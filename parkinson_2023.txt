    "abstract": "Neural biomarkers that can classify or predict disease are of broad interest to the neurological and psychiatric communities. Such biomarkers can be informative of disease state or treatment efficacy, even before there are changes in symptoms and/or behavior. This work investigates EEG-estimated functional connectivity (FC) as a Parkinson's Disease (PD) biomarker. Specifically, we investigate FC mediated via neural oscillations and consider such activity during the Simons conflict task. This task yields sensory-motor conflict, and one might expect differences in behavior between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs). In addition to considering spatially focused approaches, such as FC, as a biomarker, we also consider temporal biomarkers, which are more sensitive to ongoing changes in neural activity. We find that FC, estimated from delta (1-4Hz) and theta (4-7Hz) oscillations, yields spatial FC patterns significantly better at distinguishing PD from HC than temporal features or behavior. This study reinforces that FC in spectral bands is informative of differences in brain-wide processes and can serve as a biomarker distinguishing normal brain function from that seen in disease.",

    "abstract": "Dysarthria is a common speech disorder in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The Dysarthria Analyzer software has emerged as a viable tool for automatic speech analysis in PD and quantification of dysarthria severity. However, most studies use the Dysarthria Analyzer with recordings obtained under tightly controlled conditions and high-quality microphones, and the utility of the Dysarthria Analyzer when used with recordings acquired under non-ideal conditions, such as in busy clinical settings, remains unexplored. This study investigates the Dysarthria Analyzer's performance in a setting more akin to a clinical environment using a smartphone. We obtained data from three groups, including healthy controls (HC), PD patients with their deep brain stimulation on (ON-DBS), and PD patients with their DBS off (OFF-DBS). We found a significant decrease in pitch variability and an increase in speech rate for the OFF-DBS group compared to the HC. Furthermore, most of the estimated values for the speech markers fall within the reported values in the literature. Our findings demonstrate that the Dysarthria Analyzer effectively extracts relevant speech markers even when used with recordings obtained under non-ideal conditions, emphasizing its potential for widespread clinical adoption.Clinical Relevance- Our findings demonstrate the potential of using smartphone recordings obtained in clinical environments for automatic objective speech analysis. These findings are relevant for developing a clinical tool that can be widely accessible and easily implemented during routine clinical visits of PD to improve the assessment of dysarthria in PD.",

    "abstract": "Wearable technologies have been demonstrated to have value in the objective assessment of Parkinson's disease. However, certain symptoms such as freezing of gait are challenging to monitor using current approaches. Data augmentation, wherein synthetic or simulated data is added to real world training sets to increase their size and diversity, has emerged as an approach to bolster the accuracy of machine learning models in other healthcare domains such as medical imaging. In this paper, we evaluate the use of generative adversarial networks to create synthetic accelerometry data representing both typical and freezing gait patterns. Our preliminary results suggest that these synthetic datasets can mimic realistic movement patterns of individuals with Parkinson's disease. In the future, we will assess the impact that integrating these synthetic data into training sets has on the accuracy of freezing of gait detection algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Dysarthria is a very common motor speech symptom in Parkinson's disease impairing normal communications of patients. Detection of dysarthria could assist clinical diagnosis and intervention of Parkinson's disease, provide monitoring approach for treatment-related side effects, and lead to effective speech therapy to prevent further communication and social deficits. Applying machine learning techniques to speech analysis for patients offers more resource-efficient, accessible and objective tools for screening and assessment of dysarthria. In this study, we constructed a multi-task speech dataset recorded from 600 participants with high data diversity to facilitate the development of detection models. We established a remote data acquisition and end-to-end prediction pipeline with deep representation learning, compared the performance with different feature-based learning and classification methods, and achieved a superior accuracy of over 90%. Different affecting factors were analyzed for model performance. Our proposed framework demonstrates the potential of developing and deploying an automated self-monitoring approach of dysarthria for patients with Parkinson's disease, which could benefit a large-scale population and their disease managements.",

    "abstract": "Postural control during quiet stance is characterized by the center of pressure (CoP) time series. Recently, we showed that CoP data from healthy young (HY) and elderly (HE) individuals, and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can be well fitted by the intermittent control model with different parameter values representing the degree of intermittency in the feedback control. We performed a model-based classification (MBC) to show that the subjects could be classified into intermittent control (INT) group including all HYs, active (CONT) and passive continuous control (STIFF) groups including HE and PD. Here, we showed first that the sum of gait-posture-related UPDRS scores for the CONT and STIFF was significantly higher than that for the INT, indicating that the MBC is a good biomarker for assessing the balance impairment in PD. We then quantified CoP data from each individual using a variety of sway metrics, and explored metrics that have a classification capability equivalent to the MBC. Multiple metrics were identified as such metrics, suggesting that the MBC-based assessment can be achieved using those metrics without performing the computationally heavy model fitting.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a non-motor symptom inherent to Parkinson's disease (PD). As an early manifestation of PD, PD-related depression is hard to diagnose, thereby contributing to morbidity. Recent endeavors have employed deep learning networks to assist in the diagnosis of PD and depression, achieving commendable levels of accuracy. However, little attention has been directed toward PD-related depression, and the decision process of the network lacks transparency and explainability. What has been learned by the network and whether pathological mechanisms contribute to the classifier's result remain mysterious. In this study, we propose an explainable functional connectivity framework to recognize depression in PD. Specifically, the diagnosis feature extraction module learns high-dimensional information from functional connectivity features, followed by the diagnosis module making decisions. Furthermore, the explainable module provides interpretation and validation for the decisions on functional connectivity. Evaluation of the dataset demonstrates superb subject-wise predictive performance and provides visual evidence of the underlying pathology in EEG. The interpretation results bridge the gap between pathophysiological mechanisms and computer-aided diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Smartwatches play an increasingly vital role in health monitoring, offering practical solutions for patients to manage their conditions in daily life. This is particularly significant for Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, as tremors, a notable symptom, significantly impact their quality of life. Our research addresses unanswered questions about the optimal configurations for these devices, considering factors such as the placement of the smartwatch, the type of sensor used (accelerometer vs. gyroscope), and the sampling frequency. Employing a gradient tree-boosting approach, we analyze data from the wrist and ankle sensors of 24 PD subjects engaged in daily living activities. The findings highlight a cost-effective, practical, and resource-friendly configuration: utilizing accelerometer wrist data sampled at 32 Hz demonstrates a robust correlation between the estimations of total tremors (0.82) and rest tremors (0.84) compared to their clinical ground-truth values. This underlines the significant potential of employing smartwatches in a natural environment for clinicians to monitor their patients efficiently, minimizing the necessity for costly, inconvenient in-clinic assessments.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a portable and programmable system, the Virtual Upper Arm Rehabilitation Simulation (VUARS), to address upper limb movement difficulties in Parkinson's Disease (PD). VUARS uses a mixed reality headset (Microsoft HoloLens 2) and a haptic stylus (Geomagic Touch), building on an existing tabletop system. It offers personalized features such as customizable button design, size, and arrangement. Additionally, it provides multimodal feedback capabilities, developed through a thorough calibration process, via synchronized mixed reality button graphics and haptic feedback rendering in the Unity 3D game engine. To evaluate the developed system, a user study was conducted with 22 healthy individuals and 9 PD individuals. The efficacy of the VUARS was validated through both collected quantitative and qualitative data, such as trial and total task completion time, hand motion tracking data, and NASA TLX data. The results indicated that haptic feedback and personalized features improved task completion times and user experience, with 67% of the target demographic (PD individuals) showing statistical differences. However, further research is needed before complete adoption of VUARS in clinical settings due to a lack of statistically significant differences between traditional and VUARS systems currently.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients exhibit more impaired gait performance during motor cognitive dual-task tests. However, the effects of motor and cognitive task complexity on early PD identification have not been systematically investigated. 25 idiopathic early PD patients and 14 age-matched healthy elders were recruited and required to perform a complex motor task with/ without three different cognitive tasks. Complex task interference features were respectively calculated based on gait spatiotemporal parameters and joint kinematics. The effects of task complexity and group on CTIs were firstly investigated using a repeated measures analysis of variance. A support vector machine-based PD classifiers were built based on distinguished CTI features. The results demonstrated that the motor task complexity had a more significant effect on gait performance which contributed to significantly improved accuracy in PD classification. The best classification was achieved at turns with backward recall task (accuracy: 97.7%; precision: 98.9%; recall: 97.7%). The study proved the great potential application of a turning-based dual-task test paradigm in clinic for identifying early-stage PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is associated with the progressive death of dopaminergic neurons producing motor disorders at advanced stages. Today, there is no definitive biomarker to early detect and diagnose the disease (80% of the dopaminergic neurons are lost at first diagnosis). Recently, neuroimages have allowed to discover radiological markers associated with structural alterations from routine T1-MRI, and even measure dopamine activations in specialized SPECT sequences. Nonetheless, SPECT sequences are highly specialized, with low availability in clinical centers, and the respective analysis and quantification remain subjective and poorly explored. This work introduces a self-supervised deep representation able to capture dopaminergic levels from an MRI-to-SPECT transformation, learning an embedding representation with the capability to classify between Parkinson's and control subjects. From a retrospective study with a set of 73 Parkinson's and 73 control patients, the proposed approach achieved a notable discrimination of 79% in the precision metric.Clinical relevance- A self-supervised representation that under a translation MRI-to-SPECT task, can code dopaminergic levels to discriminate between control and Parkinson's subjects.",

A novel shared-task self-supervised learning is then employed to leverage the knowledge extracted from the signal to improve the estimation during patients' free-body movements. We utilize 24 PD subjects' data performing daily activities. The estimated UPDRS-III showed an improved correlation with the clinical examinations from 0.67 to 0.81, reducing the mean absolute error from 7.75 to 6.96. Our investigation demonstrates the potential of our approach in providing a reliable estimation of PD severity scores during subjects' daily routines.

Thirty PD patients collected data through mobile-based questionnaires and activity tasks aimed at measuring motor and non-motor symptoms for a duration of two months. We report the results about usability conducted within this study. A combination of methods consisting of the uMARS questionnaire and interviews with PD patients inform the usability aspects of the mobile application. Results indicate that the app is overall received well and is usable (median uMARS score=4). Interviews reveal usability issues related to the size of textual instructions and buttons, and to the context of use of the app, particularly when the phone is used as a sensor. These findings highlight the need of co-design and preliminary testing when developing apps for PD.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning in Parkinson's disease assessment uses data from clinically-coded movements, such as finger tapping, to objectively measure motor impairment. Video-based models showed promise in several experiments, but the lack of a unified test benchmark hinders proving generalizability. Additionally, new telemedicine systems may easily collect large amounts of unsupervised data, while obtaining ground truth labels for supervised learning remains time-consuming and requires specialized clinicians. This study explores semi-supervised learning to enhance the generalizability of a Light Gradient Boosting model for video-based finger tapping staging, while reducing its need for supervised data labelling. Specifically, this work employs the Self-training schema in two trials using openly-available finger tapping datasets from three independent experiments. This method significantly improves model performance across various metrics, achieving notable accuracy gains (e.g., from 87.62% to 92.05%) when tested on unseen data from a different experiment. Semi-supervision proves valuable when limited labelled data (less than 10%) from the test distribution are available during training.",

    "abstract": "Several commercially available instrumented insole systems have been examined for validity and repeatability, but very few studies have focused on validation of the Moticon OpenGo sensor insoles in measuring gait and balance parameters in a clinical population. Given the paucity of studies examining the validity of these novel technologies in PD, there were two main goals of this research: (1) assess the concurrent validity of the Moticon OpenGo sensor insoles for gait and balance assessment in people with PD using a pressure-sensitive electronic walkway (Protokinetics Zeno\u2122 walkway) as a reference system and (2) compare the gait metrics derived from the insole and walkway systems during a walking and turning task in order to assess the output of the systems under more real-world conditions. Twelve participants (5F/7M; mean age 71.3 \u00b1 6.8 years) with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and a score of 2.5 or 3 on the Modified Hoehn & Yahr score performing straight-line walking, walking with turning, and balance tasks were included in this analysis. Differences in the estimated gait metrics from each system were evaluated through Bland-Altman analysis and calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Results showed strong agreement between the insoles and the reference walkway system during both self-selected pace and hurried pace walking tasks. Although agreement is not as strong when estimating spatial metrics, the limits of agreement (LOA) still indicate that clinically important differences can be seen. Additional investigation into the insole derived center of pressure metrics from the insole sensor systems may be necessary as well as investigation into improved algorithms for capturing gait metrics during more real-world conditions in both types of systems.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by decreased dopamine in the basal ganglia, which causes excessive tonic inhibition of the thalamus. This excessive inhibition seems to explain decreased motor vigor in Parkinson's disease, but whether it causes tremor remains unclear. This paper explores how inhibition may change closed-loop characteristics to determine how this established pathophysiology could produce tremor. First, single-neuron simulations establish the rate and time characteristics of increased tonic inhibition by adjusting the membrane time constant. These characteristics point towards two possible mechanisms for unstable feedback: information delay and decreased signal. Both cases create a mismatch between the closed-loop dynamics and the forward model that overcomes proprioceptive feedback delays. Overall, unstable feedback stemming from excessive tonic inhibition represents a unifying pathophysiology for the movement inhibiting and excitatory motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",

This game serves as a more engaging way to encourage individuals with PD to perform hand motor tasks such as dropping, pulling up, and moving left or right. The device provided resisting force during the tasks, and a VR headset enhanced the game experience, making it more engaging and immersive. We examined the usability and efficacy of the VR game system with haptic feedback for upper-limb rehabilitation by collecting data from healthy and PD participants. Participants were asked to complete predefined task sessions and provide workload ratings using a NASA Task Load Index. Participants' skills and efficacy were also quantitatively assessed using task specific data. Haptic feedback, which controlled resistance, influenced user performance in movement trajectory, completion time, and task score significantly. These results are helpful in the development of personalized rehabilitation in this population.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a technique known as \"channel stacking,\" aimed at comprehensively representing electroencephalogram signals to identify Parkinson's disease accurately. This method combines information from multiple channels to prepare input signals for the model, enabling the deep learning architecture to capture information across all channels efficiently. For classification, a ResNet18 network is employed. Notably, the model achieves an accuracy of 96.43% with just 90 seconds of data per subject. This performance is validated through Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation, effectively simulating real-world scenarios. The experimental results highlight the robust detection performance of the proposed method on clinical datasets.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of Gait (FOG) significantly impacts daily activities of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Despite the potential of wearable sensors in predicting FOG, challenges persist, including the brief prediction interval before FOG onset, limited generalization across patients, and the inconvenience of multiple sensors. Addressing one issue often aggravates others, making it difficult to achieve suitable concurrent solutions to all these challenges.\nWe introduce the PhysioGait Predictive Network (PhysioGPN), a deep learning framework designed to predict FOG events in PD patients at least 2 seconds prior to onset. The model architecture incorporates four key strategies: (1) Detection of progressive motion changes using large convolutional kernels; (2) Unraveling the complexity of motion coordination and gait dynamics using multi-dimensional and multi-scale convolution; (3) Capture gait self-similarity and asymmetry with twin-tower structure; (4) Promoting cross-domain information exchange with multi-domain attention. Furthermore, we propose a framework based on knowledge distillation (KD), reducing the model's dependence on multiple sensors while maintaining prediction accuracy.\nThe model achieves an 85.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC) in FOG prediction. When reducing the number of sensors, KD mitigates the decline in performance and increases the AUC by 5.1%, compared to scenarios without KD.\nOur research proposes a practical solution to the challenges of FOG prediction, demonstrating the effectiveness of the KD approach for lightweight wearable sensors in rehabilitation engineering.\nOur findings offer valuable insights for addressing multiple challenges in the practical application of wearable devices.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptomatology in Parkinson's disease (PD) is related to patients' quality of life (QoL). The Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NNMS) assesses QoL by investigating numerous domains including nutritional status, which is represented by domain 6. Patients with PD commonly suffer from dysphagia, and consequently malnutrition, leading to sarcopenia and increasing motor deficits in relation to loss of muscle mass and energy deficit. The impact of dysphagia on PD patients' health status, makes it necessary to study the effectiveness of specific nutritional programs in addressing feeding needs, with the goal to improve clinical outcomes and the patient's perception of their QoL. The 'Weancare' Program was trialed on an 84-year-old PD patient suffering from dysphagia and the Tower of Pisa Syndrome. The first assessment of the patient showed an early overall deteriorating condition, particularly under a nutritional point of view. The patient was assessed before and after the intervention considering serological tests, and the QoL through the New Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NNMS). We found a beneficial impact of the 'Weancare' program on the patient significantly improving the non-motor symptomatology and QoL and the investigated outcomes, enhancing a better subjective experience of mealtime lived by the patient.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, resulting in motor symptoms. Ongoing research shows promise for long-term solutions.\nStudies highlight the dysregulation of Syt11 and \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in PD. Disrupted \u03b1-syn homeostasis due to palmitoylation of Syt11 contributes to its aggregation, potentially playing a role in PD pathology. \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in stool samples show promise as an early diagnostic biomarker. Vocal impairments in PD may be linked to \u03b1-syn-induced neuropathology. Irisin, produced after exercise, promotes the degradation of pathologic \u03b1-syn. Progress has been made in identifying PD biomarkers. Retinal thinning and abnormal protein aggregates in skin biopsies provide noninvasive diagnostic indicators. Blood-based biomarkers like \u03b1-syn, DJ-1, and LRRK2 hold promise but face limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) models enhance mitophagy, detect PD through sleep-breathing signals, and improve survival. AI analysis aids noninvasive assessment and risk prediction. Further understanding of PD involves studying pathological seeds and genetic mutations. Adenosine receptor regulation relates to early-onset PD, and specific gene mutations impact patient survival. Differentiated-induced pluripotent stem cells offer the potential for cell replacement therapy. Autoimmune features and T-cell involvement suggest intervention targets. Stem cell-based therapies and neurostimulation strategies show promise for improving motor function. Imaging reveals increased central inflammation in PD, suggesting an inflammatory role. Machine learning algorithms and home gait speed monitoring aid in diagnosis and disease progression tracking. Abnormal putamen gradients reflect dopaminergic loss and motor dysfunction. Antiepileptic drug prescriptions are associated with an increased PD risk. Personalized medicine, gut-brain axis involvement, and vestibular stimulation therapy offer potential PD treatment avenues. Genetic engineering techniques and deep brain stimulation show promise for alleviating PD symptoms.\nOngoing research and technological advancements promise to improve PD screening, diagnosis, and treatment, bringing hope to affected individuals.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the role of pesticide exposure on PD risk.\nParkinson's disease is the fastest-growing neurological disorder in the world. Since the discovery of the nigral toxin, MPTP, many studies have investigated the role of environmental contaminants, notably pesticides, on PD risk but mostly in epidemiologic studies with limited geographic coverage.\nIn the Multiple Air Pollutants in PD (MAP-PD) study, we conducted a nationwide, population-based, geographical study of 21,549,400 Medicare beneficiaries (aged 67+ in 2009) and 465 pesticides obtained from the United States Geological Survey. Our outcome variable was county-level standardized relative risk derived from Bayesian modeling and our independent variables were estimates of average annual pesticide application from 1992-2008. We mapped the nationwide association for 65 pesticides (those with sufficient data) using Multiscale Geographic Weighted Regression (MGWR), and classified pesticides according to the strength and ratio of positive to negative regression coefficients. We used linear regression to quantify the nationwide relationships between PD risk and pesticides. We explored county-level air pollution, rural/urban residence, and median income as potential confounding factors.\nWe identified 14 pesticides strongly associated with PD in the Rocky Mountain and Great Plains region. Of these, simazine, lindane, and atrazine had the strongest relationship with PD. Counties with the highest decile of simazine application had a 36% (95% CI 32%-41%) greater relative risk of PD compared to counties with the lowest decile of exposure. For atrazine and lindane, relative risks were 31% (95% CI 26%-35%) and 25% (95% CI 21%-29%) greater for counties in the top decile of application compared to the lowest decile, respectively. Moreover, there was a modest dose-response relationship between PD risk and all three pesticides.\nIn the Rocky Mountains/Great Plains region, application of lindane, simazine, and atrazine are associated with PD.

    "abstract": "To determine the feasibility and reliability of using precision-mapping techniques for people with Parkinson disease.\nStandard resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) approaches collect small amounts of data, typically \u2264 10 min, and rely on group-average network definitions. An innovative new approach applies precision-mapping techniques, with > 40min of data, to identify individual-level RSFC network maps. Precision-mapping RSFC reveals individual differences in network size, strength, and location.\nWe tested the feasibility and reliability of precision-mapping RSFC for people with Parkinson disease. Participants completed multiple fMRI sessions (3-5) up to seven months apart. Using stringent motion censoring, we determined the amount of low-motion, high quality fMRI data per person to establish feasibility. We compared the similarity of RSFC maps across sessions to examine stability and applied split-half analyses to measure the reliability of RSFC maps based on amount fMRI data.\nPreliminary analyses reveal the high feasibility and strong reliability of precision-mapping RSFC for people with Parkinson disease. All participants completed multiple fMRI sessions with large amounts of low motion data for each person (>40 min per person, frame retention average = 75%). Individual participant RSFC maps were stable across sessions (r > 0.7) and highly reliable with >40min of data (split-half reliability, r > 0.8).\nThese results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of using the precision-mapping technique for identifying individual-level RSFC networks in Parkinson disease. With this approach, it will now be possible to examine how individual-level variability of RSFC networks relates to variability in clinical manifestations and predicts progression of Parkinson disease.

    "abstract": "While significant progress has been made in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have consistently failed. To address the underlying molecular mechanisms of PD, two biology-based criteria have been proposed: the \"Synucleinopathy-Neurodegeneration-Genetics\" (SynNeurGe) and \"neuronal \u03b1-synuclein disease\" (NSD) frameworks. Both frameworks emphasize the importance of biological markers over clinical symptoms. They recognize \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and genetic mutations (such as SNCA) as key diagnostic elements, with \u03b1-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) used to detect early disease stages. Dopaminergic neurodegeneration, measured by DAT imaging, is also central to both frameworks. These shared features aim to improve early diagnosis and precision medicine for PD. However, SynNeurGe provides a broader, more flexible framework that integrates \u03b1-synuclein pathology (S), neurodegeneration (N), and genetics (G), linked to clinical features (C). It aims to accommodate the complexity of PD and related Lewy body diseases, facilitating research on targeted DMTs. In contrast, NSD focuses specifically on PD and Lewy body dementia, introducing a staging system (NSD-ISS) based on biological markers and clinical impairment, helping track disease progression from preclinical to symptomatic stages. Despite their differences, both approaches highlight the need for more specific biomarkers and prospective studies to improve early intervention and personalized treatment. Harmonizing SynNeurGe and NSD concepts will be key in creating a universally accepted framework for precise PD diagnosis and therapy development.\nIn recent years, significant progress has been made in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms, but therapies to slow or stop disease progression have failed. Symptomatic treatments focus on neurotransmitter replacement, while disease-modifying therapies target the molecular and cellular causes of PD. Two research criteria aim to redefine PD biologically, not just by clinical symptoms. The SynNeurGe and NSD concepts both focus on the role of \u03b1-synuclein, a protein linked to PD, but differ slightly in approach.SynNeurGeThis framework highlights three key elements\u2014pathological \u03b1-synuclein in bodily fluids, evidence of neurodegeneration, and specific gene mutations. These are linked to clinical features, aiming to support targeted research for precision medicine.NSD (Neuronal \u03b1-synuclein disease)This approach identifies PD and related diseases by detecting \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid and dopaminergic neurodegeneration using dopamine transporter imaging. It also introduces a staging system, from pre-symptomatic to more advanced stages, based on biological markers and clinical symptoms. Both models share common ground in using \u03b1-synuclein detection, demonstration of neurodegeneration, and genetic mutations to define PD biologically. NSD proposes a more restricted concept, which fits within the broader SynNeurGe framework. Further research is needed to track how these biological markers evolve over time, with a focus on finding more precise biomarkers and affordable diagnostic tools. Harmonizing these two concepts could lead to earlier diagnoses, more accurate staging, and personalized treatment plans for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with heterogenous symptoms and progression rates. Some studies have classifying PD into tremor-dominant and non-tremor-dominant PD (TD-PD and Non-TD-PD), finding that TD-PD tend to have a better prognosis, slower disease progression, and lower pathological burden compared to Non-TD-PD. However, this classification does not consider the specific types of tremors, even though recent studies have shown that different types of tremors in PD might have distinct underlying mechanism.\nData from 517 de novo drug-na\u00efve PD patients was analyzed.\nSurvival analysis was carried out including motor subtypes, rest tremor presence, kinetic tremor presence, postural tremor presence, as well as the instability of tremor presence or motor subtypes as predictors. Occurrence of 6 outcomes, including motor and non-motor milestones at follow-up, were used as the time-to-event.\nBoth TD-PD subtype and rest tremor presence was associated with slower PD progression, while kinetic tremor presence and postural tremor presence, especially kinetic tremor presence, was associated with a faster one.\nOur study suggests different types of tremors are associated with distinct PD prognoses, indicating potential differences in underlying mechanisms. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying different types of tremors in PD and to explain their relationship to disease prognosis.\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogenous disease with diverse symptoms and rates of progression. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of motor subtype, different types of tremors, and their consistency on the progression of PD. We analyzed data from 537 newly diagnosed, untreated PD patients and monitored them for several important progression milestones. We found that patients with tremor-dominant PD and those experiencing resting tremors tended to have slower disease progression. Conversely, the presence of kinetic tremors and postural tremor, especially kinetic tremor, was associated with a faster progression of PD. These findings suggest that the specific types of tremors in PD may have potentially different mechanisms. Understanding these differences could help in developing targeted treatments that address specific tremor types, potentially improving outcomes for patients. Further research is necessary to explore the underlying mechanisms behind these tremor types and their relationship to PD prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FoG) is among the most disabling gait disorders of Parkinson's disease. The full understanding of its mechanisms requires a network study approach. So far, FoG was mainly studied using magnetic resonance imaging, and especially using the resting state functional sequence, which does not completely reflect the brain actual modifications.\nThis study aims to investigate metabolic networks using position emission tomography (PET) imaging. Exploration after a rest or gait session combined with a delayed tracer's uptake are assumed to reflect the actual metabolism modifications.\nTwenty-six patients in the off-drug state underwent two PET imaging sessions using [\nIn the rest condition, the freezing group showed globally reduced metabolic connectivity between brain regions compared to the non-freezing group. During gait, enhanced connectivity was observed in the cerebellum, cerebello-cortical loops and parieto-frontal regions, with high recruitment of the visual cortex in the freezing group. However, connectivity inside cerebellar networks remained lower in the freezing group than in the non-freezing group, while occipito-frontal connectivity was higher in the freezing group.\nStudying real freezing of gait in a vertical position emphasized the role of the visual cortex and cerebellum in gait problems.\nFreezing of gait is among the most disabling gait disorders associated with Parkinson's disease. It is characterized by a sudden episodic inability to produce effective stepping despite the intention to walk. Brain imaging, primarily using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been widely utilized to study its mechanisms. However, this imaging modality does not allow for the exploration of actual gait aspects, as images are acquired while the patient is in a supine position within the machine. In this study, we propose using nuclear medicine imaging, which allows for the assessment of metabolism over the 20\u201330 min following the injection of a radiotracer. Thus, even though the acquisition is also performed in a supine position, this delay is expected to reflect the actual mechanisms. Twenty-six patients were examined twice using nuclear medicine imaging: in a resting condition and after a gait session. Among the patients, twelve exhibited freezing. Images were analyzed to measure the connectivity between cerebral regions. The results showed that patients with freezing had lower connectivity between brain regions. After the gait session, some connections were re-established, but overall, the connectivity remained lower than in patients without freezing. The affected connections mainly involved the cerebellum, cerebello-cortical loops, and parieto-frontal regions, with implications for the visual cortex. Thanks to the study conducted in a vertical position, this research highlighted the roles of the visual cortex and cerebellum in gait problems.",

    "abstract": "Directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides more precise control of current spread than conventional ring-shaped electrodes. Whether this enhanced flexibility improves motor function is unclear.\nHere we examine whether directional and circular stimulation differentially impact motor performance in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nMotor behaviors were assessed in 31 patients who underwent unilateral subthalamic nucleus brain stimulation surgery (SUNDIAL, NCT03353688). Eight configurations, including 6 directional contacts and their corresponding rings), were evaluated during device activation. Objective measures of motor performance related to limb dexterity, gait, and overall mobility were evaluated in a double-blind fashion in the \"off\" medication state versus preoperative baseline, with stimulus amplitude at the center of the therapeutic window.\nSignificant changes in performance were observed across each of five motor tasks between the best and worst directional contacts on a given DBS row (p\u2009<\u20090.001 each task). Certain stimulation directions led to functional declines versus baseline, whereas the best direction yields greater improvement than ring stimulation (p\u2009=\u20090.005, p\u2009=\u20090.001, p\u2009=\u20090.007, p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively, across tasks). Directional DBS improves therapeutic window and side effect thresholds versus ring stimulation (0.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.94 and 0.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.51\u2005mA, p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively), but these variables correlated only modestly with motor performance at a given stimulation site.\nOptimized directional subthalamic nucleus DBS yields better group-level motor performance than ring stimulation, in addition to its known advantages related to tolerability. Prospective studies should evaluate whether these improvements persist over longer time intervals.",

In EMBARK, LSM (SE) changes from baseline in MDS-UPDRS Part III were nonsignificant (-1.6 [1.7]) and significant (8.3 [3.9]) for dopaminergic-treated and treatment-na\u00efve patients, respectively, the latter indicating disease worsening. Adverse events possibly related to deferiprone were reported in 35.7%-88.9% across all deferiprone groups vs. 42.9% for placebo.\nSKY and EMBARK studies indicate that deferiprone combined with L-dopa does not provide significant motor function benefit, while the absence of L-dopa treatment worsens symptoms.\nParkinson's disease is an age-related brain condition that can lead to problems with movement, muscle cramps, mental health, and pain. People with Parkinson's disease also struggle with activities of daily living that can reduce their well-being. Researchers have found that some people with Parkinson's disease have high levels of iron in their brain. Currently, we do not know if removing iron from the brain can help people with Parkinson's disease. In this study, we examined if a medicine that removes iron from the brain could improve symptoms of Parkinson's disease. This medicine is called deferiprone. Our study included 176 people with Parkinson's disease. People were then divided into 2 groups. In the first group, people were already being treated for Parkinson's disease and then were given deferiprone for 9 months. We found that a low or high dose of deferiprone did not improve disease symptoms. In the second group, people taking no other medication for their Parkinson's disease were given deferiprone for 9 months. In this group, deferiprone worsened Parkinson's symptoms. There are currently no arguments in favor of using deferiprone in Parkinson's disease. Deferiprone without L-dopa worsens symptoms. Research could potentially evaluate low doses of iron chelator in combination with L-dopa over the long term and in large numbers of people.",

    "abstract": "Proteins of the TRIM family are involved in both innate immunity and the nervous system processes and may play an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we analyzed the expression of 35 genes of the TRIM family in neural progenitors (NPs), terminally differentiated neurons (TDNs) and glial derivatives (NGs) obtained from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of healthy donors (HD) and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), in the absence of inflammatory stimuli and upon the induction of a nonspecific inflammatory response under the influence of TNF\u03b1. In NPs and TDNs of PD patients, compared with HD cells, differences in expression were observed for only a small number of TRIM genes. Under the influence of TNF\u03b1 in TDNs, the expression of individual TRIM genes was activated, which was more significant in the cells of patients with PD compared to cells of HDs. In NGs of PD patients, the expression of many TRIM genes was initially reduced compared to HD cells and remained low or further decreased after exposure to TNF\u03b1. The data obtained demonstrate differences in the network of the TRIM family members in PD neurons and glia compared to control, and also show the multidirectional influence of the inflammatory stimulus on the expression of a number of TRIM genes in these types of cells. Considering the important role of many TRIM genes in the functioning of the innate immune system, it can be assumed that, in PD, more significant disturbances in the functioning of genes of this family occur in glia compared to neurons.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to create a robust and interpretable method for predicting dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in resource-limited settings. The model aims to be accurate even with small datasets and missing values, ultimately promoting its use in clinical practice to benefit patients and medical professionals.\nOur study introduces LightGBM-TabPFN, a novel hybrid model for predicting dementia conversion in PD. Combining LightGBM's strength in handling missing values with TabPFN's ability to exploit small datasets, LightGBM-TabPFN outperforms seven existing methods, achieving outstanding accuracy and interpretability thanks to SHAP analysis. This analysis leverages data from 242 PD patients across 17 variables.\nOur LightGBM-TabPFN model significantly outperformed seven existing methods. Achieving an accuracy of 0.9592 and an area under the ROC curve of 0.9737.\nThe interpretable LightGBM-TabPFN with SHAP signifies a significant advancement in predictive modeling for neurodegenerative diseases. This study not only improves dementia prediction in PD but also provides clinical professionals with insights into model predictions, offering opportunities for application in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have reported a potential association between trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to examine the potential relationship between the levels of circulating TMAO and its precursors and the risk of PD using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.\nWe aggregated data from three genome-wide association studies (International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium, Parkinson's Research: The Organized Genetics Initiative and GenePD, and FinnGen) to extract single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with circulating concentrations of TMAO, choline, carnitine, and betaine. These SNPs were employed as instrumental variables in a random-effects model to evaluate the causal relationship between circulating concentrations of TMAO and its precursors and the risk of Parkinson's disease, by estimating odds ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. The primary analysis employed the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method, which was complemented with MR-Egger regression analysis.\nThe analysis using the IVW method, which aggregated data from the three databases, did not show any causal relationship between circulating concentrations of TMAO and its precursors, and the risk of PD (\nThis study did not identify any conclusive evidence of a causal association between the circulating concentrations of TMAO or its precursors and the risk of PD. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether such an association indeed exists.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FoG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) with limited response to dopaminergic medication and subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). Substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) stimulation could improve FoG.\nTo analyze the effect of combined STN-SNr stimulation at different frequencies on FoG.\nWe performed a double-blind, cross-over, randomized pilot trial involving STN-DBS treated PD patients with FoG. Participants received: high-frequency (HF) STN-DBS (S), combined HF-STN and SNr stimulation (C1), and combined HF-STN and low-frequency (LF) SNr stimulation (C2), for one month each. The primary endpoint was the score change in the New-Freezing-of-Gait-Questionnaire (NFOG-Q). Secondary analyses were performed on motor complications, axial symptoms, daily living activities, psychiatric symptoms, sleep, and patient preference.\nFifteen patients received at least one combined stimulation. No significant difference in NFOG-Q scores was found between S, C1, and C2; one-third of patients showed a clinically significant improvement (\u22658 points) with combined stimulations. Motor complications improved significantly with C1 and C2 (C1-S: 3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8 vs. 4.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8, p\u2009=\u20090.046; C2-S: 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1 vs. 4.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8, p\u2009=\u20090.005). 80% of patients preferred the combined STN-SNr stimulation while blinded. All adverse events were manageable.\nOur study did not prove a statistically significant improvement in NFOG-Q with STN-SNr stimulation; however, one-third of patients experienced a clinically meaningful FoG improvement, and the majority preferred to maintain STN-SNr stimulation. STN-SNr stimulation was both safe and effective in addressing motor complications and improving sleep quality, highlighting the importance of further exploration into the effects of combined STN-SNr stimulation.\nWe aimed to identify novel therapeutic approaches for freezing of gait (FoG), a disabling symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with risk of falls and poor life quality. FoG affects 31 up to 87% of PD patients and can be difficult to manage with standard PD medications. FoG may remain unchanged or even worsen in patients treated with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). We focused on DBS-treated PD patients and stimulated simultaneously two areas of the brain: the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the typical target for treating PD motor symptoms, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). 15 PD patients with FoG received different types of brain stimulation for one month each: STN stimulation alone and combined STN\u2009+\u2009SNr stimulation at two different stimulation frequencies. We measured improvement of FoG (using a validated questionnaire) and other PD symptoms (including motor fluctuations, anxiety and depression, and sleep quality), as well as safety and tolerability of the combined STN\u2009+\u2009SNr stimulation. Finally, we observed the patient preference for the type of stimulation provided. We found no statistically significant change of FoG scores with STN\u2009+\u2009SNr stimulation, but one-third of patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in FoG. STN\u2009+\u2009SNr stimulations helped improve motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. Moreover, 80% of the patients preferred the combined stimulation over the standard STN stimulation. We believe this data suggest that combined STN\u2009+\u2009SNr stimulation could be a valuable area for further research aiming to improve FoG and can be safely attempted in clinical practice in DBS-treated patients with disabling FoG.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective in managing motor symptoms in select cases of Parkinson's disease (PD). Nonetheless, the ideal timing for surgery and the comparative outcomes of unilateral versus bilateral DBS procedures remain under-researched areas.\nWe aimed to compare the impact of unilateral and bilateral DBS on the motor manifestations of PD using standardized Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part-III (UPDRS-III).\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of PD patients who underwent multidisciplinary DBS screening which made a formal recommendation for surgical approach. We compared unilateral, bilateral \"rapid\" (less than 2 months apart), and bilateral \"staged\" (5-11 months apart) implantation approaches. The study included 90 patients, 48 patients, and 42 patients from the 3 groups, respectively. The primary outcome was the percentage improvement in baseline off UPDRS-III scores compared to medication-off/DBS-on conditions at 3-6 months and 10-14 months post-surgery. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare scores within groups and across follow-up periods. The Kruskal-Wallis test assessed differences among groups. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses were performed to adjust for confounding variables.\nUPDRS-III scores improved significantly from baseline at both follow-up intervals regardless of the type of DBS staging approach. The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed no significant differences in UPDRS-III percentage improvement among groups at 3-6 months (p\u2009=\u20090.125) and 10-14 months (p\u2009=\u20090.298) post-DBS.\nOur study revealed that in a single experienced DBS center which employed multidisciplinary screening, assignment to unilateral and bilateral DBS, both rapid and staged, targeting the STN or GPi, effectively improved motor symptoms for up to 14 months.\nDeep brain stimulation is a surgical treatment that helps manage motor symptoms in select people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the best timing for surgery and whether it's better to have DBS implanted on one side of the brain (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral) from the beginning are still unclear. This study compared the effects of unilateral and bilateral DBS on movement problems in 180 PD patients. The patients were divided into three groups: 90 had DBS on one side, and 90 had DBS on both sides implanted in a staged manner, either quickly (named bilateral rapid, with surgeries done less than 2 months apart) or more slowly (named bilateral staged, with surgeries done 5\u201311 months apart). We measured their movement problems using a standard motor assessment after surgery at two different times: 3\u20136 months and 10\u201314 months; and we compared that to their baseline scores. We found that all groups showed significant improvement in their movement problems after DBS. There were no major differences in improvement between those who had one side done and those who had both sides done, whether quickly or slowly, up to 14 months after surgery. In conclusion, DBS, whether done on one side or both sides of the brain and regardless of the timing of staging between surgeries, significantly improved movement problems in PD patients for up to 14 months after surgery.",

    "abstract": "In 2023, a workshop was organized by the UK charity Cure Parkinson's with The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research and Parkinson's UK to review the field of growth factors (GFs) for Parkinson's disease (PD). This was a follow up to a previous meeting held in 2019.\nFor many years, scientists have explored the idea of administering growth factors to the brain, thereby repairing the damage associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD). Growth factors like glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) have shown promise in animal models of PD, and initial clinical trials suggested that this approach may be beneficial for patients. However, there has been some uncertainty in the field after a number of clinical trials did not reach their primary endpoints. Nevertheless, the development of growth factor therapies for PD has continued, with new trials underway. Recent developments in this scientific area were discussed at a workshop organized by a number of PD charities in 2023. The discussion and conclusions from that workshop are presented in this new paper.",

    "abstract": "Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) is acknowledged for its therapeutic benefits in Parkinson's disease (PD), yet long-term adherence remains a challenge.\nThe primary aim of this study was to assess the preliminary effects of EMST coupled with a mobile health app (SpiroGym) on self-efficacy and exercise adherence in PD patients. The secondary aim was to assess the usability of the SpiroGym app.\nThis single-group, multicenter, multinational proof-of-concept study involved 63 PD patients across four tertiary PD centers. Participants were enrolled in either a 1-week (n\u2009=\u200935) or 24-week (n\u2009=\u200928) EMST program coupled with SpiroGym app. Self-efficacy was assessed using the Self-Efficacy for Home Exercise Program scale (SEHEPS) and exercise adherence was monitored by SpiroGym app. Usability was evaluated using the System Usability Scale.\nPost-intervention, significant improvements in SEHEPS were observed in 1-week group (d\u2009=\u20090.48; p\u2009=\u20090.02) and 24-week group (d\u2009=\u20090.57; p\u2009=\u20090.002). Adherence rates in the 24-week PD patient group were high throughout the course of the study. Post-training SEHEPS was found to correlate (rho\u2009=\u20090.55; adjusted p\u2009=\u20090.016) with adherence to EMST during the non-supervised maintenance phase. The SpiroGym app exhibited high usability (>85th percentile score), with no significant differences noted between short-term and long-term use, indicating sustained user satisfaction.\nThe results of our study suggest a promising role for SpiroGym app in supporting adherence to home-based EMST in PD patients. Nevertheless, future comparative studies are required to confirm SpiroGym's effectiveness.\nPeople with Parkinson's disease (PD) can have trouble sticking with long-term exercise programs. This study looked at using a smartphone app called SpiroGym to see if it could help people with PD with their home breathing exercises. We included 63 patients with PD from four different treatment centers. Patients were divided into two groups: one used the SpiroGym app for 1 week, and the other for 24 weeks. We wanted to see if the app helped patients feel more confident about exercising at home and if breathing exercises were performed regularly. We also checked how easy the app was to use. After using the app, both groups reported feeling more confident about doing their home breathing exercises. The group that used the app for 24 weeks regularly did their exercises throughout the study. Participants rated the app highly for ease of use, regardless of how long they used it. In conclusion, the SpiroGym app might be a potentially helpful tool for people with PD to maintain their breathing exercises at home. However, future studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Best practice guidelines in Parkinson's disease (PD) calls for the immediate initiation of rehabilitation therapies (inclusive of physical (PT) and occupational therapy (OT)) to prevent or ameliorate the loss of function and quality of life associated with disease progression.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the utilization of PT and OT services within the first 2 years following PD diagnosis and to observe longitudinal trends in PT and OT utilization early following PD diagnosis.\nThis retrospective cohort study accessed 12 years (2011 to 2023) of data from electronic health records at a midwestern US healthy system. Patients with new PD diagnoses and two-years of visit history were included. The primary outcome was utilization of PT or OT services within two-years of PD diagnosis. Data extracted included demographics and PD therapies. Records of 9720 patients were included in the analyses.\nOverall, 36.9% of the cohort (\nThis study shows a promising increase in utilization of PT and OT services over previous reports and longitudinally, however it continues to convey how far clinical practice continues to lag behind best practice and scientific recommendation.\nThis study looked at how often people with Parkinson's disease (PD) use physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) in the first two years after being diagnosed. These therapies are important because they can help maintain a person's ability to function and improve their quality of life as the disease progresses. The researchers analyzed data from 9720 patients diagnosed with PD between 2011 and 2023. They wanted to see how many of these patients received PT or OT within two years of their diagnosis and to track how the use of these therapies changed over time. The study found that only about 37% of patients received PT or OT within the first two years of their PD diagnosis. Certain groups of people were more likely to use these therapies, including older adults, women, African Americans, those with other health conditions, and those taking medication to manage PD symptoms. Over time, the use of PT and OT increased slightly each year by about 1.4% between 2013 and 2021. The findings suggest that while more people are using PT and OT after a PD diagnosis than in the past, many still aren\u2019t receiving these important therapies as recommended. This highlights a gap between what is considered best practice and what is actually happening in clinical care. More efforts may be needed to ensure that all people with PD have access to the therapies that can help them live better with the disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and vascular parkinsonism (VP) are characterized by similar neurological syndromes but differ in pathogenesis, morphology, and therapeutic approaches. The molecular genetic mechanisms of these pathologies are multifactorial and involve multiple biological processes. To comprehensively analyze the pathophysiology of PD and VP, the methods of systems biology and gene network reconstruction are essential. In the current study, we performed metabolomic screening of amino acids and acylcarnitines in blood plasma of three groups of subjects: PD patients, VP patients and the control group. Comparative statistical analysis of the metabolic profiles identified significantly altered metabolites in the PD and the VP group. To identify potential mechanisms of amino acid and acylcarnitine metabolism disorders in PD and VP, regulatory gene networks were reconstructed using ANDSystem, a cognitive system. Regulatory pathways to the enzymes converting significant metabolites were found from PD-specific genetic markers, VP-specific genetic markers, and the group of genetic markers common to the two diseases. Comparative analysis of molecular genetic pathways in gene networks allowed us to identify both specific and non-specific molecular mechanisms associated with changes in the metabolomic profile in PD and VP. Regulatory pathways with potentially impaired function in these pathologies were discovered. The regulatory pathways to the enzymes ALDH2, BCAT1, AL1B1, and UD11 were found to be specific for PD, while the pathways regulating OCTC, FURIN, and S22A6 were specific for VP. The pathways regulating BCAT2, ODPB and P4HA1 were associated with genetic markers common to both diseases. The results obtained deepen the understanding of pathological processes in PD and VP and can be used for application of diagnostic systems based on the evaluation of the amino acids and acylcarnitines profile in blood plasma of patients with PD and VP.\n\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f) \u0438

    "abstract": "Tremor is a common symptom in movement disorders and is evident at rest in Parkinson's Disease (PD). In PD, tremor may be responsive to brain stimulation, ranging from Deep Brain Stimulation to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Transcranial Pulse Stimulation (TPS) is a novel/painless/non-invasive technique which appears to induce biomolecular changes through shock waves. Here, as one of the first studies in the field of PD, we exploratively investigate the possibility to observe changes in tremor, induced by single-session TPS delivered on the motor cortex of PD patients.\nTPS was delivered in 16 patients. Of these, 9 were admitted to sham (placebo). Resting tremor was measured at baseline (T0), after TPS (T1), and after 24\u00a0\u200bh from intervention (T2).\nAt baseline, tremor was always present. After TPS, tremor reduction was noted at T1 and T2 (compared to T0 and placebo). We noted a decrease in the amplitude of resting tremor (not its frequency).\nTPS is a non-invasive technique that may be a novel solution for reducing tremor in PD, lasting at least 24\u00a0\u200bh after single-sessions. No side effects were reported. We discuss evidence suggesting potential physiological changes in mechanisms of neural circuits that are affected in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurological disorder, characterized by motor symptoms such as tremor and rigidity due to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This study investigates the formulation of quercetin, a natural bioflavonoid with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as niosomes for intranasal delivery to enhance its bioavailability and therapeutic potential for PD.\nThe niosomal formulation was optimized for critical parameters including particle size, entrapment efficiency, and zeta potential. Male Wistar rats were utilized to assess the effects of quercetin-loaded niosomes on motor function, dopaminergic neuron protection, and oxidative stress alleviation.\nThe optimized niosomal formulation exhibited a particle size of 195\u00a0nm, a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.29, a zeta potential (ZP) of -30.63\u00a0mV, and an entrapment efficiency (EE) of 82.77%. \nThe findings suggest that the quercetin-loaded niosomal formulation offers improved drug delivery and efficacy, indicating its potential as a superior treatment option for PD compared to conventional dosage forms. This approach may pave the way for enhanced therapeutic strategies targeting the neurodegenerative processes underlying Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing correlation between periodontal disease, a common inflammatory disorder that affects the tissues supporting the teeth, and several systemic diseases.\nTwo hundred patients from a tertiary care hospital, ages 50-75, participated in this cross-sectional research. The subjects were split up into four groups: 50 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, 50 with Alzheimer's disease, 50 with Parkinson's disease, and 50 with periodontal disease. To evaluate periodontal condition, including clinical attachment loss and pocket depth, thorough oral exams were performed. Measurements were made of serum biomarkers for inflammation, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Multivariate regression models were used to examine correlations between the severity of periodontal disease and the underlying systemic diseases.\nIn all groups, there were significant relationships between higher levels of indicators of systemic inflammation and the severity of periodontal disease. In comparison to healthy controls (CRP mean value: 2.1 mg/L; IL-6 mean value: 6.4 pg/mL), participants with periodontal disease had higher mean levels of CRP (5.6 mg/L) and IL-6 (mean value: 12.8 pg/mL). Furthermore, compared to those with rheumatoid arthritis, those with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disorders showed higher levels of pocket depth and periodontal attachment loss.\nIn conclusion, the results point to a possible connection between systemic diseases such rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease. Since the diagnosis of the PD is mainly made based on the symptoms and after the disease progression, early diagnosis can play a crucial role in delaying the passage of the PD. There have been many methods focusing on disease diagnosis using electroencephalography (EEG) signals, where most of the proposed methods are data-dependent. Here, the study aims to propose a technique that, despite its high accuracy, is robust. Various features including fractal dimension, approximate entropy, largest Lyapunov exponent, and the energy of different frequency sub-bands were extracted from EEG signals. Multi-layer perceptron neural networks were used for classification based on these features. Additionally, 2D phase space images reconstructed from EEG signals were classified using convolutional neural networks. Finally, a combination of these features and images was used for classification using ResNets. During 10 rounds of training and testing, the mean accuracies were calculated for three cases: using only features, only images, and a combination of both. The mean accuracies were 84.67 %, 76.5 %, and 90.2 % respectively. The variances for each case were 35.6 %, 19.5 %, and 13.97 %. The lower variance when using a combination of features and images indicates a more accurate and robust classification.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) affects more than one million people in the EU. It currently has no definitive cure, meaning that patients rely only on symptomatic treatments, which themselves are burdened by side effects. The need for advancements in both knowledge and available treatments is thus strongly felt by patients, caregivers, and health operators. This unmet need sparked the idea of orchestrating a collaborative effort via a common network - IMMUPARKNET (The role of IMMUnity in tackling PARKinson's disease through a Translational NETwork). The IMMUPARKNET COST Action focuses on challenges in PD and its related crosstalk with immune response. Although widely recognized, the role of immunity in the onset and development of PD is still unclear. The main goal of IMMUPARKNET is to fill this knowledge gap by establishing an innovative, interdisciplinary research network and fostering exchanges of expertise among specialists from different countries and institutions. As we gather scientists and clinicians who study immunity in PD and related fields, IMMUPARKNET will establish the first nucleus of a multidisciplinary ecosystem that aims to harmonize efforts and approaches, both in research and clinical practice, to boost the development of ground-breaking treatments for PD. Through meetings, training schools, webinars, position papers, and review manuscripts, IMMUPARKNET will lead fruitful exchanges of know-how among experts in the field. The IMMUPARKNET structure revolves around 5 working groups, with a total of 157 active members from 34 different countries. Of these active members, 58.5% are young researchers, while 67.5% come from Inclusiveness Target Countries (ITC - less research-intensive COST Members; https://www.cost.eu/about/members/). IMMUPARKNET output will facilitate the improved sharing and development of research resources, straightening the road to novel treatments and identifying where existing ones can be repurposed, all, ultimately and hopefully, finding a cure for PD.\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) affects more than one million people in the EU.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) involves the disruption of brain energy homeostasis. This encompasses broad-impact factors such as mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired glycolysis, and other metabolic disturbances, like disruptions in the pentose phosphate pathway and purine metabolism. Cortical hubs, which are highly connected regions essential for coordinating multiple brain functions, require significant energy due to their dense synaptic activity and long-range connections. Deficits in ATP production in PD can severely impair these hubs. The energy imbalance also affects subcortical regions, including the massive axonal arbors in the striatum of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons, due to their high metabolic demand. This ATP decline may result in ",

    "abstract": "According to people with Parkinson's disease (PD), gait impairments are the most disabling motor symptoms of PD. Recently, motor imagery (MI) has gained notoriety as a gait training technique due to the flexibility of its use, however, it has not been demonstrated that causes a superior effect when included in physiotherapy. This study aims to determine if gait training combined with MI has a greater effect on the gait of people with PD than just gait training.\nThe GAITimagery is designed as a double-blind, randomized control trial, including a convenience sample in 2 parallel groups (1:1) with two interventions of 2 sessions per week during 6-week and 8-week follow-up. The initial recruitment will be 88 participants with idiopathic PD and unimpaired cognition state, who will be randomly divided into two groups: GAITimagery (GiG) or the active control Gait group (GaG). Both will perform the same gait exercises but only GiG will include MI training. Gait speed is the primary outcome, while Maximum gait speed (m/s) and Gait speed variability are the secondary results. The tertiary outcomes are related to Quality of life, Daily life activities, Freezing of gait, Balance, Mobility, and Gait performance measures to psychometrics and biomechanics instruments. All results will be measured at baseline (t0), post-training (t1), and follow-up assessment (t2) 8\u202fweeks after finished physiotherapy programs.\nThe GAITimagery program standardizes the application of MI exercises related to the improvement of parkinsonian gait at the same time that monitoring the vividness referred by the participants session by session. The effectiveness of this MI-exclusive program includes subjective and objective measurement tools to detect minimal changes after training. This still-to-be-finish study will support the therapeutic decisions on whether or not to allocate session time to imagery exercises depending on the effect size achieved and the comparison with a control gait training.",

    "abstract": "Recent research in the field of \"Arts and Health\" has demonstrated the beneficial impact of arts-based interventions on health and well-being across diverse populations. Recognizing their potential, especially in cases where conventional healthcare cannot address the multifaceted impact of conditions such as in Parkinson's disease (PD), our study advocates for an integrative approach in medical practice and neuroscience. We recommend incorporating learning environments from the design phase through long-term care. The arts offer a unique opportunity to create such environments. In this study, we specifically focus on individuals with PD, co-designing an intervention as a creative engagement learning environment and a PD-specific creative arts therapy. In this study, the narratives of those affected contribute as scientific knowledge, shaping care and increasing the intervention's relevance to participants' lives.\nWe used a participatory design-based research approach. Fourteen individuals with PD, along with three creative therapists and three researchers, collaborated through iterative design cycles to co-develop a creative arts therapy intervention. Qualitative data were collected through interviews, group reflections, and ethnographic observations. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.\nThe co-creation process resulted in a 10-week creative engagement intervention delivered in a \"creative playground\" setting. Participants chose from multiple media and autonomously decided their creative activities. Guidance from the creative therapists was provided as needed to support individual engagement and guide reflection and learning processes. Narratives offered insights into the relevance of autonomy in care, the role of the arts, and the individuality of disease experience, resulting in seven key features of our intervention framework, which include (i) intervention structure (e.g., duration of the intervention and sessions), (ii) freedom in selection of creative media, (iii) environment as a creative playground, (iv) skills of creative therapists, (v) PD-specific considerations, (vi) financial considerations and logistics, and we list (vii) responsibilities of the Design Team.\nThis study establishes an initial framework for a PD-specific creative arts therapy intervention designed as a creative engagement learning environment. Future research will focus on rigorously evaluating its effectiveness and exploring its scalability in diverse settings.",

    "abstract": "Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has emerged as a novel noninvasive adjunct therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), yet no quantitative analysis had been conducted to assess its therapeutic effect.\nThis review aimed to investigate the efficacy of tVNS on motor function, other potential clinical targets and its safety in various treatment conditions.\nWe searched six databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involved treating PD patients with tVNS. Primary outcome was motor functions, including severity of motor signs, functional mobility and balance, and gait parameters. Secondary outcomes were cognition, emotion, sleep related impairments, patient reported non-motor outcomes, and any adverse events. All outcomes were classified and analyzed according to the treatment duration and medication condition of an included study. Risk of bias was evaluated by referencing Cochrane risk of bias tool 1.0. Data was analyzed by Revman 5.4.\n6 RCTs with 176 PD patient were included. Several motor functions and non-motor functions measured during on-medication condition (severity of motor signs -0.48 [95% CI -0.93, -0.04], gait -0.48 [95% CI -0.85, -0.1], patients reported non-motor outcomes -0.4 [95% CI -0.78, -0.03]), improved significantly. However, verbal fluency, sleep-related impairment, and fatigue were negatively impacted by tVNS during on-medication condition.

    "abstract": "The gradually increasing age of the world population implies that the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases also continues to rise. These diseases are characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive and motor functions. Parkinson's disease, which involves the gradual death of specialized neural tissue, is a striking example of a neurodegenerative process. The pathomorphological analysis shows that chronic cerebral ischemia is accompanied by extensive complex neurodegeneration; parkinsonism is its clinical manifestation in 20-30% of cases. Although Parkinson's disease and vascular parkinsonism are similar, these two pathologies have fundamentally different etiopathogeneses. But their set of differential diagnosis traits is confined to some features of the neurological status. There currently exist no diagnostic markers for individual neurodegenerative pathologies or the neurodegeneration phenomenon in general. Metabolomic profiling can be a promising means for finding a unique \"fingerprint\" of the disease. Identifying the biomarkers of various neurodegenerative diseases will help shorten the time to the diagnosis, forecast the course of the disease, and personalize the therapeutic approach. This review summarizes and compares the current concepts of metabolomics research into Parkinson's disease and vascular parkinsonism, as well as the respective animal models.",

    "abstract": "In light of the escalating global incidence of Parkinson's disease and the dearth of therapeutic interventions that can alter the disease's course, there exists an urgent necessity to comprehensively elucidate and quantify the disease's global burden.\nThis study analyzed the incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of Parkinson's disease at global, regional, and national levels based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021. Bayesian age-period cohort (BAPC) analysis was used to predict the burden in Parkinson's disease from 2022 to 2035.\nIn 2021, 11.77 million people worldwide had Parkinson's disease.

    "abstract": "To verify the efficacy of smile training in improving gait disturbances in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibiting neuropsychiatric symptoms.\nA single-case BAB design with three intervention periods (B1, A1, and B2) was used. During periods B1 and B2, 10 min of smile training (facial muscles training and positive thinking training) was performed before the usual exercise therapy. During the A1 period, the participant received only the usual exercise therapy. During the intervention period, the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) was performed daily in both directions. Tau-U was calculated to determine the effect size of the TUG test time and the number of steps taken during each period. Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 10-meter walk at maximum speed, Berg Balance Scale, and Characterizing Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (C-FOGQ) were administered on the day before the start of the intervention and the last day of each period.\nComparisons of A1 to B2, TUG time, and the number of steps taken on both turns revealed large reductions (Tau-U \u22650.74, p <0.01). The 10-meter walk speed and MDS-UPDRS Part III bradykinesia scores improved, whereas the frequency of gait freezing on the C-FOGQ remained unchanged. The HADS scores did not show significant changes; however, the participant made more positive statements in his reflections.\nSmile training may be an effective intervention for improving gait and other motor symptoms in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the potential associations between voice metrics of patients with PD and their motor symptoms.\nMotor and vocal data including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III), Harmonic-Noise Ratio (HNR), jitter, shimmer, and smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPS) were analyzed through exploratory correlations followed by univariate linear regression analyses. We employed these four voice metrics as independent variables and the total and sub-scores of the UPDRS-III as dependent variables.\nThirteen subjects were included, 76% males and 24% females, with a mean age of 62.9 \u00b1 10.1 years, and a median Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2.3 \u00b1 0.7. The regression analysis showed that CPPS is associated with posture (UPDRS-III posture scores: \u03b2 = -0.196; F = 10.0; \nThese findings highlight the potential role of CPPS as a predictor of postural impairments secondary to PD, emphasizing the need for further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons leading to debilitating motor and non-motor symptoms. Beyond its well-known neurological features, emerging evidence underscores the pivotal role of the gut-brain axis and gastrointestinal microbiota in PD pathogenesis. Dysbiosis has been strongly linked to PD and is associated with increased intestinal permeability, chronic inflammation, and the production of neurotoxic metabolites that may exacerbate neuronal damage.\nThis review delves into the complex interplay between PD and dysbiosis, shedding light on two peculiar subsets of dysbiosis, \nThe potential to modulate gut microbiota through probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics; fecal microbiota transplantation; and antibiotics represents a promising frontier for innovative PD treatments. Despite this potential, the current evidence is limited by small sample sizes and methodological variability across studies. Rigorous, large-scale, randomized placebo-controlled trials with standardized treatments in terms of composition, dosage, and duration are urgently needed to validate these findings and pave the way for microbiota-based therapeutic strategies in PD management.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complicated neurodegenerative disease that is the most prevalent severe movement disorder worldwide. The research includes studying the levels of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE) with some biochemical parameters in the serum of patients with PD in Mosul City (Iraq), which include Serotonin (SERT), dopamine (DA), sphingomyelin (SM), vitamin B12, Acetylcholine esterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO), creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Samples reached (100), which included: (40) for the Parkinson's patients group, and (60) for the control group. The results showed there was a significant decrease in the levels of H2S, CSE, SERT, DA, SM, B12 and CK and a significant increase in the activity of MAO, AST, and ALT and no significant difference in AChE activity in serum for Parkinson's patients when compared with the control group. The effect of periods PD revealed, a significant decline of H2S, CSE, SERT, DA, B12, and AChE, while MAO, CK, AST, and ALT showed a significant rise with increased periods of disease, SM showed a non-significant change with periods of disease. The study concluded that H2S gas produced within the body and CSE suffer from low levels within the body, and they also decrease with the increase in the duration of the disease as a result of their use as protective functions in the body against Parkinson's disease. And developing it by observing the levels of the variables measured with it, and stimulating the body to increase their levels (H2S, CSE) in various ways can lead to improving the health condition of patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative condition. It affects the central nervous system, and it impairs cognitive processes, motor skills and other functions. The aim of this study was to determine the synaptic processes in medial Entorhinal cortex (mENT) under High frequency stimulation of Basolateral Amygdala on the model of Parkinson's disease under the influence of Hydrocortisone. Rotenone is involved in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. We investigated whether hydrocortison protects against rotenone-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in a rat model by in vivo electrical recording from medial Entorhinal cortex. Hydrocortison significantly improved electrical activity of neurons in the mENT of rotenone-induced PD model rats.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. These symptoms often lead to significant postural deformities and an increased risk of falls, severely impacting the quality of life. Conventional rehabilitation methods have shown benefits, but recent advancements suggest that virtual reality (VR) could offer a promising alternative. This scoping review aims to analyze the current literature to evaluate the effectiveness of VR in the postural rehabilitation of patients with PD. A scientific literature search was performed using the following databases: PubMed, PEDro, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English. Our selection criteria included studies that compared VR-based rehabilitation to traditional methods regarding posture-related outcomes. We identified and analyzed nine RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The results consistently demonstrated that VR-based rehabilitation leads to greater improvements in balance and gait compared to conventional therapy. Key findings include significant enhancements in balance confidence and postural control and a reduction in fall rates. The superior efficacy of VR-based rehabilitation can be attributed to its engaging and immersive nature, which enhances patient motivation and adherence to therapy. VR allows for precise, repeatable training scenarios tailored to individual patient needs, providing a safe environment to practice and improve motor skills. In conclusion, VR-based rehabilitation represents an innovative approach with substantial potential to improve the quality of life for PD patients. However, limitations such as small sample sizes and short intervention durations in existing studies highlight the need for larger multicenter trials with longer follow-up periods to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a range of motor and non-motor symptoms (NMSs) that significantly impact patients' quality of life. This review aims to synthesize the current literature on the application of brain stimulation techniques, including non-invasive methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), as well as invasive approaches like deep brain stimulation (DBS). We explore the efficacy and safety profiles of these techniques in alleviating both motor impairments, such as bradykinesia and rigidity, and non-motor symptoms, including cognitive decline, depression, and impulse control disorders. Current findings indicate that while non-invasive techniques present a favorable safety profile and are effective for milder symptoms, invasive methods like DBS provide significant relief for severe cases that are unresponsive to other treatments. Future research is needed to optimize stimulation parameters, establish robust clinical protocols, and expand the application of these technologies across various stages of PD. This review underscores the potential of brain stimulation as a vital therapeutic tool in managing PD, paving the way for enhanced treatment strategies and improved patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms resulting from the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Dopamine transporter scan (DATSCAN), based on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), is commonly used to evaluate the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. This study aims to identify a biomarker from DATSCAN images and develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm for PD diagnosis. Using 13 DATSCAN-derived parameters and patient handedness from 1309 individuals in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, we trained an AdaBoost classifier, achieving an accuracy of 98.88% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 99.81%. To ensure interpretability, we applied the local interpretable model-agnostic explainer (LIME), identifying contralateral putamen SBR as the most predictive feature for distinguishing PD from healthy controls. By focusing on a single biomarker, our approach simplifies PD diagnosis, integrates seamlessly into clinical workflows, and provides interpretable, actionable insights. Although DATSCAN has limitations in detecting early-stage PD, our study demonstrates the potential of ML to enhance diagnostic precision, contributing to improved clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a particularly severe non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that significantly diminishes the quality of life of affected individuals. Identifying reliable biomarkers for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease is essential for early diagnosis, prognostic assessments, and the development of targeted therapies. This review aims to summarize recent advancements in biofluid biomarkers for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, focusing on the detection of specific proteins, metabolites, and other biomarkers in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva. These biomarkers can shed light on the multifaceted etiology of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, which includes protein misfolding, neurodegeneration, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The integration of biofluid biomarkers with neuroimaging and clinical data can facilitate the development of predictive models to enhance early diagnosis and monitor the progression of cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease. This comprehensive approach can improve the existing understanding of the mechanisms driving cognitive decline and support the development of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying the course of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. Despite the promise of these biomarkers in characterizing the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease, further research is necessary to validate their clinical utility and establish a standardized framework for early detection and monitoring of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "There remains a significant gap in systematic research on healthcare utilization behaviors and the influencing factors for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly those in late stages.\nPD patients in late stage (Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stages 4 and 5) and their caregivers from Seoul National University Hospital Movement Disorders Clinic participated. A total of 103 respondents completed a questionnaire covering medical utilization behaviors, perceptions of face-to-face and telemedicine consultations, and additional medical service needs. Descriptive analysis was conducted based on HY stage, age, and travel time to the hospital.\n82.1% of patients in HY4 make more than 50% of in-person visits by themselves or with caregivers, compared with only 38.9% of patients in HY5. Despite proxy visits by caregivers were common, audiovisual or written materials about the patient's condition were underused (63% answered 'never'). Over three-quarters of patients did not receive rehabilitation therapy, mainly due to mobility issues and the lack of nearby facilities. One third of respondents were open to telemedicine, with differing preferences between age groups. 22% of HY5 patients or their caregivers were willing to pay more for telemedicine than in-person visit.\nThis study seeks to understand hospital use patterns and needs in late-stage PD patients and their caregivers. Current treatment framework for PD has areas that, if improved, could significantly enhance the quality of care. Telemedicine offers an opportunity to enhance PD education and assessment, introducing new methods for remotely measuring symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Resting state electroencephalography (EEG) has proved useful in studying electrophysiological changes in neurodegenerative diseases. In many neuropathologies, microstate analysis of the eyes-closed (EC) scalp EEG is a robust and highly reproducible technique for assessing topological changes with high temporal resolution. However, scalp EEG microstate maps tend to underestimate the non-occipital or non-alpha-band networks, which can also be used to detect neuropathological changes. Recent evidence has shown that the source-space microstates can characterize distinct functional connectivity patterns but its clinical ability to detect neuropathological changes has not been demonstrated so far. It should also be remembered that the eye condition may play an important role in neural activity dynamics. The aim of this study was to systematically characterize the dynamic neuropathological features of sensor-space and source-space EEG microstates in PD patients with no cognitive impairment in both EC and EO conditions with the aim of identifying potential biomarkers that could be used as a complementary clinical screening method for early PD detection. We found that the dynamic features of the source-space microstates were more sensitive in detecting PD than the sensor-space microstates, while EO was able to detect neuropathological changes in PD patients better than EC. In EO, PD disease exhibited significantly higher occurrence and coverage in visual-network related source-space microstates and abnormally high duration in sensorimotor network-related microstates. Our results suggest that the source-space microstate analysis of resting-state EEG could provide robust biomarkers to detect early-stage PD, which would allow the development of patient-oriented strategies to prevent the disease and improve the patients' quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a crucial organelle associated with cellular homeostasis. Accumulation of improperly folded proteins results in ER stress, accompanied by the reaction involving triggering unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is mediated through ER membrane-associated sensors, such as protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1\u03b1, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Prolonged stress triggers cell apoptotic reaction, resulting in cell death. Neuronal cells are especially susceptible to protein misfolding. Notably, ER and UPR malfunctions are linked to many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), delineated by accumulation of misfolded proteins. Notably, ATF family members play key roles in AD and PD pathogenesis. However, the connection between ER stress, UPR, and neuropathology is not yet fully understood. Here, we discuss our present knowledge of the association between ER stress, the UPR, and neurodegeneration in AD and PD. We also discuss the roles of ATF family members in AD and PD pathogenesis. Moreover, we provide a mechanistic clarification of how disease-related molecules affect ER protein homeostasis and explore recent findings that connect the UPR to neuronal plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Ergothioneine (EGT) is a natural dietary antioxidant derived from certain edible mushrooms, commonly used as a food additive and supplement, but its effects on Parkinson's Disease (PD) are still unclear. The accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and development of PD. Here, this study demonstrated that EGT effectively inhibits \u03b1-syn aggregation, disrupts mature fibers, and reduces associated cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. The beneficial effects of EGT were confirmed in Caenorhabditis elegans, where it protected dopaminergic neurons, prolonged lifespan and enhanced behavioral functions by reducing \u03b1-syn plaque accumulation and associated oxidative stress. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that EGT interacts directly with \u03b1-syn pentamer through van der Waals and electrostatic forces, disrupting the structural stability of the preformed pentamer. Furthermore, animal studies validated that EGT alleviated neuronal damage and improved behavioral deficits by reducing \u03b1-syn aggregation, oxidative stress and inflammatory response. In conclusion, EGT presents promising potential as a dietary supplement for preventing and alleviating PD.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a disabling symptom for people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). Turning on the spot for one minute in alternating directions (360 turn) while performing a cognitive dual-task (DT) is a fast and sensitive way to provoke FOG. The FOG-index is a widely used wearable sensor-based algorithm to quantify FOG severity during turning. Despite that, the FOG-index's classification performance and criterion validity is not tested against the gold standard (i.e., video-rated time spent freezing). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the FOG-index's classification performance and criterion validity to assess FOG severity during 360 turn. Additionally, we investigated the FOG-index's optimal cutoff values to differentiate between PwPD with and without FOG.\n164 PwPD self-reported the presence of FOG on the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOGQ) and performed the DT 360 turn in the ON medication state while being videoed and wearing five wearable sensors. Two independent clinical experts rated FOG on video. ROC-AUC values assessed the FOG-index's classification accuracy against self-reported FOG and expert ratings. Spearman-rho was used to evaluate the correlation between expert and FOG-index ratings of FOG severity.\nTwenty-eight patients self-reported FOG, while 104 were classified as a freezer by the experts. The FOG-index had limited classification agreement with the NFOGQ (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.60, \nA surprisingly large discrepancy was found between self-reported and expert-rated FOG during the 360 turning task, indicating PwPD do not always notice FOG in daily life. The FOG-index achieved suboptimal classification performance and poor criterion validity to assess FOG severity. Regardless, 360 turning proved a sensitive task to elicit FOG. Further development of the FOG-index is warranted, and long-term follow-up studies are needed to assess the predictive value of the 360 turning task for classifying FOG conversion.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration within the nigrostriatum, leading to motor dysfunction. This systematic review aimed to summarize the effects of various exercise training regimens on protein or gene expression within the nigrostriatum and their role in neuroprotection and motor function improvement in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nPubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched up to June 2024 and included sixteen studies that adhere to PRISMA guidelines and CAMARADES checklist scores ranging from 4 to 6 out of 10. Various exercise training regimens, administered 5 days per week for 6.5 weeks, were applied to MPTP, 6-OHDA, and PFF-\u03b1-synuclein-induced PD animal models.\nExercise training was found to downregulate the inflammatory pathway by attenuating \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, inhibiting the TLR/MyD88/I\u03baB\u03b1 signaling cascade and NF-\u03baB phosphorylation, and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 within the nigrostriatum. It also inhibited the ASC and NLRP3 inflammasome complex and reduced the BAX/ Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-1/3 proteins, thereby decreasing neuronal apoptosis in the nigrostriatum. Exercise training elevated the expression of Pro-BDNF, BDNF, GDNF, TrkB, and Erk1/2, providing neurotrophic support to dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, it upregulated the dopaminergic signaling pathway by increasing the expression of TH, DAT, PSD-95, and synaptophysin in the nigrostriatum.\nThe findings suggested that exercise training downregulated inflammatory and apoptotic pathways while upregulated BDNF/GDNF pathways and dopaminergic signaling within the nigrostriatum. These molecular changes contributed to neuroprotection, reduced dopaminergic neuron loss, and improved motor function in PD animal models.\nCRD42024484537 https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#recordDetails.",

    "abstract": "This review assesses the primary neuroimaging techniques used to evaluate Parkinson's disease (PD) - a neurological condition characterized by gradual dopamine-producing nerve cell degeneration. The neuroimaging techniques explored include positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These modalities offer varying degrees of insights into PD pathophysiology, diagnostic accuracy, specificity by way of exclusion of other Parkinsonian syndromes, and monitoring of disease progression. Neuroimaging is thus crucial for diagnosing and managing PD, with integrated multimodal approaches and novel techniques further enhancing early detection and treatment evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The deficiency of estrogen correlates with a range of diseases, notably Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) and Parkinson's disease (PD). There is a possibility that PMO and PD may share underlying molecular mechanisms that are pivotal in their development and progression. The objective of this study was to identify critical genes and potential mechanisms associated with PMO by examining co-expressed genes linked to PD.\nInitially, pertinent data concerning PMO and PD were obtained from the GWAS database, followed by conducting a Bayesian colocalization analysis. Subsequently, co-expressed genes from the PMO dataset (GSE35956) and the PD dataset (GSE20164) were identified and cross-referenced with estrogen-related genes (ERGs). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among PMO, PD, and ERGs were subjected to an array of bioinformatics analyses, including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses, in addition to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. The study also involved constructing TF-gene interactions, TF-microRNA coregulatory networks, interactions of hub genes with diseases, and validation through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).\nThe colocalization analysis uncovered shared genetic variants between PD and osteoporosis, with a posterior probability of colocalization (PPH4) measured at 0.967. Notably, rs3796661 was recognized as a shared genetic variant. A total of 11 genes were classified as DEGs across PMO, PD, and ERGs. Five principal KEGG pathways were identified, which include the p53 signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, cell cycle, FoxO signaling pathway, and cellular senescence. Additionally, three hub genes-WT1, CCNB1, and SMAD7-were selected from the PPI network utilizing Cytoscape software. These three hub genes, which possess significant diagnostic value for PMO and PD, were further validated using GEO datasets. Interactions between transcription factors and genes, as well as between microRNAs and hub genes, were established. Ultimately, the expression trends of the identified hub genes were confirmed through qRT-PCR validation.\nThis study is anticipated to offer innovative approaches for identifying potential biomarkers and important therapeutic targets for both PMO and PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss, Lewy body build-up, and motor dysfunction. One of the primary pathogenic mechanisms of PD development is autophagy dysfunction and nitric oxide-mediated neurotoxicity.\nThe current study focuses on autophagy and nitric oxide (NO) signaling roles in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated PD mice and their protection by their modulators.\nBALB/c mice were administered MPTP (30 mg/kg/i.p/day) for five consecutive days in order to create a PD model. Following MPTP poisoning, the doses of GA (16.8 mg/kg/day/i.p.), 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) (10 mg/kg/day/i.p.), and their combination were administered once daily for 14 days. Animals were observed for behavioral and locomotor changes, biochemical examination, inflammatory mediators, and analysis of molecular markers.\nGA, 7-NI alone significantly reduced MPTP-induced locomotor, behavioral, and oxidative damage. Additionally, in MPTP-intoxicated animals, 7-NI and GA had protective effects on dopamine levels, TH positive DA neurons, inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) concentration. Furthermore, GA increases LC3BII expression, which in turn increases autophagy. It also decreases total NO content, and a significant response of 7-NI demonstrates their interaction, which is neuroprotective.\nPresent research suggests that dysregulation of autophagy and NO-mediated neuroinflammation are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of MPTP-induced PD. The use of two pharmacotherapeutics, GA and 7-NI, respectively, significantly reduces MPTP-induced PD distortions and their interaction enhances the overall protective effect, suggesting that these pharmacological agents may be used for the treatment of PD.",

Additionally, in MPTP-intoxicated animals, 7-NI and GA had protective effects on dopamine levels, TH positive DA neurons, inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) concentration. Furthermore, GA increases LC3BII expression, which in turn increases autophagy. It also decreases total NO content, and a significant response of 7-NI demonstrates their interaction, which is neuroprotective.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI) as an independent risk factor for dementia in Parkinson's disease has prognostic value in predicting dementia in PD patients. It was found that the calculation of cognitive function decision-making could better evaluate the cognitive function of PD-MCI. Therefore, this study explored deficits in decision-making cognitive function in PD-MCI population, and mined novel digital biomarkers for recognizing early cognitive decline in PD-MCI through an independently designed maze decision-making digital assessment paradigm. This study included 30 healthy controls 37 PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) and 40 PD-MCI patients. Through difference comparison and stepwise regression analysis, two digital decision-making biomarkers, total decision time and performance average acceleration, were screened, and their joint area under curve for the ability to discriminate between PD-MCI and PD-NC was 0.909, and for the ability to discriminate between PD-MCI and NC was 0.942. In addition, it was found that maze digital decision-making biomarkers had greater early warning efficacy in men than in women. Unlike traditional methods, this study used digital dynamic assessment to reveal possible decision-making cognitive deficits in the PD-MCI populations, which provides new ideas for effective screening for PD-MCI.",

    "abstract": "There are currently no deep learning models applying resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data to distinguish patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls (HCs). Moreover, no study has correlated objective gait parameters with brain network alterations in patients with PD. We propose BrainNetCNN + CL, applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) and joint contrastive learning (CL) method to brain network analysis to classify patients with PD and HCs, and compare their performance with classical classification methods. This study aimed to explore more accurate abnormal connecting regions that may serve as potential therapeutic targets, and to explore the correlation between abnormal connecting regions and gait parameters.\nWe enrolled 29 patients with PD and 38 HCs. Rs-fMRI data and high-resolution three-dimensional structural T1-weighted images were acquired for each participant. BrainNetCNN + CL were utilized to classify the PD and HC groups.\nThe top 20 connections with the highest contribution to the classification results obtained using BrainNetCNN + CL included the default mode network (DMN), ventral attention network (VAN), and limbic network (LN). The strength of the functional connectivity (FC) between the right inferior occipital gyrus and left postcentral gyrus in the PD group was negatively correlated with the step length at the self-selected pace (SSP) speed in the \"ON\" state (P=0.001, r=-0.589). The strength of the FC between the right fusiform gyrus and the right calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex was negatively correlated with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) score (P=0.032, r=-0.406) and positively correlated with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score measured in the \"ON\" state (P=0.037, r=0.395).\nBrainNetCNN + CL accurately identified abnormally connected regions associated with gait impairments, which may serve as potential therapeutic targets for PD.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that dysfunction of thalamocortical circuity generates the motor signs that lead to distinct disease processes and prognoses in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to leverage ultrahigh-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify the connectivity alterations of thalamocortical circuity and clarify their relation to motor signs in early PD.\nPatients with early-stage PD (n=55) and healthy controls (HCs, n=56) were recruited from March 2022 to July 2023. All participants underwent 7-Tesla MRI scans as the baseline. Sign scores were calculated from the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III. Significant differences in the functional connectivity between the thalamus subregions and cortex between the PD and HC groups were discovered. The association between altered thalamic functional connectivity and sign scores was evaluated using Spearman or Pearson correlation analysis with false discovery rate (FDR) correction.\nCompared to the HCs, the patients with early-stage PD exhibited a decreased functional connectivity between thalamic subregions (primary motor, sensory, occipital, premotor, and parietal thalamus regions) and the cortex [voxel-level P<0.001, cluster-level P\nThese findings support the use of ultrahigh-field MRI for examining the thalamic subregions and clarifying their involvement in the neural mechanisms of various motor signs in early-stage PD.",

    "abstract": "Preliminary scientific evidence suggests that freezing of gait (FoG) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) is linked to noradrenergic dysfunction in the locus coeruleus (LC). However, definitive findings regarding the correlation between FoG occurrence and the LC are lacking. This study thus aimed to investigate the relationship between the FoG occurrence and LC degeneration in patients with PD by analyzing the signal characteristics of the LC in neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI).\nThis study enrolled 22 patients with PD and FoG, 24 patients with PD without FoG, and 13 matched healthy controls (HCs). All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning and clinical assessments. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of LC was measured on NM-MRI images. We used two statistical models (model 1 and model 2) to screen and adjust for potential confounding factors and evaluated the independent relationship between LC's CNR and FoG.\nThe statistical models showed that except for the target factor FoG [model 1: \u03b2=0.127, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.019-0.236, P=0.023; model 2: \u03b2=0.153, 95% CI: 0.019-0.287, P=0.026], rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (model 1: \u03b2=0.182, 95% CI: 0.073-0.291, P=0.002; model 2: \u03b2=0.171, 95% CI: 0.048-0.294, P=0.008), and gender (model 1: \u03b2=0.150, 95% CI: 0.042-0.257, P=0.007) were independent factors associated with the CNR of the left LC. Among these, RBD had the greatest influence, followed by gender and FoG.\nOur findings indicated that the FoG is associated with noradrenergic dysfunction caused by LC degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is associated with pathological \u03b1-synuclein deposition and may have different damage directions due to \u03b1-synuclein spreading orientations. Recent functional imaging studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) with RBD have identified abnormalities in connectivity, but effective connectivity (EC) for this altered orientation is understudied. Here, we aimed to explore altered intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) and EC in PD patients with probable RBD (pRBD).\nThis was a cross-sectional study. A total of 31 PD patients with pRBD (PD-pRBD), 35 PD without pRBD (PD-npRBD), and 32 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) scans. The voxel-wise degree centrality (DC) calculation was first performed to investigate the inherent connectivity of the PD-pRBD patients. Subsequently, we applied Granger causality analysis (GCA) to probe the causal effects of anomalous brain regions. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) method was executed to evaluate the DC values in identifying PD-pRBD.\nPD-pRBD patients exhibited reduced z-DC values in the right precentral gyrus relative to PD-npRBD (voxel-level P<0.001, cluster-level P<0.05), as well as decreased z-DC values in the right postcentral gyrus and the superior parietal lobule compared to HCs. Then, our GCA revealed that decreased EC was located predominantly from the right precentral gyrus to the right caudate nucleus in the PD-pRBD group. Additionally, the SVM results revealed that the z-DC values of the right precentral gyrus could discriminate PD-pRBD from the PD-npRBD group [area under the curve (AUC) =0.905].\nThe altered z-DC in the right precentral gyrus and the anomaly causal effects from the precentral motor cortex to the ipsilateral striatum represented by the caudate nucleus might play vital roles in the pathogenesis of PD-pRBD. It was speculated that the attenuation of FC from the precentral motor cortex to the subcortical striatum might be associated with nocturnal muscle dyskinesia and behavioral abnormalities in PD-pRBD patients. This disruption pattern may be a prospective imaging marker in the characterization of PD with pRBD.",

Meanwhile, various rating scales were used to assess the clinical symptoms of PD.\nCompared to healthy controls (HCs), PD patients showed a significant increase in magnetic susceptibility values (MSVs) within the SN and GP. Further comparisons indicated that the MSVs of the SN, PT, GP and CN are all higher in advanced stages than in early stages. Significant positive correlations were observed between the MSVs of the SN and scores on the UPDRS-III, HAMA, and HAMD (\nOur study revealed that QSM possesses the capability to serve as a biomarker for PD.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms that profoundly impact patients' quality of life. While pharmacological therapies such as levodopa remain the mainstay of treatment, their long-term use is often limited by motor complications. Device-based interventions, including deep brain stimulation (DBS) and continuous dopaminergic infusions, have emerged as alternatives, promising sustained symptomatic control and reduced medication-related side effects. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the comparative efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of device-based interventions versus pharmacological therapies in the management of advanced PD. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases to identify randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and systematic reviews. Primary outcomes included motor function improvement, quality of life, and adverse events. Meta-analyses were performed, and subgroup analyses explored the effectiveness of specific interventions. Device-based interventions demonstrated superior efficacy over pharmacological therapies, with a pooled effect size (Cohen's d) of 1.12 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94-1.29) for motor symptom control and quality of life improvements. Subgroup analyses showed DBS and levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel to be particularly effective, with levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel showing a Cohen's d of 1.25 (95% CI: 0.91-1.58). Device-based therapies also reduced medication dosages and associated motor complications. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings, and no significant publication bias was detected. However, gaps remain in understanding the long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Device-based interventions, especially DBS and levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel, offer superior symptom control and quality of life improvements compared to traditional pharmacological therapies in advanced PD. These findings support the integration of device-based therapies into personalized treatment strategies. Further research is needed to explore long-term outcomes and establish standardized guidelines for their implementation in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. It affects mainly people over 65 and the incidence increases with age. It is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms and several clinical manifestations. The most evident symptom that affects all patients with Parkinson's Disease is the impairment of motor control, including bradykinesia, tremor, joint rigidity, and postural instability. In the literature, it has been evaluated with muscle synergies, a well-known method for evaluating motor control at the muscular level. However, few studies are available and there is still a major gap to fill to exploit the potential of the method for assessing motor control in Parkinson's Disease, both in the understanding of physiopathology and clinical practice.\nIn the light of understanding and fostering future developments for the field, in this review we initially screened 212 papers on Scopus and Web of Science and selected 15 of them to summarize the main features of investigations that employed muscle synergies to analyze patients with Parkinson's Disease. We detailed the features of the screened papers by reporting the clinical findings, a detailed report of EMG processing choices and synergy-based results.\nWe found that synergistic control is in general altered in patients with Parkinson's Disease, but it can improve if patients are subjected to pharmacological and rehabilitation therapies. Moreover, a further understanding of synergistic control in Parkinson's patients is needed.\nWe discuss the future developments in the field with a detailed assessment of the topic on the view of physicians, including the most promising lines of research for clinical practice and from the perspective of engineers, for methodological application of synergistic approaches.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to systematically review the available evidence on the effects of boxing interventions on people with Parkinson disease.\nFour electronic databases were searched systematically from their inception until December 2023. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies scales.\nA total of 13 studies were included. Data synthesis indicated that participants who performed boxing programs did not have a significant effect in the polled data on functional mobility, balance, motor symptoms, gait and cardiorespiratory fitness Accordingly, for the effects of boxing on self-reported quality of life, the polled data showed a non-significant trend towards improving Hedges' g. Also, when the analysis was performed by comparing the experimental and control groups, the results remained non-significant.\nThe evidence regarding the use of boxing as a program exercise for patients with Parkinson disease remains uncertain. Preliminary findings indicate that participation in boxing does not demonstrate a substantial impact on either physical or mental health outcomes.\nEste estudio tuvo como objetivo revisar sistem\u00e1ticamente la evidencia disponible sobre los efectos de las intervenciones de boxeo en personas con enfermedad de Parkinson. M\u00e9todos: Se realizaron b\u00fasquedas sistem\u00e1ticas en cuatro bases de datos electr\u00f3nicas desde su creaci\u00f3n hasta diciembre de 2023. La calidad metodol\u00f3gica de los estudios incluidos fue evaluada utilizando las escalas Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) y Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies.\nSe incluyeron un total de 13 estudios. La s\u00edntesis de los datos indic\u00f3 que los participantes que realizaron programas de boxeo no mostraron un efecto significativo en los datos agrupados sobre movilidad funcional, equilibrio, s\u00edntomas motores, marcha y capacidad cardiorrespiratoria. Asimismo, en cuanto a los efectos del boxeo en la calidad de vida autoinformada, los datos agrupados mostraron una tendencia no significativa hacia la mejora seg\u00fan el estad\u00edstico Hedges' g. Adem\u00e1s, cuando se realiz\u00f3 el an\u00e1lisis comparando los grupos experimentales y de control, los resultados permanecieron no significativos.\nLa evidencia sobre el uso del boxeo como programa de ejercicio para pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson sigue siendo incierta. Los hallazgos preliminares indican que la participaci\u00f3n en boxeo no demuestra un impacto sustancial en los resultados de salud f\u00edsica o mental.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance is an important pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Proinflammatory cytokines during neuroinflammation decrease insulin sensitivity by suppressing insulin signaling elements. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the main receptor involved in neuroinflammation, is also associated with the pathogenesis of PD.\nThe present study evaluated the effect of insulin, an insulin receptor antagonist, and a TLR4 inhibitor on behavioral deficits and insulin resistance induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA).\nMale Wistar rats were divided into nine groups: (1) sham (normal saline [NS] in the medial forebrain bundle [MFB]); (2) 6-OHDA (20 \u00b5g in the MFB); (3) 6-OHDA + NS; (4) 6-OHDA + dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); (5) 6-OHDA + insulin (2.5 IU/day, intracerebroventricular ([ICV]); (6) 6-OHDA + insulin (5 IU/day, intranasal [IN]); (7) 6-OHDA + insulin receptor antagonist (S961; 6.5 nM/kg, ICV); (8) 6-OHDA + TLR4 inhibitor (TAK242; 0.01 \u00b5g/rat, ICV); (9) 6-OHDA + insulin + TLR4 inhibitor. All treatments were administered for seven consecutive days. Motor performance was evaluated using apomorphine-induced rotation and cylinder tests. Gene expression and protein levels of \u03b1-synuclein, TLR4, insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1, IRS2, and glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively, in the striatum.\nInsulin, alone and with TAK242, improved motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA. Administration of the insulin receptor antagonist had no effect on motor deficits. The increased expression of \u03b1-synuclein and TLR4 following 6-OHDA was attenuated by insulin and TAK242. GSK3\u03b2 levels, both mRNA and protein, were significantly increased by 6-OHDA and attenuated with insulin and TAK242.\nThe findings suggest that 6-OHDA induces neurodegeneration via activation of TLR4 and GSK3\u03b2, indicating insulin resistance, and that insulin can improve these impairments. Moreover, TLR4 inhibition prevents insulin signaling dysfunction and improves behavioral and molecular impairments, highlighting the critical role of TLR4 in the development of insulin resistance in PD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Timely identification of drug-induced Parkinson-like events is essential to improve clinical management and enhance patients' quality of life. However, there is a significant lack of studies addressing these events in real-world settings.\nTo bridge this gap, we analyzed adverse event (AE) reports related to Parkinson-like events from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from the first quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2024. Our objective was to summarize a list of potential drugs at high risk for Parkinson-like events and their corresponding proportions of AE reports.\nAs a result, a total of 54,639 AE reports linked to Parkinson-like events involving 1,224 drugs were identified. Among these, carbidopa/levodopa exhibited the highest number of reports, followed by baclofen and pimavanserin. The most frequently reported drug class was antiparkinsonian drugs and psycholeptics, followed by psychoanaleptics. Using two disproportionate analysis methods, the reporting odds ratio and proportional reporting ratio, we found that 136 drugs exhibited positive results in both methods, while 1,063 drugs did not show any positive signals.\nThis study provides a comprehensive pharmacovigilance analysis of drugs associated with Parkinson-like events, aiming to promote rational drug use and inform clinical practice.",

    "results": "As a result, a total of 54,639 AE reports linked to Parkinson-like events involving 1,224 drugs were identified. Among these, carbidopa/levodopa exhibited the highest number of reports, followed by baclofen and pimavanserin. The most frequently reported drug class was antiparkinsonian drugs and psycholeptics, followed by psychoanaleptics. Using two disproportionate analysis methods, the reporting odds ratio and proportional reporting ratio, we found that 136 drugs exhibited positive results in both methods, while 1,063 drugs did not show any positive signals.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and is associated with significant disability. The prevalence is rising, and studies have reported potential sex and race disparities in patient outcomes. Data about the demographic trends in PD-related mortality in the United States (US) is limited. This descriptive study aimed to report the national demographic trends in PD-related mortality over a 20-year period.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiological Research (CDC-WONDER) Underlying Cause of Death database from January 1999 to December 2020 was used to determine the PD-related age adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) stratified by age, sex, ethnicity and geographic area, with the 1999 deaths as the reference group. Annual percentage change (APC) for AAMR was then calculated using Joinpoint regression.\nThere were 515,884 PD-related deaths in the study period. The AAMR increased from 5.3 per 100,000 population in 1999 to 9.8 per 100,000 in 2020. Males had consistently higher AAMR than females and white race had consistently higher overall AAMR (7.6 per 100,000), followed by American Indians/Alaska Natives (4.4 per 100,000), Asians/Pacific Islanders (4.1 per 100,000) and Black/African Americans (3.4 per 100,000). The Midwest had the highest AAMR followed by West, South and Northeast. Utah, Idaho and Minnesota had the highest state-level AAMR.\nThis study identified significant age, sex, race and geographic disparities in PD-related mortality in the US. Older age, male sex, white race and Midwest locality were associated with the highest AAMR.\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a common disease that impacts the brain and as a result, movement. One in 37 people will be diagnosed with PD in their lifetime, and the risk of developing PD increases with age. PD can lead to variety of complications such as falls, depression, and death. This research aimed to summarise the demographic trends in PD-related death in the United States from 1999\u20132020 using death certificate data. There were 515,884 PD-related deaths in the study period. Death rates increased from 5.3 per 100,000 population in 1999 to 9.8 per 100,000 in 2020. In terms of demographics, firstly, male sex had a higher rate than female sex. Secondly, white race had death rate than American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians/Pacific Islanders and Black/African Americans, Finally, the Midwest had a higher death rate than the West, South and Northeast. These results could be because PD is more common in these groups. Future research could investigate underlying reasons behind disparities in mortality. In summary, PD is a significant cause of death in the US and there are differences in demographic trends in PD-related deaths. The number of deaths from PD per population count is higher with older ages, in males, people of white race and in the Midwest. Knowledge of these trends is important to build healthcare services around this growing population.",

    "abstract": "The main characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) are the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and abnormal aggregation of cytosolic proteins. However, the exact pathogenesis of PD remains unclear, with ferroptosis emerging as one of the key factors driven by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Glial cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, serve as supportive cells in the central nervous system (CNS), but their abnormal activation can lead to DA neuron death and ferroptosis. This paper explores the interactions between glial cells and DA neurons, reviews the changes in glial cells during the pathological process of PD, and reports on how glial cells regulate ferroptosis in PD through iron homeostasis and lipid peroxidation. This opens up a new pathway for basic research and therapeutic strategies in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Walking ability is essential for human survival and health. Its basic rhythm is mainly generated by the central pattern generator of the spinal cord. The rhythmic stimulation of music to the auditory center affects the cerebral cortex and other higher nerve centers, and acts on the central pattern generator. By means of rhythm entrainment, the central pattern generator can produce walking rhythm synchronized with music rhythm, control muscle tension, and then regulate human gait. Basal ganglia dysfunction is the main cause of abnormal gait in patients with Parkinson's disease. Music therapy provides external rhythmic stimulation, recruits neural networks to bypass the basal ganglia and synchronizes gait with external rhythms in both time and space through auditory-motor neural networks, helping to promote the improvement of abnormal gait patterns in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Despite being recognized for a long time as a characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD), pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is still a symptom that is underdiagnosed and undertreated. This study aimed to assess the association between PBA and various mood disturbances, as well as the impact on quality of life in PD patients.\nSixty-eight patients with PD were enrolled in this study. Their demographic and clinical features, including age, gender, education, smoking, lateralization and duration of the disease, and comorbidity, were recorded. The scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn-Yahr Scale, The Mental Component Summary (MCS-12), the Physical Component Summary (PCS-12), The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Beck Depression Inventory were evaluated. The Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) was used to explore PBA.\nThere were 12 patients (17%) with CNS-LS scores of \u226513, and 4 patients (5%) with CNS-LS scores of \u22654. BDI scores demonstrated a strong positive correlation with CNS-LS scores (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.64, p<0.001), and MCS-12 scores showed a significant negative correlation with CNS-LS scores (Spearman correlation coefficient=-0.70, p<0.001). The multivariate linear regression analysis showed that lower MCS-12 scores are related to higher CNS-LS scores, and higher BDI scores are also linked to higher CNS-LS scores.\nOur results indicate that elevated depressive symptoms correspond with increased CNS-LS scores, while a lower quality of mental health is also linked to higher CNS-LS scores. These findings highlight the influence of mood and mental health status on PDA among patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Surgical planning is critical to achieve optimal outcome in deep brain stimulation (DBS). The relationship between clinical outcomes and DBS electrode position relative to subthalamic nucleus (STN) is well investigated, but the role of surgical trajectory remains unclear. We sought to determine whether preoperatively planned DBS lead trajectory relates to adequate motor outcome in STN-DBS for Parkinson's disease (PD).\nIn 49 participants who underwent bilateral STN-DBS for PD using a Leksell\u00ae frame, we coregistered the frame and participant MRI images to obtain participant-specific anatomical planes. We evaluated relationships between clinical data and planned trajectories relative to their midsagittal and axial planes. We computed percent change in Unified PD Rating Scale subsection 3 (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III) scores before and after DBS, and performed binary logistic regression to determine whether planned trajectories affect adequate (>30% Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III improvement) motor outcome.\nPreoperatively planned left lead trajectory relative to midsagittal plane predicted likelihood of adequate right body motor outcomes (odds ratio = 0.69, P = .024), even when controlling for ventricular width through Evans index. This effect reflects that increasingly lateral angle of approach reduced odds of adequate motor outcome. Right lead trajectory lacked a similar trend.\nLeft DBS lead trajectory predicts adequate right-body motor outcome after bilateral STN-DBS. Greater planned trajectory angle relative to midsagittal plane reduces motor outcomes, independent of patients' ventricular width. These data may guide patient selection, inform risk/benefit discussions, optimize surgical planning, or support evidence-based evaluation of the methodologies used to select the approach trajectory, with careful consideration of the angle of approach relative to target.",

While large research consortia are performing widespread research genetic testing to accelerate discoveries, debate continues about whether, and to what extent, the results should be returned to patients. Ethically, it is imperative to keep participants informed, especially when findings are potentially actionable. However, research testing may not hold the same standards required from clinical diagnostic laboratories and hold significant psychosocial implications. The absence of universally recognized protocols complicates the establishment of appropriate guidelines.\nAiming to develop recommendations on return of research results (RoR) practice within the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2), we conducted a global survey to gain insight on GP2 members' perceptions, practice, readiness, and needs surrounding RoR.\nGP2 members (n = 191), representing 147 institutions and 60 countries across 6 continents, completed the survey. Access to clinical genetic testing services was significantly higher in high-income countries compared with low- and middle-income countries (96.6% vs 58.4%), where funding was predominantly covered by patients themselves. While 92.7% of the respondents agreed that genetic research results should be returned, levels of agreement were higher for clinically relevant results relating to pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in genes known to cause PD or other neurodegenerative diseases. Less than 10% offered separate clinically accredited genetic testing before returning genetic research results. A total of 48.7% reported having a specific statement on RoR policy in their ethics consent form, while 53.9% collected data on participants' preferences on RoR prospectively. 24.1% had formal genetic counselling training. Notably, the comfort level in returning incidental genetic findings or returning results to unaffected individuals remains low.\nGiven the differences in resources and training for RoR, as well as ethical and regulatory considerations, tailored approaches are required to ensure equitable access to RoR. Several identified strategies to enhance RoR practices include improving informed consent processes, increasing capacity for genetic counselling including providing counselling toolkits for common genetic variants, broadening access to sustainable clinically accredited testing, building logistical infrastructure for RoR processes, and continuing public and health care education efforts on the important role of genetics in PD.",

    "results": "GP2 members (n = 191), representing 147 institutions and 60 countries across 6 continents, completed the survey. Access to clinical genetic testing services was significantly higher in high-income countries compared with low- and middle-income countries (96.6% vs 58.4%), where funding was predominantly covered by patients themselves. While 92.7% of the respondents agreed that genetic research results should be returned, levels of agreement were higher for clinically relevant results relating to pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in genes known to cause PD or other neurodegenerative diseases. Less than 10% offered separate clinically accredited genetic testing before returning genetic research results. A total of 48.7% reported having a specific statement on RoR policy in their ethics consent form, while 53.9% collected data on participants' preferences on RoR prospectively. 24.1% had formal genetic counselling training. Notably, the comfort level in returning incidental genetic findings or returning results to unaffected individuals remains low.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that presents with motor symptoms such as tremors, slowness and gait difficulties, in addition to various non-motor symptoms such as anxiety, depression and autonomic and sleep disturbances. Pranayama (yogic breathing practices) has been studied as a part of yoga interventions in Parkinson's disease. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have not detailed the pranayama practices used in clinical studies, and there is no clarity on the pranayama practices that would be most beneficial for Parkinson's disease. This scoping review aims to map the available scientific evidence on the effect of pranayama interventions for Parkinson's disease and identify the potential gaps in the literature.\nA literature search will be conducted in major databases (JBI evidence synthesis, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, including Cochrane Complimentary Medicine, and Scopus) from 1990 to date. Relevant grey literature will be searched. Two independent reviewers will initially review the extracted articles and will be further adjudicated by two independent reviewers. Data management will be done using Rayyan software throughout the review. Data extracted will include specific details of the population, concept, context and study methods specific to the scoping review objectives. The extracted data will be presented in tabular/diagrammatic form, reporting on items aligning with the review objectives, such as details of the pranayama intervention and its clinical outcomes. A narrative summary will accompany the tabulated results, identifying the gaps in evidence and areas for future research.\nEthics approval is not required for this scoping review. The findings will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.\nProtocol Registration in Open Science Framework - https://osf.io/jdwga/?view_only=82aa5afd46974416a402fa1a0ac39fce.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of study was to explore family caregiver perspectives on work-life balance while caring for adults with Parkinson's disease.\nThe study was performed using a convergent mixed methods design and a revised adaptation of the Work-Life Conflict model. Caregivers completed surveys followed by semistructured interviews ( n = 40).\nWork-life balance is bidirectionally influenced by time, stress, and behavior across the working and caregiving role. Caregiver burden was offset by higher decision latitude at work. Supervisor support and coworker support were positively associated with work-life balance. Barriers included physical, emotional, and financial stress, and speech and cognitive changes of the care recipient.\nThe results of this study identify the influence of work-life imbalance on caregiver burden and stress, and generate discussion of potential solutions that optimize well-being and health of this working population.",

    "abstract": "Herein, we review the literature on Parkinson's disease (PD) management and summarize the progress in medical, surgical, and assisted therapeutic modalities for motor and non-motor symptoms. A thorough search strategy was implemented to retrieve all relevant articles and identify the best evidence from different databases including Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Evidence-Based Medicine reviews from the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. Multiple terms, such as Parkinson, tremor, predominant, Parkinson management, deep brain stimulation, LCIG, ablative surgery for PD, medical management of PD, and assistive devices for PD, were used for screening. A total of 160 articles were gathered; irrelevant papers and older articles were excluded. After initial exclusion, we had 140 articles to review from 1980 to 2022. Five articles were found to be duplicated, and another five articles were excluded as they did not have additional information on management that could be used in this research paper. We found that management options and assistive devices for PD are improving, with new therapeutic options emerging every year. Medical therapy is the most common therapy as it corrects dopamine deficiency which is the main factor implicated in PD; other surgical treatment options are available in cases of chronic progressive disease course. This article adds significant value to the literature as it includes the history and the role of most Parkinson's disease management options.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, primarily due to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Factors contributing to this neuronal degeneration include mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuronal excitotoxicity. Despite extensive research, the exact etiology of PD remains unclear, with both genetic and environmental factors playing significant roles. Given the increasing prevalence of PD, particularly in aging populations, effective preventive and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Emerging research suggests that dietary interventions might offer promising approaches to managing PD progression. This literature review examines various dietary interventions that differ in their composition and mechanisms of action, including the Mediterranean, vegan, carnivore, paleo, and ketogenic diets, and their potential neuroprotective effects. By evaluating the current evidence, this review aims to identify dietary strategies that may improve the quality of life for individuals with PD. Additionally, it explores the underlying mechanisms through which diet may influence PD pathophysiology, thus providing insights into how nutritional modifications can be integrated into holistic management plans for the disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) remains incurable and its prevalence is increasing as the population ages. Although physical activity is considered a therapeutic treatment to slow the progression of the disease, it is considered to be an effective non-pharmacological adjuvant to medication to improve the symptom management.\nThe training program was offered for all the participants (N = 50) in three non-consecutive sessions per week for 60 minutes and a total duration of 12 to 16 months. Each session is composed of warming up, adapted boxing training exercises, muscle building and resistance exercises, and returning to calm. For the measurement of physical capacities, the following tests were administered: the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (FAB), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and the 30-second chair lift test (TLC30). With regard to quality of life, the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire of 39 questions (PDQ-39) was used. The participants (age range from 60 to 80 years) were divided following the results of the Parkinson disease severity (Questionnaire Hoehn and Yahr; H&Y) into two groups (H&Y 1-2: mild to moderate symptoms; H&Y 3-4: moderate to severe symptoms).\nThe aim of this research was to assess the long-term effects (12 to 16 months) of a community-wide adapted physical program on the physical capacity and quality of life of people with Parkinson disease.\nIn view of the results, adapted physical training appears to be beneficial for physical capacity and life quality and considered to be an important approch for maintaining the physical and mental capacities and slowing down the proression of neurodegenrative disease.",

    "abstract": "Prasinezumab was shown to potentially delay motor progression in individuals with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) who were either treatment-na\u00efve or on monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor (MAO-Bi) therapy in the PASADENA study. We report the rationale, design, and baseline patient characteristics of the PADOVA study, designed to evaluate prasinezumab in an early-stage PD population receiving standard-of-care (SOC) symptomatic medications.\nPADOVA (NCT04777331) is a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, in which individuals with early-stage PD on SOC stable symptomatic monotherapy (levodopa or MAO-Bi) receive intravenous prasinezumab 1500\u00a0mg every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint is time to confirmed motor progression, defined as \u22655 points increase from baseline on the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III in practically defined OFF-medication state.\n586 participants were enrolled between May 5th, 2021 and March 22nd, 2023. At baseline, 74.2\u00a0% and 25.8\u00a0% of participants were receiving levodopa and MAO-Bi, respectively. Mean age was 64.2 years and 63.5\u00a0% were male. Mean time from diagnosis was 18.6 months, 85\u00a0% of participants were in Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) Stage 2, and mean MDS-UPDRS Part III score was 24.5. Compared with the PASADENA population, PADOVA participants were older (\u223c5 years), with longer disease duration (\u223c8 months), and slightly more advanced based on H&Y stage (10\u00a0% more in Stage 2) and MDS-UPDRS Part III (\u223c3 points more).\nPADOVA has successfully recruited an early-stage PD population to test the effect of prasinezumab when added to background SOC.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson disease (PD). It is episodic and variable in nature, making assessment difficult. Wearable sensors used in conjunction with specialized algorithms, such as our group's pFOG algorithm, provide objective data to better understand this phenomenon. While these methods are effective at detecting FOG retrospectively, more work is needed. The purpose of this paper is to explore how the existing pFOG algorithm can be refined to improve the detection and prediction of FOG. To accomplish this goal, previously collected data were utilized to assess the prediction ability of the current algorithm, the potency of each FOG assessment task(s) for eliciting FOG, and the maintenance of detection accuracy when modifying the sampling rate. Results illustrate that the algorithm was able to predict upcoming FOG episodes, but false positive rates were high. The Go Out and Turn-Dual Task was most potent for eliciting FOG, and the 360-Dual Task elicited the longest duration of FOG. The detection accuracy of the pFOG algorithm was maintained at a sampling rate of 60 Hz but significantly worse at 30 Hz. This work is an important step in refining the pFOG algorithm for improved clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "One of the most pressing challenges facing society today is the rising prevalence of physical and cognitive frailty. This geriatric condition makes older adults more vulnerable to disability, illness, and a heightened risk of mortality. In this scenario, Parkinson's disease (PD) and geriatric frailty, which share several common characteristics, are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for innovative strategies. Nutraceuticals are naturally occurring bioactive compounds contained in foods, offering health benefits over and above essential nutrition. By examining the literature from the past decade, this review highlights how nutraceuticals can act as complementary therapies, addressing key processes, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and neuroprotection. Notably, the antioxidant action of nutraceuticals appears particularly beneficial in regard to PD and geriatric frailty. For instance, antioxidant-rich nutraceuticals may mitigate the oxidative damage linked to levodopa therapy in PD, potentially reducing the side effects and enhancing treatment sustainability. Similarly, the antioxidant effects of nutraceuticals may amplify the benefits of physical activity, enhancing muscle function, cognitive health, and resilience, thereby reducing the risk of frailty. This review proposes a holistic approach integrating nutraceuticals with exercise, pharmacotherapy, and lifestyle adjustments. It promises to transform the management of ARD, prolong life, and improve the quality of life and well-being of older people.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) affects more than 6 million people worldwide. Its accurate diagnosis and monitoring are key factors to reduce its economic burden. Typical approaches consider either speech signals or video recordings of the face to automatically model abnormal patterns in PD patients.\nThis paper introduces, for the first time, a new methodology that performs the synchronous fusion of information extracted from speech recordings and their corresponding videos of lip movement, namely the bimodal approach.\nOur results indicate that the introduced method is more accurate and suitable than unimodal approaches or classical asynchronous approaches that combine both sources of information but do not incorporate the underlying temporal information.\nThis study demonstrates that using a synchronous fusion strategy with concatenated projections based on attention mechanisms, i.e., speech-to-lips and lips-to-speech, exceeds previous results reported in the literature. Complementary information between lip movement and speech production is confirmed when advanced fusion strategies are employed. Finally, multimodal approaches, combining visual and speech signals, showed great potential to improve PD classification, generating more confident and robust models for clinical diagnostic support.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NGD) encompass a range of progressive neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), characterised by the gradual deterioration of neuronal structure and function. This degeneration manifests as cognitive decline, movement impairment, and dementia. Our focus in this investigation is on PD, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, leading to motor disturbances. Early detection of PD is paramount for enhancing quality of life through timely intervention and tailored treatment. However, the subtle nature of initial symptoms, like slow movements, tremors, muscle rigidity, and psychological changes, often reduce daily task performance and complicate early diagnosis.\nTo assist medical professionals in timely diagnosis of PD, we introduce a cutting-edge Multimodal Diagnosis framework (PMMD). Based on deep learning techniques, the PMMD framework integrates imaging, handwriting, drawing, and clinical data to accurately detect PD. Notably, it incorporates cross-modal attention, a methodology previously unexplored within the area, which facilitates the modelling of interactions between different data modalities.\nThe proposed method exhibited an accuracy of 96% on the independent tests set. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art models, along with an in-depth exploration of attention mechanisms, highlights the efficacy of PMMD in PD classification.\nThe obtained results highlight exciting new prospects for the use of handwriting as a biomarker, along with other information, for optimal model performance. PMMD's success in integrating diverse data sources through cross-modal attention underscores its potential as a robust diagnostic decision support tool for accurately diagnosing PD.",

    "abstract": "The \u03b1-synuclein seed amplification assay (\u03b1Syn-SAA) sensitively detects Lewy pathology, the amyloid state of \u03b1-synuclein, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The \u03b1Syn-SAA harnesses the physics of seeding, whereby a superconcentrated solution of recombinant \u03b1-synuclein lowers the thermodynamic threshold (nucleation barrier) for aggregated \u03b1-synuclein to act as a nucleation catalyst (\"seed\") to trigger the precipitation (nucleation) of monomeric \u03b1-synuclein into pathology. This laboratory setup increases the signal for identifying a catalyst if one is present in the tissue examined. The result is binary: positive, meaning precipitation occurred, and a catalyst is present, or negative, meaning no precipitation, therefore no catalyst. Since protein precipitation via seeding can only occur at a concentration many-fold higher than the human brain, laboratory-elicited seeding does not mean human brain seeding. We suggest that a positive \u03b1Syn-SAA reveals the presence of pathological \u03b1-synuclein but not the underlying etiology for the precipitation of monomeric \u03b1-synuclein into its pathological form. Thus, a positive \u03b1Syn-SAA supports a clinical diagnosis of PD but cannot inform disease pathogenesis, ascertain severity, predict the rate of progression, define biology or biological subtypes, or monitor treatment response.",

    "abstract": "Hearing impairment is implicated as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (Parkinson's) incidence, with evidence suggesting that clinically diagnosed hearing loss increases Parkinson's risk 1.5-1.6 fold over 2-5 years follow up. However, the evidence is not unanimous with additional studies observing that self-reported hearing capabilities do not significantly influence Parkinson's incidence. Thus, additional cohort analyses that draw on alternative auditory measures are required to further corroborate the link between Parkinson's and hearing impairment.\nTo determine whether hearing impairment, estimated using a speech-in-noise test (the Digit Triplet Test, DTT), is a risk factor for Parkinson's incidence.\nThis was a pre-registered prospective cohort study using data from the UK Biobank. Data pertaining to 159,395 individuals, who underwent DTT testing and were free from Parkinson's at the point of assessment, were analysed. A Cox Proportional Hazard model, controlling for age, sex and educational attainment was conducted.\nDuring a median follow up of 14.24 years, 810 cases of probable Parkinson's were observed. The risk of incident Parkinson's increased with baseline hearing impairment [hazard ratio: 1.57 (95%CI: 1.018, 2.435; P\u00a0=\u00a0.041)], indicating 57\u00a0% increase in risk for every 10\u00a0dB increase in speech-reception threshold (SRT). However, when hearing impairment was categorised in accordance with UK Biobank SRT norms neither 'Insufficient' nor 'Poor' hearing significantly influenced Parkinson's risk compared to 'Normal' hearing.\nThe congruence of these findings with prior research further supports the existence of a relationship between hearing impairment and Parkinson's incidence.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor and non-motor features. There are several proposed clinical markers to define disease severity. However, if rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is associated with worse prognosis of both motor and non-motor findings in PD is unknown.\nTo determine whether RBD is a marker of PD clinical severity.\nWe cross-sectionally compared patients according to the presence of RBD and used Hoehn Yahr, Schwab and England (ADL), MDS-UPDRS, brain magnetic resonance, polysomnography and autonomic reactivity tests to evaluate PD stage and disability. Pairwise comparisons and regression techniques were used to investigate the association of PD clinical markers with RBD.\nWe enrolled 120 PD patients. RBD was present in 46\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a055; median age 65 years; 67\u00a0% male), who were compared to PD patients without RBD (n\u00a0=\u00a065, median age 62 years, 64\u00a0% male). There was also a healthy control group comprising 48 subjects (median age 57 years, 54\u00a0% male). Comparing PD patients with and without RBD, RBD was associated with higher MDS-UPDRS Part II scores [15(11-21) x 12(7-16), p\u00a0=\u00a00.02], higher frequency of abnormal gait (43,6\u00a0% x 21,5\u00a0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), greater use of walking aids (21,8\u00a0% x 4,6\u00a0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), greater dysautonomia (56,4\u00a0% x 47,7\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and osteoporosis [PR 1,64(1.37-1.96), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and lower ADL scores [80(80-90) x 90(80-90); p\u00a0=\u00a00.002], CONCLUSION: The presence of RBD in PD patients was associated with indirect indicators of motor impairment, lower independence in ADL, possibly a higher frequency of dysautonomia and with a higher frequency of osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "DJ-1 is a protein whose mutation causes rare heritable forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and is of interest as a target for treating PD and other disorders. This work used high performance affinity microcolumns to screen and examine the binding of small molecules to DJ-1, as could be used to develop new therapeutics or to study the role of DJ-1 in PD. Non-covalent entrapment was used to place microgram quantities of DJ-1 in an unmodified form within microcolumns, which were then used in multiple studies to analyze binding by model compounds and possible drug candidates to DJ-1.\nSeveral factors were examined in optimizing the entrapment method, including the addition of a reducing agent to maintain a reduced active site cysteine residue in DJ-1, the concentration of DJ-1 employed, and the entrapment times. Isatin was used as a known binding agent (dissociation constant, \u223c2.0\u00a0\u03bcM) and probe for DJ-1 activity. This compound gave good retention on 2.0\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.1\u00a0mm inner diameter DJ-1 microcolumns made under the final entrapment conditions, with a typical retention factor of 14 and elution in \u223c8\u00a0min at 0.50\u00a0mL/min. These DJ-1 microcolumns were used to evaluate the binding of small molecules that were selected in silico to bind or not to bind DJ-1. A compound predicted to have good binding with DJ-1 gave a retention factor of 122, an elution time of \u223c15\u00a0min at 0.50\u00a0mL/min, and an estimated dissociation constant for this protein of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM.\nThese chromatographic tools can be used in future work to screen additional possible binding agents for DJ-1 or adapted for examining drug candidates for other proteins. This work represents the first time protein entrapment has been deployed with DJ-1, and it is the first experimental confirmation of binding to DJ-1 by a small lead compound selected in silico.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity dystonia (LED) is a frequent complication of Parkinson disease (PD). Treatment with botulinum neurotoxinA (BoNTA) over 8\u00a0years was retrospectively reviewed.Cases14 patients with LED received an average of 3.86 injections (1-8). Mean interval was 40\u00a0weeks (median of 25). Average dose was 182 units. Injections were well-tolerated. Using a 6 point scale, there was an average of 3.37 point improvement in disability after each session, with average duration of 28.56\u00a0weeks (median 11\u00a0weeks). After mean follow-up of 101\u00a0weeks, disabling dystonia was not present in 11 of 14 patients.\nBotulinum toxin is safe and effective in PD related LED. Good response to the first two injection sessions was significantly associated with greater likelihood of long-term response. Assertive BoNTA dosing may lead to sustained remission of symptoms. As natural history of LED in PD has not been reported, prospective placebo-controlled studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to compare the effects of Tai Chi, yoga, and resistance training on balance function in healthy elderly individuals and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Given the well-documented benefits of these three exercise types in enhancing balance and motor function, it is crucial to assess their differential impacts.\nA comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases through December 2023. Articles were selected based on predefined criteria, screened, and evaluated by two independent researchers who also extracted study characteristics. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome measures were the Berg Balance Scale and the Timed Up and Go test, while the secondary measure was the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III. A random effects model was employed, and heterogeneity was measured using the \nOf the 21 studies reviewed, 9 focused on healthy older adults and 12 targeted individuals with PD. The meta-analysis showed that Tai Chi, yoga, and resistance training significantly improved balance in patients with PD compared to control groups (\nComparative analyses demonstrate that Tai Chi, yoga, and resistance training significantly enhance balance and motor function. Specifically, resistance training markedly improves dynamic balance in healthy elderly individuals, while Tai Chi shows pronounced improvements in motor function and balance for PD patients.

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has been used in research and clinical practice in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD), potentially enhancing physiotherapy. Adverse events (AEs) associated with VR applications in PD have been poorly explored. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare two 12-week interventions using physiotherapy and immersive VR, and analyzed the frequency and type of AEs occurring in 30 people with PD. We reported 144 AEs (8.4% of the sessions), predominantly classified as mild and unrelated to the interventions. Two were serious AEs, one leading to study discontinuation. Notably, discomfort/pain, motor fluctuations, and falls were the most frequently reported, accounting for 63% of the total AEs. Five falls were definitely associated with the 'sense of presence' provided by the fully immersive VR system, which underscores the necessity for careful game selection when designing interventions for PD. Motor fluctuations may have been associated with various factors, which merit further investigation. We also explored the role of SSQ as a measure of cybersickness in PD. In conclusion, it is important to closely monitor and characterize AEs to ensure safety and efficacy in clinical practice as AEs may be more common than previously recognized in VR interventions in PD.",

    "abstract": "Mobility tasks like the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), cognitive TUG (cogTUG), and walking with turns provide insights into the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on motor control, balance, and cognitive function. We assess the test-retest reliability of these tasks in 262 PD participants and 50 controls by evaluating machine learning models based on wearable-sensor-derived measures and statistical metrics. This evaluation examines total duration, subtask duration, and other quantitative measures across two trials. We show that the diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing PD from controls decreases by a mean of 1.8% between the first and the second trial, suggesting that task repetition may not be necessary for accurate diagnosis. Although the total duration remains relatively consistent between trials (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.62 to 0.95), greater variability is seen in subtask duration and sensor-derived measures, reflected in machine learning performance and statistical differences. Our findings also show that this variability differs not only between controls and PD participants but also among groups with varying levels of PD severity, indicating the need to consider population characteristics. Relying solely on total task duration and conventional statistical metrics to gauge the reliability of mobility tasks may fail to reveal nuanced variations in movement.",

One of the therapeutic options for restoring striatal dopamine levels is the administration of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa). However, Parkinson's disease patients on long-term L-Dopa therapy often experience motor complications, such as dyskinesias. L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) manifest as abnormal involuntary movements and are produced by elevated striatal dopamine levels, which lead to increased activity of the basal ganglia direct striato-nigral pathway.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurological disorder affecting approximately 10 million people worldwide, with prevalence expected to rise as the global population ages. It is characterized by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, and gait disturbances, as well as non-motor symptoms including olfactory disturbances, sleep disorders, and depression. Currently, no cure exists for PD, and most available therapies focus on symptom alleviation. This dopamine deficiency impairs motor control, and since dopamine itself cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the precursor L-Dopa is commonly used in treatment. L-Dopa is administered with enzyme inhibitors to prevent premature conversion outside the brain, allowing it to cross the BBB and convert to dopamine within the central nervous system. Although these therapies have improved symptom management, recent research has revealed additional molecular factors in PD pathology, such as \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lysosomal abnormalities, contributing to its complexity. These discoveries open up possibilities for neuroprotective therapies that could slow disease progression. In this review, we categorize PD therapeutic targets into two main groups: currently used therapies and targets under active research. We also introduce promising small-molecule compounds studied between 2019 and 2023, which may represent future treatment options. By examining both established and emerging targets, we aim to highlight effective strategies and potential directions for future drug development in Parkinson's disease therapy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregation into Lewy bodies in the neurons. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is considered the most suited source for investigating PD pathogenesis and identifying biomarkers. While microRNA (miRNA) profiling can aid in the investigation of post-transcriptional regulation in neurodegenerative diseases, information on miRNAs in the CSF of patients with PD remains limited. This review combines miRNA analysis with proteomic profiling to explore the collective impact of CSF miRNAs on the neurodegenerative mechanisms in PD. We constructed separate networks for altered miRNAs and proteomes using a bioinformatics method. Altered miRNAs were poorly linked to biological functions owing to limited information; however, changes in protein expression were strongly associated with biological functions. Subsequently, the networks were integrated for further analysis. In silico prediction from the integrated network revealed relationships between miRNAs and proteins, highlighting increased reactive oxygen species generation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration and suppressed ATP synthesis, mitochondrial function, and neurotransmitter release in PD. The approach suggests the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers for critical mechanisms underlying PD. The combined strategy could enhance our understanding of the complex biochemical networks of miRNAs in PD and support the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-leading cause of death among neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting around 2% of the population. It is expected that the incidence of PD will exceed 12 million by 2040. Meanwhile, there is a recognized difference in the phenotypical expression of the disease and response to treatment between men and women. Men have twice the incidence of PD compared to women, who have a late onset and worse prognosis that is usually associated with menopause. In addition, the incidence of PD in women is associated with the cumulative estrogen levels in their bodies. These differences are suggested to be due to the protective effect of estrogen on the brain, which cannot be given in clinical practice to improve the symptoms of the disease because of its peripheral side effects, causing cancer in both males and females in addition to the feminizing effect it has on males. As PD pathophysiology involves alteration in the expression levels of multiple LncRNAs, including metastatic-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), and as estrogen has been illustrated to control the expression of MALAT1 in multiple conditions, it is worth investigating the estrogen-MALAT1 interaction in Parkinson's disease to mimic its protective effect on the brain while avoiding its peripheral side effects. The following literature review suggests the potential regulation of MALAT1 by estrogen in PD, which would enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, improving the development of more tailored and effective treatments.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Spiral drawing analysis has emerged as a non-invasive tool to detect early motor impairments associated with PD. This study examines the performance of hybrid deep learning and machine learning models in detecting PD using spiral drawings, with a focus on the impact of data augmentation techniques. We compare the accuracy of Vision Transformer (ViT) with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Residual Neural Networks (ResNet-50) with Logistic Regression, evaluating their performance on both augmented and non-augmented data. Our findings reveal that ViT with KNN, initially achieving 96.77% accuracy on unaugmented data, experienced a notable decline across all augmentation techniques, suggesting it relies heavily on global patterns in spiral drawings. In contrast, ResNet-50 with Logistic Regression showed consistent improvement with data augmentation, reaching 93.55% accuracy when rotation and flipping techniques were applied. These results highlight that hybrid models respond differently to augmentation, and careful selection of augmentation strategies is necessary for optimizing model performance. Our study provides important insights into the development of reliable diagnostic tools for early PD detection, emphasizing the need for appropriate augmentation techniques in medical image analysis.",

    "abstract": "Despite many years of research into the complex neurobiology of Parkinson's disease, the precise aetiology cannot be pinpointed down to one causative agent but rather a multitude of mechanisms. Current treatment options can alleviate symptomsbut only slightly slow down the progression and not cure the disease and its underlying causes. Factors that play a role in causing the debilitating neurodegenerative psycho-motoric symptoms include genetic alterations, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, general inflammation, neurotoxins, iron toxicity, environmental influences, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent findings suggest that the characteristic abnormal protein aggregation of alpha-synuclein and destruction of substantia nigra neurons might be due to mitochondrial dysfunction related to disturbances in lipid and glucose metabolism along with insulin resistance. The latter mechanism of action might be mediated by insulin receptor substrate docking to proteins that are involved in neuronal survival and signaling related to cell destruction. The increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus endorses a connection between metabolic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Here, we explore and highlight the potential role of glycolipid cellular insults in the pathophysiology of the disorder, opening up new promising avenues for the treatment of PD. Thus, antidiabetic drugs may be employed as neuromodulators to hinder the progression of the disorder.",

    "abstract": "Staging Parkinson's disease (PD) with a novel simple classification called MNCD, based on four axes (Motor; Non-motor; Cognition; Dependency) and five stages, correlated with disease severity, patients' quality of life and caregivers' strain and burden. Our aim was to apply the MNCD classification in advanced PD patients treated with device-aided therapy (DAT).\nA multicenter observational retrospective study of the first patients to start the levodopa-entacapone-carbidopa intestinal gel (LECIG) in Spain was performed (LECIPARK study). The MNCD total score (from 0 to 12) and MNCD stages (from 1 to 5) were collected by the neurologist at V0 (before starting LECIG) and V2 (follow-up visit). Wilcoxon's signed rank and Marginal Homogeneity tests were applied to compare changes from V0 to V2.\nSixty-seven PD patients (58.2% males; 69.9 \u00b1 9.3 years old) with a mean disease duration of 14.4 \u00b1 6.5 years were included. The mean treatment duration (V2) was 172.9 \u00b1 105.2 days. At V0, patients were classified as in stage 2 (35.8%), 3 (46.3%) or 4 (17.9%). The frequency of patients in stage 4 decreased to 9% at V2 (\nThe MNCD classification could be useful to classify advanced PD patients and to monitor the response to a DAT.",

    "abstract": "Randomized clinical trials should be complemented with data from real-world studies. We report our long-term experience with safinamide in a movement disorders unit.\nThis retrospective study included patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with safinamide in our unit from February 2016 to May 2022 under routine clinical practice. Assessments included the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage, unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) part III score, levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), LEDD for dopamine agonists, and safinamide treatment discontinuation.\nWe included 180 patients with a median age of 74 years (IQR 11), and the majority (90.6%) had an HY stage of \u22642. After a median follow-up of 40 months (IQR 34), 14 patients discontinued treatment with safinamide (7.8%, 95% CI 4.7 to 12.6). Among the 166 patients who remained on safinamide, the UPDRS III score was stable (10 (IQR 9) vs. 9 (IQR 13), \nOur results support the long-term effectiveness and tolerability of safinamide in patients with PD in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized, in addition to the well-recognized motor disturbances, by a complex interplay between cognitive and psychiatric manifestations. We dissect the complex landscape of PD-related psychiatric symptoms, taking into account the impact of functional neurological disorders, somatic delusions, impulse control disorders, and conditions within the bipolar spectrum. The newer entities of somatoform and functional neurological disorders, as well as preexisting bipolar spectrum disorders, are analyzed in detail. Moreover, we emphasize the need for a holistic understanding of PD, wherein the cognitive and psychiatric dimensions are valued alongside motor symptoms. Such an approach aims to facilitate early detection and personalized interventions, and enhance the overall quality of life for individuals suffering from this neurodegenerative disorder.",

    "abstract": "The involvement of the circadian system in the etiology and treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is becoming an increasingly important topic. The prodromal symptoms of PD include insomnia, fatigue, depression and sleep disturbance which herald the onset of the primary symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity while robbing patients of their quality of life. Light treatment (LT) has been implemented for modifying circadian function in PD but few studies have examined its use in a protracted term that characterizes PD itself.\nThe present exploratory study monitors the effect of LT over a 10 year course of PD in the context of ongoing circadian function.\nImprovement in circadian based symptoms were seen soon after LT commenced and continued for the duration of the study. Improvement in motor function was more subtle and was not distinguishable until 1.2 years after commencing treatment. Improvement in most motor and prodromal symptoms remained in steady state for the duration of the study as long as patients were compliant with daily use.\nThe sequence of improvement in prodromal symptoms and motor function seen here parallels the slow, incremental repair process mimicking the protracted degenerative sequelae of PD that extends over decades. This process also emulates the slow incremental improvement characterizing the reparative course seen with circadian symptoms in other disorders that improve with LT. Recent findings from epidemiological work suggest that early disruption of circadian rhythmicity is associated with increased risk of PD and the present findings are consistent with that hypothesis. It is concluded that intervening in circadian function with LT presents a minimally invasive method that is compatible with internal timing that slows the degenerative process of PD.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) may lead to disabling incontrollable movements known as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been applied as non-invasive therapy to ameliorate motor symptoms and dyskinesias in PD treatment. Recent studies have shown that TMS-induced motor effects might be related to dopaminergic system modulation. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects of TMS are not fully understood.\nTo assess the expression of FosB and c-Fos in dopamine-D1 receptor-containing cells of dyskinetic rats and to analyze the effect of TMS on dyskinetic behavior and its histological marker (FosB).\nWe investigated the outcome of TMS on cellular activation, using c-Fos immunoreactivity, on D1 receptor-positive (D1R+) cells into the motor cortex and striatum of dyskinetic (\nTMS reduces c-Fos expression in D1R+cells into the motor cortex and striatum. Moreover, TMS treatment attenuated dyskinesias, along with a low stratal FosB expression.\nThe current study shows that TMS depressed FosB and c-Fos expression in D1R+ cells of the dorsal striatum and motor cortex, in accordance with previous evidence of its capacity to modulate the dopaminergic system, thus suggesting a mechanism by which TMS may mitigate dyskinesias. Additionally, our observations highlight the potential therapeutic effect of TMS on dyskinesias in a PD model.",

Electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PEDro, LILACS and SciELO databases and gray literature sources. Experimental studies that investigated the effects of speed-based interventions on bradykinesia in individuals with PD will be considered. Two independent reviewers will screen the studies, extract data and assess risk of bias using Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and ROBINS-I (\"Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies-of Interventions\"). Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) will be used to assed the quality of evidence.\nThis systematic review will offer information regarding which types of speed-based interventions have been investigated for reducing bradykinesia in individuals with PD. This information may be important for clinical decision making and will help identify gaps in the literature that may be useful for the definition of future research objectives and the planning of new trials.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects over 1% of population over age 60. It is defined by motor and nonmotor symptoms including a spectrum of cognitive impairments known as Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Currently, the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for PDD is rivastigmine, which inhibits acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase increasing the level of acetylcholine in the brain. Due to its limited efficacy and side effect profile, rivastigmine is often not prescribed, leaving patients with no treatment options. PD has several derangements in neurotransmitter pathways (dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway, kynurenine pathway (KP), acetylcholine, \u03b17 nicotinic receptor, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors) and rivastigmine is only partially effective as it only targets one pathway. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a metabolite of tryptophan metabolism, affects the pathophysiology of PDD in multiple ways. Both galantamine (\u03b17 nicotinic receptor) and memantine (antagonist of the NMDA subtype of the glutamate receptor) are KYNA modulators. When used in combination, they target multiple pathways. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with each drug alone for PD have failed, the combination of galantamine and memantine has demonstrated a synergistic effect on cognitive enhancement in animal models. It has therapeutic potential that has not been adequately assessed, warranting future randomized controlled trials. In this review, we summarize the KYNA-centric model for PD pathophysiology and discuss how this treatment combination is promising in improving cognitive function in patients with PDD through its action on KYNA.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of healthy mitochondria is essential for neuronal survival and relies upon mitochondrial quality control pathways involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). Mitochondrial dysfunction is critically implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), a brain disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Consequently, impaired mitochondrial quality control may play a key role in PD pathology. This is affirmed by work indicating that genes such as PRKN and PINK1, which participate in multiple mitochondrial processes, harbor PD-associated mutations. Furthermore, mitochondrial complex-I-inhibiting toxins like MPTP and rotenone are known to cause Parkinson-like symptoms. At the heart of PD is alpha-synuclein (\u03b1S), a small synaptic protein that misfolds and aggregates to form the disease's hallmark Lewy bodies. The specific mechanisms through which aggregated \u03b1S exerts its neurotoxicity are still unknown; however, given the vital role of both \u03b1S and mitochondria to PD, an understanding of how \u03b1S influences mitochondrial maintenance may be essential to elucidating PD pathogenesis and discovering future therapeutic targets. Here, the current knowledge of the relationship between \u03b1S and mitochondrial quality control pathways in PD is reviewed, highlighting recent findings regarding \u03b1S effects on mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, and autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Pathological significance of interaction of Synphilin-1 with mutated alpha-synuclein is well known to have serious consequences in causing the formation of inclusion bodies that are linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). Information extracted so far pointed out that specific mutations, A53T, A30P, and E46K, in alpha-synuclein promote such interactions. However, a detailed structural study of this interaction is pending due to the unavailability of the complete structures of the large protein Synphilin-1 of chain length 919 residues and the mutated alpha-synuclein having all the reported specific mutations so far. In this study, a semi-automatic pipeline-based meta-predictor, AlphaLarge, is created to predict high-fidelity structures of large proteins like Synphilin-1 given the limitations of the existing protocols. AlphaLarge recruits a novel augmented AlphaFold model that uses a divide and conquer based strategy on the foundation of a self-sourced template dataset to choose the best structure model through their standard validations. The structure models were re-validated by a Protein Mediated Interaction Analysis (PMIA) formalism that uses the existing structurally relevant information of these proteins. For the training dataset, the new method, AlphaLarge, performed reasonably better than AlphaFold. Also, the new residue- and domain-based structural details of interactions of resultant best structure models of Synphilin-1 and both wild and mutated alpha-synuclein are extracted using PMIA. This result paves the way for better screening of target specific drugs to control the progression of PD, in particular, and research on any kind of pathophysiology involving large proteins of unknown structures, in general.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is considered one of the most frequent neurological diseases in the world. There is a need to study the early and efficient biomarkers of Parkinson's, such as changes in structural disorders like DNA/chromatin, especially at the subcellular level in the human brain. We used two techniques, Partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR), to detect the changes in structural disorder in the human brain tissue samples. It was observed from the PWS experiment that there was an increase in structural disorder in Parkinson's disease tissues/cells when compared to normal tissues/cells using mesoscopic light transport theory. Furthermore, the IPR experiment also showed DNA/chromatin structural alterations that have the same trend and support the PWS results. The increase in mass density in the nuclei components, such as DNA/chromatin, can be linked to the aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra of the brain. This protein deposition is considered a significant cause of neuronal death in the brains of PD patients. We also did a histological analysis of brain tissues, which supports our results from dual photonics techniques. The results show that this dual technique is a powerful approach to detect the changes. Our results highlight the potential of the parameter, related to the structural disorder strength, as an efficient biomarker for PD progress, paving the way for research into early disease detection.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Managing PD requires accurate assessment of motor and non-motor symptoms, often complicated by the subjectivity in symptom reporting and the limited availability of neurologists. To address these challenges, commercial wearable devices have emerged to continuously monitor PD symptoms outside the clinical setting. The main devices include PKG\u2122, Kinesia 360\u2122, Kinesia U\u2122, PDMonitor\u2122, and STAT-ON\u2122. These devices utilize advanced technologies such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and specific algorithms to provide objective data on motor symptoms like tremors, dyskinesia, and bradykinesia. Despite their potential, the adoption of these devices is limited due to concerns about their accuracy, complexity of use, and lack of independent validation. The correlation between these devices' measurements and traditional clinical observations varies, and patient usability and adherence remain critical areas for improvement. To optimize their utility and improve patient outcomes, it is essential to conduct validation and usability studies with a sufficient number of patients, develop standardized protocols, and ensure integration with hospital information systems.",

    "abstract": "Interest in wearable device use in Parkinson's disease (PD) has grown rapidly with many compelling studies supporting diagnostic and therapeutic uses. Concurrently, consumer devices have proliferated and their role in health and wellness has expanded. However, incorporation of consumer and medical wearable devices into medical care has in our experience been limited.\nWe sought to assess the current state of consumer and medical wearable device use among those with PD and to understand the factors impacting their rate of use.\nAn anonymous online survey of individuals with PD in the US was conducted from July 9th, 2023, to Jan 8th, 2024, with 298 completed responses collected.\nGreater than 90% of respondents were interested in new technologies with 67% having had experiences with consumer wearable devices. Only 24% were using consumer devices for disease management and many functions were not fully utilized. Medical wearable device use was very limited with only 8% having used a device. Users of both consumer and medical wearables generally reported low barriers to use despite continued strong perceptions on the importance of cost, impact on care, comfort, and other factors.\nThis study demonstrates that for the clinical management of PD there is limited use of wearable devices even among individuals who are motivated and experienced with consumer wearable device use. Additionally, it is suggested that substantial barriers to medical wearable use are likely originating from the provider and/or systemic level.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by muscle stiffness, bradykinesia, and balance disorders, significantly impairing the quality of life for affected patients. While motion pose estimation and gait analysis can aid in early diagnosis and timely intervention, clinical practice currently lacks objective and accurate tools for gait analysis.\nThis study proposes a multi-level 3D pose estimation framework for PD patients, integrating monocular video with Transformer and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) techniques. Gait temporal and spatial parameters were extracted and verified for 59 healthy elderly and PD patients, and an early prediction model for PD patients was established.\nThe repeatability of the gait parameters showed strong consistency, with most of the estimated parameters yielding an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) greater than 0.70. Furthermore, these parameters exhibited a high correlation with VICON and ATMI results (\nThe proposed 3D pose estimation method demonstrates high reliability and effectiveness in providing accurate 3D human pose parameters, with strong potential for early prediction of PD.\nThis markerless method offers significant advantages in terms of low cost, portability, and ease of use, positioning it as a promising tool for monitoring and screening PD patients in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning approaches including deep learning models have shown promising performance in the automatic detection of Parkinson's disease. These approaches rely on different types of data with voice recordings being the most used due to the convenient and non-invasive nature of data acquisition. Our group has successfully developed a novel approach that uses convolutional neural network with transfer learning to analyze spectrogram images of the sustained vowel /a/ to identify people with Parkinson's disease. We tested this approach by collecting a dataset of voice recordings via telephone lines, which have limited bandwidth. This study builds upon our prior results in two major ways: First, we tested the performance of our approach on a larger voice dataset recorded using smartphones with wide bandwidth. Our results show comparable performance between two datasets generated using different recording platforms where we report differences in most important features resulting from the limited bandwidth of telephonic lines. Second, we compared the classification performance achieved using linear-scale and mel-scale spectrogram images and showed a small but statistically significant gain using mel-scale spectrograms. The convolutional neural network with transfer learning approach showed superior performance against conventional machine learning methods that collapse measurements across time to generate feature vectors.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. While motor symptoms such as rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia/akinesia, and postural instability are well-recognized, non-motor symptoms including cognitive decline, depression, and anxiety also significantly impact patients' quality of life. Preclinical research utilizing animal models has been instrumental in understanding PD pathophysiology and exploring therapeutic interventions. Various approaches, including genetic manipulations and toxin-induced insults, aim to recapitulate both motor and non-motor aspects of PD in animal models. However, no single model fully replicates the complex spectrum of PD symptoms. Behavioral assessments play a crucial role in evaluating motor impairments in PD animal models, focusing on the manifestation of Parkinsonian motor phenotype. These assessments encompass locomotor activities, motor behavior abnormalities, and induced rotational behavior. Similarly, non-motor features are assessed through tests evaluating behavioral alterations such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Although numerous animal models of PD have been developed, including non-human primates and both mammalian and non-mammalian species, this review focuses on motor and non-motor testing methodologies in rodent models, which are the most commonly used. Emphasizing genetic and toxin-induced PD models in mice and rats, we highlight key testing strategies and the significance of each method in addressing specific research questions and interpreting experimental data. By providing a comprehensive overview of these testing approaches, this review aims to advance understanding and foster progress in PD research.",

    "abstract": "As the number of Parkinson's patients is expected to increase with the growth of the aging population there is a growing need to identify new diagnostic markers that can be used cheaply and routinely to monitor the population, stratify patients towards treatment paths and provide new therapeutic leads. Genetic predisposition and familial forms account for only around 10% of PD cases [1] leaving a large fraction of the population with minimal effective markers for identifying high risk individuals. The establishment of population-wide omics and longitudinal health monitoring studies provides an opportunity to apply machine learning approaches on these unbiased cohorts to identify novel PD markers. Here we present the application of three machine learning models to identify protein plasma biomarkers of PD using plasma proteomics measurements from 43,408 UK Biobank subjects as the training and test set and an additional 103 samples from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) as external validation. We identified a group of highly predictive plasma protein markers including known markers such as DDC and CALB2 as well as new markers involved in the JAK-STAT, PI3K-AKT pathways and hormonal signaling. We further demonstrate that these features are well correlated with UPDRS severity scores and stratify these to protective and adversarial features that potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Population aging has caused a rise in neurodegenerative diseases among which includes Parkinson's disease. However, in Chile, there is still little knowledge about how Parkinson's disease is associated with functionality in elderly people.\nto examine the association between Parkinson's disease and functionality in elderly people of Maip\u00fa, Metropolitan region, between the years 2017-2019.\nA quantitative study with an observational design was conducted. A sample of 4.843 elderly people (\u226565 years) enrolled in CESFAM Michelle Bachelet in Maip\u00fa was used. To examine the association between Parkinson's disease and functionality, we use logistic regression models adjusted by demographic, socioeconomic, and health variables.\nPeople with Parkinson's disease are 3.3 times more likely to experience functional limitation (p-value<0.001). At the same time, males (OR= 1.3; 95% CI 1,1-1,5; p-value<0.001), of old age (OR= 10; 95% CI 7,9-12,6; p-value<0.001, on people 85 years old) with low schooling (OR= 1,7) and belonging to A-B segment of FONASA (OR= 1,3) have more chances of having functional limitations.\nThe study shows a significant association between Parkinson's disease and functional limitations, supported by the literature. Although this study accounts for the specific reality of a territory, its results can be useful in designing strategies and interventions that could help improve the quality of life of people with Parkinson's disease and their families in other urban territories of the country.",

    "abstract": "The neural mechanisms underlying freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) have not been completely comprehended. Sensory-motor integration dysfunction was proposed as one of the contributing factors. Here, we investigated short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long-latency afferent inhibition (LAI), and analyzed their association with gait performance in FOG PD patients, to further validate the role of sensorimotor integration in the occurrence of FOG in PD.\nTwenty-five levodopa responsive-FOG PD patients (LR-FOG), fifteen levodopa unresponsive-FOG PD patients (LUR-FOG), twenty-eight PD patients without FOG (NO-FOG PD) and twenty-two healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. Clinical features such as PD motor symptoms, FOG severity and cognitive abilities were evaluated using clinical scales in subjects with PD. All participants underwent paired associative stimulation (PAS) to evaluate SAI and LAI in addition to regular input-output curve by transcranial magnetic stimulation. The performances of gait were assessed using a portable gait analyzing system in 10-meter timed Up and Go task. The correlations between the gait spatiotemporal parameters or the scores of FOG scale and the magnitudes of SAI or LAI were analyzed.\nCompared to HC and NO-FOG PD patients, SAI was decreased in FOG PD subgroups. LAI was also reduced in both LR-FOG PD and LUR-FOG PD in relative to HC; however, only LUR-FOG PD showed significant reduction of LAI in comparison to NO-FOG PD group. FOG PD patients showed poorer gait performance compared to HC and NO-FOG PD group. The reduction of SAI and LAI were correlated with the impaired gait spatiotemporal parameters or scores of FOG scale in PD with FOG.\nThe SAI and LAI were attenuated in PD patients with FOG, and the reduction of SAI or LAI were correlated to disturbed gait performance, indicating that sensory-motor integration dysfunction played a role in the development of FOG in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by fibrillar neuronal inclusions containing aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn). While the pathology of PD is multifaceted, the aggregation of \u03b1-Syn and mitochondrial dysfunction are well-established hallmarks in its pathogenesis. Recently, TFE3, a transcription factor, has emerged as a regulator of autophagy and metabolic processes. However, it remains unclear whether TFE3 can facilitate the degradation of \u03b1-Syn and regulate mitochondrial metabolism specifically in dopaminergic neurons. In this study, we demonstrate that TFE3 overexpression significantly mitigates the loss of dopaminergic neurons and reduces the decline in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fiber density, thereby restoring motor function in an \u03b1-Syn overexpression model of PD. Mechanistically, TFE3 overexpression reversed \u03b1-Syn-mediated impairment of autophagy, leading to enhanced \u03b1-Syn degradation and reduced aggregation. Additionally, TFE3 overexpression inhibited \u03b1-Syn propagation. TFE3 overexpression also reversed the down-regulation of Parkin, promoting the clearance of accumulated mitochondria, and restored the expression of PGC1-\u03b1 and TFAM, thereby enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis in the adeno-associated virus-\u03b1-Syn model. These findings further underscore the neuroprotective role of TFE3 in PD and provide insights into its underlying mechanisms, suggesting TFE3 as a potential therapeutic target for PD.",

    "abstract": "To determine the role of obesity in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nObesity has been reported to be both a risk factor for PD, as well as potentially protective. The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a multigenerational longitudinal cohort study that was started in 1948, which is well-known for its cardiovascular health studies. In this study, we utilized the extensive cardiovascular and neurological data to determine if obesity contributes to the risk of the development of PD.\nParticipants in the FHS Original and Offspring cohorts were included in this study. Controls were selected based on sex and age at baseline examination, 1:10. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used, adjusting for age and sex. PD case status was determined utilizing prior medical and neurological examination data, Framingham Heart Study examinations, and self-report data by a panel of movement disorders neurologists using the UK Brain Bank Criteria (UKBB) and other supporting clinical details after being flagged for review by FHS neurologists. We used p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for significance.\nAccounting for missing covariate data, this study included 117 participants with PD, with 1170 controls. We found that higher BMI was associated with lower PD risk, with participants with BMI 25\u00a0kg/m2 to 30\u00a0kg/m2 having HR of 0.66 (CI 0.44-0.98; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and BMI >= 30\u00a0kg/m2 having HR 0.47 (CI 0.27-0.84; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). When the overweight and obese BMI groups were combined, we noted a more robust association, with combined HR of 0.67 (0.41-0.86; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).\nObesity during mid-life potentially reduces the risk of developing PD; however, additional studies are needed to further explore this association.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19-related social restrictions provided an opportunity to evaluate the impact of social isolation on Parkinson's disease.\nThis study aimed to explore changes in social isolation and their associations with PD symptoms using the Lubben Social Network Scale-Revised (LSNS-R).\nData from 80 participants of the Early Parkinson's Disease Longitudinal Singapore cohort were collected from April 2019 to April 2023, covering the periods before and after the imposition of COVID-19 restrictions. Individuals with LSNS-R scores\u00a0\u2264\u00a024 were considered socially isolated. Data were stratified into strata 1 (improved LSNS-R scores) and strata 2 (worsened/unchanged scores). Linear regression was used to identify predictors of LSNS-R change, and MANCOVA was used to examine associations between LSNS-R change and motor/ non-motor symptoms.\nMean LSNS-R scores decreased (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014), and proportions of social isolation increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00. 001) during COVID-19 restrictions. However, 35\u00a0% showed improved LSNS-R scores, while 65\u00a0% had worsened/unchanged scores. The regression model was significant in strata 1 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.806, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), with age, marital status, and social isolation status being significantly associated with change in LSNS-R scores.

The regression model was not significant in strata 2 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00. 279, p\u00a0=\u00a00.206), wherein motor and non-motor symptoms worsened.\nWhile worsening LSNS-R scores were associated with poorer outcomes, improvements in social networks were associated with improved non-motor symptoms and quality of life. These findings underscore the complexity of social isolation in PD and the need for targeted interventions.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD) onset, pathophysiology, and progression. The aim of our meta-analysis was to review the available literature to assess the role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of the two most common neurological diseases: Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Two medical databases were searched: Web of Science and PubMed in the period from 2009-2023, where a total of 37 publications that met the inclusion criteria were selected for further evaluation. Both patients with AD and with PD showed statistically significantly higher levels of interleukin IL-6 compared to the control group: p-value of 0.0034 for AD (SMD, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.39-1.96) and p-value of 0.0487 for PD (SMD 0.29 95% Cl 0.00-0.59). In AD patients, statistical significance (for random effect) was also observed for IL-1\u03b2, where higher values of this cytokine were recorded in patients compared to controls (p-value <0.001). In turn, in patients with PD, apart from IL-6, statistical significance was also observed for tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (p= 0.0431, SMD 0.52 95%Cl 0.02-1.02). Significant heterogeneity was also recorded (Q =85.48; P < 0.01; I",

    "abstract": "The long-term effects of surgery for subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) on cognitive aspects of motor control for people with Parkinson's disease (PD) are largely unknown. We compared saccade latency and reach reaction time (RT) pre- and post-surgery while participants with PD were off-treatment.\nIn this preliminary study, we assessed people with PD approximately 1\u202fmonth pre-surgery while OFF medication (OFF-MEDS) and about 8\u202fmonths post-surgery while OFF medication and STN-DBS treatment (OFF-MEDS/OFF-DBS). We examined saccade latency and reach reaction time (RT) performance during a visually-guided reaching task requiring participants to look at and reach toward a visual target.\nWe found that both saccade latency and reach RT significantly increased post-surgery compared to pre-surgery. In addition, there was no significant change in Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III score.\nWe found detrimental post-surgical changes to saccade latency and reach RT. We discuss the potential contributions of long-term tissue changes and withdrawal from STN-DBS on this detrimental cognitive effect.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder caused by dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Both Levodopa (L-dopa) and Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation (STN-DBS) effectively alleviate symptoms, yet their cerebral effects remain under-explored. Understanding these effects is essential for optimizing treatment strategies and assessing disease severity. Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data provide a continuous time series signal that reflects the dynamic changes in brain activity. The hidden Markov model (HMM) can capture and model the temporal features and underlying states of the MEG signal to extract potential brain states and monitor dynamic changes. In this study, we employed HMM to investigate the cortical mechanism underlying the treatment of PD patients using MEG recordings.\n21 PD patients treated with medication underwent MEG recording in both L-dopa medoff and medon conditions. Additionally, 11 PD patients receiving STN-DBS treatment underwent MEG recording in both dbsoff and dbson conditions. The MEG data were segmented into four states by Time-delay embedded Hidden Markov Model (TDE-HMM) algorithm. The state parameters including Fractional Occupancy (FO), Interval Times (IT), and Life Time (LT) for each state and power spectrum of \u03b2 band were analyzed to study the effects of L-dopa and STN-DBS treatment respectively.\nL-dopa significantly increased the motor state of HMM and power in the motor area of both high \u03b2 (21-35 Hz) and low \u03b2 (13-20 Hz); the motor state of high \u03b2 in medoff were correlated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III). Conversely, DBS significantly diminishes the motor state of HMM and power in motor area of high \u03b2 oscillations. The score changes of tremor and limb rigidity after DBS treatment were significantly correlated with the changes of motor state of high \u03b2.\nThis study demonstrates that L-dopa and STN-DBS exert differing effects on \u03b2 oscillations in the motor cortex of PD patients, primarily in high \u03b2 band. Understanding these distinct neurophysiological impacts can provide valuable insights for refining therapeutic approaches in motor control for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "The brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) was characterized by increased phosphorylation and oligomerization of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) and altered activity of enzymes regulating \u03b1-syn phosphorylation and oligomerization. Whether increased \u03b1-syn phosphorylation and oligomerization as well as related enzyme changes can be detected in the plasma of PD patients remains unclear. Here, we showed that human \u03b1-syn proteins incubated in PD plasma formed more oligomerized \u03b1-syn (O-\u03b1-syn) and phosphorylated \u03b1-syn (pS-\u03b1-syn) than those in healthy control (HC) plasma. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicated that \u03b1-syn oligomerization rate and phosphorylation rate discriminated PD patients well from HC subjects. Moreover, they were both positively correlated with Hoehn and Yahr staging and polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, an enzyme promoting \u03b1-syn phosphorylation) levels, and negatively correlated with protein phosphatase 2A levels (PP2A, an enzyme dephosphorylating \u03b1-syn) and glucocerebrosidase (GCase, an enzyme whose deficiency causes \u03b1-syn oligomerization) activity and ceramide (a product of GCase and a natural PP2A activator) levels. The above results suggest that increased \u03b1-syn oligomerization and phosphorylation rates and related enzyme changes can be detected in PD plasma and used to discriminate PD patients from HC subjects and predict PD progression.",

    "abstract": "Data accumulated in scientific literature indicate that Parkinson's disease develops after infections caused by SARS-CoV-2, West Nile, Coxsackie, St. Louis viruses, Japanese encephalitis B, hepatitis B and C, influenza A, HIV, herpes viruses, flaviviruses. Neuroinvasive West Nile viruses and HIV activate expression of alpha-synuclein. Influenza A, SARS-CoV-2, and Coxsackie B3 viruses promote aggregation of alpha-synuclein, which has the biophysical characteristics of antiviral peptides and is required for neuronal interferon-stimulated gene expression. These mechanisms can be triggers of Parkinson's disease, which progression is due to involvement of retroelements activated under their influence, stimulating the interferon response, expression and aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the brain. Direct activation of retroelements of the human genome by the described viral infections has been identified. Additional factors are aging and Parkinson's disease-associated polymorphisms located in intergenic, intronic and regulatory regions where transposon sequences are localized. In addition, the influence of the distribution of retroelements in the genomes of human populations on susceptibility to Parkinson's disease and the role of transposons in monogenic forms of the disease were determined. The effects of pathologically activated retroelements in Parkinson's disease are changes in expression of microRNAs derived from them, which contribute to disruption of epigenetic regulation of genes in the brain and pathology progression. An analysis of the scientific literature made it possible to describe a decrease in the levels of 15 such microRNAs, which can serve as tools for targeted therapy of the disease.\n\u041d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0435

    "abstract": "Daytime sleepiness, reported in about 50\u00a0% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), is associated with high morbidity, poor quality of life and increased risk for accidents. While an association between dysautonomia and daytime sleepiness in early, de-novo PD has been reported, our understanding of the role of medications, cognitive status and co-morbidites on this relationship is inadequate.\nData were analyzed from the prospective Cincinnati Cohort Biomarkers Program. The primary outcome of interest was excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; ESS score\u00a0>\u00a010). The primary exposure variable was orthostatic hypotension (OH). Linear and logistic regression analyses followed by moderated graphical network analyses were conducted to explore the complex association between OH and ESS. Edge weight from graphical network analysis indicates the strength of the association.\nData on 453 subjects with PD were analyzed. Median disease duration was 5.8\u00a0years and nearly 90\u00a0% were H&Y stage <3. OH was not associated with EDS. OH was associated with depression (edge weight, 0.22) in cognitively impaired patients but not in cognitively normal patients. In addition, depression was associated with ESS (edge weight, 0.37; moderation weight, 0.22) in cognitively impaired patients to a greater extent than in cognitively normal patients (edge weight, 0.22).\nOH is not directly associated with daytime sleepiness in early, treated PD. However, OH seems to be associated with ESS via depression in cognitively impaired patients. This complex relationship deserves additional study.",

    "abstract": "Given that Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder, with symptoms that worsen over time, our goal is to enhance the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by utilizing machine learning techniques and microbiome analysis. The primary objective is to identify specific microbiome signatures that can reproducibly differentiate patients with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls.\nWe used four Parkinson-related datasets from the NCBI repository, focusing on stool samples. Then, we applied a DADA2-based script for amplicon sequence processing and the Recursive Ensemble Feature Selection (REF) algorithm for biomarker discovery. The discovery dataset was PRJEB14674, while PRJNA742875, PRJEB27564, and PRJNA594156 served as testing datasets. The Extra Trees classifier was used to validate the selected features.\nThe Recursive Ensemble Feature Selection algorithm identified 84 features (Amplicon Sequence Variants) from the discovery dataset, achieving an accuracy of over 80%. The Extra Trees classifier demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74. In the testing phase, the classifier achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.64, 0.71, and 0.62 for the respective datasets, indicating sufficient to good diagnostic accuracy. The study identified several bacterial taxa associated with Parkinson's disease, such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Roseburia, which were increased in patients with the disease.\nThis study successfully identified microbiome signatures that can differentiate patients with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls across different datasets. These findings highlight the potential of integrating machine learning and microbiome analysis for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. However, further research is needed to validate these microbiome signatures and to explore their therapeutic implications in developing targeted treatments and diagnostics for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a worldwide, fast-growing, progressive neurodegenerative condition. Its multifaceted clinical presentation includes a wide range of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Smartphones present a potential solution to better monitor and subsequently alleviate PD symptoms.\nThe aim of this study is to explore neurologists' and patients' needs and preferences regarding the design and functionality of a new smartphone app for PD, DigiPark.\nThis qualitative, noninterventional study gathered data through two primary methods: (1) by conducting interviews with 9 neurologists and (2) through a usability test including 5 patients with PD.\nThe neurologists affirmed the necessity for a patient-centered app, highlighting the complexities of PD management. They advocated for personalized app functionalities to improve patients' quality of life and emphasized the need for enhanced patient-provider communication. Feedback from the usability test indicated a preference for a clear, simple user interface, as well as elucidation of the app's benefits. Concerns about the app's time demands and the complexity of certain features like medication management were expressed. Furthermore, patients with PD consistently showed interest in features that could track and monitor their progress over time. This highlights the need to include clear benefits within the app to maintain user engagement and commitment.\nNeurologists' and patients' feedback on the design and functionality of the app complement each other. Collaborative efforts in shaping the app should better address genuine PD management needs. Future clinical trial inclusion can further validate the efficacy of DigiPark.",

    "results": "The neurologists affirmed the necessity for a patient-centered app, highlighting the complexities of PD management. They advocated for personalized app functionalities to improve patients' quality of life and emphasized the need for enhanced patient-provider communication. Feedback from the usability test indicated a preference for a clear, simple user interface, as well as elucidation of the app's benefits. Concerns about the app's time demands and the complexity of certain features like medication management were expressed. Furthermore, patients with PD consistently showed interest in features that could track and monitor their progress over time. This highlights the need to include clear benefits within the app to maintain user engagement and commitment.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with unclear pathogenesis. Some recent studies have shown that there is a close relationship between PD and ferroptosis. We aimed to identify the ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) and construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks to further assess the pathogenesis of PD.\nExpression of 97 substantia nigra (SN) samples were obtained and intersected with FRGs. Bioinformatics analysis, including the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), consensus cluster analysis, weight gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and machine learning algorithms, were employed to assess the feasible differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Characteristic signature genes were used to create novel diagnostic models and construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network for PD, which were further verified by in vitro experiments and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).\nA total of 453 DEGs were identified and 11 FRGs were selected. We sorted the entire PD cohort into two subtypes based on the FRGs and obtained 67 hub genes. According to the five machine algorithms, 4 features (S100A2, GNGT1, NEUROD4, FCN2) were screened and used to create a PD diagnostic model. Corresponding miRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted to construct a ceRNA network. The scRNA-seq and experimental results showed that the signature model had a certain diagnostic effect and lncRNA NEAT1 might regulate the progression of ferroptosis in PD via the NEAT1/miR-26b-5p/S100A2 axis.\nThe diagnostic signatures based on the four FRGs had certain diagnostic and individual effects. NEAT1/miR-26b-5p/S100A2 axis is associated with ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of PD. Our findings provide new solutions for treating PD.",

    "abstract": "To determine (1) the quality of systematic reviews about dance-based intervention in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and (2) standard evidence for dance-based intervention efficacy based on the categories of The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) from the World Health Organization's (WHO).\nThe data source included MEDLINE, PUBMED, Embase, Scopus, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), CINAHL, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, APA PsycNet (APA PsycINFO), LILACS, SciELO, and AMED. Pairs of independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts of eligible studies by using the software Covidence. Criteria included: systematic review designs; individuals with PD; dance-based interventions aimed to change critical PD symptoms matched to IFC domains (body functions, activities, and participation). Independent reviewers extracted information regarding the characteristics of all systematic reviews included and appraised quality using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2). Randomized controlled trials and their risk of bias were identified within each review and were used to perform an updated pairwise meta-analysis.\nOf the 571 manuscripts screened, 55 reviews met the inclusion criteria. The overall confidence in the results of 38 reviews (69%) was rated as 'critically low,' nine (9%) as 'low,' one (2%) as 'moderate,' while seven of 55 reviews (13%) were rated as 'high'. Dance associated with pharmacological usual care is better than pharmacological usual care alone for essential components of ICF, such as motor symptoms severity (body function), depressive symptoms (body function), balance (body function and activity), and functional mobility (activity), but not for gait distance (activity) and quality of life (participation). Dance is also superior to multimodal exercise to improve balance.\nClinicians and people with PD can refer to this paper for a summary of high-quality reviews and the overall evidence supporting dance as an adjunct rehabilitation. This umbrella review not only underscores the therapeutic potential of dance but also reinforces the use of arts-based approaches into healthcare practices for people with neurological conditions.",

Dance associated with pharmacological usual care is better than pharmacological usual care alone for essential components of ICF, such as motor symptoms severity (body function), depressive symptoms (body function), balance (body function and activity), and functional mobility (activity), but not for gait distance (activity) and quality of life (participation). Dance is also superior to multimodal exercise to improve balance.",

    "abstract": "Reduced step length is a hallmark of gait disturbance in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although treadmill training is effective for improving step length, the associated neural mechanisms have not been fully investigated. Moreover, exploring the baseline neurophysiological predictors for step length improvement after training could facilitate personalized gait rehabilitation for PD.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the neuroplastic changes in corticomotor excitability after treadmill training and to explore whether baseline neurophysiological measures could predict step length improvement in PD.\nData from 61 participants with idiopathic PD who completed 12 treadmill training sessions were included. Gait performances and corticomotor excitability measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were obtained at baseline, postintervention, and 1-month follow-up. TMS outcomes included motor-evoked potentials, cortical silent period (CSP), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI). General estimating equation analysis and principal-component analyses were used to determine the neuroplastic changes induced by training, and multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the baseline TMS predictors for step length improvement at 1-month follow-up.\nAfter treadmill training, SICI and CSP significantly increased and shared an emerging relationship. Regression analysis showed that female sex and greater baseline ICF and SICI were significant predictors of step length improvement at the follow-up.\nThis study advanced the understanding of neuroplastic changes induced by treadmill training in PD and showed that preserved SICI and ICF were predictors for lasting step length improvement after training. Future studies could investigate other influential factors for treadmill training in PD. \u00a9 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Speech change is a biometric marker for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, evaluating speech variability across diverse languages is challenging. We aimed to develop a cross-language algorithm differentiating between PD patients and healthy controls using a Taiwanese and Korean speech data set. We recruited 299 healthy controls and 347 patients with PD from Taiwan and Korea. Participants with PD underwent smartphone-based speech recordings during the \"on\" phase. Each Korean participant performed various speech texts, while the Taiwanese participant read a standardized, fixed-length article. Korean short-speech (\u226615 syllables) and long-speech (>\u200915 syllables) recordings were combined with the Taiwanese speech dataset. The merged dataset was split into a training set (controls vs. early-stage PD) and a validation set (controls vs. advanced-stage PD) to evaluate the model's effectiveness in differentiating PD patients from controls across languages based on speech length. Numerous acoustic and linguistic speech features were extracted and combined with machine learning algorithms to distinguish PD patients from controls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was calculated to assess diagnostic performance. Random forest and AdaBoost classifiers showed an AUROC 0.82 for distinguishing patients with early-stage PD from controls. In the validation cohort, the random forest algorithm maintained this value (0.90) for discriminating advanced-stage PD patients. The model showed superior performance in the combined language cohort (AUROC 0.90) than either the Korean (AUROC 0.87) or Taiwanese (AUROC 0.88) cohorts individually. However, with another merged speech data set of short-speech recordings\u2009<\u200925 characters, the diagnostic performance to identify early-stage PD patients from controls dropped to 0.72 and showed a further limited ability to discriminate advanced-stage patients. Leveraging multifaceted speech features, including both acoustic and linguistic characteristics, could aid in distinguishing PD patients from healthy individuals, even across different languages.",

However, it remains unclear whether these factors are associated with the occurrence of cognitive impairment (CI) in PD patients.\nThis study initially enrolled eligible PD patients without cognitive impairment. Blood samples were collected to measure serum levels of \u03b1-synuclein, Hcy, and LRG using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After one year of treatment, patients were divided into CI group and non-CI groups based on their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. Baseline clinical characteristics and the levels of these three factors were compared between the two groups. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the predictive value of these factors for the occurrence of CI in PD patients.\nThe study included 102 eligible PD patients without baseline CI, divided into 65 patients in the non-CI group and 37 patients in the CI group after one year, based on the MoCA scores. Serum levels of \u03b1-synuclein, Hcy, and LRG in the CI group were 0.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.33 ng/mL, 19.85\u2009\u00b1\u20096.31 \u00b5mol/L, and 14.53\u2009\u00b1\u20095.11 ng/mL respectively, compared to 0.04\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 ng/mL, 14.32\u2009\u00b1\u20095.25 \u00b5mol/L, and 11.67\u2009\u00b1\u20093.10 ng/mL in the non-CI group.

    "abstract": "One of the most common post-COVID-19 condition is persistent fatigue, while post-COVID fatigue among Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is less known. This study was aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of post-COVID fatigue in PD patients at 1\u00a0month and 12\u00a0months after symptom onset. PD patients attending clinic from December 2022 to January 2023 were enrolled consecutively in the study. All participants were assessed demographics, details of COVID-19 infection, clinical characteristics as well as fatigue status with Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) (cutoff\u2009\u2265\u200936) at 1-month and 12-month after symptom onset. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the risk factors of post-COVID fatigue. Fatigue symptoms were reported by 75.89% of PD patients and associated with decreased physical activity and number of initial symptoms of COVID-19 at 1\u00a0month. Meanwhile, 32.99% of PD patients at 12 months reported persistent fatigue. Using of antiviral drugs, decreased physical activity, anxiety status and delayed ON were associated with persistent fatigue at 12 months. Clinically persistent fatigue was pervasive in our study at 12-month after COVID infection. These findings implicate using of antiviral drugs, decreased physical activity, anxiety status and delayed ON were possible predictors of post-COVID persistent fatigue.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to study the effect of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) on the subnetwork of subcortical and cortical motor regions and on the whole brain connectivity using the functional connectivity analysis in Parkinson's disease (PD). The high-density source space EEG was acquired and analyzed in 43 PD subjects in DBS on and DBS off stimulation states (off medication) during a cognitive-motor task. Increased high gamma band (50-100\u00a0Hz) connectivity within subcortical regions and between subcortical and cortical motor regions was significantly associated with the Movement Disorders Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III improvement after DBS. Whole brain neural correlates of cognitive performance were also detected in the high gamma (50-100\u00a0Hz) band. A whole brain multifrequency connectivity profile was found to classify optimal and suboptimal responders to DBS with a positive predictive value of 0.77, negative predictive value of 0.55, specificity of 0.73, and sensitivity of 0.60. Specific connectivity patterns related to PD, motor symptoms improvement after DBS, and therapy responsiveness predictive connectivity profiles were uncovered.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) experience a wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms that have a significant impact on their health and quality of life. Effective care management for PwPD involves monitoring symptoms at home, involving specialised multidisciplinary care providers and enhancing self-management skills. This study protocol describes the process evaluation within a randomised clinical trial to assess the implementation and its impact on patient health outcomes of ParkProReakt-a proactive, multidisciplinary, digitally supported care model for community-dwelling PwPD.\nThe hybrid efficacy-implementation study will assess key implementation outcomes using the Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions alongside a randomised controlled trial. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to assess process data from care providers and patients. The main process outcomes are fidelity, dose, feasibility and context. Context will be analysed through semistructured interviews and focus groups using the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research. To elucidate potential facilitators and barriers to implementation and to gain deeper insights into the efficacy outcome data, quantitative and qualitative process data will be integrated at an interpretative level using mixed methods. In addition to process evaluation, potential indirect mechanisms of impact will be measured.\nEthical approval for this study was obtained from the responsible state medical ethics committees in Hesse and Hamburg, Germany. Results will be communicated to the funding body and disseminated through scientific publications.\nThis study was registered with the German Registry for Clinical Studies (DRKS)-number: DRKS00031092.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's Disease (PD), are a significant global health challenge with no effective therapies to counteract neurodegeneration. Genetic and environmental factors lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in oxidative stress. This stress reduces levels of Peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3), a key protein for maintaining ROS balance at the mitochondrial level, increasing the substantia nigra's susceptibility to damage. To investigate the protective role of antioxidant gene therapy in a PD model, we overexpressed the PRDX3 enzyme using a cell-penetrating peptide-based delivery system (mRVG9R-PRDX3 complex). The mRVG9R peptide was combined with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmid expressing PRDX3 to create the complex. Overexpression of the PRDX3 gene in neuronal phenotype cells was confirmed in vitro using dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. Following successful in vitro expression, the mRVG9R-PRDX3 complex was stereotaxically injected into the striatum of male C57BL/6 mice. The PD model was induced by administering paraquat (PQ) twice a week for 6\u00a0weeks. After the final PQ injection, motor and cognitive functions were evaluated, followed by histological analysis. Animals treated with the mRVG9R-PRDX3 complex showed a clear reduction in PQ-induced PD symptomatology and prevented cellular senescence in the substantia nigra's neuronal population. The mRVG9R-PRDX3 gene therapy improved motor and cognitive functions in the PD animal model and demonstrated potential in protecting substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons from PQ-induced death.",

    "abstract": "Long-term use of levodopa, a metabolic precursor of dopamine (DA) for alleviation of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), can cause a serious side effect known as levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). With the development of LID, high-frequency gamma oscillations (~100 Hz) are registered in the motor cortex (MCx) in patients with PD and rats with experimental PD. Studying alterations in the activity within major components of motor networks during transition from levodopa-off state to dyskinesia can provide useful information about their contribution to the development of abnormal gamma oscillations and LID.\nFreely moving rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide (6-OHDA)-induced nigral DA cell lesions were administered a high dose of levodopa for 7 days. Local field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal activity were recorded from electrodes implanted in the motor cortex (MCx), ventromedial nucleus of the thalamus (VM), and substantia nigra pars reticulata nucleus (SNpr).\nLevodopa reduced the power of beta oscillations (30-36 Hz) associated with bradykinesia in PD rats in three divisions of the motor neural network (MCx, VM, and SNpr) and prompted subsequent emergence of robust high-frequency gamma oscillations (80-120 Hz) in VM and MCx, but not SNpr, LFPs. Gamma oscillations were strongly associated with the occurrence of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) and accompanied by an increase in spiking rates in the VM and MCx and enlarged spike-LFP synchronization with cortical gamma oscillations (68% in the VM and 34% in the MCx). In contrast, SNpr LFPs did not exhibit gamma oscillations during LID, and neuronal activity in most recordings (87%) was largely decreased and not synchronized with VM or MCx LFPs. Administration of the antidyskinetic drug 8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)-tetraline hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) restored the initial characteristics of LFPs (30-36 Hz oscillations), rates of neuronal activity, and bradykinesia. Inhibition of VM neurons by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA-A)-agonist muscimol during LID eliminated high gamma oscillations in the MCx and VM, but not dyskinesia, suggesting that gamma oscillations are not critical for the expression of AIMs. In contrast, chemogenetic activation of SNpr neurons during LID eliminated both gamma oscillations and dyskinesia.\nThese findings suggest that levodopa treatment leads to crucial reduction of inhibitory control over motor networks due to a large decline in spiking of most SNpr GABAergic projecting neurons, which causes persistent hyperactivity in motor circuits, leading to the appearance of thalamocortical gamma oscillations and LID.",

    "abstract": "The neurodegenerative progression of Parkinson's disease affects brain structure and function and, concomitantly, alters the topological properties of brain networks. The network alteration accompanied by motor impairment and the duration of the disease has not yet been clearly demonstrated in the disease progression. In this study, we aim to resolve this problem with a modeling approach using the reduced Jansen-Rit model applied to large-scale brain networks derived from cross-sectional MRI data. Optimizing whole-brain simulation models allows us to discover brain networks showing unexplored relationships with clinical variables. We observe that the simulated brain networks exhibit significant differences between healthy controls (\nUnderstanding the progression of neurodegenerative diseases is of extreme importance in medicine. We utilize biophysical whole-brain models to describe how the brain networks change in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). We demonstrate clear correlations between the severity of motor impairment and the properties of the simulated brain networks, which are not prominent in empirical brain networks. Furthermore, we show that healthy participants exhibit a pronounced adaptation of network efficiencies in response to varying parameters of the model, while such an adaptation process is suppressed in PD patients with higher disease severity and duration. Our findings suggest a potential model-based biomarker for classification and clinical evaluation of progressive PD using cross-sectional clinical MRI data.",

    "abstract": "Striatum, the input stage of the basal ganglia, is important for sensory-motor integration, initiation and selection of behavior, as well as reward learning. Striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from mainly cortex and thalamus. In rodents, the striatal projection neurons (SPNs), giving rise to the direct and the indirect pathway (dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively), account for 95% of the neurons, and the remaining 5% are GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons. Interneuron axon terminals as well as local dSPN and iSPN axon collaterals form an intricate striatal network. Following chronic dopamine depletion as in Parkinson's disease (PD), both morphological and electrophysiological striatal neuronal features have been shown to be altered in rodent models. Our goal with this in silico study is twofold: (a) to predict and quantify how the intrastriatal network connectivity structure becomes altered as a consequence of the morphological changes reported at the single-neuron level and (b) to investigate how the effective glutamatergic drive to the SPNs would need to be altered to account for the activity level seen in SPNs during PD. In summary, we predict that the richness of the connectivity motifs in the striatal network is significantly decreased during PD while, at the same time, a substantial enhancement of the effective glutamatergic drive to striatum is present.\nThis in silico study predicts the impact that the single-cell neuronal morphological alterations will have on the striatal microcircuit connectivity. We find that the richness in the topological striatal motifs is significantly reduced in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), highlighting that just measuring the pairwise connectivity between neurons gives an incomplete description of network connectivity. Moreover, we predict how the resulting electrophysiological changes of striatal projection neuron excitability together with their reduced number of dendritic branches affect their response to the glutamatergic drive from the cortex and thalamus. We find that the effective glutamatergic drive is likely significantly increased in PD, in accordance with the hyperglutamatergic hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of people around the world. Conventional PD detection algorithms are generally based on first and second-generation artificial neural network (ANN) models which consume high energy and have complex architecture. Considering these limitations, a time-varying synaptic efficacy function\u00a0based leaky-integrate and fire neuron model, called SEFRON is used for the detection of PD. SEFRON explores the advantages of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) which is suitable for neuromorphic devices. To evaluate the performance of SEFRON, 2 publicly available standard datasets, namely (1) UCI: Oxford Parkinson's Disease Detection Dataset and (2) UCI: Parkinson Dataset with replicated acoustic features are used. The performance is compared with other well-known neural network models: Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF-NN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM). The experimental results demonstrate that the SEFRON classifier achieves a maximum accuracy of 100% and an average accuracy of 99.49% on dataset 1. For dataset 2, it attains a peak accuracy of 94% and an average accuracy of 91.94%, outperforming the other classifiers in both cases. From the performance, it is proved that the presented model can help to develop a robust automated PD detection device that can assist the physicians to diagnose the disease at its early stage.",

    "abstract": "Affective Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to understand other peoples' emotional states and feelings. Several studies showed impaired affective ToM abilities in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, most studies tested this ability by using single-stimulus modality tasks (visual cues). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether affective ToM abilities are impaired in PD using multiple stimulus modalities and whether they are related to disease duration and cognitive/emotional abilities. Twenty mid-stage, non-demented people with PD and 20 matched controls were evaluated by means of two tasks requiring subjects to infer others' mental states from the eyes' expression - the Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RME) test, and from the emotional prosody - a modified version of the Reading the Mind in the Voice (RMV) test. In people with PD, cognitive function and emotional processes were assessed through cognitive tasks and batteries of facial and prosodic emotion recognition tests. Compared to controls, the PD group showed significantly impaired performances in both RME and RMV tests (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Affective ToM abilities in people with PD were not correlated with cognitive function or disease duration. Visual recognition of anger and auditory recognition of fear were positively correlated with RME (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0028) and RMV (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) test scores, respectively. Cross-modal impairment of affective ToM abilities is a non-motor feature of PD, unrelated to disease stage or cognitive status. A dysfunctional amygdala-centred network might represent the shared bases for impairments in fear and anger recognition and affective ToM abilities in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by movement impairments. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has shown promise in treating various neurological conditions, including PD. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the existing evidence on the efficacy of nVNS in managing PD symptoms.\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies published up to July 2024. The included studies investigated the effect of nVNS on various PD motor symptoms. The quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (ROB-2) and NIH tool for RCTs, single-arm studies, and case series studies respectively. Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager version 5.4.1 with outcomes expressed as Mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nThe systematic review included eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one single-arm study, and one case series, encompassing a total of 217 patients with PD. The review revealed that nVNS in increasing Freezing of Gait (FOG) in PD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). However, no significant differences were found in UPDRS-III (p\u00a0=\u00a00.19 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.89 for on and off-medication conditions, respectively), UPDRS-II (p\u00a0=\u00a00.9), UPDRS-I (p\u00a0=\u00a00.46), Time Up and Go (p\u00a0=\u00a00.61), stand time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.87), walking speed (p\u00a0=\u00a00.22), or step length measured in meters (p\u00a0=\u00a00.8). Interestingly, a significant improvement was observed in step length measured in centimetres (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0005). No study reported serious adverse effects associated with nVNS treatment.\nOur finding suggests a potential benefit of nVNS in reducing FOG in PD, but did not demonstrate a significant improvement in other motor symptoms. Larger, longer follow-up studies are needed to confirm the effect nVNS on PD management. PROSPERO number: CRD42024574822.",

    "abstract": "Visual hallucinations (VH) and pareidolia, a type of minor hallucination, share common underlying mechanisms. However, the similarities and differences in their brain regions remain poorly understood in Parkinson's disease (PD). A total of 104 drug-na\u00efve PD patients underwent structural MRI and were assessed for pareidolia using the Noise Pareidolia Test (NPT) were enrolled. Subcortical gray matter volume and cortical surface volume were analyzed using the FreeSurfer software. Structural analyses revealed associations between NPT scores and atrophy in the right thalamus, right hippocampus, right temporal cortex, and right orbitofrontal cortex in all PD participants. These results were almost the same after adjusting for right-handed 97 patients with PD. It is considered that hallucinations in patients with PD are related to altered integration of sensory input (bottom-up) and prior knowledge (top-down) within the visual system. Our findings indicate that pareidolia in PD involves both bottom-up (thalamus and temporal cortex) and top-down (orbitofrontal cortex) processing disturbances; in contrast, VH predominantly involves bottom-up but not top-down regions. Understanding these distinctions could aid in the development of targeted interventions for hallucinations in patients with PD.",

Each patient was assessed using a set of validated measures for assessing PD and cognitive state. We explored NoMoFA's feasibility, acceptability, factorial structure, internal consistency, convergent validity, test-retest reliability (the latter performed on 50 patients after 14\u00a0days), and the precision of the scale.\n227 PD patients (mean age 65.34, disease duration 9.31\u00a0years) were included, with 100% data computability. The scale was free from floor and ceiling effects, and included 7 factors (59.2% of the variance). Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.89, indicating strong internal consistency. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.90 demonstrated satisfactory reproducibility.

A group of patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls were recruited, and their clinical characteristics and plasma were collected. Untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based plasma metabolomics profiling was performed. Differentially expressed metabolites between patients and healthy controls were respectively identified in the male and female participants and metabolite set enrichment analyses were further employed. A total of 75 patients with Parkinson's disease (37 males and 38 females) and 31 healthy controls (16 males and 15 females) were enrolled while no significant differences can be discovered in clinical characteristics. The constructed male-specific metabolic model from orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis can't well recognize female patients and the female-specific model also can't accurately identify male patients. There were 55 differentially expressed metabolites in the male participants, and fatty acids and conjugates and eicosanoids were the significantly enriched metabolite sets. Meanwhile, 86 metabolites were differentially expressed in the female participants while fatty acids and conjugates and glycerophosphocholines were enriched. Only 17 metabolites were simultaneously changed in both male and female patients. Significant sex differences of lipid metabolism were found in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor manifestations, including alexithymia. This condition is defined by difficulty in recognizing, articulating, and expressing one's emotional states. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the prevalence of alexithymia in PD patients and a healthy population, and to identify associated demographic and clinical factors. We identified 16 observational studies through Pubmed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and SCOPUS, selecting articles published since 2002. Data were analyzed using a random-effects model. We conducted additional prevalence meta-analyses and correlation meta-analyses. We found that PD patients exhibit higher levels of alexithymia compared to the general population (combined effect size 0.65 [95% CI = 0.49-0.81; P <0.05]), and moderate but significant heterogeneity (I\u00b2 = 52.42%, Q = 29.42, P <0.05), partially explained by regional differences, levodopa equivalent dosage (positive regression coefficient of 0.0006 [95% CI = 0.0001; 0.0011, P <0.05]); and cognitive scores (negative regression coefficient of -0.14 [95% CI = -0.24; -0.04, P<0.05]), after adjusting for covariates. The additional meta-analysis reported higher prevalence of alexithymia in PD and a pooled correlation coefficient of 0.496 (95% CI = 0.40-0.59, P <0.05) when we analyzed alexithymia and depression scores. To our knowledge, there are no previous meta-analysis applied to alexithymia in PD patients. Even though we could not determine whether alexithymia is a primary characteristic of PD, we found an association of higher levels of alexithymia with depression and higher levodopa equivalent daily dose. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to draw clear conclusions about the influence of cognitive status.",

    "abstract": "An increased prevalence of peripheral polyneuropathy (PN) in Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with greater functional impairment has previously been reported. A possible cause has been suggested as levodopa therapy. The aim of this real-world study was to assess the prevalence and the characteristics of PN in PD and to investigate the putative association between PN and oral levodopa.\nA cohort of 692 consecutive patients with idiopathic PD had routine clinical, laboratory, and lower limb clinical neurophysiology assessment when attending the certified tertiary Parkinson center, Sch\u00f6n Klinik Neustadt, Neustadt in Holstein, Germany, between 2016 and 2019. Patients were sent by general neurologists for the medication adjustment, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, and logopaedic treatment. A retrospective cross-sectional review of the data was performed.\nThe mean age of the cohort was 72.6 (8.44) years (range, 44-90 years) and 60% were male. The age of the first PD manifestation was 65.22 (10.09) years (range, 31-88 years). Of 692 patients with PD, 507 (73.27%) had clinical signs of neuropathy and PN was first diagnosed 6.3 (5.7) years after the PD onset. Of these 507 patients, 446 (87.96%) underwent the electrophysiological investigations with PN confirmed in 396 patients (88.79% out of 446 electrophysiologically investigated patients with PD). Peripheral polyneuropathy was ruled out in 50 patients (11.21% of 446 electrophysiologically investigated patients with PD). The half of patients had moderate and severe sensory axonal PN (201 patients or 53.03% of all 396 with confirmed PN). The mean motor examination part of the Movement Disorders Society's Unified PD Rating Scale score in patients with PN was significantly higher (off, 30.48 [11.60] points; on, 19.92 [10.27] points), than in patients without PN (off, 27.17 [14.57] points; on, 17.14 [11.98] points), with P < 0.01 in the both off and on states. The mean levodopa daily dosage was similar in patients with PN and without PN (565 mg vs 556 mg, P = nonsignificant). No difference between other dopaminergic medication in PN and non-PN group was found.\nPN is highly prevalent in patients with PD. There was no association between oral levodopa or other dopaminergic medication and PN. More awareness of PN in PD clinics and further understanding of the pathophysiology, which leads to the development of an axonal polyneuropathy in PD, are required.",

The effects of MAO-B inhibitors on quality of life remain unclear, and the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of MAO-B inhibitors on quality of life in different domains.\nWe searched PubMed, Embass, and Cochrane Library databases for randomized controlled trials of PD patients who were administered MAO-B inhibitors. Outcomes were the change from baseline in the total score of life quality scales, change from baseline in domains of the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), and incidence of treatment-associated adverse events (TAEs).\nSixteen studies covering 4734 PD patients were included in the study. The PDQ-39 scores were lower with MAO-B inhibitors than with placebo (SMD: -0.26, 95\u202f% CI: [-0.49, -0.04], P\u202f=\u202f0.02). The European Quality of Life Questionnaire-5D (EQ-5D) scores were higher in the MAO-B inhibitor group. Patients treated with MAO-B inhibitors had better performance in the domains of mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, communication, and bodily discomfort, except for social support and cognition. The incidence of TAEs was slightly higher in patients treated with MAO-B inhibitors.\nEvidence has shown that MAO-B inhibitors, especially safinamide, are effective in improving the quality of life of PD patients, although with a slightly higher incidence of TAEs. The domains of quality of life were improved, except for cognition and social support, compared with placebo. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of other MAO-B inhibitors on quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in the moderate and severe stages can present several walk alterations. They can show slow movements and difficulty initiating, varying, or interrupting their gait; freezing; short steps; speed changes; shuffling; little arm swing; and festinating gait. The Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) has a good reputation for uniformly evaluating motor and non-motor aspects of PD. However, the motor clinical assessment depends on visual observations, the results are qualitative, and subtle differences are not identified. This study presents a fuzzy inference model for gait assessments in PD patients with detailed descriptions of signal processing and eight biomechanical indicators computations; as such, other authors can replicate the presented methods. The computer model uses 334 bilateral measurements of 58 Parkinson's patients and 15 healthy control subjects performed over one year. The computer model validations are based on physician evaluations in real-time and post-analysis using an extensive database of videos and signals. The assessment results are explainable, quantitative, and qualitative, increasing their acceptance and use in clinical environments. The computer system design considers three expert motor evaluations, including the PD patients' evolutions; this facilitates correlation with medication doses and appropriate intervals for follow-up medical consultations. The assessments include three qualitative gait conditions of MDS-UPDRS-normal, slight, and mild-as well as a numerical evaluation of up to two decimal places.",

    "abstract": "In a number of causes of Parkinson's disease (PD), occupation is periodically mentioned as a possible risk factor. However, a look at the complex impact of external factors on people of certain professions and the expansion of the area of risk factors in a rapidly changing world leads to the emergence of new studies. There is an assumption that the risk of developing PD is increased in doctors due to long-term exposure to stress. The presented case series describes the clinical features of 7 female doctors with PD. Of the 278 patients with PD referred for rehabilitation since 2016, 7 (2.5%) people were doctors by profession, all women, with stage II-III according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale, average age 65.28\u00b17.94 years, and all referrals were registered during 2022-2023, which accounted for 10% of patients during this time. All patients were assessed for their medical history, clinical features of the underlying disease, comorbidity, MoCA scale, and self-reported physical activity. At the time of examination, the patients worked as primary care physicians or stopped working shortly before the examination due to the underlying disease. The patients' experience of PD was 4.0\u00b12.0 years. The patients complained of unilateral tremor and uni- or bilateral gait disturbance, one patient had freezing. Additionally, the patients were bothered by comorbidities: deforming osteoarthrosis, obesity, arterial hypertension. Cognitive deficit was determined in 5 cases. The patients had reduced muscle strength, had no sports history and did not perform the minimum amount of physical activity recommended for maintaining health. These patients additionally had synergy of the underlying disease with degenerative processes of other body systems and lack of physical activity, which is a preventive factor in the development of PD and comorbid pathology.\n\u0412 \u0440\u044f\u0434\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Mobile technologies enable Parkinson's patients to improve their quality of life, manage symptoms, and enhance overall well-being through various applications (apps). There is no integrated list of specific capabilities available to cater to the unique needs of Parkinson's patient-focused mobile apps.\nThis study aimed to identify the key features and capabilities prioritized in developing mobile apps for patients with Parkinson's disease (PWP) and rank the related apps in this field.\nWe searched iTunes and Google Play for PWP apps with \"Parkinson\" or \"Parkinson's\" in their title or description. We evaluated existing mobile apps through a four-step process: identification, screening, eligibility, and feature analysis. We installed apps on Android and iOS devices, categorized their features/capabilities by the \"use case model\" and other additional identified features. We scored them using a tool called FARM (Feature-based Application Rating Method) and ranked PWP-related apps.\nThirty-three apps related to the PWP were included and evaluated. Almost half of the apps were available on both the Android and iOS platforms. Seventy-five percent of the genres were associated with health and fitness. Although the included apps utilized certain features, none of the capabilities were used simultaneously. According to the experts' opinions, 'large font' was the most important feature and was utilized in 70% of the mobile applications. Additionally, the average score for all Parkinson's disease-related applications was 17.71 (SD\u2009=\u20097.92). The app titled 'Swiss Parkinson' had the highest score.\nIntegrating a relevant list of features used for Parkinson's patients' applications yielded valuable insights for the design of mobile applications tailored to patients' needs. These features are highly efficient in dealing with the specific obstacles related to this disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by both motor and non-motor symptoms that necessitate ongoing clinical evaluation and medication adjustments. Home-based wearable sensor monitoring offers a detailed and continuous record of patient symptoms, potentially enhancing disease management. The EmPark-PKG study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Parkinson's KinetoGraph (PKG), a wearable sensor device, in monitoring and tracking the progression of motor symptoms over 12\u00a0months in Emirati and non-Emirati PD patients. Fifty PD patients (32% Emirati, 68% non-Emirati) were assessed at baseline and a 12-month follow-up. Clinical evaluations included levodopa equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) and motor and non-motor assessments. Concurrently, the PKG provided metrics such as bradykinesia score (BKS) and dyskinesia score (DKS). Statistical analyses were conducted to determine changes from baseline to six months, differences between Emirati and non-Emirati groups, and correlations between PKG metrics and clinical assessments. Significant reductions in LEDD and improvements in both motor and non-motor scores were observed from baseline to six months (p\u2009<\u20090.05). PKG-guided medication adjustments were associated with enhanced motor and non-motor outcomes (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Specifically, non-Emirati patients exhibited a significant reduction in LEDD (Z\u2009=\u2009-\u00a02.010, p\u2009=\u20090.044), whereas Emirati patients did not (Z\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.468, p\u2009=\u20090.640). Both groups showed significant improvements in motor scale scores and motor complication scores. Spearman correlation analysis revealed strong relationships between PKG metrics and subjective clinical assessments (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The EmPark-PKG study demonstrates the potential benefits of remote PKG monitoring for personalised motor symptom management in PD. PKG supports a stepped care paradigm by enabling bespoke medication titration based on objective data, facilitating tailored and effective patient care.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Despite numerous studies, specific age-related factors remain unidentified. This study employed a multi-omics approach to investigate the link between PD and aging. We integrated blood gene expression profiles, expression quantitative trait loci, genome-wide association studies, predictive models, and conducted clinical validation.By analyzing PD datasets, a total of 953 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 10 intersecting aging differentially expressed genes (ADEGs) were identified. Enrichment analysis revealed that the regulatory pathways of these ADEGs involve the classical Wnt signaling pathway, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and neuronal apoptosis. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis showed that the MAP3K5 gene significantly reduces the risk of PD. Multivariate regression analysis identified MXD1, CREB1, and SIRT3 as key diagnostic genes and constructed a predictive model to aid clinical decision-making. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments validated the expression levels of these genes in the serum of PD patients.This study utilized a multi-omics approach to identify key ADEGs and their regulatory mechanisms in PD, leading to the establishment of a diagnostic model. The resource is accessible at this link: https://yunhaihupo.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp . This web application can be used as a standalone resource to explore changes in blood transcription profiles in PD and their relationship to clinical and aging aspects, generating new research hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments and the accumulation of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein. Dysregulation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP), responsible for degrading misfolded proteins, has been implicated in PD pathogenesis. However, current diagnostic approaches rely heavily on motor symptoms, which occur due to substantial neurodegeneration, limiting early detection and intervention. This study investigated the potential of ALP-associated proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as diagnostic biomarkers for early-stage PD. Quantitative analysis revealed a significant reduction in optineurin\u00a0levels in PBMCs from PD patients, and the expression levels of various ALP-associated proteins were tightly correlated, suggesting a coordinated dysregulation of the pathway. Correlation analyses revealed associations between ALP-associated features and clinical characteristics, such as age of onset and motor impairment. Furthermore, the study identified multiple positive correlations among ALP-associated proteins and functional readouts, highlighting the interconnectivity within the pathway. Notably, a PBMC biomarker model incorporating lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1\u00a0and optineurin exhibited high diagnostic accuracy (86%) in distinguishing PD patients from controls. These findings highlight the potential of ALP-associated protein signatures in PBMCs as novel diagnostic biomarkers for early detection and intervention in PD, offering insights into the systemic manifestations of the disease.",

    "abstract": "This study compared ocular and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMP and cVEMP) among individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) without dizziness, with nonspecific dizziness (dizziness without orthostatic hypotension), or with dizziness combined with orthostatic hypotension.\nWe prospectively analyzed 30 of each of the three types of individuals who were admitted to Yongchuan Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (Chongqing, China) between June 2022 and April 2023. The three groups received oVEMP and cVEMP measurements using an electromyography-evoked potential system. For oVEMP, the N10 latency, P16 latency, and amplitude were compared between the three groups and the reference values. For cVEMP, the P13 latency, N23 latency, and amplitude were compared between the three groups and the reference values. Overall characteristics of oVEMP and cVEMP were also assessed using a previously published scoring scale originally developed for individuals with multiple sclerosis between the three groups included. The correlation between VEMP parameters (the latency and amplitude) and VEMP scores were simultaneously analyzed using Pearson's bivariate correlation analysis.\nWhen compared with reference values, the oVEMP and cVEMP parameters of all three groups were found to be slightly different from the reference values. When the three groups included were compared with each other, in terms of oVEMP, the average amplitude in the left eye was significantly higher in those with nonspecific dizziness than in the other two groups. In terms of cVEMP, the average N23 latency on both the right and left sides of the neck and average amplitude on the right side of the neck were significantly higher in those with nonspecific dizziness than in the other two groups. Scores for oVEMP and cVEMP were also significantly higher for those with nonspecific dizziness than for the other two groups. There were no significant differences in oVEMP and cVEMP parameters, and scores for oVEMP and cVEMP between patients with dizziness combined with orthostatic hypotension and those without dizziness. In terms of correlation analysis, the N23 latency of left neck (r\u202f=\u202f0.509, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), the N23 latency of right neck (r\u202f=\u202f0.495, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), and the amplitude of right neck (r\u202f=\u202f0.304, p\u202f=\u202f0.004) correlated positively with cVEMP score.\nPatients with PD without dizziness, with dizziness attributable to orthostatic hypotension, and with nonspecific dizziness may be all associated with vestibular dysfunction. The VEMP scores were highest in patients with nonspecific dizziness, so vestibular function is more severely affected in patients with nonspecific dizziness. The VEMP especially cVEMP may be useful for early diagnosis of nonspecific dizziness in PD.",

    "abstract": "Falls are a common and debilitating complication in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have primarily focused on cohorts with prevalent falls or advanced disease stages. This study assessed risk factors for falls in early-stage falls-na\u00efve cohort stratified by sex.\nA total of 172 PD patients (<5 years disease duration) were selected from a registry-based study that reported no falls at baseline. All patients were assessed with a standardized data extraction form and falls were defined according to UPDRS Item 13. Hazard Ratios were calculated with univariable and stepwise multivariable Cox Proportional Hazard regression models.\nAmong the study sample, 61 (35.4\u202f%) patients were female. At baseline, female and male PD groups were comparable in terms of age, disease duration, and UPDRS scores, although female PD patients had higher scores for UPDRS IV. Over a mean follow-up period of 3.9 (3.0) years, falls were reported in 13 female (21.3\u202f%) and 18 male (16.2\u202f%) PD patients. In female PD, motor fluctuations (HR [95\u202f%] = 1.8 [1.3 - 2.6], p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and postural stability (HR [95\u202f%] = 4.2 [1.6 - 10.6], p\u202f=\u202f0.003) emerged as significant predictors for falls, whereas in male PD, stepwise Cox regression selected freezing of gait (HR [95\u202f%] = 2.0 [1.0 - 4.2], p\u202f=\u202f0.053) and postural instability (HR [95\u202f%] = 2.2 [0.89 - 5.4], p\u202f=\u202f0.089) as the primary predictors for falls, although they were non-significant.\nOur findings suggest that the risk factors for falls differ between female and male early-stage PD patients, which may have important implications for clinical management.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in neurology have shifted focus from mere diagnosis to comprehensive management of movement disorders, particularly Parkinson's Disease (PD), which is rapidly increasing in prevalence due to global ageing trends. While age is a key risk factor for PD, centenarians often exhibit a remarkably low prevalence of the disease, presenting an intriguing paradox. This viewpoint explores potential reasons for this low prevalence, drawing on studies from regions with high centenarian populations, known as Blue Zones. The authors highlight the importance of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors in promoting healthy ageing and examines how these may contribute to the resilience against PD found in centenarians. By understanding the protective mechanisms in centenarians, particularly the concept of hormesis and factors like diet, exercise, and social connections, we may inform prevention strategies for PD. The study proposes the \"EAT, MOVE, SLEEP, PROTECT, and REPEAT\" approach as a framework for lifestyle interventions to counteract PD risk factors. Ultimately, centenarians offer valuable insights into delaying neurodegeneration, providing a model for potential preventive trials for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is accompanied by a complex array of nonmotor and motor manifestations. The exploration of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant active ingredient as potential therapeutic interventions in PD-associated mood alterations has gained significant attention. This study aimed to assess the antidepressant and anxiolytic properties of luteolin (LTN), a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory component, using a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced animal model of PD. Rats were administered LTN (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg, per oral) and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/per oral) over a 28-day period. Behavioral tests were employed to estimate the depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. Rats treated with LTN exhibited significant improvement in 6-OHDA-induced mood alterations, as per behavioral tests. Additionally, LTN treatment led to increased hippocampal levels of catalase and superoxide dismutase, and a reduction in malondialdehyde. LTN downregulated the gene expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)/nod-like receptor (NLR) pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) axis components, including NF-\u03baB, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase1 and reduced the protein level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), in addition to augmenting the protein levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. Furthermore, LTN exhibited an upregulatory effect on the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 within the hippocampus of 6-OHDA-induced PD rats. Also, molecular docking showed higher affinity between LTN and NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 axis components. These findings highlight the potential anxiolytic and antidepressant impacts of LTN through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms against 6-OHDA-induced alterations in a rat PD model.",

    "abstract": "It is difficult to distinguish Parkinson's disease (PD) in the early stage from those of various disorders including atypical Parkinson's syndrome (APS), vascular parkinsonism (VP), and even essential tremor (ET), because of the overlap of symptoms. Other, more challenging problems will arise when Parkinson's disease develops into Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) in the middle and late stages. At this time, the differential diagnosis of PDD and DLB becomes thorny. These complicate the diagnostic process for PD, which traditionally heavily relies on symptomatic assessment and treatment response. Recent advances have identified several biomarkers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), including \u03b1-synuclein, lysosomal enzymes, fatty acid-binding proteins, and neurofilament light chain, whose concentration differs in PD and the related diseases. However, not all these molecules can effectively discriminate PD from related disorders. This review advocates for a paradigm shift toward biomarker-based diagnosis to effectively distinguish between PD and similar conditions. These biomarkers may reflect the diversity that exist among different diseases and provide an effective way to accurately understand their mechanisms. This review focused on blood and CSF biomarkers of PD that may have differential diagnostic value and the related molecular measurement methods with high diagnostic performance due to emerging technologies.",

    "abstract": "Classification of disease and healthy volunteer cohorts provides a useful clinical alternative to traditional group statistics due to individualized, personalized predictions. Classifiers for neurodegenerative disease can be trained on structural MRI morphometry, but require large multi-scanner datasets, introducing confounding batch effects. We test ComBat, a common harmonization model, in an example application to classify subjects with Parkinson's disease from healthy volunteers and identify common pitfalls, including data leakage. We used a multi-dataset cohort of 372 subjects (216 with Parkinson's disease, 156 healthy volunteers) from 11 identified scanners. We extracted both FreeSurfer and the determinant of Jacobian morphometry to compare single-scanner and multi-scanner classification pipelines. We confirm the presence of batch effects by running single scanner classifiers which could achieve wildly divergent AUCs on scanner-specific datasets (mean:0.651 \u00b1 0.144). Multi-scanner classifiers that considered neurobiological batch effects between sites could easily achieve a test AUC of 0.902, though pipelines that prevented data leakage could only achieve a test AUC of 0.550. We conclude that batch effects remain a major issue for classification problems, such that even impressive single-scanner classifiers are unlikely to generalize to multiple scanners, and that solving for batch effects in a classifier problem must avoid circularity and reporting overly optimistic results.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the cortical and subcortical gray matter volume (GMV) and cognitive impairment (CI) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nIn this study, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the cortex and subcortex was conducted on 92 individuals diagnosed with PD and 92 healthy controls (HCs). PD patients were divided into three groups: PD with normal cognition (PD-NC, \nCompared to the HCs, the PD-NC group exhibited reduced GMV in the right middle frontal gyrus (RMFG), right precentral gyrus medial segment (RPGMS), left temporal pole, and right superior frontal gyrus medial segment (RSFGMS). In comparison to the HC and PD-NC groups, the PD-MCI and PD-SCI groups (respectively) demonstrated significant decreases in GMV in the right caudate, left hippocampus, left thalamus, RMFG, RPGMS, RSFGMS, and cerebellum (right crus\u2009I and left crus\u2009I). The regression analysis indicated that changes in the GMV of the frontal areas can predict cognitive test outcomes.\nCompared to HCs, PD patients with CI presented significant volume reductions in the RC, LH, LT, RMFG, RPGMS, RSFGMS, and the right and left crus I regions. Consequently, as average GMV atrophy increased in the specified regions, PD patients exhibited more severe cognitive impairment than the HC group. This may be attributed to the initial pathological loss of frontal GMV (especially in the RMFG and RPGMS regions), which could subsequently lead to subcortical dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Bilateral lesions of the basal ganglia using termocoagulation or radiation for improving tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been performed starting several decades ago, especially when levodopa and deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery were not available. However, because of unclear additional benefit compared to unilateral lesion, and particularly to the evidence of increased adverse events occurrence, bilateral lesions were basically abandoned at the end of the 20th century. Therefore, bilateral DBS has become the standard procedure to treat PD. Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is an emerging incisionless technique used to produce therapeutic brain ablation. The positive experiences of unilateral MRgFUS ablation for PD, along with the preliminary favorable outcomes of bilateral thalamic MRgFUS for essential tremor, raise the possibility to eventually reintroduce bilateral lesioning in the management of PD motor features. This possibility has so far only been tested in a few small studies. This article reviews the evidence of bilateral lesioning of the basal ganglia to treat PD, and elaborates on current gaps, controversies, and perspectives of the different available neurosurgical procedures and specifically of MRgFUS ablation. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Camptocormia has been considered to contribute to vertical gait instability and, at times, may also lead to forward instability in experimental settings in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these aspects, along with compensatory mechanisms, remain largely unexplored. This study comprehensively investigated gait instability and compensatory strategies in PD patients with camptocormia (PD+CC).\nTen PD+CC, 30 without camptocormia (PD-CC), and 27 healthy controls (HCs) participated. Self-paced gait tasks were analyzed using three-dimensional motion capture systems to assess gait stability, spatiotemporal, and kinematic parameters. Unique cases with pronounced forward gait stability or instability were first identified, followed by group comparisons. Correlation analysis was performed to examine associations between trunk flexion angles (lower/upper) and gait parameters. Significance level was set at 0.05.\nExcluding one unique case, the PD+CC group showed a significantly lower vertical center of mass (COM) position (p=0.019), along with increased mediolateral COM velocity (p=0.004) and step width (p=0.013), compared to PD-CC group. Both PD groups showed higher anterior-posterior margin of stability than HCs (p<0.001). Significant correlations were found between lower/upper trunk flexion angles and a lower vertical COM position (r=-0.690/-0.332), as well as increased mediolateral COM velocity (r=0.374/0.446) and step width (r=0.580/0.474).\nMost PD+CC patients exhibited vertical gait instability, increasing fall risk, and adopted compensatory strategies involving greater lateral COM shift and wider base of support, with these trends intensifying as trunk flexion angles increased. These findings may guide targeted interventions for gait instability in PD+CC.",

    "abstract": "In recognising emotions expressed by others, one can make use of both embodied cognition and mechanisms that do not necessarily require activation of the limbic system, such as evoking from memory the meaning of morphological features of the observed face. Instead, we believe that the recognition of the authenticity of an emotional expression is primarily based on embodied cognition, for which the mirror system would play a significant role. To verify this hypothesis, we submitted 20 parkinsonian patients and 20 healthy control subjects to the Emotional Authenticity Recognition test, a novel test using dynamic stimuli to evaluate the ability to recognise emotions and their authenticity. Analysis of variance of the test scores shows that Parkinsonian patients perform worse than controls when they had to recognise the authenticity of emotions, although they are able to identify them. Our results confirm a deficit in the recognition of the authenticity of emotions in patients with Parkinson's disease attributable to the disruption of extrapiramidal limbic circuit between ventral striatum and orbitomesial-prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are classified as \u03b1-synucleinopathies and are primarily differentiated by their clinical phenotypes. Delineating these diseases based on their specific \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) proteoform pathologies is crucial for accurate antemortem biomarker diagnosis. Newly identified \u03b1-Syn pathologies in PD raise questions about whether MSA exhibits a similar diversity. This prompted the need for a comparative study focusing on \u03b1-Syn epitope-specific immunoreactivities in both diseases, which could clarify the extent of pathological overlap and diversity, and guide more accurate biomarker development.\nWe utilised a multiplex immunohistochemical approach to detect multiple structural domains of \u03b1-Syn proteoforms across multiple regions prone to pathological accumulation in MSA (n\u2009=\u200910) and PD (n\u2009=\u200910). Comparison of epitope-specific \u03b1-Syn proteoforms was performed in the MSA medulla, inferior olivary nucleus, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and cerebellum, and in the PD olfactory bulb, medulla, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex.\nN-terminus and C-terminus antibodies detected significantly more \u03b1-Syn pathology in MSA than antibodies for phosphorylated (pS129) \u03b1-Syn, which are classically used to detect \u03b1-Syn. Importantly, C-terminus immunolabelling is more pronounced in MSA compared to PD. Meanwhile, N-terminus immunolabelling consistently detected the highest percentage of \u03b1-Syn across pathologically burdened regions of both diseases, which could be of biological significance. As expected, oligodendroglial involvement distinguished MSA from PD, but in contrast to PD, no substantial astrocytic or microglial \u03b1-Syn accumulation in MSA occurred. These data confirm glial-specific changes between these diseases when immunolabelling the N-terminus epitope. In comparison, N-terminus neuronal \u03b1-Syn was present in PD and MSA, with most MSA neurons lacking pS129 \u03b1-Syn proteoforms. This explains why characterisation of neuronal MSA pathologies is lacking and challenges the reliance on pS129 antibodies for the accurate quantification of \u03b1-Syn pathological load across \u03b1-synucleinopathies.\nThese findings underscore the necessity of utilising a multiplex approach to detect \u03b1-Syn, most importantly including the N-terminus, to capture the entire spectrum of \u03b1-Syn proteoforms in \u03b1-synucleinopathies. The data provide novel insights toward the biological differentiation of these \u03b1-synucleinopathies and pave the way for more refined antemortem diagnostic methods to facilitate early identification and intervention of these neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with functional and structural alterations beyond the nigrostriatal dopamine projection. However, the structural-functional (SC-FC) coupling changes in combination with subcortical regions at the network level are rarely investigated in PD.\nSC-FC coupling networks were systematically constructed using the structural connectivity obtained by diffusion tensor imaging and the functional connectivity obtained by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in 53 PD and 72 age- and sex-matched healthy controls\u00a0(HCs). Then, we explored how SC-FC coupling varied within and between several well-defined functional domains.\nResults showed that the SC-FC coupling in patients with PD was globally reduced in comparison with HCs.\u00a0Specifically,\u00a0regional SC-FC decoupled in the inferior parietal lobule, occipitotemporal cortex, motor cortex, and higher-order association cortex in patients with PD. Moreover, PD showed intranetwork SC-FC decoupling in the visual network (VIS), limbic and higher-order association networks. Furthermore, internetwork decoupling mainly linked to the VIS, the somatomotor network (SOM), the dorsal attention network, and the default mode network, was observed, increased internetwork coupling was found between the subcortical network and the SOM in PD (all p\u2009<\u20090.05, FDR corrected).\nThese findings suggest that PD is characterized by SC-FC decoupling in topological organization of multiscale brain networks, providing insights into the brain network mechanisms in PD.",

    "abstract": "Pain is reported as one of the most troubling symptoms for people with Parkinson's (PwP); however, the literature exploring their lived experience of pain and how to manage it is limited. Pain affects PwP at all stages of their condition and can fluctuate and change over time. Therefore, it is pertinent to speak to PwP to understand their experiences of pain to inform the development of tailored behavioural interventions to manage pain. How pain interacts with other Parkinson's symptoms lacks consensus. Gaining a better understanding of this from the perspective of PwP is important to inform interventions. Exploring the behavioural determinants, including the barriers and enablers to pain management from the perspective of PwP, the role of healthcare professionals and impact of other symptoms alongside pain will inform the development of a fit for purpose, pain management toolkit for PwP.\nA longitudinal qualitative study using semi structured interviews at two time points within an 18-month period will be conducted. PwP living with pain will be purposefully sampled from four NHS sites in the North of England. Data will be thematically analysed with reference to the Theoretical Domains Framework.\nA favourable ethical opinion has been granted by the National Health Service East Midlands-Derby Research Ethics Committee (22/EM/0176) and the NHS Health Research Authority (IRAS ID 316403). Findings will be disseminated via scientific conferences, academic journals, lay summaries and public engagement events.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized by predominantly motor symptoms. However, recent research has broadened our understanding of PD by revealing its impact on non-motor functions, including ocular manifestations. This review explored the intricate relationship between PD and ocular health, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying common ocular diseases such as dry eye disease, cataract, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. It also underscores the importance of recognizing ocular manifestations as potential early markers of PD, as well as their impact on patients' daily activities, necessitating prompt identification and intervention to prevent complications and enhance the overall quality of life. Furthermore, future research should prioritize unraveling the potential association between PD and other prevalent ocular diseases, such as myopia, to formulate effective treatment strategies.",

Brain extracellular matrix (ECM) accounts for 10-20\u00a0% of the total brain volume and is responsible for the physical organization of neuronal and glia cells. Blood-based biomarkers quantifying ECM fragments holds the potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Here we evaluated the serum ECM biomarkers C1M, C4M, TUM, SPARC-M and BGM in healthy donors and patients diagnosed with PD. The biomarkers were able to separate between healthy donors and PD patients with an AUC up to 0.926. These pathologically relevant biomarkers could be used as biomarkers in clinical management.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) improves motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its effect on motivation is controversial. Apathy, the lack of motivation, commonly occurs in PD and is often exacerbated after surgery and its concomitant levodopa reduction. Apathy and reward processing are associated with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which standard targeting strategies avoid by targeting the dorsolateral STN. Since apathy can be a levodopa-responsive PD symptom, levodopa withdrawal could unmask apathy without sufficient stimulation of non-motor pathways, similar to the persistence of motor symptoms when motor pathways are underengaged with DBS.\nUsing an individualized tractography model, maximized left-sided vmPFC engagement following a DBS adjustment improved apathy in a case example. We, therefore, retrospectively investigated the moderating role of stimulation-related left-sided vmPFC connectivity and levodopa reduction on changes in apathy after STN DBS (N\u00a0=\u00a028).\nWe measured apathy (Starkstein Apathy Scale) and levodopa dose pre- and post-surgery. Stimulation-related connectivity was quantified using patient-specific diffusion-weighted MRI and probabilistic tractography to test the interaction with levodopa reduction.\nEffective DBS of the dorsolateral STN included prefrontal non-motor connections. We found a significant interaction between levodopa dose change and STN-connections to the left vmPFC. Apathy severity negatively correlated with stimulation-related connectivity to the left vmPFC in patients with greater levodopa reductions. Apathy change was unrelated to motor pathway connectivity.\nInsufficient stimulation of the left vmPFC and associated limbic fronto-subthalamic connections combined with high levodopa reduction contributed to DBS-related apathy in PD, which may inspire novel personalized non-motor targeting strategies.",

    "abstract": "Astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation plays a key role in Parkinson's disease (PD) progression. The proinflammatory protein S100A9 is linked to various neurodegenerative diseases, but its involvement in astrocyte activation in PD remains unclear. Here, we investigate the role of S100A9 in astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation in PD. C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 15\u00a0mg/kg four times daily) and subsequently treated with Paquinimod, a S100A9 inhibitor (7\u00a0mg/kg, once daily for 7\u00a0days, totaling 8 doses). We observed an abnormal increase in S100A9 protein expression and a rise in S100A9-positive cells in the striatum of PD mice. Paquinimod treatment significantly improved behavioral deficits (pole test, rotarod test, traction test, and open field tests), prevented the reduction in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein and the loss of dopaminergic neurons (TH",

    "abstract": "Curcumin is a hydrophobic polyphenolic compound with potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether it can achieve therapeutic effects by alleviating neuroinflammation in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and its potential mechanism are still unknown. This study explored the effects of curcumin on neuroinflammation in dopaminergic neurons and deciphered its direct target in the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)-Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) pathway, revealing the potential role of curcumin in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Here, we show that curcumin alleviated the degeneration of neurons in a PD model by mitigating the activation of the NLRP3-mediated inflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we discovered that curcumin prevented neuroinflammation by blocking the HDAC6-NLRP3 pathway in a PD model. Moreover, overexpression of HDAC6 could eliminate the effect of curcumin on the neuroinflammatory response mediated by NLRP3. Curcumin and the HDAC6 inhibitor WT161 could alleviate neurodegeneration. In addition, activated HDAC6 directly deacetylated NLRP3 at lysine 84 to maintain its stability, which increased the inflammatory response and promoted neurodegeneration. These findings show that curcumin, a neuroinflammation inhibitor, blocks neurodegeneration via the HDAC6-NLRP3 pathway and represents a potentially practical pharmacological approach for treating neuroinflammation-driven neurodegenerative diseases. For the first time, HDAC6 was shown to directly regulate the acetylation of NLRP3.",

    "abstract": "Identifying Parkinson's disease (PD) during its initial phases presents considerable hurdles for clinicians.\nTo examine the feasibility and efficacy of a machine learning model based on quantitative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features in identifying early-stage PD.\nWe recruited 33 participants, including 19 with early-stage PD, 14 with advanced-stage PD and 20 healthy control subjects. Each participant underwent both quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). We utilized combined QSM and DKI features to establish a support vector machine (SVM) model to identify early-stage PD.\nWhen comparing early-stage PD with healthy controls, the SVM model exhibited moderate performance, achieving a training set accuracy of 0.78 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.90, and the accuracy of 0.77 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.87) in the test set. When comparing advanced-stage PD with healthy controls, the SVM model exhibited equally high accuracy in both training (0.97, AUC\u2009=\u20090.97) and test (0.94, AUC\u2009=\u20090.94) sets. In discriminating between early-stage PD and advanced-stage PD, the SVM model achieved an accuracy of 0.80 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.81) in the training set and an accuracy of 0.71 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.72) in the test set. The mean kurtosis feature of DKI in the substantia nigra, played a significant role in classification.\nThese findings suggest that early PD is associated with specific MRI features reflecting magnetic susceptibility and microstructural changes. The SVM model combining quantitative QSM and DKI features holds promise for improving early PD diagnosis.",

In discriminating between early-stage PD and advanced-stage PD, the SVM model achieved an accuracy of 0.80 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.81) in the training set and an accuracy of 0.71 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.72) in the test set. The mean kurtosis feature of DKI in the substantia nigra, played a significant role in classification.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily recognized for its motor symptoms, yet non-motor symptoms (NMS) such as neuropsychiatric disturbances, sleep disorders, autonomic dysfunction, and sensory abnormalities significantly contribute to the disease's overall burden. While traditional pharmacological and surgical treatments have primarily targeted motor symptoms, alternative therapies such as acupuncture, cognitive therapy, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are gaining attention for managing NMS. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of alternative therapies for NMS in PD, drawing on evidence from international guidelines and TCM. The review highlights the current gaps in research, emphasizing the need for high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and standardized protocols, particularly in the evaluation of TCM therapies. Additionally, it underscores the potential of integrated treatment approaches that combine traditional and modern medicine, offering a personalized strategy for managing NMS in PD. By addressing these challenges, this review aims to enhance the understanding and application of alternative therapies, ultimately improving the quality of life for PD patients. These therapies, particularly those emphasizing holistic and individualized approaches, such as cognitive therapy and TCM, offer potential solutions to the unmet needs in PD management without causing side effects associated with medications or fluctuations in drug plasma levels.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative pathology of the central nervous system. The well-known abnormalities characteristic of PD are dysfunctions in the nigrostriatal system including the substantia nigra of the midbrain and the striatum. Moreover, in PD persons, alpha-synucleinopathy is associated with abnormalities in the dopaminergic brain system. To study the mechanisms of this pathology, genetic models in mice have been designed. Transgenic mice of the B6.Cg-Tg(Prnp-SNCA*A53T)23Mkle/J strain (referred to as B6.Cg-Tg further in the text) possess the A53T mutation in the human alpha-synuclein SNCA gene. The density of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra and striatum in B6.Cg-Tg mice was assessed in our previous work, but the dopaminergic system was not studied there, although it plays a key role in the development of PD. The aim of the current study was to investigate motor coordination and body balance, as well as dopaminergic neuronal density and alpha-synuclein accumulation in the substantia nigra in male B6.Cg-Tg mice at the age of six months. Wild-type mice of the same sex and age, siblings of the B6.Cg-Tg mice from the same litters, lacking the SNCA gene with the A53T mutation, but expressing murine alpha-synuclein, were used as controls (referred to as the wild type further in the text). Motor coordination and body balance were assessed with the rota-rod test; the density of dopaminergic neurons and accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra were evaluated by the immunohistochemical method. There was no difference between B6.Cg-Tg mice and WT siblings in motor coordination and body balance. However, accumulation of alpha-synuclein and a decrease in the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra were found in the B6.Cg-Tg mouse strain. Thus, the mice of the B6.Cg-Tg strain at the age of six months have some symptoms of the onset of PD, such as the accumulation of mutant alpha-synuclein and a decrease in the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Taken together, the results obtained in our work qualify the B6.Cg-Tg strain as a pertinent model for studying the early stage of human PD already at the age of six months.\n\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f) \u2013 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder without a definitive cure. Oriental exercises (OEs) have emerged as a complementary and alternative therapy for PD, but their efficacy in ameliorating non-motor symptoms (NMS) and quality of life (QOL) remains uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis actively investigated the efficacy of OEs in addressing NMS and enhancing QOL and sought to offer recommendations for optimal OE regimens for PD patients. By analyzing 30 controlled trials involving 2029 participants, we found that OEs significantly improved cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and QOL compared to control groups. Specifically, significant improvements were observed in several outcome measures: Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ) [MD: [Formula: see text]3.67, 95% CI: [Formula: see text]5.72-[Formula: see text]1.63, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]%], Parkinson's Disease Non-Motor Symptom Questionnaire (NMSQ) [MD: [Formula: see text]2.34, 95% CI: [Formula: see text]4.67-[Formula: see text]0.01, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]%], Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [MD: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.46-2.03, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]%], Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) [MD: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.49-1.24, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]%], Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) [MD: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.16-1.81, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]%], Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) [MD: [Formula: see text]4.27, 95% CI: [Formula: see text]6.85-[Formula: see text]1.69, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]%], Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) [MD: [Formula: see text]0.24, 95% CI: [Formula: see text]0.32-[Formula: see text]0.16, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]%], and the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) [MD: [Formula: see text]0.37, 95% CI: [Formula: see text]0.48-[Formula: see text]0.25, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]%]. Our findings provide compelling evidence for the potential benefits of OEs in managing NMS and improving QOL in PD patients. To optimize outcomes, we recommend customizing OE regimens based on individual clinical phenotypes, and to validate these results we emphasize the need for rigorous, large-scale studies.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive functions are reduced in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The current study attempted to elucidate whether DBS alters the functional connectivity (FC) pattern of cognitive networks in PD patients.\nThe study obtained fMRI and cognitive scale data from 37 PD patients before and after the DBS surgery. Seed-based FC analysis helped demonstrate the FC changes of the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and dorsal attention network (DAN).\nPD patients indicated significant network connectivity decline in DMN [such as in right precuneus, left angular gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG)], ECN [such as in left inferior parietal gyrus, left MFG, and left supplementary motor area (SMA)], and DAN [such as in left inferior frontal gyrus and left MFG] post-DBS surgery. The phonemic fluency score was positively associated with the FC value of the right precuneus and left angular gyrus in DMN before DBS.\nThe general reduction in FC in the major cognitive networks after DBS surgery depicted the presence of the corresponding network reorganization. Further research can help explore the mechanism of impaired cognitive function post-DBS.",

    "abstract": "Dance has emerged as a complementary treatment that may promote adaptive neural plasticity while improving symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD), such as balance, gait, posture, and walking. Understanding brain changes that arise from participation in dance interventions is important as these neural plastic changes play an important role in protecting and healing the brain. Although dance has been shown to improve PD motor and nonmotor symptoms, the neural mechanisms underlying these changes, specifically depression and mood, remain elusive. Further, many side effects of PD drug treatments can be exacerbated or even induced by dopaminergic drugs, particularly depression and anxiety, making these nonmotor symptoms more noticeable throughout the progression of the disease.\nIn this study, we focused on the impact of dance interventions on PD nonmotor symptoms by conducting an 8-month observational study, tracking the relationship between depression scores and functional neuroimaging measures for people with PD.\nA total of 34 dancers-23 (68%) people with PD and 11 (32%) healthy controls-completed the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) before and after attending weekly community-based dance classes, referred to as Dance for PD classes. Specifically, we examined changes within the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal from the subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG), an important node within the depression network and a controversial target for deep brain stimulation in the treatment of major depressive disorder.\nDepression scores on the GDS decreased in each preintervention to postintervention comparison (all P<.025). In addition, GDS scores also improved over the 8-month dance period (all P<.01). Blood oxygen level-dependent signals from frontal cortex brain region implicated for emotional regulation within the SCG decreased at each testing time point (all P<.05). Also, a significant decrease in depression scores (GDS) was correlated with reduced blood oxygen level-dependent signals from the SCG (P=.02).\nThis study contributes to an improved understanding of the neural mechanisms that are involved in depression, as well as the beneficial contribution that longitudinal dance interventions have in reducing nonmotor symptoms associated with PD, particularly in depression symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction, affecting 75-90\u00a0% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, holds significant predictive value for PD development. Advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion MRI (dMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), offer insights into structural and functional changes within olfactory pathways. This review summarizes a decade of research on MRI-based connectivity of the olfactory system in PD, focusing on structural and functional alterations in olfactory brain areas and their links to early olfactory processing changes. Fifteen dMRI and eighteen fMRI studies met inclusion criteria and were carefully reviewed. Among the studies investigating diffusion metrics, the most consistent finding was the reduction of fractional anisotropy in the olfactory tract and anterior olfactory structures, though evidence correlating this result to olfactory dysfunction is limited and contrasting. dMRI support the hypothesis that olfactory function may be correlated to structural alterations at the network-level. In contrast, fMRI studies found more consistent evidence of dysconnectivity in both primary and secondary olfactory areas as directly correlated to olfactory processing and dysfunction. Results suggest a potential dissociation between structural alterations in olfactory brain regions and early functional impairment in olfactory processing, likely related to different patient subtypes. Heterogeneity in clinical and technical factors may limit the generalizability of the results, leaving room for further investigations. By providing a comprehensive perspective on the use of dMRI and fMRI to explore the olfactory connectome in PD, our review might facilitate future research towards earlier diagnosis and more targeted therapeutic and neurorehabilitation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and biomarkers are needed to enhance earlier detection and monitoring. Alpha-synuclein, phosphorylated at serine 129 (pS129-\u03b1-syn), is the predominant form of \u03b1-syn found in Lewy bodies implicating an involvement in disease pathology. This review aims to systematically evaluate the evidence for pS129-\u03b1-syn detection in human biofluid samples of PD utilizing ELISA-based protein detection methods.\nA systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Electronic searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from inception to November 7th, 2024, to identify studies comparing pS129-\u03b1-syn in biofluids of PD patients with controls or related neurodegenerative disease. Risk of bias was assessed for each study.\nTwenty-three publications met the inclusion criteria, with pS129-\u03b1-syn detected in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, red blood cells, serum, and saliva exosomes. Overall, pS129-\u03b1-syn levels were elevated in patients with PD compared to controls, and in some studies, correlated with disease severity. There was no consistent pattern when comparing PD patients to those with related neurodegenerative diseases. Significant variability in pS129-\u03b1-syn levels and considerable overlap between groups may limit the utility as a biomarker.\nWhile pS129-\u03b1-syn for PD shows some promise as a diagnostic marker for PD, its differential diagnostic utility remains limited. Further research involving larger cohorts is required. The greatest potential for pS129-\u03b1-syn may be as part of a panel with other PD-specific markers, to enhance diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between acoustic and cortical brain features in Parkinson's disease patients.\nWe recruited 19 (eight females, 11 males) Parkinson's disease patients and 19 (eight females, 11 males) healthy subjects to participate in the experiment. Speech samples of three vowels (/i/, /a/, /u/), six plosives (/p/, /p\u02b0/, /t/, /t\u02b0/, /k/, /k\u02b0/), and three voiced consonants (/l/, /m/, /n/) were collected for the experiment, and the acoustic parameters were extracted for fundamental frequency (F0), voice onset time (VOT), voicing onset-vocalic voicing onset (VO-VVO), first formant (F1), second formant (F2), third formant (F3), first bandwidth (B1), second bandwidth (B2), third bandwidth (B3), Jitter, Shimmer, and\u00a0Harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR). We also used Ingenia CX 3.0\u00a0T to complete the cranial magnetic resonance scanning and did image processing based on the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville Atlas. We assessed the differences in acoustic and neuroimaging parameters between the PD and\u00a0healthy controls (HCs) groups using the Levene's test (LT), two-sample independent t test (TT), and Mann-Whitney U test (MWUT), and calculated Spearman's bias correlations for acoustic and neuroimaging parameters in the PD and HC groups, respectively.\nThe results showed that in acoustic features, based on the results of the TT, it can be seen that the F3 of the PD group regarding the vowel /i/ is significantly smaller than that of the HC group. The jitter on the vowel /u/ was significantly higher in the male PD group than in the male HC group. For other acoustic measures, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. In the cortical features, the thickness, area, and volume of the cortex were reduced in the vast majority of the brains of the PD patients, however, there is also a small portion of the cortex that appears to be thickened. In the correlation analysis between cortical and acoustic features, F0, F1, F2, F3, B2, B3, VO-VVO, Jitter, HNR, and VOT acoustic parameters showed significant and strong correlation with thickness, area, and volume of cortical sites such as frontal, temporal, entorhinal, fusiform, and\u00a0precuneus in PD patients, whereas no significant correlation was found in HC group.\nThis suggests that Parkinson's disease does have an effect on the acoustic and cortical features of the patient's brain, and that there is a correlation between the two features.",

For other acoustic measures, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. In the cortical features, the thickness, area, and volume of the cortex were reduced in the vast majority of the brains of the PD patients, however, there is also a small portion of the cortex that appears to be thickened. In the correlation analysis between cortical and acoustic features, F0, F1, F2, F3, B2, B3, VO-VVO, Jitter, HNR, and VOT acoustic parameters showed significant and strong correlation with thickness, area, and volume of cortical sites such as frontal, temporal, entorhinal, fusiform, and\u00a0precuneus in PD patients, whereas no significant correlation was found in HC group.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsonian syndromes are characterised by similar motor-related symptomology resulting from dopaminergic neuron damage. While Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent parkinsonism, we also focus on two other variants, Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Due to the clinical similarities of these parkinsonisms, and since definite diagnoses are only possible post-mortem, effective therapies and novel biomarkers of disease are scarce. Thus, we explore the current findings relating to the relationship of parkinsonism proteinopathy (\u03b1-synuclein in PD, and tau in PSP/CBD) paralleled to a specific form of cell death, ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is characterised by iron-induced lipid peroxidation and several markers of this pathway have been identified to control intracellular iron fluctuations. However, in parkinsonism, these mechanisms are thought to become dysfunctional. Although both proteinopathies have been linked to ferroptosis, much less is known about ferroptotic cell death and tau in the context of PSP/CBD. Interestingly, clinical trials targeting iron have recently shown conflicting results which begs to question the complexity of the ferroptotic pathway and alludes to the need for exploring other ferroptosis-related machinery as possible therapeutic targets. Overall, we address the literature gap in parkinsonism proteinopathy and ferroptosis, and its relevance to understanding disease pathophysiology and aetiology.",

    "abstract": "Defective clearance and accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) is the key pathogenic factor in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies emphasize the importance of E3 ligases in regulating the degradation of \u03b1-Syn. However, the molecular mechanisms by which deubiquitinases regulate \u03b1-Syn degradation are scarcely studied. In this study, it is found that the protein levels of \u03b1-Syn are negatively regulated by ovarian tumor protease deubiquitinase 5 (OTUD5) which protects dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the PD model. Mechanistically, OTUD5 promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of \u03b1-Syn independent of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity and mediates its endolysosomal degradation by recruiting the E3 ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (NEDD4). Furthermore, OTUD5 conditional knockout\u00a0in DA neurons results in more severe \u03b1-Syn related pathology and dyskinesia after injection of \u03b1-Syn preformed fibrils (PFF). Overall, the data unveil a novel mechanism to regulate the degradation of \u03b1-Syn and provide a new therapeutic strategy to alleviate DA neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "The complex pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) requires comprehensive understanding and multi-pronged interventions for communication between nerve cells. Despite new developments in nanotechnology in the treatment of PD, in-depth exploration of their biological effects, in particular, the specific mechanisms of inflammation inhibition are lacking. Herein, using the stable cascade catalysis channel formed by polydopamine (PDA), imidazole groups, and Cu ions, a microgel system comprising functional monomers [superoxide dismutase (SOD) with double bonds, PDA, 2-methacryloyloxy ethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), and Cu ions] is proposed for managing PD. The microgel can be efficiently delivered to the brain aided by MPC, after which a multi-level regulatory strategy targeting neurons and microglia can be initiated. The catalytic activity cascade elicited by SOD and Cu ions can regulate the anti-inflammatory phenotypic transformation of microglia by relieving oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the dopamine (DA) released from PDA can facilitate DA storage and neurogenesis, inhibiting CX3CL1 release and the CX3CR1 receptor on microglia and further regulating the CX3CL1/CX3CR1-NF-\u03baB-NLRP3 signaling pathway in microglia to inhibit neuroinflammation. Therefore, the proposed microgel delivery system with functional monomers represents a promising therapeutic strategy for managing neuroinflammation and promoting neurogenesis in PD by intervening chemokine axis-mediated communication between neurons and microglia.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) prevalence is projected to reach 12 million by 2040. Wearable sensors offer a promising approach for comfortable, continuous tremor monitoring to optimize treatment strategies. Here, we present a wristwatch-like triboelectric sensor (WW-TES) inspired by automatic watches for unobtrusive PD tremor assessment. The WW-TES utilizes a free-standing design with a surface-modified polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film and a stainless-steel rotor within a biocompatible polylactic acid (PLA) package. Electrode distance is optimized to maximize the output signal. We propose and discuss the WW-TES working mechanism. The final design is validated for activities of daily living (ADLs), with varying signal amplitudes corresponding to tremor severity levels (\"normal\" to \"severe\") based on MDS-UPDRS tremor frequency. Wavelet packet transform (WPT) is employed for signal analysis during ADLs. The WW-TES demonstrates the potential for continuous tremor monitoring, offering an accurate screening of severity and comfortable, unobtrusive wearability.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurological disorder primarily affecting motor control, clinically characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and other symptoms that significantly diminish the quality of life. Currently, available treatments only alleviate symptoms without halting or delaying disease progression. There is a significant association between PD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), possibly due to shared pathological mechanisms such as insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. PD is caused by a deficiency of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain that plays a critical role in the control of movement. Glucose metabolism and energy metabolism disorders also play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. This review investigates the neuroprotective mechanisms of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its receptor agonists, offering novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies for PD. GLP-1 class drugs, primarily used in diabetes management, show promise in addressing PD's underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, including energy metabolism and neuroprotection. These drugs can cross the blood-brain barrier, improve insulin resistance, stabilize mitochondrial function, and enhance neuronal survival and function. Additionally, they exhibit significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress effects, which are crucial in neurodegenerative diseases like PD. Research indicates that GLP-1 receptor agonists could improve both motor and cognitive symptoms in PD patients, marking a potential breakthrough in PD treatment and prevention. Further exploration of GLP-1's molecular mechanisms in PD could provide new preventive and therapeutic approaches, especially for PD patients with concurrent T2DM. By targeting both metabolic and neurodegenerative pathways, GLP-1 receptor agonists represent a multifaceted approach to PD treatment, offering hope for better disease management and improved patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder. There is a certain pathological connection between PD and dysphonia. Speech signals have been successfully used to identify PD and predict its severity. Moreover, PD has several subtypes, such as tremor, freezing of gait and dysphagia. The recognition of subtypes is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of PD. In this paper, we consider PD subtype recognition as a multi-label learning task and try to simultaneously recognize these subtypes using speech signals. In the proposed recognition framework, multiple types of speech data are collected, such as/a/,/pa-ka-la/, etc., and different speech features are extracted from different types of speech data. The features are concatenated as the representation of speech data. Especially, a multi-label speech feature selection algorithm based on graph structure is proposed to choose the key features and followed by a multi-label classifier for PD subtype recognition. The speech samples of 70 PD patients are collected as speech corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-label feature selection method can obtain higher recognition performance than other classical ones in most cases.",

For Parkinson's disease (PD), somatosensory abnormalities may accompany motor dysfunction in early disease stages when dopaminergic degeneration is limited to the basal ganglia. It remains unclear whether, based on the network-spread account, these abnormalities emanated from aberrant functional connectivity with the basal ganglia, and whether interventions normalizing this connectivity could reverse these abnormalities. Here, we employed functional MRI to record brain responses to tactile stimuli in patients with idiopathic PD and healthy controls before and after three-week rhythmic auditory stimulation-assisted gait (RASg) training. Consistent with the presence of striatal degeneration, patients showed right posterior putamen (pPut) hypoactivation when detecting tactile stimuli of their left leg. They also exhibited reduced functional connectivity from the right pPut to the right parietal somatosensory region (inferior parietal lobule, IPL), whose hypoactivation reflected patients' impaired tactile detectability. Importantly, this dysconnectivity predicted right IPL hypoactivation, indicating that pPut-IPL dysconnectivity underlay patients' impaired tactile detectability. Intriguingly, RASg training normalized patients' tactile detectability, which was mirrored by normalization of right IPL activation and pPut-IPL connectivity. Training-induced changes in pPut-IPL connectivity predicted changes in IPL activation during tactile detection, reinforcing the role of pPut-IPL connectivity in patients' tactile detectability. These findings suggest that somatosensory abnormalities in PD may arise from the spread of striatal pathology to relevant cortical regions. Rhythmic auditory-motor training acts to recover striatal connectivity, improving PD patients' somatosensory deficits.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this meta-analysis was to conduct a comparative study by systematically examining and analyzing trials that studied the impacts of levodopa and bromocriptine, either separately or together, in treating Parkinson's disease (PD).\nAn extensive literature search was conducted across PubMed (Medline), Scopus, and Web of Science databases, using targeted keywords for studies published up to October 2024. The methodological quality of included RCTs was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool, and bias evaluation was performed using RevMan (version 5). Statistical analyses were conducted in STATA version 17, applying random-effects models. The overall quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach.\nThe thorough evaluation identified 12 randomized controlled trials with a total of 4,060 participants, 1,956 in the intervention group and 2,104 in the comparison group, all diagnosed with PD. A combined effect size of 0.18 (SMD: 0.18; 95% CI: -0.03, 0.39) was found through quantitative analysis of motor scales for the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). An effect size of 0.50 (OR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.80) was determined for dyskinesia. Dystonia occurrences showed a significant effect size of 0.44 (OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.81; I2: 87.28%; P value: 0.0001). Hallucination and dizziness occurrences showed effect sizes of 0.91 (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.36, 2.30) and 1.36 (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.91, 2.04) overall, respectively. Quality assessment revealed high-certainty evidence for dyskinesia and dystonia reduction with bromocriptine, while other outcomes showed low to very low certainty. Meta-regression analyses showed no significant correlation between population characteristics and outcomes.\nThis thorough meta-analysis offers an understanding of how bromocriptine compares in effectiveness to levodopa and other treatments for managing PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease affecting nearly 10 million people worldwide and placing a heavy medical burden on both society and families. However, due to the complexity of its pathological mechanisms, current treatments for PD can only alleviate patients' symptoms. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently sought in clinical practice. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has emerged as a highly promising target for PD therapy. Missense mutations within the structural domain of LRRK2, the most common genetic risk factor for PD, lead to abnormally elevated kinase activity and increase the risk of developing PD. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the structure, biological function, and pathogenic mutations of LRRK2, and examine recent advances in the development of LRRK2 inhibitors. We hope that this article will provide a reference for the design of novel LRRK2 inhibitors based on summarizing the facts and elucidating the viewpoints.",

    "abstract": "Elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) has been reported as a risk factor for cognitive impairment in the general population. However, there are conflicting results regarding the relationship between Hcy and cognitive impairment across various cognitive domains in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThis study aims to explore the association between plasma Hcy levels, cognitive impairment, and dysfunction in various cognitive domains among PD patients with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nA total of 101 PD patients underwent plasma Hcy measurement, comprising 50 PD-MCI patients and 51 patients with normal cognition (PD-NC). A battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to assess different cognitive domains. Adjusted generalized linear models were used to assess the correlations between Hcy levels and cognitive functions.\nAs anticipated, PD-MCI patients demonstrated a significant decline in cognitive function across all five cognitive domains (memory, executive function, attention/working memory, language, and visuospatial function). Elevated plasma Hcy levels (\u2265 10 \u03bcmol/L) were associated with a higher odds of PD-MCI, even within the normal range of Hcy levels (< 15 \u03bcmol/L). After adjusting for confounding factors, a negative correlation was observed between plasma Hcy levels and the performance on specific cognitive tests evaluating executive functions in PD, such as the Stroop Color-Word Test-C (\u03b2 = -1.123, 95% CI = -1.845 \u223c-0.401, \nThis study underscores a significant link between plasma Hcy levels and PD-MCI, particularly concerning executive dysfunction, even within the normal range of Hcy levels (< 15 \u03bcmol/L).",

    "abstract": "Introduction Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily thought to be brought on by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the basal ganglia. Communication difficulties are a common symptom of PD, affecting both motor speech and language systems. These challenges significantly impact the quality of life by reducing participation in communication, leading to social withdrawal, and increasing the risk of social isolation and stigma among individuals with PD. There are no established yoga protocols specifically addressing speech problems in PD. Hence, the research team aimed to develop and validate the yoga program targeting speech dysfunction and speech difficulties among patients with PD. Materials and methods The first part of this study involved developing a yoga-based intervention based on a review of classic literature and recently published research papers in the area of yoga and voice culture on PD. In the second step, 30 subject matter experts (SMEs) (yoga) confirmed the proposed module. The content-validity ratio (CVR) was determined using Lawshe's formula. The content validity was scored by these 30 SMEs in an independent manner on a three-point scale (0-2), with 'not essential' receiving 0, 'useful but not essential' receiving 1, and 'essential' receiving 2. Results Of the 68 practices selected for validation, 33 practices had a CVR score of \u22650.333, indicating high content validity. Thirty-five practices had a CVR score of <0.333, indicating low content validity. As a result, the final intervention module was created, consisting of 33 yoga practices with a CVR of 0.333. Conclusion A comprehensive and traditional literature-based yoga intervention module was developed and may be used as an intervention for speech difficulty in PD. Further studies are advocated to test the efficacy of the intervention.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the effects of whey protein (WP) supplements in a rat model of rotenone-induced locomotor and biochemical features of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nMale Wistar rats were used. Daily injections of rotenone (2 mg/kg; i.p.) for 16 days were used to induce PD. WP or soy protein (SP) at 1, 2, and 4 g/rats were administrated daily by gavage. Motor skills were measured in rats 24 h after the last injection using the bar test, grid test, rearing, and open field tests. In the following, striatum tissue was isolated for biochemical measurements. ELISA kits were used for biochemical assessments.\nWhile rotenone caused a significant increase in the delay time in both the bar and grid tests and a significant decrease in the motor activities were observed in both rearing and spontaneous movement tests in the rotenone group, supplementation with 2 and 4 g of WP, but not SP, significantly decreased the delay time in the bar and grid tests and also significantly increased both rearing and spontaneous movements. Additionally, rotenone caused a significant decrease in striatal levels of dopamine and glutathione and significantly increased apoptotic caspases 8, 9, and Cytochrome C, while 2 and 4 g of WP, but not SP, significantly reversed these effects.\nWP appears to have neuroprotective effects against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity and motor dysfunction, so it may be effective in the control of PD.",

    "abstract": "The estimated worldwide number of individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) might exceed 10 million by 2040. However, the underlying evidence for PD is unclear. Recent research in Parkinson's disease has focused on exploring the gut-brain axis. Researchers have proposed that gut microbiota and gut dysbiosis contribute to peripheral inflammatory conditions. The involvement of gut pathogens and dysbiosis in peripheral inflammatory diseases has been hypothesized. In Parkinson's disease, the metabolic effects associated with gut dysbiosis accelerate nerve cell loss and damage. The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) establishes the relationship between the brain and the gut through the bidirectional vagus nerve. The MGBA promotes digestive system regulation and is responsible for maintaining metabolic homeostasis under regular conditions. Helicobacter pylori, Enterococcus faecalis, and Desulfovibrio are gut bacteria whose relative abundance has been associated with Parkinson's disease etiology and treatment efficacy. Numerous clinical and preclinical studies have substantiated the therapeutic potential of probiotics in treating Parkinson's disease via the gut-brain axis. The technique appears to have benefited from a combination of favorable conditions that led to its success. The present study investigated whether administering the probiotic can be a better therapeutic intervention for PD or not. Although widespread, no medicines exist to halt the neurodegenerative effects of PD. Some probiotics raised brain dopamine levels, slowed or stopped neuronal death, and improved motor function in models of toxin-induced and genetic PD in mice, rats, flies, and induced pluripotent stem cells. Probiotics control gut dysbiosis, thereby preventing neurodegeneration in PD via the gut-brain axis. Probiotics are used to control the principal dangers of oxidative stress and alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-synuclein) aggregation. Probiotics, which contain beneficial microorganisms such as Lactobacillus, Blautia, Roseburia, Lachnospiraceae, Prevotellaceae, and Akkermansia, may help alleviate PD symptoms and slow the disease's progression. Numerous probiotic bacteria can treat the neurodegenerative condition. As a result, this review paper focuses on the current understanding of the link between PD and gut microbiota while also providing comprehensive information about the neuroprotective function of probiotics.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial disease caused by irreversible progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Recent studies have reported the successful conversion of astrocytes into DANs by repressing polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1), which led to the rescue of motor symptoms in a chemically-induced mouse model of PD. However, follow-up studies have questioned the validity of this astrocyte-to-DAN conversion model. Here, we devised an adenine base editing strategy to downregulate PTBP1 in astrocytes and neurons in a chemically-induced PD mouse model. While PTBP1 downregulation in astrocytes had no effect, PTBP1 downregulation in neurons of the striatum resulted in the expression of the DAN marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in non-dividing neurons, which was associated with an increase in striatal dopamine concentrations and a rescue of forelimb akinesia and spontaneous rotations. Phenotypic analysis using multiplexed iterative immunofluorescence imaging further revealed that most of these TH-positive cells co-expressed the dopaminergic marker DAT and the pan-neuronal marker NEUN, with the majority of these triple-positive cells being classified as mature GABAergic neurons. Additional research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of the observed markers and understand how the formation of these cells contributes to the rescue of spontaneous motor behaviors. Nevertheless, our findings support a model where downregulation of neuronal, but not astrocytic, PTBP1 can mitigate symptoms in PD mice.",

    "abstract": "Switching, a critical executive function, can manifest as task switching (TS) or response switching (RS). Although TS impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) are well-studied, RS, especially in contexts requiring adaptive behavior to external or internal cues, is less explored. This study evaluated the impact of PD on RS under exogenous and endogenous cueing. Using a gamified, remote task triggering these cues, RS was assessed in 85 PD patients and 82 neurologically healthy participants (NHP). RS cost was quantified by comparing reaction times between repeating and changing responses. A linear mixed model analyzed the effects of group, cueing mode, and their interaction on RS cost. PD patients exhibited increased RS costs under exogenous cueing but not under endogenous cueing. These findings indicate that while PD patients can effectively use predictive endogenous cues, they struggle with less predictive exogenous cues, emphasizing the need for compensatory strategies and technological aids in daily activities.",

    "abstract": "The brain-age gap, i.e. the difference between the brain age estimated from structural MRI data and the chronological age of an individual, has been proposed as a summary measure of brain integrity in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we aimed to determine the brain-age gap in genetic and idiopathic Parkinson's disease and its association with surrogate markers of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease pathology and with rates of cognitive and motor function decline. We studied 1200 cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort, including idiopathic Parkinson's disease, asymptomatic and clinical mutation carriers in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) and the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), and normal controls using a cohort study design. For comparison, we studied 187 Alzheimer's disease dementia cases and 254 controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. We used Bayesian ANOVA to determine associations of the brain-age gap with diagnosis, and baseline measures of motor and cognitive function, dopamine transporter activity and CSF markers of Alzheimer's disease type amyloid-\u03b242 and phosphotau pathology. Associations of brain-age gap with rates of cognitive and motor function decline were determined using Bayesian generalized mixed effect models. The brain-age gap in idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients was 0.7 years compared to controls, but 5.9 years in Alzheimer's disease dementia cases. In contrast, asymptomatic LRRK2 individuals had a 1.1. year younger brain age than controls. Across all cases, the brain-age gap was associated with motor impairment and (in the clinically manifest PD cases) reduced dopamine transporter activity, but less with CSF amyloid-\u03b242 and phosphotau. In idiopathic Parkinson's disease cases, however, the brain-age gap was associated with lower CSF amyloid-\u03b242 levels. In sporadic and genetic Parkinson's disease cases, a higher brain-age gap was associated with faster decline in episodic memory, and executive and motor function, whereas in asymptomatic LRRK2 cases, a smaller brain-age gap was associated with faster cognitive decline. In conclusion, brain age was sensitive to Alzheimer's disease like rather than Parkinson's disease like brain atrophy. Once an individual had idiopathic Parkinson's disease, their brain age was associated with markers of Alzheimer's disease rather than Parkinson's disease. Asymptomatic LRRK2 cases had seemingly younger brains than controls, and in these cases, younger brain age was associated with poorer cognitive outcome. This suggests that the term brain age is misleading when applied to disease stages where reactive brain changes with apparent volume increases rather than atrophy may drive the calculation of the brain age.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative brain disease characterised by motor and non-motor symptoms. Motor disabilities, including dystonia and dyskinesia, cause speech and movement difficulties and limit many aspects of life. Factors affecting PD refer to the various internal and external conditions that contribute to the onset, severity and progression of the disease. These factors can be broadly categorised into genetic, environmental and lifestyle-related factors.\nThe primary objective of this prospective cohort study is to investigate the association between environmental exposures and genetic predisposition and the risk of developing PD. Secondary objectives include examining the relationships between these factors and clinical outcomes in PD, such as disease severity and progression. We have utilised the data from other research studies, which primarily involve recruiting a cohort of individuals at high risk for PD based on their family history and/or environmental exposure history. These research studies also include participants who will undergo clinical evaluations, including neurological examinations and cognitive assessments, and provide biospecimens for genetic analysis. Environmental exposure histories will be obtained through questionnaires and medical records fetched by the authors of these research studies. In all these studies, participants were followed up regularly over several years to monitor the development of PD and to assess disease progression.\nThis study provided valuable insights into the role of environmental exposures and genetic predisposition in the development and progression of PD. The results of this study may inform strategies for preventing or delaying the onset of PD in high-risk individuals, as well as guide the development of targeted interventions for those already diagnosed with the disease.",

    "abstract": "Gait initiation is a fundamental human task, requiring one or more anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) prior to stepping. Deviations in amplitude and timing of APAs exist in Parkinson's disease (PD), causing dysfunctional postural control which increases the risk of falls. The motor cortex and basal ganglia have been implicated in the regulation of postural control, however, their dynamics during gait initiation, relationship to APA metrics, and response to pharmacotherapy such as levodopa are unknown. To address these questions, we streamed electrocorticography (ECoG) potentials from the premotor and primary motor cortices, as well as local field potentials (LFPs) from the globus pallidus in five people with PD exhibiting gait and balance dysfunction during a cued gait initiation task. Amplitude and timing of APA were evaluated with force plates and synchronized to the neural data. Subjects performed gait initiation trials under ON and LOW levodopa conditions to assess effects of medication on APA metrics and underlying neural dynamics. All subjects demonstrated pallidal and cortical oscillatory changes during different phases of gait initiation. Grouped analysis revealed that from quiet standing to the first foot step, pallidal beta power showed stepwise decrease and broadband gamma power increases, whereas cortical potentials showed low frequency (theta, alpha, beta) power decrease during gait initiation, regardless of medication state. The pallidum and motor cortices also became increasingly coherent during gait initiation compared to quiet standing prior to APA onset. Using linear mixed models, we found that while pallidal gamma powers are predictive of APA scaling, pallidal-cortical coherence (theta, alpha, beta) and premotor-M1 gamma coherence are predictive of APA timing. Our study is the first detailed characterization of basal-ganglia cortical circuit dynamics during human gait initiation. We identified significant pallidal motor cortical power and coherence changes that underlie the amplitude and timing of APA which appear to be independent of medication states of the study subjects. Our results provide evidence for a model where synchronized premotor and motor cortical activities transiently couple with the globus pallidus to regulate the timing of postural responses, and local pallidal activity regulate the amplitude of postural changes during gait initiation. It suggests that abnormal pallidal outflow and synchronization between the pallidum and motor cortices may be a pathophysiological mechanism underlying disordered postural response in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Parkinson's disease (PD) drug development have been significantly driven by genetic research. Importantly, drugs supported by genetic evidence are more likely to be approved. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful tool to nominate genomic regions associated with certain traits or diseases, pinpointing the causal biologically relevant gene is often challenging. Our aim was to prioritize genes underlying PD GWAS signals. The polygenic priority score (PoPS) is a similarity-based gene prioritization method that integrates genome-wide information from MAGMA gene-level association tests and more than 57,000 gene-level features, including gene expression, biological pathways, and protein-protein interactions. We applied PoPS to data from the largest published PD GWAS in East Asian- and European-ancestries. We identified 120 independent associations with ",

    "abstract": "While deep brain stimulation (DBS) remains an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), sources of variance in patient outcomes are still not fully understood, underscoring a need for better prognostic criteria. Here we leveraged routinely collected T1-weighted (T1-w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to derive patient-specific measures of brain structure and evaluate their usefulness in predicting changes in PD medications in response to DBS. Preoperative T1-w MRI data from 231 patients with PD were used to extract regional measures of fractal dimension (FD), sensitive to the structural complexities of cortical and subcortical areas. FD was validated as a biomarker of Parkinson's disease (PD) progression through comparison of patients with PD and healthy controls (HCs). This analysis revealed significant group differences in FD across nine brain regions which supports its utility as a marker of PD. We evaluated the impact of adding imaging features (FD) to a clinical model that included demographics and clinical parameters-age, sex, total number and location of DBS electrodes, and preoperative motor response to levodopa. This model aimed to explain variance and predict changes in medication following DBS. Regression analysis revealed that inclusion of the FD of distributed brain areas correlated with post-DBS reductions in medication burden, explaining an additional 13.6% of outcome variance (R",

    "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are closely related neurodegenerative conditions within the Lewy body spectrum. The relationship between DLB and PDD remains debated, with ongoing discussion about whether they are distinct diseases or different manifestations of the same disorder. This study aimed to identify differences in cerebral perfusion patterns between DLB and PDD patients.\nSingle-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) imaging was performed on patients diagnosed with DLB ( n \u2005=\u200546) and PDD ( n \u2005=\u200530). The data were acquired by two SPECT/computed tomography systems from two affiliated centers and were retrospectively recruited under the local ethics approval. Relative tracer uptake levels were calculated across 47 automatically determined regions of interest and 240 subregions. A two-sided Welch's t -test was employed to evaluate mean perfusion differences, with results further confirmed through a voxel-wise t -test mapping. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to adjust P -values for multiple comparisons.\nThe greatest difference in perfusion was in the left associative visual cortex in planes 34 and 36 and the right primary visual cortex in plane 34, with lower mean perfusion observed in PDD patients than those with DLB ( P \u2005=\u20050.005).\nNo statistically significant differences in ECD perfusion were found between DLB and PDD patients. The greatest difference was in the visual cortices, where PDD patients suffered a greater loss of perfusion.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein (SNCA) gene hypomethylation was reported in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD). Based on a high clinical resemblance between iPD and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)-driven Parkinson's disease (L2PD), we investigated the epigenetic status of SNCA in an extensive LRRK2 clinical cohort from Spain.\nWe assessed the methylation levels of 23 CpG sites in the SNCA promoter region using peripheral blood DNA from L2PD patients (n\u2009=\u2009151), LRRK2 nonmanifesting carriers (n\u2009=\u200955), iPD patients (n\u2009=\u2009115), and healthy control subjects (n\u2009=\u2009154) (total: N\u2009=\u2009475).\nCompared with control subjects, we found significant SNCA hypomethylation in 11 of 23 CpGs in L2PD (48%), whereas 22 CpGs (96%) were hypomethylated in iPD. In line with a healthy status, asymptomatic mutation carriers had similar SNCA methylation profiles to control subjects.\nThis study shows for the first time that SNCA hypomethylation occurs in patients with L2PD. Further studies addressing SNCA methylation status in additional worldwide LRRK2 cohorts are warranted. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "This study aims to objectively evaluate turning gait parameters in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients using 2D-RGB video-based analysis and explore their relationships with imbalance.\nWe prospectively enrolled PD patients for clinical assessment, balance analysis and gait with 180\u00ba turning. Spatiotemporal gait parameters during turning were derived using video-based analysis and correlated with modified Hoehn and Yahr (mHY) stages and center of pressure (COP) oscillations.\nA total of 64 PD patients were enrolled. The PD patients with higher mHY stages (\u22652.5) had significantly longer turning times, greater numbers of steps, wider step bases and less variability in step length during turns. COP oscillations were positively correlated with the mean turning time on both the anterior-posterior and right-left axes.\nSpatiotemporal gait parameter during turning, derived from video-based gait analysis, may represent apromising biomarker for monitoring postural instability in PD patients.",

The aim of this work is to describe typical neuropsychiatric symptoms and their treatment.\nThis is a narrative opinion paper, illustrated by a fictional case report. The most common neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depressive symptoms, anxiety, apathy, psychotic symptoms, impulse control disorders, as well as cognitive impairment are discussed in the context of prodromal stage, early stage, fluctuations stage, post-surgical intervention, and late stage of PD.\nMultiple factors such as pathophysiology, dopaminergic medication, deep brain stimulation, personality traits and individual life circumstances influence neuropsychiatric symptoms. Since the complexity and causes of neuropsychiatric symptoms can change, management strategies have to be adapted and individualised throughout the disease trajectory.\nRecognising neuropsychiatric symptoms within the framework of the disease stage and identifying their potential causes is pivotal to provide adequate interventions.",

However, natural differences in the voices of people can make this challenging. Computerized binary speech classification can identify people with PD (PwPD), but its multiclass application to detect the severity of the disease remains difficult.\nThis study investigated six diadochokinetic (DDK) tasks, four features (phonation, articulation, prosody, and their fusion), and three machine learning models for four severity levels of PwPD. The four binary classifications were: (i) Normal vs Not Normal, (ii) Slight vs Not Slight, (iii) Mild vs Not Mild and (iv) Moderate vs. Not Moderate. The best task and features for each class were identified and the models were ensembled to develop a multiclass model to distinguish between Normal vs. Slight vs. Mild vs. Moderate.\nFor Normal vs Not-normal, logistic regression (LR) using the prosody from \"ka-ka-ka\" task, Random Forest (RF) using articulation from \"petaka\" for Slight vs Not Slight, RF for the fusion from \"ka-ka-ka\" for Mild vs Not Mild and Gradient Boosting (GB) using prosody from \"ta-ta-ta\" for Moderate vs Not Moderate gave the best results. Combining these using LR achieved an accuracy of 72%.\nDividing the multiclass problem into four binary problems gives the optimum speech features for each class.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) aggregation are key contributors to Parkinson's Disease (PD). While genetic and environmental risk factors, including mutations in mitochondrial-associated genes, are implicated in PD, the precise mechanisms linking mitochondrial defects to \u03b1Syn pathology remain incompletely understood, hindering the development of effective therapeutic interventions. Here, we identify the loss of branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) as a mitochondrial risk factor that exacerbates \u03b1Syn pathology by disrupting Complex I function. Our findings reveal a consistent downregulation of BCKDK in dopaminergic (DA) neurons from A53T-\u03b1Syn mouse models, PD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and postmortem brain tissues. BCKDK deficiency leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, including reduced membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production upon administration of a stressor, which in turn promotes \u03b1Syn oligomerization. Mechanistically, BCKDK interacts with the NDUFS1 subunit of Complex I to stabilize its function. Loss of BCKDK disrupts this interaction, leading to Complex I destabilization and enhanced \u03b1Syn aggregation. Notably, restoring BCKDK expression in neuron-like cells rescues mitochondrial integrity and restores Complex I activity. Similarly, in patient-derived iPS cells differentiated to form dopaminergic neurons, NDUFS1 and phosphorylated aSyn levels are partially restored upon BCKDK expression. These findings establish a mechanistic link between BCKDK deficiency, mitochondrial dysfunction, and \u03b1Syn pathology in PD, positioning BCKDK as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate mitochondrial impairment and neurodegeneration in PD.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit altered reward processing, reflected by a decreased amplitude of an event-related potential (ERP) marker called reward positivity (RewP). Most studies have used RewP to investigate reward behavior due to the high temporal resolution of EEG and its high sensitivity. However, traditional single-electrode ERP analyses often overlook the intricate dynamics of non-phase-locked oscillatory activity and the complex interactions within these neural oscillatory patterns. Studying oscillatory activity is crucial as it provides mechanistic insights into the functional, spatial, and temporal aspects of neuronal processing. To address this gap, we employed a data-driven approach to identify EEG-based markers associated with PD reward processing deficits. Using an openly available 64-channel EEG dataset of 28 age- and sex-matched PD and control participants during a reinforcement learning task, we conducted a comprehensive secondary analysis. First, we employed a cluster-based permutation method to extract ERP markers, finding a consistent decrease in reward positivity in PD, regardless of medication status. Additionally, through region of interest (ROI) analysis on time-frequency data, we identified specific oscillatory patterns during reward processing. PD patients exhibited attenuated theta power and increased gamma power compared to healthy controls (HC). Notably, within the PD group, those off medication showed anterior localization of high gamma power, while those on medication displayed higher posterior gamma power. Building upon these findings, we explored phase-amplitude coupling between theta phase and gamma amplitude measured by the modulation index. We observed a trend of decreased theta-gamma coupling in PD patients, with statistically significant differences between on and off medication conditions. These results highlight the potential role of theta-gamma coupling as a neuromodulatory target for improving goal-oriented behavior in PD. Our correlation analyses suggest that high gamma power is linked to longer disease duration, while reduced reward positivity and low theta-gamma coupling may serve as markers of the dopaminergic impact on reward processing. Thus, our study unveils the intricate time-frequency dynamics underlying reward processing deficits in PD, emphasizing the utility of a data-driven approach to elucidate neural mechanisms and to identify potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we compared the value of pathological alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) seed amplification assay (SAA) in gastric and duodenal biopsies with skin biopsies in Parkinson disease (PD) patients with different disease duration. The accuracy of \u03b1Syn SAA was 87.7% in skin, 67.4% in duodenum, and 80.0% in gastric biopsies, with significantly higher sensitivity in advanced PD (skin: 81.8%; gastric: 88.9%; duodenal 58.8%). Misfolded \u03b1Syn was detected with higher sensitivity in advanced PD across all matrices, likely reflecting the progression of \u03b1Syn pathology. The seeding activity was lower in the duodenal than in the gastric wall, indicating differences in \u03b1Syn burden.",

    "abstract": "To date, few studies have focused on the benefits of dopaminergic treatment on episodic memory functions in patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the effects of pharmacological therapy with dopamine in alleviating episodic memory deficits in Parkinson's patients. A secondary aim was to evaluate the role of dopamine in episodic memory circuits and thus in different memory systems. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed (1971-2022) to find studies that met specific inclusion criteria. The studies had to provide sufficient data (means and standard deviations) to evaluate performance on neuropsychological tests of episodic memory. A total of k\u2009=\u200936 measures were included in the analysis. A statistically significant difference suggested better performance following dopaminergic therapy assumption (ON condition) than following dopaminergic withdrawal (OFF condition), specifically the estimated pooled effect calculated through a random-effects restricted maximum likelihood model was log ratio of means (RoM)\u2009=\u20090.047 (p\u2009=\u20090.011). The back-transformed RoM, indicating a 4.8% improvement, provides an interpretable measure of the effect size, as it reflects the multiplicative change in performance associated with the ON condition. A meta-regression analysis was also performed to assess the influence of specific memory tasks and relevant covariates/factors on the overall meta-analytic effect: four memory contrasts (verbal/visual, immediate/delayed, recall/recognition, word-list/short-story), age of participants, years of education, severity of illness, duration of illness in years, country of study, proportion of women in the sample, type of medication, counterbalancing. Word list/short story and proportion of women in the sample were the only two statistically significant predictors in the model, both associated with a positive higher pooled effect size. The present study revealed a significant overall difference between the results obtained in the ON and OFF conditions. We also found a significantly greater pharmacological effect in the recall of short stories than word lists, which supports the hypothesis of a beneficial effect of dopamine on the hippocampal circuit rather than on prefrontal cortical areas.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) resting tremor is thought to be initiated in the basal ganglia and amplified in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Because stress worsens tremor, the noradrenergic system may play a role in amplifying tremor. We tested if and how propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reduces PD tremor and whether or not this effect is specific to stressful conditions.\nIn a cross-over, double-blind intervention study, participants with PD resting tremor received propranolol (40\u2009mg, single dose) or placebo (counter-balanced) on 2 different days. During both days, we assessed tremor severity (with accelerometry) and tremor-related brain activity (with functional magnetic resonance imaging), as well as heart rate and pupil diameter, while\u00a0subjects performed a stressful cognitive load task that has been linked to the noradrenergic system. We tested for effects of drug (propranolol vs placebo) and stress (cognitive load vs rest) on tremor power and tremor-related brain activity.\nWe included 27 PD patients with prominent resting tremor. Tremor power significantly increased during cognitive load versus rest (F[1,19] =\u200913.8; p\u2009=\u20090.001; \nOur findings indicate that propranolol has a general, context-independent, tremor-reducing effect that may be implemented at the level of the primary motor cortex.

    "abstract": "Pain is a major non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). The relationship between hyperalgesia and neuropeptides originating from paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rats has already been investigated for oxytocin (OXT), but not yet for arginine vasopressin (AVP) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The present study aimed to investigate the alterations in these neuropeptides following nociceptive stimulation in PD model rats and to examine the mechanisms of hyperalgesia. Dopaminergic nigrostriatal lesions were induced by injecting 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle. Subcutaneous formalin injection into the vibrissa pad was performed in rats as a nociceptive stimulus in the orofacial region. Dopamine depletion's effect on nociception was assessed by counting the p-ERK-immunoreactive (-IR) cells in the trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis (Vc). The PD model rats induced by 6-OHDA injection (6-OHDA rats) showed a significantly higher number of p-ERK-IR cells in the Vc than the sham rats, confirming hyperalgesia in 6-OHDA rats. Then, we investigated the immunohistochemical responses to OXT, AVP, and CRH cells in the PVN and examined the changes in blood levels of these neuropeptides. As a result, formalin injection increased neuronal activity and blood levels of OXT and CRH in sham rats, but these were suppressed in the 6-OHDA rats. Contrarily, neuronal activity and blood level of AVP were unaffected by nociceptive stimuli and were significantly lower in 6-OHDA rats than in sham rats. Our findings suggest that OXT and CRH suppression is linked to hyperalgesia in PD, whereas AVP does not directly influence the observed hyperalgesia.",

    "abstract": "Although practice effects (PE) on repeated cognitive testing have received growing interest in Alzheimer's disease, they have been understudied in Parkinson's disease (PD). The current paper examined PE across one week in a sample of patients with PD via traditional methods and regression-based change scores, as well as if these change scores relate to clinical variables in PD.\nThirty-five patients with PD were administered a brief cognitive battery twice across approximately one week. Using both simple-difference and standardized regression-based change scores, a series of one-sample and independent t-tests were calculated to assess for PE across the test battery. Pearson correlations examined both types of change scores and measures of mood and severity of motor symptoms.\nWhereas traditional analyses (i.e., simple difference scores and dependent t-tests) did not reveal any changes on test scores over this interval, regression-based change scores did identify that these individuals showed significantly smaller-than-expected PE on three of the seven cognitive scores. Furthermore, when these regression-based change scores were trichotomized (decline/stable/improve), four of the seven tests showed significantly more decline than expected in this sample. Finally, these regression-based change scores significantly correlated with motor measures, with smaller PE being associated with worse motor functioning.\nAlthough these results are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger and more diverse samples, smaller-than-expected PE are seen in PD and they may signal more advanced disease.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the role of membrane vesicles (MVs) from the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus in reducing intestinal inflammation and increasing 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTwenty healthy male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 5 per group), including a) control, b) 6-OHDA, c) 6-OHDA+MV, and d) sham groups. PD was induced by bilateral injection of 6-OHDA. Rats in the 6-OHDA+MV group received MV equivalent to 1 \u00d7 10\nThe induction of PD by 6-OHDA induced a remarkable decrease in beam-walking (p < 0.0001). In addition, the expression of protein and genes (receptor) of 5-HT (r-5-HT1A) decreased, and that of protein and gene (receptor; GABBR1) of GABA increased in the PD group (p < 0.05 compared with the healthy control group), while MV gavage of 6-OHDA-injected rats controlled these factors in the substantia nigra. In the intestinal tissue, the expression of TLR-4 and \u03b1-synuclein gene was significantly increased in the 6-OHDA group compared to the control group (p < 0.0001).\nMVs might act as potential beneficial tools to reduce intestinal inflammation, control neurological damage associated with PD, and increase 5-HT neurotransmitters.

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a common treatment for motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease but its influence on non-motor symptoms is less clear. Sleep spindles are known to be reduced in patients with Parkinson's disease, but the effect of STN DBS is unknown. The objective of our study was to address this knowledge gap.\nPolysomnograms were recorded for three consecutive nights in 15 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (11 male, 4 female; age: 53-75\u00a0years), including at least one night each of unilateral STN DBS stimulation ON and OFF. Stimulation ON was set to 70\u00a0% of clinical amplitude to mitigate sleep being altered via changing motor symptoms or due to patient awareness of stimulation. Sleep spindles were detected in electroencephalogram (EEG) data by two previously published, validated automated sleep spindle detection algorithms: Ferrarelli et al. (2007) and Martin et al. (2013).\nSleep spindle density was higher during stimulation ON than OFF nights in 11 of 12 subjects using either sleep spindle detection algorithm (p<=0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum). Stimulation ON versus OFF had no statistically significant effect on sleep spindle duration or amplitude.\nOur analysis indicates that a single night of sub-optimal STN stimulation significantly increases sleep spindle density in Parkinson's disease patients.\nThese results further our understanding of how DBS impacts non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) inhibition is a promising disease-modifying therapy for LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease (L2PD) and idiopathic PD (iPD). However, pharmaco-dynamic readouts and progression biomarkers for clinical trials aiming for disease modification are insufficient since no endogenous marker reflecting enhanced kinase activity of the most common LRRK2 G2019S mutation has been reported yet in L2PD patients. Employing phospho-/proteomic analyses we assessed the impact that LRRK2 activating mutations had in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a LRRK2 clinical cohort from Spain (n=174). The groups of study encompassed G2019S L2PD patients (n=37), non-manifesting LRRK2 mutation carriers of G2019S, here, G2019S L2NMCs (n=27), R1441G L2PD patients (n=14), R1441G L2NMCs (n=11), iPD patients (n=40), and healthy controls (n=45). We identified 207 differential proteins in G2019S L2PD compared to controls (39 up/168 down) and 67 in G2019S L2NMCs (10 up/57 down). G2019S down-regulated proteins affected the endolysosomal pathway, proteostasis, and mitochondria, e.g., ATIC, RAB9A, or LAMP1. At the phospho-proteome level, we observed increases in endogenous phosphorylation levels of pSer106 RAB12 in G2019S carriers, which were validated by immunoblotting after 1 year of follow-up (n=48). Freshly collected PBMCs from 3 G2019S L2PD, 1 R1441G L2PD, 1 iPD, and 5 controls (n=10) showed strong diminishment of pSer106 RAB12 phosphorylation levels after in-vitro administration of the MLi-2 LRRK2 inhibitor. Using machine learning, we identified an 18-feature G2019S phospho-/protein signature discriminating G2019S L2PD, L2NMCs, and controls with 96% accuracy that correlated with disease severity, i.e., UPDRS-III motor scoring. Using easily accessible PBMCs from a LRRK2 clinical cohort, we identified elevated levels of pSer106 RAB12 as an endogenous biomarker of G2019S carriers. Our data suggest that monitoring pSer106 RAB12 phosphorylation could be a relevant biomarker for tracking LRRK2 activation, particularly in G2019S carriers. Future work may determine whether pSer106 RAB12 could help with patient enrichment and monitoring drug efficacy in LRRK2 clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The role played by sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic branches in patients with Parkinson's disease carrying variants in the GBA1 gene (GBA-PD) is still elusive.\nTo characterize cardiovascular autonomic function in GBA-PD and I-PD patients with early and mid-stage disease.\nThese assessments were performed: cardiovascular autonomic tests, analysis of heart rate and blood pressure variability, cardiac noradrenergic imaging. The frequency and severity of autonomic symptoms were comparatively assessed with the SCOPA-AUT questionnaire.\nCompared to the I-PD cohort, GBA-PD patients displayed an increased burden of autonomic symptoms. Autonomic tests revealed worse parasympathetic scores in GBA-PD while sympathetic indexes and the degree of cardiac sympathetic binding were comparable in the two groups. Heart rate variability indexes also revealed lower vagal modulation in the GBA-PD group.\nThe cardiovascular autonomic profile in GBA PD is characterized by a prominent cardiovagal dysfunction compared to I-PD.",

Group and correlation analyses were performed.\nMA patients had greater GID than DN. GIDS-PD scores directly correlated with MDS-UPDRS-III and non-motor scores in both groups, although more in DN. GIDS-PD scores were directly associated with \u03b1-synuclein and inversely with lymphocytes only in DN; conversely, they were positively associated with tau proteins and albumin ratio, and negatively with amyloid-\u03b2-peptides in both groups.\nThe burden of GID increases along the PD course with associated stage-specific clinical-biological patterns.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-syn), a pathological hallmark of PD, is emerging as a bridging element at the crossroads between neuro/immune-inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in PD. Several evidence show that pathological \u03b1-syn accumulates in neuronal and non-neuronal cells (i.e., neurons, microglia, macrophages, skin cells, and intestinal cells) in central and peripheral tissues since the prodromal phase of the disease, contributing to brain pathology. Indeed, pathological \u03b1-syn deposition can promote neurogenic/immune-inflammatory responses that contribute to systemic and central neuroinflammation associated with PD. After providing an overview of the structure and functions of physiological \u03b1-syn as well as its pathological forms, we review current studies about the role of neuronal and non-neuronal \u03b1-syn at the crossroads between neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in PD. In addition, we provide an overview of the correlation between the accumulation of \u03b1-syn in central and peripheral tissues and PD, related symptoms, and neuroinflammation. Special attention was paid to discussing whether targeting \u03b1-syn can represent a suitable therapeutical approach for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurological disorder globally. Defining features include tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, which in combination with nonmotor symptoms such as cognitive impairment and orthostatic hypotension increase the risk of falls. Along with low bone mineral density, fracture risk is high in PD.\nThe aims were to identify and appraise clinical practice guidelines, consensus statements, and treatment algorithms containing recommendations for bone health in people with PD (PwP).\nWe systematically searched 4 electroninc databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, and Web of Science) (n\u2009=\u200978), in addition to the websites of organizations, societies, and professional bodies focused on PD or osteoporosis (n\u2009=\u200928), up to April 22, 2024.\nAfter duplicate removal, screening, and full-text review, 6 records were included. Included records were appraised using the AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) tool. All records recognized bone health as a concern in PD, yet recommendations for fracture-risk screening were inconsistent. Two of six records grouped PD under the broad category of neurological diseases. The acceptability and tolerance of anti-osteoporosis medications in PwP was discussed only in 1 record, which incorporated national osteoporosis guidelines into a PD-specific treatment algorithm.\nThis review highlights that despite the documented high fracture rates of PwP, health professionals do not always have adequate resources to support them when considering how to manage osteoporosis. Osteoporosis screening and management needs to be incorporated into PD treatment guidelines, and equally providing specific recommendations for PwP related to bone health in national osteoporosis guidelines should be a priority given the high burden of fracture in the patient population.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor fluctuations (NMFs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) significantly affect patients' well-being. Despite being identified over two decades ago, NMFs remain largely underrecognized, undertreated, and poorly understood. While they are often temporally associated with motor fluctuations (MFs) and can share common risk factors and pathophysiologic mechanisms, NMFs and MFs are currently considered distinct entities. The prevalence and severity of NMFs, often categorized into neuropsychiatric, sensory, and autonomic subtypes, vary significantly across studies due to the heterogeneous PD populations screened and the diverse evaluation tools applied. The consistent negative impact of NMFs on PD patients' quality of life underscores the importance of further investigations via focused and controlled studies, validated assessment instruments and novel digital technologies. High-quality research is essential to illuminate the complex pathophysiology and clinical nuances of NMFs, ultimately enhancing clinicians' diagnostic and treatment options in routine clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "To determine the effect of Bilateral Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) on drug reduction for Parkinson's disease (PD) in a low-middle-income country.\nThis retrospective cohort study included 49 patients following interview based questionnaires who underwent bilateral STN DBS at the Department of Neurosurgery, Punjab Institute of Neurosciences, Lahore, Pakistan over five years (July 30, 2018 to June 29, 2023). Patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria (49 patients) were selected and the effect of bilateral STN DBS on drug reduction was evaluated.\nFollowing bilateral STN for Parkinsons Disease Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III results were statistically significant, with a P-value of 0.0001. Effect of DBS on UPDRS-IV was 0.2751, which is statistically insignificant. LEDD reduced by 55.03% (P<0.0001), UPRS-III improved by 80.49% (P<0.0001), and UPDRS-IV improved by 1% (P<0.0001). Time spent with dyskinesia reduced by 17.54% (P<0.0001), whereas time spent off period reduced 22.44% (P<0.0001).\nWhen the disease is in its early stages and has not yet manifested advanced Parkinsons symptoms, bilateral STN DBS is an effective treatment option. It considerably reduces the need for levodopa and significantly improves the motor symptoms of rigidity, tremors, and bradykinesia.",

    "abstract": "Action observation treatment (AOT) is a novel rehabilitation approach aimed to the recovery of both motor and linguistic deficits in subjects with brain lesions. The aim of the present randomized controlled study was to assess the benefits of AOT treatment in the activities of daily living (ADLs) and in the linguistic abilities of the patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) at mild-moderate stage (Hoehn & Yahr's stage scale: 2-3).\nTwenty patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to an experimental group (submitted to AOT) or to a control group. The experimental group (AOT-group) underwent the vision of a video containing 6 complex ADLs, while the control group (C-group) was subjected to a video-clip regarding semantic information of a geographical-naturalistic type without motor content. The treatment duration was 4\u2009weeks. All patients underwent assessment before and after the treatment by the following tools: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-Part III), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL), Direct Assessment of Functional Status (DAFS) and subtest Verb Naming of Analysis of Aphasic Deficit Battery (BADA). Paired samples \nAOT-group showed an improvement from baseline to the end of study in ADCS-ADL (\nThese preliminary results suggest the potential efficacy of AOT in rehabilitation of ADLs and verb retrieval in people with PD. Further studies will be necessary to verify these findings.",

    "abstract": "Neurofilament light chain (NfL) has recently emerged as a key indicator of neurodegeneration. In this study, our hypothesis is that the levels of blood-derived NfL and its accumulation during the Parkinson's disease (PD) progression could serve as a potential biomarker for predicting subsequent cognitive decline. To investigate this, we conducted a study utilizing a large single-center cohort.\nThe study included 193 participants, consisting of 106 cognitively normal PD (PD-CN) patients and 87 normal controls (NC) individuals. Serum NfL concentrations were measured. PD patients were followed up for clinical assessment at an average of 2 \u00b1 0.6 years.\nThe serum NfL levels were significantly higher in PD-CN patients compared to NC. PD-CN patients and NC at follow-up time exhibited higher serum NfL levels compared to those at baseline. PD patients with high serum NfL levels were found to have a higher likelihood of transitioning from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia (Hazard ratio (HR) 1.107, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.010-1.213, \nIn conclusion, our study found that PD patients have significantly higher levels of serum NfL compared to individuals without PD. Furthermore, serum NfL levels increase as PD progresses and can predict cognitive impairment within a 2-year timeframe. Serum NfL may serve as a feasible, non-invasive biomarker of cognitive progression in PD. However, further studies and functional experiments are needed to validate these findings.",

Artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have been used in recent studies (2015-2023) to improve PD diagnosis by categorizing patients and healthy controls based on similar clinical presentations. This study investigates several datasets, modalities, and data preprocessing techniques from the collected data. Issues are also addressed, with suggestions for future PD research involving subgrouping and connection analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dopamine transporter scan (DaTscan), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) data. We have used different models like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for detecting PD at an early stage. We have used the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset 3D brain images and archived the 86.67%, 94.02%, accuracy of models, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity, often due to drug interactions. It classically manifests with autonomic and neuromuscular hyperactivity and by mental status changes that might include restlessness, delirium, and agitation. We present a case of a 76-year-old patient with Parkinson's disease with SS triggered by interaction between rasagiline and buspirone. He presented with altered mental status, hyperreflexia, and muscle rigidity. Due to the severity of symptoms, he was early admitted to the ICU, and his clinical condition improved after discontinuation of serotonergic agents and supportive care. In SS, a high index of suspicion is fundamental, so early treatment is implemented.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the dysfunction and death of dopaminergic neurons. Neural-stem-cell (NSC)-based therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of PD but its therapeutic performance is limited by low efficiency of differentiation of NSCs to dopaminergic neurons. Although electrical stimulation can promote neuronal differentiation, it is not verified whether it can induce the NSCs to specifically differentiate into dopaminergic neurons. Meanwhile, it is a great challenge to precisely apply electrical stimulation to dynamically migrating NSCs after transplantation. Here, electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanosheets are designed to anchor to the membrane of NSCs to serve as wireless nanoelectrodes. After anchoring to the cell membrane, these nanoelectrodes are able to migrate together with the cells and precisely apply extracellular electrical stimulation to the receptors or ion transport channels on the membrane of transplanted cells under alternating magnetic field. The nanoelectrode-mediated electrical stimulation induces 38.46% of the NSCs to specifically differentiate into dopaminergic neurons, while the percentage is only 5.82% for NSCs without the nanoelectrode stimulation. Transplantation of NSCs anchored with the nanoelectrodes effectively improves the recovery of the motor and memory ability of PD mice under alternating magnetic field within 2 weeks.",

    "abstract": "We prospectively evaluated how well combinations of signs and symptoms can identify individuals in the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe study comprised 6,108 men who underwent repeated assessments of key prodromal features and were prospectively followed for the development of PD. Two composite measures of prodromal PD were evaluated: (i) the co-occurrence of constipation, probable rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (pRBD), and hyposmia, and (ii) the probability of prodromal PD based on the Movement Disorders Society (MDS) research criteria. We also examined the progression and heterogeneity of the prodromal PD phase.\nOne hundred three individuals were newly diagnosed with PD over an average follow-up of 3.4\u2009years. Men with constipation, pRBD, and hyposmia had a 23-fold higher risk of receiving a PD diagnosis in the subsequent 3\u2009years, compared with men without these features (risk ratio [RR]\u2009=\u200923.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u200910.62-51.33). The risk of PD was 21-fold higher in men with a probability of prodromal PD \u2265\u20090.8 compared with those with a probability <\u20090.2 (RR\u2009=\u200921.96, 95% CI\u2009=\u200911.17-43.17). Both the co-occurrence of the 3 non-motor features and an MDS-based probability \u2265\u20090.8 had comparable predictive values, and both were stronger predictors of PD than any of the features individually. We identified 2 prodromal PD subtypes where RBD and visual color impairment were key discriminators.\nOur study demonstrates that combinations of key signs and symptoms strongly predict future clinically manifest PD. These measures may be integrated into screening strategies to identify individuals who could be targeted for enrollment into PD prevention trials. ANN NEUROL 2024.",

The risk of PD was 21-fold higher in men with a probability of prodromal PD \u2265\u20090.8 compared with those with a probability <\u20090.2 (RR\u2009=\u200921.96, 95% CI\u2009=\u200911.17-43.17). Both the co-occurrence of the 3 non-motor features and an MDS-based probability \u2265\u20090.8 had comparable predictive values, and both were stronger predictors of PD than any of the features individually. We identified 2 prodromal PD subtypes where RBD and visual color impairment were key discriminators.",

    "abstract": "To examine the associations of apolipoprotein E (APOE) carrier status and lipid profiles with sleep disorders, including excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (pRBD), among patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD) over 5-year follow-up periods. The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative is a multicenter cohort study based on an ongoing and open-ended registry. Data from baseline and 5-year follow-up visits from participants of de novo PD were analyzed. Longitudinal associations of APOE carrier status and lipid profiles with sleep disorders were estimated via linear mixed-effects models. A total of 657 participants with complete APOE genotypes were enrolled at baseline. Among them, 153 (25.3%) had available lipid profiles at baseline. In the linear mixed-effects models, baseline APOE \u03b52/\u03b53/\u03b54 carrier status did not exhibit significant associations with EDS and pRBD (all p\u2009>\u20090.05) in all models. However, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and elevated triglycerides (TG) were associated with developing EDS (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.04, 95% CI: -0.07, -0.00) and pRBD (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.01, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.02) in PD patients, respectively. In the APOE \u03b54+ subgroup, decreased HDL and increased TG displayed substantial associations with developing EDS and sleep disorders (all p\u2009<\u20090.05) in all models, respectively, whereas no significant differences were noted in the APOE \u03b54- subgroup (all p\u2009>\u20090.05). Our study did not demonstrate a clear association between APOE \u03b52/\u03b53/\u03b54 and sleep disorders in PD patients. However, the presence of APOE \u03b54 was associated with changes in lipid profiles, notably affecting TG and HDL levels.",

    "abstract": "Oculomotor behaviour changes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are a promising source of prodromal disease markers. Capitalizing on this phenomenon to facilitate early diagnosis requires oculomotor assessment in prodromal cohorts. We examined oculomotor behaviour in non-manifesting LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers (LRRK2-NM), who have heightened PD risk.Seventeen LRRK2-NM participants, 47 patients with idiopathic PD, and 63 healthy age-matched control participants completed an interleaved pro- and antisaccade task while undergoing video-based eye-tracking. We analyzed between-group differences in saccade, pupil, blink, and fixation acquisition behaviour. Patients with PD showed previously demonstrated abnormalities (saccade hypometria, antisaccade errors). Relative to controls, LRRK2-NM participants and patients with PD both displayed increased short-latency prosaccades and reduced pupil velocity, plus altered fixation acquisition-less preemptive returning of gaze to the future fixation point location. Interestingly, the effect on blink probability was opposite-higher than controls in LRRK2-NM participants but lower in patients with PD. Future longitudinal studies must confirm the viability of these features as prodromal PD markers.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Environmental and lifestyle factors, such as smoking and coffee drinking, have been associated with a decreased risk for PD. However, the biological mechanisms underlying protective effects on PD are still not fully understood. It has been suggested that non-nicotine components in cigarette smoke and non-caffeine components in coffee may contribute to this protective effect. The aim of this review was to explore candidate molecules and mechanisms behind the effects of smoking and coffee drinking on PD by integrating findings from previous studies. By cross-referencing an index of tobacco constituents and a list of coffee constituents with existing literature on natural compounds and their structural analogs that show inhibitory activities against monoamine oxidase B, catechol O-methyltransferase, and \u03b1-synuclein fibrillation, we have identified tobacco and coffee components that inhibit these targets. Furthermore, tobacco and coffee components potentially play roles in suppressing neuroinflammation, activating the Nrf2 pathway as natural activators, and altering the gut microbiome. This review suggests that the phenolic compounds from tobacco and coffee investigated may contribute to the low incidence of PD in smokers and coffee drinkers, showing moderate to strong potential as therapeutic interventions. The current review suggests that multifunctional molecules found in coffee and cigarette smoke may have potential neuroprotective effects, but none of the data indicates that multifunctionality is required for these effects. This review will deepen our understanding of how smoking and coffee drinking are linked to a reduced risk of PD and will also be important in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of smoking and coffee drinking on PD.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic equilibrium between acetylation and deacetylation is vital for cellular homeostasis. Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder marked by \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) accumulation and dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra, is associated with a disruption of this balance. Therefore, correcting this imbalance with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors represents a promising treatment strategy for PD. CAY10603 (CAY) is a potent and selective HDAC6 inhibitor. However, because of its poor water solubility and short biological half-life, it faces clinical limitations. Herein, we engineered lactoferrin-decorated CAY-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (denoted as PLGA@CAY@Lf NPs) to effectively counter methamphetamine (Meth)-induced PD. PLGA@CAY@Lf NPs showed enhanced blood-brain barrier crossing and significant brain accumulation. Notably, CAY released from PLGA@CAY@Lf NPs restored the disrupted acetylation balance in PD, resulting in neuroprotection by reversing mitochondrial dysfunction, suppressing reactive oxygen species, and inhibiting \u03b1-syn accumulation. Additionally, PLGA@CAY@Lf NPs treatment normalized dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase levels, reduced neuroinflammation, and improved behavioral impairments. These findings underscore the potential of PLGA@CAY@Lf NPs in treating Meth-induced PD and suggest that an innovative HDAC6-inhibitor-based strategy can be used to treat PD.",

    "abstract": "Several measures of the center of pressure have been used to describe magnitude and structure of the postural sway in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to examine whether both the magnitude and structure of the center of pressure trajectory can differentiate PD individuals with and without freezing of gait in both On- and Off-medication states and with eyes open and closed.\nTwenty-four individuals with PD (14 without and 10 with freezing of gait) were tested. Participants stood as still as possible on a force plate for 30\u00a0s with eyes open and closed and On- and Off-medication. Analyses of variance were used to test the effect of group, medication state, and visual information on the magnitude (area) and structure (shape measured by the ratio between axes length and orientation) of the center of pressure ellipses.\nThe center of pressure ellipses were less elongated in On-medication state and for PD with freezing of gait than without freezing of gait. Moreover, the magnitude of the ellipses was larger for PD with freezing than without freezing of gait only in the On-medication state. The orientation of the ellipses was more diagonal for individuals with freezing, in the On-medication state, and with the eyes closed when compared to individuals with PD without freezing under the same conditions.\nMagnitude and structure of the postural sway differed between PD individuals with and without freezing of gait, depending on the medication state and the availability of the visual information.",

    "abstract": "According to the dual syndrome hypothesis, patients with Parkinson disease (PD) with visuospatial deficits are more likely to progress to dementia, compared with patients with a prevalent dysexecutive syndrome. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether early connectivity changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the precuneus (PCun)-which are critical to fronto-executive and visuospatial functions, respectively-can identify distinct cognitive phenotypes in cognitively intact newly diagnosed patients with PD.\nNewly diagnosed, drug-na\u00efve patients with PD (\u22642 years from clinical onset) with normal Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), were consecutively enrolled from our Movement Disorders Clinics in Italy. Sex-matched and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled among nonconsanguineous patients' relatives. Participants underwent 3T-fMRI to investigate resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of DLPFC and PCun with a seed-based approach at baseline (T0). K-means cluster analysis was performed on \nThe study included 68 patients with PD (27% women; mean age: 60 \u00b1 9 years; Hoehn & Yahr score: 1.4 \u00b1 0.5; MoCA score: 27.9 \u00b1 1.6) and 31 HCs (39% women; mean age 64.2 \u00b1 9.3 years) at T0. Forty-two patients completed T1 evaluation. Patients displayed reduced rs-FC of both DLPFC and PCun with several cortical and subcortical areas compared with HCs. Cluster 1 was defined by lower values of rs-FC in all investigated regions of interest while clusters 2 and 3, respectively, by higher and intermediate values. Despite none meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at T0, cluster 1 was older and lower performing in global cognition, fronto-executive, and memory domains, compared with clusters 2 and 3 (all \nEarly connectivity changes of the DLPFC and the PCun occur in newly diagnosed patients with PD without MCI and can distinguish cognitive phenotypes, as confirmed after a longitudinal clinical observation.",

    "abstract": "Regular exercise can reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, a common neurodegenerative disorder. The Rock Steady Boxing organization created an exercise program for people with Parkinson's Disease (pwPD) modelled after traditional boxing. The purpose of this study was to better understand the physical function, exercise beliefs, contextual factors, class experiences and outcome perceptions of pwPD participating in Rock Steady Boxing.\nA pragmatic qualitative approach of semi-structured interviews and class observations was supplemented by cross-sectional physical function measures.\nTen study participants were community dwelling adults with Parkinson's Disease, participating in Rock Steady Boxing two to three times a week for an average of 10.6 (6.2) months. Most participants (7/10) had good mobility with Timed Up and Go scores below the 14.8 second average for community dwelling pwPD (7/10) and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 Mobility Scores < 50% (8/10). Participants (9/10) had good exercise self-efficacy, with average scores on the Short Self-efficacy for Exercise Scale > 3/5. Thematic analysis revealed a history of exercise and strong exercise beliefs positively influenced participation. Rock Steady Boxing provided valued social interactions and offered individualized attention through personalized modifications.\nInstructor enthusiasm, program modifiability and social support drive participation and provide a challenge for differing abilities. RSB is a valued community offering for pwPD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. In particular, neuroinflammation associated with phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is likely to cause the death of dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, protecting dopaminergic neurons through anti-neuroinflammation is a promising therapeutic strategy for PD. This study investigated whether Tribuli Fructus (TF) could alleviate PD by inhibiting neuroinflammation. Mouse primary mixed glial culture cells from the mouse cortex were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce neuroinflammation, and 1\u00a0h later, cells were treated with TF. 1-methyl-4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was injected into C57BL/6J mice for 5 days, and TF was co and post-administered for 12 days. Our study showed that TF attenuated pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines in LPS-stimulated primary mixed glial cultures. In the brains of MPTP-induced PD mouse model, TF inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes, protected dopaminergic neurons, and increased dopamine levels. TF alleviated MPTP-induced bradykinesia, a representative behavioral disorder in PD. In addition, the results in vitro and in vivo revealed that TF regulates the phosphorylation of JNK. Collectively, our data suggest that TF may be a new therapeutic candidate for PD by regulating JNK signaling.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, leading to the range of motor and non-motor symptoms. There is mounting evidence suggesting that oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of PD. Current therapies only alleviate perturbed motor symptoms. Therefore, it is essential to find out new therapies that allow us to improve not only motor symptoms, but non-motor symptoms like cognitive impairment and modulate disease progression. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous anti-oxidants and cytoprotective genes can counteract oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby potentially ameliorating PD-associated pathology. The current review discusses about the Nrf2 structure and function with special emphasis on various molecular signalling pathways involved in positive and negative modulation of Nrf2, namely Glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2, Phosphoinositide-3-kinase, AMP-activated protein kinase, Mitogen activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-\u03baB and P62. Furthermore, this review highlights the various Nrf2 activators as promising therapeutic agents for slowing down the progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) affects nearly half of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, the structural heterogeneity within the brainstem, which regulates REM sleep, remains largely unexplored in PD. Our objective was to identify distinct PD subtypes based on microstructural characteristics in the brainstem and examine their associations with the severity of RBD. Data, including diffusion tensor imaging and REM sleep behavior disorder screening questionnaire (RBDSQ) responses, were obtained from 124 PD patients and 61 healthy controls through the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative database. Mean Quantitative Anisotropy (QA) values, representing axonal density, were extracted from 14 brainstem tracts and input into the semi-supervised machine learning algorithm, Heterogeneity through Discriminative Analysis (HYDRA), to cluster subtypes. Applying HYDRA, we identified two distinct PD subtypes (Subtype 1: n\u2009=\u200966, Subtype 2: n\u2009=\u200958). Subtype 2 exhibited reduced QA across assessed brainstem tracts and significantly higher RBDSQ scores than Subtype 1 and healthy controls (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Conversely, Subtype 1, characterized by lower RBDSQ scores, exhibited increased QA, notably in the right medial longitudinal fasciculus, when compared to Subtype 2 and controls (p\u2009<\u20090.001). These findings suggest that heterogeneous axonal damage in brainstem circuits correlates with variations in RBD severity, providing insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of early PD.",

    "abstract": "Both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and the successful reprogramming of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an unprecedented therapeutic potential for Parkinson's disease (PD), allowing for the replacement of depleted neurons in PD-affected brain regions, thereby achieving therapeutic goals. This study explored the differences in cell types between iPSCs and ESCs in the PD brain to provide a feasible theoretical basis for the improved use of iPSCs as a replacement for ESCs in treating PD. Signal cell RNA sequencing data and microarray data of ESCs and iPSCs were collected from the GEO database. scRNA-seq data were subjected to quality control, clustering, and identification using the Seurat R package to determine cell types and proportions in ESCs and iPSCs. Differential expression analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes between ESCs and iPSCs, and PPI network analysis was conducted using String. Based on scRNA-seq data, we identified 13 cell clusters in ESCs and 13 cell clusters in iPSCs. iPSCs were predominantly composed of immune cells and lacked astrocytes, neurons, and dopamine neurons compared to ESCs. iPSCs also exhibited lower cell type diversity compared to ESCs. At the gene level, iPSCs lacked key genes, such as TH and GAP43 for nerve growth and development. At the metabolic level, the difference between ESCs and iPSC was mainly reflected in nerve cells and was closely related to the tumor-proliferation signature. iPSCs can be promoted to differentiate into cell types closer to or even replace ESCs, providing a better therapeutic option for PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Variants in PRKN and PINK1 are the leading cause of early-onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, yet many cases remain genetically unresolved. We previously identified a 7 megabases complex structural variant in a pair of monozygotic twins using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing. This study aims to determine if ONT long-read sequencing can detect a second variant in other unresolved early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) cases with 1 heterozygous PRKN or PINK1 variant.\nONT long-read sequencing was performed on EOPD patients with 1 reported PRKN/PINK1 pathogenic variant, with onset age under 50. Positive controls included EOPD patients with 2 known PRKN pathogenic variants. Initial testing involved short-read targeted panel sequencing for single nucleotide variants and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for copy number variants.\nA total of 47 patients were studied (PRKN \"one-variant,\" n\u2009=\u200923; PINK1 \"one-variant,\" n\u2009=\u200912; PRKN \"two-variants,\" n\u2009=\u200912). ONT long-read sequencing identified a second pathogenic variant in 26% of PRKN \"one-variant\" patients (6/23), but none in PINK1 \"one-variant\" patients (0/12). Detected variants included 1 complex inversion, 2 structural variant overlaps, and 3 duplications. In the PRKN \"two-variants\" group, both variants were identified in all patients (100%, 12/12).\nONT long-read sequencing effectively identifies pathogenic structural variants in the PRKN locus missed by conventional methods. It should be considered for unresolved EOPD cases when a second variant is not detected through conventional approaches. ANN NEUROL 2024.",

    "abstract": "One percent of persons over 65 years of age suffer from Parkinson's disease, a neurological ailment marked by dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway gradually dying and being depleted in the striatum. Parkin and PINK1 gene mutations, which are essential for mitophagy and impair mitochondrial function, are the cause of it. Parkinson's disease is linked to a number of motor and impairment disorders, including bradykinesia, rigid muscles, tremor at rest, and imbalance. Numerous signaling pathways, including \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, lead to age-related decline in proteolytic defense systems. Parkinson's disease etiology involves oxidative stress, ferroptosis, mitochondrial failure, and neuroinflammation. Parkinson's disease is significantly influenced by neuroinflammation, which is a result of both innate and adaptive immune responses. The purpose of studying mechanisms and phytomolecules is to assist researchers in creating therapies for Parkinson's disease. Phytomolecules, like curcumin, \u03b2- amyrin, berberine, capsaicin, and gentisic acid, exert neuroprotective properties by reducing ROS levels, lessening \u03b1-synuclein-induced toxicity, and shielding the cells from apoptosis. In conclusion, the studies presented here provide valuable insights into the potential of various medications for Parkinson's disease treatment. By understanding the mechanisms behind these treatments, researchers can develop more effective treatments for PD.",

    "abstract": "The malfunctioning of microtubules is highly correlated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), although whether it is a cause or an effect of neurodegeneration is yet unknown. Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3 kinases (LIMKs), being one of the important kinases, regulate the neuronal cytoskeleton by controlling the phosphorylation of the cofilin/actin-depolymerizing factor. Recently, we showed that upregulation of phosphorylated LIMK1 (p-LIMK1) affects the microtubule dynamics in a central nervous system traumatic injury. The goal of this study is to correlate the expression of LIMK1 with dopaminergic neuron death in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine model of PD, one of the well-established subacute models of PD, where the neurotoxin acts via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I of the electron transport chain. Herein, we found that LIMK1 expression was increased and correlated to dopaminergic neuronal death. Finally, we demonstrated that the treatment with LIMK inhibitor BMS-5 significantly reversed the neurodegeneration, along with an upregulation of the dynamic tubulins, indicating the relevance of LIMKs and microtubule dynamics in neurodegeneration. Therefore, targeting the microtubules, an integral part of the neuronal cytoskeleton and neurite formation, can be a promising strategy to combat degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to determine the effect of chronic hyperglycemia, induced by a high-fat diet and STZ-induced diabetes, on the development of Parkinson's disease-like characteristics. Understanding this relationship is crucial in pharmacology, neurology, and diabetes, as it could potentially lead to developing new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease. Our study employed a comprehensive approach to investigate the effect of hyperglycemia on Parkinson's disease-like characteristics. Hyperglycemia was induced by a high-fat diet for 6- and 9-week duration with a single intraperitoneal STZ (100 mg/kg) injection at week 5 in C57/BL6 mice. Rotenone (10 mg/kg p.o.) was administered to C57/BL6 mice for 6 and 9 weeks. Time-dependent behavioral studies (wire-hang tests, pole tests, Y-maze tests, and round beam walk tests) were carried out to monitor pathology progression and deficits. Molecular protein levels (GLP1, PI3K, AKT, GSK-3\u03b2, NF-\u03baB, and \u03b1-syn), oxidative stress (GSH and MDA) parameters, and histopathological alterations (H&E and Nissl staining) were determined after 6 weeks as well as 9 weeks. After 9 weeks of study, molecular protein expression (p-AKT and p-\u03b1-syn) was determined. Hyperglycemia induced by HFD and STZ induced significant motor impairment in mice, correlated with the rotenone group. Insulin receptor signaling (GLP1/PI3K/AKT) was found to be disrupted in the HFD+STZ group and also in rotenone-treated mice, which further enhanced phosphorylation of \u03b1-syn, suggesting its role in \u03b1-syn accumulation. Histopathological alterations indicating neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration were quite evident in the HFD+STZ and rotenone groups. Exposure to hyperglycemia induced by HFD+STZ administration exhibits PD-like characteristics after 9 weeks of duration, which was correlative with rotenone-induced PD-like symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a critical non-motor symptom of Parkinson's Disease (PD) that profoundly affects patients' quality of life. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating the structural and functional brain changes associated with cognitive impairment in PD (PD-CI). MRI techniques enable the precise identification and monitoring of the onset and progression of cognitive deficits in PD. This review synthesizes recent literature on the use of MRI-based techniques, including voxel-based morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI, in the study of PD-CI. By examining these imaging modalities, the article aims to elucidate the patterns of brain structural and functional alterations in PD-CI, offering critical insights that can inform clinical management and therapeutic strategies. In particular, this review provides a novel synthesis of recent advancements in understanding how specific MRI metrics, such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and functional connectivity, contribute to early detection and personalized treatment approaches for PD-CI. The integration of findings from these studies enhances our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in PD and highlights the potential of MRI as a supportive tool in the clinical assessment and treatment of PD-CI.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects around 8.5 million people currently with numbers expected to rise to 12 million by 2040. PD is characterized by fluctuating motor and non-motor symptoms demanding accurate monitoring. Recent advancements in digital medical devices (DMDs) like wearables and AI offer promise in addressing these needs. However, the successful implementation of DMDs in healthcare relies on patients' willingness to adopt and engage with these digital tools.\nTo understand patient perspectives in individuals with PD, a cross-sectional study was conducted as part of the EU-wide DIGIPD project across France, Spain, and Germany. Multidisciplinary teams including neurodegenerative clinics and patient organizations conducted surveys focusing on (i) sociodemographic information, (ii) use of DMDs (iii) acceptance of using health data (iv) preferences for the DMDs use. We used descriptive statistics to understand the use of DMDs and patient preferences and logistic regression models to identify predictors of willingness to use DMDs and to share health data through DMDs.\nIn total 333 individuals with PD participated in the study. Findings revealed a high willingness to use DMDs (90.3%) and share personal health data (97.4%,) however this differed across sociodemographic groups and was more notable among older age groups (under 65\u202f=\u202f17.9% vs. over 75\u202f=\u202f39.29%, \nThe study emphasizes the importance of considering patient perspectives for the effective deployment of digital technologies, especially for older and more advanced disease-stage patients who stand to benefit the most.",

PD is a globally prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of Lewy bodies and the loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to severe motor and non-motor complications in patients. As current treatments are unable to halt the progression of neuronal loss and dopamine degradation, MSC therapy has emerged as a highly promising strategy for PD treatment. This promise is due to MSCs' unique properties compared to other types of stem cells, including self-renewal, differentiation potential, immune privilege, secretion of neurotrophic factors, ability to improve damaged tissue, modulation of the immune system, and lack of ethical concerns. MSCs have been employed in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies for PD treatment with promising results. However, certain aspects of their efficacy in treating PD may benefit from various genetic and epigenetic modifications. In this review article, we assess these approaches to improving MSCs for specialized treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Pyroptosis, a specific type of programmed cell death, which has become a significant factor to Parkinson's disease (PD). Concurrently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have garnered attention for their regulatory roles in neurodegenerative disorders. This study was designed to ascertain the key lncRNAs in pyroptosis pathways of PD and elucidate their regulatory mechanisms.\nEmploying a combination of bioinformatics and machine learning, we analyzed PD data sets GSE133347 and GSE110716. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) recognized different lncRNAs. Through various algorithms such as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Random Forest (RF), and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), we recognized LINC01606 and LINC00269, which are key factors during the emergence and development of PD. Furthermore, experimental validation was conducted in PD mouse models to confirm these bioinformatics findings.\nThe analysis showed that there were a large number of apoptosis-related gene expression changes in Parkinson's syndrome, for example, CASP1 and GSDME were up-regulated, and CASP9 and AIM2 were down-regulated. Among the lncRNAs, LINC01606 and LINC00269 were identified as potential modulators of pyroptosis. Notably, LINC00269 was observed to be significantly downregulated in the brain tissues of a PD mouse model, supporting its involvement in PD. The study also highlighted potential interactions of these lncRNAs with genes like ONECUT2, PRLR, CTNNA3, and LRP2.\nThis study identifies LINC00269 as a potential contributor to pyroptosis pathways in PD. While further investigation is required to fully elucidate its role, these findings provide new insights into PD pathogenesis and suggest potential avenues for future research on diagnostic and therapeutic targets. The study underscores the importance of integrating bioinformatics with experimental validation in neurodegenerative disease research.",

    "abstract": "Pharmaceutical care for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is complex. Specialized pharmaceutical care provided by a dedicated pharmacy team member (pharmabuddy) for these patients may reduce medication-related problems. The feasibility of this service for PD patients is unknown.\nTo evaluate the feasibility of a Pharmabuddy Care Service (PCS) for PD patients in primary care pharmacies.\nPharmabuddies who offered PCS were invited to fill in a questionnaire to evaluate the feasibility of PCS. Patients received a patient questionnaire and were invited for an interview. Patient records provided information on medication-related problems and interventions. Feasibility was evaluated conform four domains of Bowen's Framework. First, acceptability included patients' satisfaction ratings and experiences, Pharmabuddy impression on start and continuation of the service. Second, demand included use by patients and provision by pharmabuddies. Third, implementation/practicality: implementation indicators and barriers and facilitators from patient- and pharmabuddy perspective and fourth limited efficacy: effect of the PCS on PD symptoms, medication related problems identified and interventions from patient records.\nTwenty-three (59%) patients completed the questionnaire, 9 were interviewed, 12 (67%) pharmabuddies responded. Acceptability was high among patients (mean 9.5 (SD 1.3) out of 10), 6 (50%) pharmacies (still) provided PCS. Demand: 56% of patients had 1-2 contact moments, 28% two or more. Ten pharmacies provided up to 14 patients per pharmacy with PCS, one up to 24. Implementation/practicality: important barriers were time constraints and perception of other healthcare professionals. Positive reactions from patients encouraged pharmabuddies to carry out their PCS-activities. Patients were positive about pharmabuddy's listening competency while knowledge could be improved. Limited efficacy: from patient records, 89 interventions were made in response to 93 (median 3 per patient (range 1-16)) medication related problems or questions, with 20 (87%) patients reporting a positive effect from their interaction with a pharmabuddy.\nThis study shows PCS is highly appreciated by responding patients and can be feasible for primary care pharmacies. Several implementation issues are still present. Future studies should focus on quantifiable effects of PCS services as well as resource and perception hurdles.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central aspect of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology, yet the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study investigates the link between \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) pathology and the loss of translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOM40), unraveling its implications for mitochondrial dysfunctions in neurons. We discovered that TOM40 protein depletion occurs in the brains of patients with Guam Parkinsonism-Dementia (Guam PD) and cultured neurons expressing \u03b1-Syn proteinopathy, notably, without corresponding changes in TOM40 mRNA levels. Cultured neurons expressing \u03b1-Syn mutants, with or without a mitochondria-targeting signal (MTS) underscores the role of \u03b1-Syn's mitochondrial localization in inducing TOM40 degradation. PDe-related etiological factors, such as 6-hydroxydopamine or ROS/metal ions stress, which promotes \u03b1-Syn oligomerization, exacerbate TOM40 depletion in PD patient-derived cells with SNCA gene triplication. Although \u03b1-Syn interacts with both TOM40 and TOM20 in the outer mitochondrial membrane, degradation is selective for TOM40, which occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) pathway. Our comprehensive analyses using Seahorse technology, mitochondrial DNA sequencing, and damage assessments, demonstrate that mutant \u03b1-Syn-induced TOM40 loss results in mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by reduced membrane potential, accumulation of mtDNA damage, deletion/insertion mutations, and altered oxygen consumption rates. Notably, ectopic supplementation of TOM40 or reducing pathological forms of \u03b1-Syn using ADP-ribosylation inhibitors ameliorate these mitochondrial defects, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues. In conclusion, our findings provide crucial mechanistic insights into how \u03b1-Syn accumulation leads to TOM40 degradation and mitochondrial dysfunction, offering insights for targeted interventions to alleviate mitochondrial defects in PD.",

    "abstract": "Research in the last few decades has brought us closer to an understanding of the brain circuit abnormalities that underlie parkinsonian motor signs. This article summarizes the current knowledge in this rapidly emerging field. Traditional observations of activity changes of basal ganglia neurons that accompany akinesia and bradykinesia have been supplemented with new knowledge regarding specific pathophysiologic changes that are associated with other parkinsonian signs, such as tremor and gait impairments. New research also emphasizes the role of non-basal ganglia structures in parkinsonism, including the pedunculopontine nucleus, the cerebellum, and the cerebral cortex, and the role of structural and functional neuroplasticity. A more detailed understanding of the brain network abnormalities that result from Parkinson's disease is necessary to arrive at more effective and specific treatments for these symptoms in parkinsonian patients through circuit interventions reaching from deep brain stimulation to genetic and chemogenetic treatments.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a vital cellular process responsible for the degradation of proteins, organelles, and other cellular components within lysosomes. In neurons, basal autophagy is indispensable for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control. Accordingly, lysosomal dysfunction has been proposed to be associated with neurodegeneration, and with Parkinson's disease (PD) in particular. Aging, dopamine metabolism, and PD-linked genetic mutations are thought to impair the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, disrupt cellular proteostasis, and contribute to PD pathogenesis. These alterations represent an opportunity to identify potential new therapeutic targets and disease biomarkers, thus laying the groundwork for the development of novel disease-modifying strategies for PD that are aimed at restoring cellular proteostasis and quality control systems.",

Particularly during pandemic, drug repurposing caught much attention to provide new applications of the previously approved drugs. In our research, we provide a novel method for drug repurposing based on feature learning process from drug-disease-gene network. In our research, we aimed at finding drug candidates which can be repurposed under neurodegenerative diseases and glioma. We collected association data between drugs, diseases and genes from public resources and primarily examined the data related to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Glioma diseases. We created a Knowledge Graph using neo4j by integrating all these datasets and applied scalable feature learning algorithm known as node2vec to create node embeddings. These embeddings were later used to predict the unknown associations between disease and their candidate drugs by finding cosine similarity between disease and drug nodes embedding. We obtained a definitive set of candidate drugs for repurposing. These results were validated from the literature and CodReS online tool to rank the candidate drugs. Additionally, we verified the status of candidate drugs from pharmaceutical knowledge databases to confirm their significance.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder, and past research suggests that adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) may influence the risk of PD. However, there are varying conclusions among different studies regarding the correlation between long-term adherence to the MD and the occurrence of PD. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between MD adherence and PD incidence.\nThis meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024520410). We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases to identify observational studies, including prospective cohorts, case-control, and cross-sectional studies, up to February 2024. Studies reported on MD adherence were included, with MD adherence categorized through a quantifying score or index. The pool odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the highest versus the lowest categories of MD score in relation to PD risk, using random-effects models. Additionally, bias assessment, heterogeneity assessment, sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis were performed. A total of 12 studies were included in the meta-analysis.\nThe overall effect size of PD risk was as follows: compared to the lowest adherence to the MD, the highest adherence to MD showed a significant negative correlation with the incidence of PD, with an overall OR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.84). Specifically, in studies diagnosing PD, the overall OR was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.94), while in studies diagnosing prodromal Parkinson's disease (pPD), the overall OR was 0.67 (95%CI: 0.59, 0.76). For individuals aged <60 years, the overall OR was 0.70 (95%CI: 0.62, 0.78), whereas, for those aged \u226560 years, the overall OR was 0.86 (95%CI: 0.74, 0.99).\nThe evidence from this meta-analysis demonstrates a significant negative correlation between adherence to MD patterns and the risk of PD, suggesting that the MD may serve as a protective factor for PD. This dietary pattern may be particularly beneficial in reducing the risk of pPD.",

Behavioral assessments included the rotarod and open field tests, while biochemical analyses measured oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), glutathione (GSH)), antioxidants (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT)), pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1)), and neurotransmitters (dopamine (DA), levodopa (L-Dopa)). Histological and immunohistochemical analyses evaluated the neuronal integrity and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and alpha-synuclein expression. The results showed that Paracentrotus lividus gonadal extract significantly mitigated rotenone-induced motor deficits and improved locomotor activity. Biochemically, the extract reduced oxidative stress and inflammation markers while enhancing antioxidant levels. Histologically, it restored neuronal integrity and reduced alpha-synuclein accumulation. Molecularly, it increased tyrosine hydroxylase and dopa decarboxylase gene expression, essential for dopamine synthesis. These findings suggest that Paracentrotus lividus gonadal extract exerts neuroprotective effects by modulating oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and dopaminergic neuron integrity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "There is currently no pharmacological treatment for visuo-cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease. Alternative strategies are needed to address these non-motor symptoms given their impact on quality of life. Novel technologies have potential to deliver multimodal rehabilitation of visuo-cognitive dysfunction, but more research is required to determine their feasibility in Parkinson's.\nTo determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a home-based, technological visuo-cognitive training (TVT) intervention using a mobile application and exercise with stroboscopic glasses compared to non-technological care in people with Parkinson's.\nThis 18-month, parallel, two-arm pilot trial took place between July 2021-December 2022. Participants were community-dwelling individuals with a diagnosis of Parkinson's, aged over 50 years. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two active four-week interventions, TVT (n = 20) or standard care (SC) (n = 20). A physiotherapist delivered 8 home visits over 4 weeks, lasting 45-60 mins. Participants were evaluated at baseline and then on completion of the intervention. Primary outcomes were feasibility of the study design and intervention (recruitment/retention, adherence, assessment time scale, equipment and safety). Exploratory outcomes included assessments of cognitive, visual, clinical and motor function. (Blinding of participants was not possible due to the nature of the intervention).\nThe recruitment rate was 60% (40/67), and the retention rate was 98% (39/40). Adherence to both arms of the intervention was high, with participants attending 98% of visits in the TVT group and 96% of visits in the SC group. 35% (9/20) of participants in the TVT group experienced mild symptoms associated with use of the stroboscopic glasses which included dizziness, queasiness and unsteadiness. There were minimal between group differences, with both interventions having positive effects on a variety of clinical, cognitive, and physical performance outcomes.\nOur findings suggest that home-based TVT with a physiotherapist is feasible in people with Parkinson's and could provide an alternative approach to addressing cognitive and motor dysfunction in this population. We make recommendations for future trials and invite ensuing studies to improve upon the design and utilise stroboscopic visual training and digital tools to investigate this emerging area of multimodal rehabilitation. This trial was prospectively registered at ISRCTN (registration number: ISRCTN46164906; https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN46164906).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Combining levodopa with other drugs, including decarboxylase inhibitors (DCI) is its most effective treatment. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common cause of hospitalization in Parkinson's patients, making it crucial to find an appropriate treatment to reduce the incidence of this complication. This study aimed to investigate UTIs in Parkinson's patients using levodopa with DCI supplements.\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched up to March 2024. Only randomized controlled trials involving Parkinson's patients were included in the present study. Parkinson's patients who used levodopa along with carbidopa or benserazide were considered the intervention group, while those who used levodopa with another drug were considered the control group.\nNine interventional studies were ultimately analyzed. The relative risk (RR) of UTI in patients taking DCI was 26% lower than those who did not (RR Treatment/Control = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.58-0.95, p = 0.019). Furthermore, observations at different times of follow-up showed that at 13-24 weeks and at > 24 weeks of treatment with DCI, there was a reduction in the incidence of UTI (RR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.46-1.01 and RR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.58-1.0, respectively). On the contrary, there was an increase of the risk of UTI in the first 12 weeks of treatment with DCI (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.37-3.33).\nThe results of this study indicated that using DCI drugs is associated with a reduced relative risk of developing UTIs. The beneficial effect of the drug showed after 12 weeks of treatment after an initial negative effect on the risk of UTI.",

    "abstract": "Women make up only 23% to 30% of recipients for deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for Parkinson's disease (PD), a discrepancy that is not accounted for by differences in disease incidence. One of the many factors that may contribute to this gap includes gender differences in decision-making.\nThe aim was to explore how women and men approach the decision for DBS in terms of informational needs, weighing risks and benefits, and decision-making.\nSemistructured interviews were conducted with 33 participants with PD who had undergone DBS evaluation within the past 3\u2009years. Data were analyzed using content analysis.\nSixteen women and 17 men participated in interviews. We identified 4 key themes. First, information sources were similar between women and men, and they valued hearing personal experiences. Second, the motivations for DBS surgery were often very personal. Third, the decision-making process occurred over time, sometimes years. Fourth, although many expressed fear of brain surgery, trust in the surgeon helped many overcome this fear. Women overall had less support than men during decision-making and after surgery. Women also placed greater value on talking to other women who had undergone DBS, although they had a hard time finding these women. Men, on the contrary, were less often worried about support and valued numerical information when weighing risks and benefits.\nWe found gender differences in information needs, support, motivating factors, and how patients weighed risks and benefits. These differences can be used to inform educational tools and counseling for DBS.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorders (ICDs) and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are common symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Few longitudinal studies have focused on the association between EDS and ICDs. This longitudinal study aimed at assessing association between EDS and ICDs in PD.\nPatients without ICDs were incorporated from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. All patients were followed until the onset of ICDs or the end of 4 years. A total of 260 PD patients were included. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to explore association between EDS and ICDs.\nThe overall frequency of ICDs at the end of follow-up was 23.8% (62 patients). The mean duration from dopamine replacement therapy to develop ICDs was 3.30 \u00b1 2.42 years. Patients with ICDs had significantly higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score (\nOur results indicated that EDS acts as a risk for ICDs occurrence in PD. Clinicians should pay attention to EDS in clinical practice. This may be a promising new approach to better understand and therapy ICDs.",

    "abstract": "Catheter ablation (CA) is the first-line treatment with a high success rate for patients with symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, while three-dimensional (3D) mapping systems enable the identification of accessory pathways (APs). We aimed to develop a novel mapping method using wave-speed mapping (WSM) to determine AP locations and CA outcomes.\nThis study included 19 patients diagnosed with atrioventricular (AV) reciprocating tachycardia. We compared local activation time (LAT) mapping and WSM, and analyzed the relationship between the \"high-speed islets\" in WSM and successful ablation sites. Sixteen APs were located on the left, three on the septum, and one on the right side. The median number of mapping points and mapping time were 1451 points and 14.6\u2009min, respectively. All 20 APs in the 19 patients were eliminated using \"high-speed islets\" in WSM. Eleven APs (55%) were eliminated after the first ablation application. One patient with an anteroseptal AP close to the AV node underwent cryoablation to avoid an AV block. The AP width in the 3D mapping system was significantly narrower in WSM than in LAT mapping (5.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0\u2009mm vs. 10.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2\u2009mm, p\u2009<\u2009.001). One patient experienced an AP recurrence, successfully eliminated using WSM-guided CA in a repeat procedure. During 13.1\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3 months of follow-up, all patients remained free of any supraventricular tachycardias.\nWSM is a novel mapping method for visualizing APs as \"high-speed islets\" and guides a more precise ablation site than LAT mapping.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord stimulation is a well-established, minimally invasive surgical technique that has been effectively utilized for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes. In the past 15 years, there has been a significant increase in reports on the use of spinal stimulation for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as in isolated cases of atypical parkinsonism. These reports frequently highlight a positive impact of spinal stimulation on gait impairments. A hallmark symptom of advanced PD, as well as several phenotypes of progressive supranuclear palsy, is the freezing of gait phenomenon. This condition, akin to postural instability, is likely linked to disruptions in multimodal integration across various levels of locomotor control. Given its poor responsiveness to dopaminergic therapy, freezing of gait remains one of the most debilitating symptoms in parkinsonism. This review consolidates current knowledge on the use of chronic epidural spinal cord stimulation in patients with PD and atypical parkinsonism, with a focus on its potential to alleviate locomotor disorders, particularly freezing of gait.\n\u0421\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0430

    "abstract": "To evaluate bladder dysfunction (BD) and its relationship with Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms and dopaminergic therapy.\nOne hundred and thirteen patients with PD of I-III H&Y stages were examined using the following scales: IPSS, including irritative and obstructive symptom indices, UPDRS I-IV, Sch&En, PDQ-39, BDI, STAI, PFS-16, GDSS, GSRS, MMSE, FAB and NMSQ.\nMost of the patients (89.4%) had BD according to IPSS (Me=6.0 [3.0-13.0]), all of them showed irritative disorders, which were combined with obstructive ones in 61%. BD did not depend on sex, stage and duration of PD. IPSS scores correlated with age (\nBD is present in the majority of PD patients and significantly reduces the quality of life already in the early stages of PD; BD predictors are depression, frontal dysfunction and male sex.

    "abstract": "To study the features of the clinical picture and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD).\nThe analysis of databases of four psychoneurological dispensaries in Moscow with the allocation of groups of patients with diagnoses of SSD (F20-F25 according to ICD-10) was carried out. Among these groups, a targeted search for patients with an established diagnosis of PD (G20) was conducted. Among this category of patients, the incidence of PD, the therapy taken, the premotor symptoms of PD and the parameters characterizing the features of the clinical picture and diagnosis of PD were analyzed.\nA total of 9124 patients with SSD were identified, among them 11 people diagnosed with PD, while the final incidence of PD was 0.1% (95% CI 0-0.2%). The average age at onset of SSD and PD was 33.18\u00b18.72 years and 58.9\u00b18.1 years, respectively. The average time between the appearance of the first signs of PD and the final diagnosis was 5.09\u00b11.92 years. The most commonly used antipsychotic in the group of patients with PD was quetiapine (54.5%); clozapine and some typical antipsychotics were used less frequently. The most common premotor symptoms were apathy, depression, anxiety, constipation and orthostatic hypotension. Hyposmia and behavioral disorders in the REM sleep phase were less common.\nThe results confirm the difficulty of managing patients with comorbidity of PD and SSD. Psychiatrists should pay close attention to the features of motor symptoms in patients with SSD and carefully identify clinical signs that may indicate the presence of PD or other neurodegenerative diseases with parkinsonism.\n\u0418\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438

The average age at onset of SSD and PD was 33.18\u00b18.72 years and 58.9\u00b18.1 years, respectively. The average time between the appearance of the first signs of PD and the final diagnosis was 5.09\u00b11.92 years. The most commonly used antipsychotic in the group of patients with PD was quetiapine (54.5%); clozapine and some typical antipsychotics were used less frequently. The most common premotor symptoms were apathy, depression, anxiety, constipation and orthostatic hypotension. Hyposmia and behavioral disorders in the REM sleep phase were less common.",

    "abstract": "Tremor is one of the main motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and its pathophysiology remains largely unknown. The clinical and pathomorphological heterogeneity of tremor and the not always response to therapy complicate the task of researchers and clinicians. This review discusses the specific degeneration of neurotransmitter systems driving the development of tremor, and the influence of neurotransmitters on specific anatomical entities according to current models explaining tremor. It is discusses how changes in neurotransmitter systems may influence the clinical diversity of tremor and differences in response to therapy. Data from clinical trials demonstrating the effect of the dopamine receptor agonist piribedil on tremor are presented.\n\u0422\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439. \u0423\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0443 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u044e. \u0420\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c, \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430, \u0438 \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438, \u043e\u0431\u044a\u044f\u0441\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u0431\u0441\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u044e. \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0444\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043f\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440.",

    "abstract": "Antigen retrieval is crucial for immunohistochemistry, particularly in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded brain tissue, where fixation causes extensive crosslinking that masks epitopes. Heat Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER) reverses these crosslinks, improving access to nuclear and aggregated proteins. We introduce Cyclic Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (CHIER), an advanced technique that builds on HIER by incorporating repeated cycles of heating and cooling. CHIER optimises antigen retrieval and significantly improves detection. CHIER is particularly effective for detecting chromatin-binding proteins, such as SMARCC2, which are difficult to label using conventional IHC methods. Using CHIER on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human brain sections, we achieved robust detection of SMARCC2 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. CHIER also enhanced the visualisation of large SMARCC2+ cytoplasmic bodies, termed cytobodies, which are increased in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Our findings suggest that SMARCC2 may translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in PD, potentially implicating SMARCC2 aggregation in the disease's pathology. Furthermore, CHIER does not negatively impact the antigenicity of other antibodies, supporting its use for multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry and super-resolution imaging. These results highlight CHIER's potential for improving the detection of chromatin-binding and aggregated proteins in neurodegenerative disease research, offering new insights into SMARCC2's role in Parkinson's Disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. While there is no curative treatment, the immune system's involvement with autoimmune T cells that recognize the protein \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in a subset of individuals suggests new areas for therapeutic strategies. As not all patients with PD have T cells specific for \u03b1-syn, we explored additional autoantigenic targets of T cells in PD. We generated 15-mer peptides spanning several PD-related proteins implicated in PD pathology, including glucosylceramidase \u03b2 1 (GBA), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1), Parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (parkin), oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), and leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Cytokine production (IFN-\u03b3, IL-5, IL-10) against these proteins was measured using a fluorospot assay and PBMCs from patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls. We identified PINK1, a regulator of mitochondrial stability, as an autoantigen targeted by T cells, as well as its unique epitopes, and their HLA restriction. The PINK1-specific T cell reactivity revealed sex-based differences, as it was predominantly found in male patients with PD, which may contribute to the heterogeneity of PD. Identifying and characterizing PINK1 and other autoinflammatory targets may lead to antigen-specific diagnostics, progression markers, and/or novel therapeutic strategies for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease has long been considered a disorder that primarily affects the brain, as it is defined by the dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra and the brain accumulation of Lewy bodies containing alpha-synuclein protein. In recent decades, however, accumulating research has revealed that Parkinson's disease also involves the gut and uncovered an intimate and important bidirectional link between the brain and the gut, called the \"gut-brain axis.\" Numerous clinical studies demonstrate that gut dysfunction frequently precedes motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients, with findings including impaired intestinal permeability, heightened inflammation, and distinct gut microbiome profiles and metabolites. Furthermore, alpha-synuclein deposition has been consistently observed in the gut of Parkinson's disease patients, suggesting a potential role in disease initiation. Importantly, individuals with vagotomy have a reduced Parkinson's disease risk. From these observations, researchers have hypothesized that alpha-synuclein accumulation may initiate in the gut and subsequently propagate to the central dopaminergic neurons through the gut-brain axis, leading to Parkinson's disease. This review comprehensively examines the gut's involvement in Parkinson's disease, focusing on the concept of a gut-origin for the disease. We also examine the interplay between altered gut-related factors and the accumulation of pathological alpha-synuclein in the gut of Parkinson's disease patients. Given the accessibility of the gut to both dietary and pharmacological interventions, targeting gut-localized alpha-synuclein represents a promising avenue for developing effective Parkinson's disease therapies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and clinical symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and slowed movements. A key feature of Parkinson's disease is the accumulation of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein, forming insoluble Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which contributes to neurodegeneration. These \u03b1-synuclein aggregates may act as autoantigens, leading to T-cell-mediated neuroinflammation and contributing to dopaminergic cell death. Our perspective explores the hypothesis that Parkinson's disease may have an autoimmune component, highlighting research that connects peripheral immune responses with neurodegeneration. T cells derived from Parkinson's disease patients appear to have the potential to initiate an autoimmune response against \u03b1-synuclein and its modified peptides, possibly leading to the formation of neo-epitopes. Recent evidence associates Parkinson's disease with abnormal immune responses, as indicated by increased levels of immune cells, such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, observed in both patients and mouse models. The convergence of T cells filtration increasing major histocompatibility complex molecules, and the susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons supports the hypothesis that Parkinson's disease may exhibit autoimmune characteristics. Understanding the immune mechanisms involved in Parkinson's disease will be crucial for developing therapeutic strategies that target the autoimmune aspects of the disease. Novel approaches, including precision medicine based on major histocompatibility complex/human leukocyte antigen typing and early biomarker identification, could pave the way for immune-based treatments aimed at slowing or halting disease progression. This perspective explores the relationship between autoimmunity and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that further research could deepen understanding and offer new therapeutic avenues. In this paper, it is organized to provide a comprehensive perspective on the autoimmune aspects of Parkinson's disease. It investigates critical areas such as the autoimmune response observed in Parkinson's disease patients and the role of autoimmune mechanisms targeting \u03b1-synuclein in Parkinson's disease. The paper also examines the impact of CD4+ T cells, specifically Th1 and Th17, on neurons through in-vitro and ex-vivo studies. Additionally, it explores how \u03b1-synuclein influences glia-induced neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease. The discussion extends to the clinical implications and therapeutic landscape, offering insights into potential treatments. Consequently, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective on the autoimmune aspects of Parkinson's disease, incorporating both supportive and opposing views on its classification as an autoimmune disorder and exploring implications for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal plasticity, the brain's ability to adapt structurally and functionally, Is essential for learning, memory, and recovery from injuries. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, this plasticity is disrupted, leading to cognitive and motor deficits. This review explores the mechanisms of neuronal plasticity and its effect on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Alzheimer's disease features amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles that impair synaptic function, while Parkinson's disease involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons affecting motor control. Enhancing neuronal plasticity offers therapeutic potential for these diseases. A systematic literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, focusing on studies of neuronal plasticity in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Data synthesis identified key themes such as synaptic mechanisms, neurogenesis, and therapeutic strategies, linking molecular insights to clinical applications. Results highlight that targeting synaptic plasticity mechanisms, such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression, shows promise. Neurotrophic factors, advanced imaging techniques, and molecular tools (e.g., clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and optogenetics) are crucial in understanding and enhancing plasticity. Current therapies, including dopamine replacement, deep brain stimulation, and lifestyle interventions, demonstrate the potential to alleviate symptoms and improve outcomes. In conclusion, enhancing neuronal plasticity through targeted therapies holds significant promise for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Future research should integrate multidisciplinary approaches to fully harness the therapeutic potential of neuronal plasticity in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",

A total of 10 epidemiological and three assessment tool validation studies of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD, conducted in the 22 Arab countries, were included. Only four Arab countries contributed to the 10 epidemiological studies found. Egypt provided the largest number of patients. Prevalence rates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD were heterogenous. Three studies relied on the Non-Motor Symptom Scale to estimate prevalence. Three studies used validated screening tools for dementia. Five studies used specific screening tools for depression, while two used the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for depression. No appropriate and validated tool is available to assess for apathy. The generalizability of the findings is limited and recommendations for future studies are provided.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) often leads to gait abnormalities, increasing the risk of falls and affecting daily life. Sensorimotor insoles aim to enhance foot sensitivity, potentially improving gait stability.\nThis study examined whether there are short-term effects of sensorimotor insoles on neural activation (measured by EEG), kinematic gait parameters (speed, cadence, step length, and step-length variability), and subjective gait stability in PD patients. Sixteen individuals suffering from PD completed a gait task while wearing sensorimotor and placebo insoles, respectively.\nThe results showed no significant changes in kinematic parameters with the sensorimotor insoles. Subjective ratings of gait stability and attentional control of gait improved on average with the sensorimotor insoles, but again did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant reduction in alpha-band activity, indicating no improvement in sensorimotor processing.\nThe immediate impact of sensorimotor insoles on sensorimotor processing and gait characteristics in PD patients remains inconclusive. The small sample size limited the statistical power, highlighting the need for larger studies to comprehensively assess efficacy. Further research should investigate the long-term effects and potential benefits on disability measures in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD) may potentially alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life of people with Parkinson's disease (PD), although clinical results to date have provided conflicting evidence. In France, cannabis use is illegal outside the current restricted medical cannabis experimental framework which does not include PD as an eligible condition. In contrast, CBD products are legal and are easily available. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability of therapeutic cannabis and CBD use, and to assess cannabinoid-related attitudes among people with PD in France, with a view to assessing the potential inclusion of medical cannabinoids in PD treatment options.\nWe conducted a French nationwide online survey among people with PD. Cannabis and CBD acceptability levels were derived from the answers to four questions. Logistic regressions were performed to identify factors associated with these levels. We also collected data on knowledge, information-seeking, and barriers to self-medication.\nOf 1136 participants, acceptability levels of medical cannabis and CBD use were 81.7% and 87.4%, respectively. For both substances, acceptability was associated with the presence of anxiety symptoms, greater knowledge about cannabinoids, seeking information on medical cannabis, and considering the risk of cannabis dependence to be low. A fear of dependence was one of the main barriers to using either substance; healthcare providers were rarely mentioned as sources of information on medical cannabis.\nAcceptability levels of cannabis and CBD were high. Acceptability was associated with knowledge and perceptions of cannabinoids. Given ongoing misconceptions about the effects and risks associated with CBD, disseminating accurate information could increase its acceptability in people with PD.",

For both substances, acceptability was associated with the presence of anxiety symptoms, greater knowledge about cannabinoids, seeking information on medical cannabis, and considering the risk of cannabis dependence to be low. A fear of dependence was one of the main barriers to using either substance; healthcare providers were rarely mentioned as sources of information on medical cannabis.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that may be managed with therapies like scalp electroacupuncture (SEA). The combination of SEA and medication could potentially offer a new approach for managing PD symptoms. The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the combined impact of SEA and medication on PD through a comprehensive analysis of randomized clinical trials, focusing on outcomes like effective rate and various scores (total Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), UPDRS III, and Webster).\nIt was conducted an unrestricted search from the beginning of each database until April 19, 2024, across 7 databases. These included 4 international databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, and 3 Chinese databases: CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang. Review Manager, version 5.3 was used to calculate the mean difference (MD) or risk ratio along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3.0 was employed for conducting bias analyses, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses.\nFrom 1422 records identified in the databases, 17 articles were included in both the systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled risk ratio and its 95%CI in the intervention (SEA\u2005+\u2005medication) group compared to the control (medication) group for the effective rate is 1.24 [1.17, 1.32] with a P\u2005<\u2005.00001. The pooled MD and its 95%CI for the Webster score is -0.51 [-6.36, 5.35] with a P\u2005=\u2005.86. The pooled MD and its 95%CI for total UPDRS is 8.73 [2.88, 14.58] with a P\u2005=\u2005.003. The pooled MD and its 95%CI for UPDRS III is 4.42 [3.23, 5.61] with a P\u2005<\u2005.00001. The results for total UPDRS and UPDRS III showed that intervention reduced the severity and progression of PD in patients more than medication.\nThe intervention (SEA\u2005+\u2005medication) has shown significant effectiveness compared to the control (medication) in terms of the effective rate, total UPDRS, and UPDRS III in PD patients. However, it did not show a significant effect on the Webster score.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a disabling yet poorly understood paroxysmal gait disorder affecting the vast majority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) as they reach advanced stages of the disorder. Falling is one of the most disabling consequences of a FOG episode; it often results in injury and a future fear of falling, leading to diminished social engagement, a reduction in general fitness, loss of independence, and degradation of overall quality of life. Currently, there is no robust or reliable treatment against FOG in PD. In the absence of reliable and effective treatment for Parkinson's disease, alleviating the consequences of FOG represents an unmet clinical need, with the first step being reliable FOG prediction. Current methods for FOG prediction and prevention cannot provide real-time readouts and are not sensitive enough to detect changes in walking patterns or balance. To fill this gap, we developed an sEMG system consisting of a soft, wearable garment (pair of shorts and two calf sleeves) embedded with screen-printed electrodes and stretchable traces capable of picking up and recording the electromyography activities from lower limb muscles. Here, we report on the testing of these garments in healthy individuals and in patients with PD FOG. The preliminary testing produced an initial time-to-onset commencement that persisted > 3 s across all patients, resulting in a nearly 3-fold drop in sEMG activity. We believe that these initial studies serve as a solid foundation for further development of smart digital textiles with integrated bio and chemical sensors that will provide AI-enabled, medically oriented data.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and always results in balance loss. Although studies in lower-extremity exoskeleton robots are ample, applications with a lower-extremity exoskeleton robot for PD patients are still challenging. This paper aims to develop an effective assistive control for PD patients with a lower-extremity exoskeleton robot to maintain standing balance while being subjected to external disturbances. When an external force is applied to participants to force them to lose balance, the hip strategy for balance recovery based on the zero moment point (ZMP) metrics is used to generate a reference trajectory of the hip joint, and then, a model-free linear extended state observer (LESO)-based fuzzy sliding mode control (FSMC) is synthesized to regulate the human body to recover balance. Balance recovery trials for healthy individuals and PD patients with and without exoskeleton assistance were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed exoskeleton robot and balance recovery strategy. Our experiments demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the proposed exoskeleton robot and controller for standing balance recovery control in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Since its first introduction, levodopa has remained the cornerstone treatment for Parkinson's disease. However, as the disease advances, the therapeutic window for levodopa narrows, leading to motor complications like fluctuations and dyskinesias. Clinicians face challenges in optimizing daily therapeutic regimens, particularly in advanced stages, due to the lack of quantitative biomarkers for continuous motor monitoring. Biochemical sensing of levodopa offers a promising approach for real-time therapeutic feedback, potentially sustaining an optimal motor state throughout the day. These sensors vary in invasiveness, encompassing techniques like microdialysis, electrochemical non-enzymatic sensing, and enzymatic approaches. Electrochemical sensing, including wearable solutions that utilize reverse iontophoresis and microneedles, is notable for its potential in non-invasive or minimally invasive monitoring. Point-of-care devices and standard electrochemical cells demonstrate superior performance compared to wearable solutions; however, this comes at the cost of wearability. As a result, they are better suited for clinical use. The integration of nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, metal-organic frameworks, and graphene has significantly enhanced sensor sensitivity, selectivity, and detection performance. This framework paves the way for accurate, continuous monitoring of levodopa and its metabolites in biofluids such as sweat and interstitial fluid, aiding real-time motor performance assessment in Parkinson's disease. This review highlights recent advancements in biochemical sensing for levodopa and catecholamine monitoring, exploring emerging technologies and their potential role in developing closed-loop therapy for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both motor symptoms and non-motor features. A hallmark of PD is the misfolding and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), which triggers neuroinflammation and drives neurodegeneration. Microglia, brain cells that play a central role in neuroinflammatory responses and help clear various unnecessary molecules within the brain, thus maintaining the brain's internal environment, respond to \u03b1-syn through mechanisms involving inflammation, propagation, and clearance. This review delves into the complex interplay between \u03b1-syn and microglia, elucidating how these interactions drive PD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting the \u03b1-syn-microglia axis, with a focus on modulating microglial functions to mitigate neuroinflammation, enhance clearance, and prevent \u03b1-syn propagation, emphasizing their potential to slow PD progression.",

    "abstract": "As our population ages, there is an increased unmet clinical need surrounding neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). To tackle this ever-increasing problem, we must ensure that the cell models that we use to develop therapeutics in vitro are robust, reliable, and replicable. In this study, we compared SH-SY5Y cells with LUHMES cells in response to 6-Hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) and 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), two common Parkinson's insults used in in vitro analysis. Both these cell types have apparent dopaminergic phenotypes, which could aid us in understanding their potential in this race to novel therapies. The LUHMES cells showed consistent dopaminergic (DA) expression through tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positivity, alongside depleted ATP levels and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, whereas the SH-SH5Y cells displayed resilience to both chemical insults, raising questions about their utility in accurately modelling PD pathology. Further electrophysiological analysis revealed comparable firing rates and ion channel signalling between both cell types; however, LUHMES cells demonstrated stronger calcium signalling responses, further supporting their use as a more robust PD model. While SH-SY5Y cells showed some adaptability in vitro, their inconsistent DA phenotype and limited response to chemical insults limit their suitability for advanced research, suggesting that LUHMES cells should and must take their place as a hallmark in Parkinson's disease research.",

    "abstract": "More than six million people worldwide are affected by Parkinson's disease (PD), a multifactorial disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Several immunohistochemical studies suggest that neuromelanin (NM), found in these neurons, plays a key role in their degeneration. In this study, twelve formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain sections were analyzed, comprising six samples from PD patients and six from healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted to assess the expression of the ETNPPL protein in these samples. ETNPPL was detected in both PD and control samples. Additionally, we examined the expression of ETNPPL mRNA using Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) in the same sample set. Notably, in control samples, ETNPPL protein was closely associated with the dark NM pigment in the cytoplasm of SNc dopaminergic neurons. In contrast, PD samples showed weak cytoplasmic expression of ETNPPL, with no association with the NM pigment. No nuclear ETNPPL signal was detected in dopaminergic neurons from either PD patients or controls. qRT-PCR results revealed lower ETNPPL mRNA expression in individual PD patients compared to controls. Importantly, we observed a higher concentration of ETNPPL protein at the NM level in the SNc neurons of controls, consistent with mRNA expression patterns. These findings suggest a potential role for ETNPPL in the normal function of dopaminergic neurons and underscore its altered expression in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "In this review, we focus on the biophysical and structural aspects of the oligomeric states of physiologically intrinsically disordered proteins and peptides tau, amyloid-\u03b2 and \u03b1-synuclein and partly disordered prion protein and their isolations from animal models and human brains. These protein states may be the most toxic agents in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. It was shown that oligomers are important players in the aggregation cascade of these proteins. The structural information about these structural states has been provided by methods such as solution and solid-state NMR, cryo-EM, crosslinking mass spectrometry, AFM, TEM, etc., as well as from hybrid structural biology approaches combining experiments with computational modelling and simulations. The reliable structural models of these protein states may provide valuable information for future drug design and therapies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in the brain. Ferroptosis, a recently identified form of regulated cell death, is critical in PD pathogenesis due to its association with iron deposition, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and impaired lipid peroxidation clearance. This cell death mechanism is closely linked to several pathogenic processes in PD, including \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, microglia-induced neuroinflammation, and neuromelanin accumulation. Given the significant role of ferroptosis in these mechanisms, there is increasing interest in targeting ferroptosis for PD treatment. Several drugs have shown potential in alleviating PD symptoms by inhibiting ferroptosis. This review aims to consolidate current knowledge on ferroptosis in PD and assess the therapeutic potential of anti-ferroptosis drugs, highlighting promising directions for future research and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), as a widespread neurodegenerative disorder, significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Its primary symptoms include motor disturbances, tremor, muscle stiffness, and balance disorders. In recent years, with the advancement of research, the concept of the bone-brain axis has gradually become a focal point in the field of PD research. The bone-brain axis refers to the interactions and connections between the skeletal system and the central nervous system (CNS), playing a crucial role in the pathogenesis and pathological processes of PD. The purpose of this review is to comprehensively and deeply explore the bone-brain axis in PD, covering various aspects such as the complex relationship between bone metabolism and PD, the key roles of neurotransmitters and hormones in the bone-brain axis, the role of inflammation and immunity, microRNA (miRNA) functional regulation, and potential therapeutic strategies. Through a comprehensive analysis and in-depth discussion of numerous research findings, this review aims to provide a solid theoretical foundation for a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of PD and to offer strong support for the development of new treatment methods.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and Huntington's, remain formidable challenges in medicine, with their relentless progression and limited therapeutic options. These diseases arise from a web of molecular disturbances-misfolded proteins, chronic neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and genetic mutations-that slowly dismantle neuronal integrity. Yet, recent scientific breakthroughs are opening new paths to intervene in these once-intractable conditions. This review synthesizes the latest insights into the underlying molecular dynamics of neurodegeneration, revealing how intertwined pathways drive the course of these diseases. With an eye on the most promising advances, we explore innovative therapies emerging from cutting-edge research: nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems capable of navigating the blood-brain barrier, gene-editing tools like CRISPR designed to correct harmful genetic variants, and stem cell strategies that not only replace lost neurons but foster neuroprotective environments. Pharmacogenomics is reshaping treatment personalization, enabling tailored therapies that align with individual genetic profiles, while molecular diagnostics and biomarkers are ushering in an era of early, precise disease detection. Furthermore, novel perspectives on the gut-brain axis are sparking interest as mounting evidence suggests that microbiome modulation may play a role in reducing neuroinflammatory responses linked to neurodegenerative progression. Taken together, these advances signal a shift toward a comprehensive, personalized approach that could transform neurodegenerative care. By integrating molecular insights and innovative therapeutic techniques, this review offers a forward-looking perspective on a future where treatments aim not just to manage symptoms but to fundamentally alter disease progression, presenting renewed hope for improved patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder globally that lacks any disease-modifying drug for prevention or treatment. Oxidative stress has been identified as one of the key pathogenic drivers of Parkinson's disease (PD). Edaravone, an approved free-radical scavenger, has proven to have potential against PD by targeting multiple key pathologies, including oxidative stress, focal mitochondria, and neuroinflammation. However, its bioavailability is potentially restricted due to its poor solubility and short half-life. This study aims to develop a simple and effective drug delivery system for edaravone to enhance its solubility, stability, and bioavailability to improve its neuroprotective efficacy. An MPEG-2000-DSPE-edaravone (MDE) micelle was prepared via solvent evaporation using MPEG-2000-DSPE as a carrier to encapsulate edaravone. The morphology, particle size, zeta potential, chemical structure, and edaravone loading of MDE were evaluated. We then investigated whether such targeted edaravone delivery could provide enhanced neuroprotection. A cell model of PD was established in PC12 cells through exposure to rotenone. The effects of MDE on PC12 cells treated with or without rotenone were evaluated using a cell counting kit-8, calcein acetoxymethyl ester (AM)-propidine iodide (PI) staining, and flow cytometry. Cell migration was evaluated using a wound healing assay. Additionally, the intracellular antioxidant study was performed using an ROS-level-detecting DCFH-DA probe, and the mitochondrial membrane potentials were evaluated using a JC-1 assay. MDE with a drug-loading content of 17.6% and an encapsulation efficiency of 92.8% was successfully prepared. The resultant MDE had a mean particle size of 112.97 \u00b1 5.54 nm with a zeta potential of -42 mV. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed that the MDE (\u2264200 ug/mL) exhibited promising cytocompatibility with no significant effect on cell viability, cell cycle regulation, or apoptosis levels. Likewise, compared with the free edaravone, no effect on cell migration was noted for MDE. MDE might be able to target edaravone delivery into PC12 cells, increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential and providing a significant local antioxidant effect. The results demonstrated that MPEG-2000-DSPE could be a promising material for enhancing edaravone's aqueous solubility, stability, and antioxidant effects. MDE could be a potential drug formulation for treating PD and other diseases in which oxidative stress plays a key role in pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis benefits significantly from advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing techniques. This paper explores various approaches for processing hand-drawn Archimedean spirals in order to detect signs of PD.\nThe best approach is selected to be integrated in a neurodegenerative disease management platform called NeuroPredict. The most innovative aspects of the presented approaches are related to the employed feature extraction techniques that convert hand-drawn spirals into a frequency spectra, so that frequency features may be extracted and utilized as inputs for various classification algorithms. A second category of extracted features contains information related to the thickness and pressure of drawings.\nThe selected approach achieves an overall accuracy of 95.24% and allows acquiring new test data using only a pencil and paper, without requiring a specialized device like a graphic tablet or a digital pen.\nThis study underscores the clinical relevance of AI in enhancing diagnostic precision for neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by degeneration of ventral midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons and abnormal deposition of \u03b1-synuclein\u00a0(\u03b1-syn) in neurons. Activation of the innate immune pathogen recognition receptor toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is associated with exacerbation of \u03b1-syn pathology. TLR2 is increased on neurons in the PD brain, and its activation results in the accumulation and propagation of \u03b1-syn through autophagy inhibition in neurons. In addition to the aggregation and propagation of pathological \u03b1-syn, dysfunction of astrocytes may contribute to DA neuronal death and subsequent clinical progression of PD. However, the role of astrocytes in TLR2-mediated PD pathology is less explored but important to address, given that TLR2 is a potential therapeutic target for PD.\nInduced pluripotent stem cells from three controls and three PD patients were differentiated into a midbrain model comprised of neurons (including DA neurons) and astrocytes. Cells were treated with or without the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4, and \u03b1-syn pathology was seeded using pre-formed fibrils. Confocal imaging was used to assess lysosomal function and \u03b1-syn pathology in the different cell types, as well as DA neuron health and astrocyte activation.\nTLR2 activation acutely impaired the autophagy lysosomal pathway, and potentiated \u03b1-syn pathology seeded by pre-formed fibrils in PD neurons and astrocytes, leading to degeneration and loss of DA neurons. The astrocytes displayed impaired chaperone-mediated autophagy reducing their ability to clear accumulated \u03b1-syn, and increases of A1 neurotoxic phenotypic proteins SerpinG1, complement C3, PSMB8 and GBP2. Moreover, the phenotypic changes in astrocytes correlated with a specific loss of DA neurons.\nTaken together, these results support a role for astrocyte dysfunction in \u03b1-syn accumulation and DA neuronal loss following TLR2 activation in PD.",

    "abstract": "Recently, studies have suggested a role of motor symptom asymmetry on impaired emotional recognition abilities in Parkinson's disease with a greater vulnerability in patients with a predominance of left-sided symptoms. However, none of them explored the interaction between motor symptom asymmetry and dopamine replacement therapy in different stages of the disease.\nWe explored the recognition of vocal emotion (i.e., emotional prosody) in 15 newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease patients in the early stages of the disease, 15 patients in the advanced stages of the disease and 15 healthy controls. The early patients were studied in two conditions: ON and OFF dopaminergic replacement therapy and both Parkinson's disease groups (early and advanced) were divided into two subgroups according to the asymmetry of motor symptoms.\nThe analyses revealed two patterns of results. First, as predicted, we observed a reduction in performance for the recognition of vocal emotions in patients with a predominance of left-sided symptoms as compared to both healthy controls and predominantly right-sided symptom patients. Second, in the early stages of the disease, we observed a deleterious effect of dopatherapy on the recognition of vocal emotions for the patients with left-predominant symptoms, and the inverse pattern (i.e., a positive effect of dopatherapy) for the patients with right-predominant symptoms.\nOur results bring to knowledge the differential effects of disease duration, dopaminergic replacement therapy and motor symptom asymmetry on vocal emotion recognition in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience not only physical symptoms but also a higher prevalence of psychological issues, including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and psychotic symptoms, compared to the general population. The relationship between these physical and psychological symptoms remains poorly understood, particularly in relation to commonly used measures of physical function and a wider variety of psychological symptoms. Investigating this link is essential for optimising patient care. This cohort study is registered with OSF (https://osf.io/c7tvd).\nThe primary aim of this study is to investigate the association between physical and psychological symptoms in PD. We will focus specifically on measures of physical function such as balance and mobility, assess the similarities between physiotherapist and participant-rated measures, and monitor changes over time.\nThis cohort study plans to recruit 30 participants with PD, who will be monitored over a 12-month period. Data will be collected at baseline and completion, providing two data points per participant. Selected outcome measures will include physical function (objective measures), non-motor symptoms, participants perceived function, and engagement in physical activity. Correlations between outcomes will be analysed, and multivariate regression modelling may be employed for time-series analysis to evaluate how relationships change over time. Descriptive summaries of all outcomes will be presented in tables.\nEthical approval for this study was obtained on 15th July 2024, with participant recruitment scheduled to begin in October 2024. Data collection is expected to conclude by August 2026, with final results anticipated within six months of study completion.\nThis study will be the first to monitor this specific set of physical and psychological outcomes over time in individuals with PD. The findings are expected to provide valuable insights into the relationship between these symptoms, informing future research and potentially leading to larger-scale, multi-site studies conducted over extended assessment periods.",

    "abstract": "To explore whether CSF phosphorylated tau-181 (P-tau181) and total tau (T-tau) are associated with disease progression in early PD patients.\nWe analyzed 8-year longitudinal clinical data from 368 early, drug-naive PD patients and 185 matched controls from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort. CSF P-tau181 and T-tau were measured over 5\u00a0years, while CSF \u03b1-synuclein was measured over 3\u00a0years. Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging was performed at baseline and at 1, 2, and 4\u00a0years.\nPD patients exhibited significantly lower CSF P-tau181, T-tau and P-tau181/T-tau ratio than controls at each visit. Higher baseline CSF P-tau181 predicted greater increases in Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III (estimate: 0.067, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores (estimate: -0.010, P\u2009=\u20090.009). Similarly, higher baseline CSF T-tau predicted greater increases in MDS-UPDRS III (estimate: 0.005, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and MoCA scores (estimate: -0.001, P\u2009=\u20090.013). Higher baseline P-tau181/T-tau ratio predicted greater increases in MDS-UPDRS III (estimate: 0.552, P\u2009<\u20090.001) but was not significantly associated with changes in MoCA scores (estimate: -0.052, P\u2009=\u20090.114). CSF P-tau181 (estimate\u2009=\u200984.889, P\u2009<\u20090.001), T-tau (estimate\u2009=\u20098.297, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and P-tau181/T-tau ratio (estimate\u2009=\u2009263.425, P\u2009<\u20090.001) were positively correlated with CSF \u03b1-synuclein but not correlated with striatal DAT uptake.\nElevated baseline CSF P-tau181, T-tau and P-tau181/T-tau ratio in early PD patients predict accelerated motor deterioration, with P-tau181 and T-tau also predicting cognitive decline, potentially through interactions with \u03b1-synuclein. However, the direct role of tau on nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration remains uncertain.",

    "abstract": "The \u03b1-Synuclein Origin and Connectome (SOC) model recently proposed two different Parkinson's Disease (PD) phenotypes clinically based on the relationship between REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and motor symptoms' onset: a \"body first\" phenotype and a \"brain first\" phenotype in which RBD precedes or may follow the motor onset, respectively. A higher burden of non-motor symptoms as well as a more symmetrical clinical presentation have also been predicted in the body-first phenotype. This point has been poorly assessed through semi-quantitative striatal dopaminergic functional imaging to date.\nTo explore the relation between RBD onset and striatal dysfunction in PD.\nPD patients were retrospectively enrolled and clinical follow-up data were gathered. Presence and onset of probable RBD were evaluated classifying patients into PD-RBDpre (onset before motor symptoms), PD-RBDpost (onset after motor symptoms) and PD-RBD-. Semi-quantitative \nFifty-six PD patients were enrolled (10 PD-RBDpre, 19 PD-RBDpost and 27 PD-RBD-). A more symmetrical motor impairment, higher mild cognitive impairment (MCI) prevalence, lower caudate SBR and lower putamen AI were found in PD-RBDpre. A negative trend in MCI prevalence as well as a positive trend in both caudate SBR and putamen AI were found across PD-RBDpre, PD-RBDpost and PD-RBD-.\nDifferent patterns of striatal dopaminergic dysfunction and cognitive impairment based on RBD onset were unraveled, supporting the SOC model's predictions.",

    "abstract": "The various symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) may change differently over time as the disease progresses. Tremor usually manifests early in the disease, but unlike other motor symptoms, its severity may diminish over time. The cerebral mechanisms underlying these symptom-specific longitudinal trajectories are unclear. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown structural changes in brain regions associated with PD tremor, suggesting that structural changes over time may define clinical trajectories.\nThe aims were to investigate the longitudinal trajectory of PD tremor in relation to bradykinesia and rigidity, and assess whether tremor progression is related to structural changes in tremor-related areas.\nWe used data from the Personalized Parkinson Project: a two-year longitudinal study involving 520 PD patients and 60 healthy controls, who were measured twice clinically and with MRI. Mixed-effects models were used to compare tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity progression; investigate gray matter changes in tremor-related regions (cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit and pallidum); and calculate associations between symptom severity and brain structure. Associations across the whole brain were included to assess anatomical specificity.\nBradykinesia and rigidity worsened over 2\u2009years, whereas tremor behaved differently: resting tremor severity remained stable, whereas postural and kinetic tremor severity decreased. Attenuation of postural and kinetic tremor was associated with, but not restricted to, atrophy in tremor-related areas. Opposite relationships were observed for bradykinesia and rigidity.\nAction tremor (postural and kinetic) is an early symptom of PD, which reduces with disease progression. Longitudinal brain atrophy correlates with tremor and other motor symptoms in opposite ways. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the age-associated, second most advanced neurodegenerative illness. Rotenone is an extensively used pesticide to study PD pathology and inhibits mitochondrial complex I. Reports indicate that rotenone exerts neurotoxicity by its capability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which eventually leads to neuronal apoptosis.\nSanggenol L (SL) is an eminent flavonoid present in the Morus alba root bark, which exhibits neuroprotective, anticancer, and antioxidant properties.\nHence, we assessed the neuroprotective activity of SL (5 and 10 \u03bcM/ml) on rotenone-stimulated SK-NSH neuroblastoma cells and elucidated the effect of the P13K/AKT/mTOR signalling.\nThe anti-PD action of SL on proliferation, oxidative stress (OS), intracellular ROS, apoptosis, Bax, cleaved Caspase-12, -9, -3, and Cyt-c, Bcl-2 and P13K/AKT/mTOR signaling was determined by MTT assay, biochemical analysis, DCFDA, AO/EB staining and western blot. It was found that SL (5 and 10 \u03bcM/ml) reduced rotenone-triggered OS, ROS levels, and apoptosis in a concentration-related way. SL alleviates Bax, cleaved caspase-12, -9, -3, and Cytc, while reducing Bcl-2. Furthermore, SL safer mitochondria by increase MMP and suppresses phosphorylation of P13k/AKT/mTOR pathway, thereby regulating apoptotic signalling.\nOur findings indicate that SL showed protective effects against rotenone-induced OS, mitochondrial complex-I in neuronal cell damage, which suggests that SL might potentially serve as an anti-PD remedial candidate for PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide and seriously affects the quality of life of elderly patients. PD is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra as well as abnormal accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in neurons. Recent research has deepened our understanding of the gut microbiota, revealing that it participates in the pathological process of PD through the gut-brain axis, suggesting that the gut may be the source of PD. Therefore, studying the relationship between gut microbiota and PD is crucial for improving our understanding of the disease's prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. In this review, we first describe the bidirectional regulation of the gut-brain axis by the gut microbiota and the mechanisms underlying the involvement of gut microbiota and their metabolites in PD. We then summarize the different species of gut microbiota found in patients with PD and their correlations with clinical symptoms. Finally, we review the most comprehensive animal and human studies on treating PD through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), discussing the challenges and considerations associated with this treatment approach.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effect of osteoporosis education on osteoporosis knowledge level (OKL) and behavioral changes in daily life in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nBetween May 2019 and December 2019, a total of 54 patients (34 males, 20 females; median age: 68.5 years; range, 50 to 87 years) were included in the study. We randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, patients with PD to receive either only the brochure or in addition to this a verbal osteoporosis education. The patients were randomized into the control (n=27) and intervention groups (n=27). Seven of the patients (two in the control group and five in the intervention group) were lost to follow-up. The patients were assessed at baseline and Week 12. The primary outcomes were Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score (0-400) and daily calcium intake (DCI). The secondary outcomes were revised 2011 osteoporosis knowledge test (rOKT) score (0-32), frequency of falls, smoking and alcohol use at Week 12.\nThe median total PASE score was 81 (range, 0 to 205) for the intervention group, compared to 61 (range, 0 to 242) for control group at Week 12. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups at Week 12, except for the medians of the frequency of falls that was significantly lower in the intervention group (p<0.05). A significant improvement from baseline was observed in the median rOKT scores (control group 16 (range, 6 to 21) to 19 (range, 11 to 25); intervention group 13 (range, 6 to 24) to 18 (range, 9 to 24); p<0.001) and DCI (control group 855 (range, 420 to 1,640) to 890 (range, 550 to 1,660); intervention group, 870 (range, 400 to 1,385) to 1,020 (range, 400 to 1,940) mg/day; p<0.01) in both groups. Also, a significant improvement in the leisure activities (PASE subgroup) was observed in the intervention group (p<0.05).\nOsteoporosis education had some positive effects in patients with PD, even when only given the brochure. With additional verbal education, more benefits can be obtained.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the effects of balance training associated with cerebellar tDCS on postural control in individuals with PD. This is a randomized clinical trial in which individuals were allocated to an experimental group (EG) or placebo group (PG), in which a conventional protocol of 10 Physiotherapy sessions for locomotor training and postural control was applied. In the EG, tDCS was applied, with a current setting of 1.5 mA for 20 min simultaneously with postural control training. In the PG, tDCS was applied in sham mode, with the same electrode positioning and the same number of sessions as the EG. The sample compared 34 individuals with PD (EG: 17; PG: 17).Cerebellar tDCS associated with balance training may help improve postural control and balance in walkers with Parkinson's Disease. The hypothesis is, if walking improve, the benefits may be accompanied by better balance and reduced fear of falling, and individuals may experience greater free-living physical activity at home and in the community.",

    "abstract": "Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an intermediate filament protein expressed mainly in astrocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), a potential biomarker of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD). The central motor subtypes of PD include tremor-dominant (TD), postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD), and indeterminate subtypes, whose different course of disease requires the development of biomarkers that can predict progression based on motor subtypes. In this study, we aimed to assess the predictive value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GFAP for PD motor subtypes in PD. Two hundred and sixteen PD patients were recruited in our study from the progression markers initiative. Patients were subgrouped into TD, PIGD, and indeterminate subtypes. Longitudinal relationships between baseline CSF GFAP and cognitive function and CSF biomarkers were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. Cox regression was used to detect cognitive progression in TD patients. The baseline and longitudinal increases in CSF GFAP were associated with a greater decline in episodic memory, CSF \u03b1-syn, and a greater increase of CSF NfL in TD and TD-male subtypes. Cox regression showed that higher baseline CSF GFAP levels were corrected with a higher risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) over a 4-year period in the PD with normal cognition (NC) group (adjusted HR\u2009=\u20091.607, 95% CI 1.907-2.354, p\u2009=\u20090.01). CSF GFAP might be a promising predictor of cognition decline in TD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is common in individuals over the age of 50 years, affecting about 1% of the population. Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are a common occurrence in PD, but they are often ignored by motor symptoms. Studies have shown that NMS in PD show a significant impact on quality of life. The introduction of tools like nonmotor symptoms scale (NMSS) and unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) that have a specific nonmotor domain will assist in defining research and therapy to enhance the early identification and management of NMS in the affected population.\n(1) To evaluate the prevalence of NMS in different stages of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. (2) To correlate the prevalence of NMS with the duration and severity of the disease.\nThe study involved 80 individuals who visited the Movement Disorder Clinic at Stanley Medical College and Hospital in Chennai and were diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which was in agreement with the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease (UK PD) Brain Bank criteria.\nOut of the 80 study participants, 63.7% (\nNMSs are found to be highly prevalent among Indian patients with PD according to this study.

    "abstract": "Pain is one of the principal non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), negatively impacting the patient's quality of life. This study aimed to demonstrate whether an effective dose of pramipexole (PPX) can modulate the NF-\u03baB/p-p65 activation in glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) and diminish the hypersensitivity (allodynia and hyperalgesia) in male Wistar rats with PD. For this, 2\u00a0\u03bcl of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 8\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL/0.2\u00a0\u03bcl/min) was administered unilaterally in the Substantia Nigra of the Pars Compacta (SNpc) to establish a PD model rat. Motor behavioral tests were used to validate the PD model, and von Frey filaments were used to evaluate allodynia and hyperalgesia. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence were used to analyze the level of tyrosine hydroxylase in SNpc and striatum as well as the expression of GFAP, Iba-1, NF-\u03baB/p-65 in the L4-L6 spinal cord dorsal horn. Unilateral 6-OHDA-lesion reduces motor capacity and produces long-term allodynia and hyperalgesia in both hind paws. L4-L6 spinal cord dorsal horn astrocytes and microglia were active in these 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Moreover, PPX (1 and 3\u00a0mg/Kg, i.p./10\u00a0days, n\u00a0=\u00a010 per group) inhibited the bilateral mechanical hypersensitivity, and PPX (3\u00a0mg/Kg/i.p./10\u00a0days) reduced 6-OHDA-induced astrocyte and microglia activation, as well as reduced NF-\u03baB/p-p65 expression only in astrocytes of dorsal horn spinal cord in the L5-L6. These findings suggest that PPX could alleviate pain by decreasing the activation of microglia and astrocytes through the NF-\u03baB/p-p65 pathway in the dorsal horn spinal cord. Therefore, PPX could be considered an optional tool for improving pain hypersensitivity in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily driven by the protein Alpha Synuclein (A-Syn) accumulation. Synphilin-1 protein, encoded by the SNCAIP gene, which co-localizes with A-Syn is a known risk factor for PD. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), is a cluster of retinal degenerative disorders, and Cyclic Nucleotide Gated channel subunit Alpha 1 (CNGA1) is one of the initial genes associated with RP. Patients with PD can have various kinds of visual dysfunction as a non-motor manifestation, but to date, CNGA1 mutation and RP as a PD associated visual symptom has not been reported. We report a mutation in the SNCAIP gene in a PD patient, not reported earlier, and its co-occurrence with RP-associated CNGA1 gene mutation.\nWhole exome sequencing (WES) of the patient DNA sample and in-silico protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis performed to find out proteins interacting with SNCAIP relevant concerning reported mutation of SNCAIP and further, CNGA1 interaction with SNCAIP.\nWe are reporting, a missense mutation (p.Thr64Ser) at the SNCAIP gene, co-occurring with a missense variation (p.Gly509Arg) in the CNGA1 gene. In silico PPI analysis suggests SIAH1 as an important protein affected by SNCAIP mutation. LGALS4 and SNCA (gene encoding A-Syn) are common interactors between SNCAIP and CNGA1.\nThe current study has determined the co-occurrence of RP and PD, whole exome sequencing ascertains the mutations in SNCAIP and CNGA1 genes, which could be the cause of PD and RP co-occurrence.",

    "abstract": "Reducing antioxidant levels exacerbates the generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, leading to alpha-synuclein aggregation and the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. These play a key role in the onset of Parkinson's disease (PD), for which effective treatment remains elusive. This study examined the neuroprotective effects of taurine, an essential \u03b2-amino acid with antioxidant and antiinflammation properties, in Swiss male mice exposed to rotenone-induced PD. Mice (20-25\u202fg) were grouped into seven groups (n\u202f=\u202f9) and treated with taurine alone (5, 10 and 20\u202fmg/kg, p.o) or levodopa (10\u202fmg/kg, p.o) for 28 consecutive days following intraperitoneal co-administration of rotenone (1.5\u202fmg/kg, in 5\u202f% dimethylsulfoxide) for 14 alternate days. Open-field, rota-rod and hanging-wire motor performance and coordination tests were conducted on days 26-28. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory markers; levels of acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity, dopamine, and alpha-synuclein were assayed in the striatal and prefrontal-cortical regions alongside histological examinations. Rotenone significantly reduced latency to fall and akinesia-like behavior with several slip/error relative to vehicle groups. Taurine increased the latency to fall, notably improving motor coordination, locomotor deficit, and neuromuscular competence. Also, rotenone significantly increased malondialdehyde and nitrite; while decreasing acetylcholinesterase activity, glutathione, catalase, superoxide-dismutase, and glutathione-S-transferase levels in the striatum and prefrontal-cortex respectively, which were attenuated by taurine. Taurine increased dopamine levels in the striatum and prefrontal cortex dose-independently. Like carbidopa, taurine decreased alpha-synuclein, tumor-necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 levels in the striatum and prefrontal-cortex. Additionally, taurine-reversed rotenone-induced neurodegeneration in the striatum and prefrontal cortex indicates neuroprotective function. Conclusively, taurine attenuates rotenone-induced PD-like behavior by enhancing the brain's antioxidant system, inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine release, reducing \u03b1-synuclein formation, and augmenting dopaminergic release in mice's brains.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide due to loss of dopaminergic neurons projecting from the basal ganglia (BG). It is associated with various motor symptoms that are grouped into subtypes, each with different clinical presentations and disease progressions. Neuroimaging biomarkers focusing on regions a part of motor circuits projecting from the BG can distinguish and improve overall subtyping. The supplementary motor cortex (SMC) is well established in PD neuropathology and associated with freezing of gait and bradykinesia, but has not been thoroughly evaluated across subtypes. This study aims to identify volumetric differences of the SMC based on PD subtypes of tremor dominant (TD), postural instability with gait difficulty (PIGD), and akinetic rigid (AR) using data from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. To segment grey matter volume and extract region of interest values, voxel-based processing was used. Multi-factor ANCOVAs, Tukey Honest Significance Test, and Kruskal-Wallis were utilized for volumetric analyses (\u03b1\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Subjects were classified and evaluated using TD, PIGD, and AR subtypes from the MDS-UPDRS rating scales. Inter-subtype differences in SMC GMV between TD and PIGD were significant in the right hemisphere for females (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). No significant inter-subtype differences were found in the TD/AR system. These results support the use of broader motor networks, specifically the SMC in further understanding the neuropathological heterogeneity of PD. Furthermore, it reveals SMC differences across sexes, subtypes, and subtyping systems, calling for further evaluation of subtyping schemas, specifically regarding sex differences.",

    "abstract": "Rodent models suggest that when respiratory demands increase during an exercise program, tongue and thyroarytenoid muscles engage to maintain a patent airway, leading to increased muscle strength. This suggests that nonspecific exercises that increase respiratory rate may improve swallowing. As such, the purpose of this proof-of-principle study was to determine the potential for whole-body exercise to improve tongue strength, cough strength, and self-reported swallowing function in older adults with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nNine community-dwelling adults with PD (six men, three women; \nBaseline frailty and mobility severity scores indicated mild PD severity. Post-exercise, four of nine participants demonstrated improvement in either anterior or posterior tongue strength, as well as cough strength. Three participants with higher exercise heart rate or rating of perceived exertion scores reported a decrease in EAT-10 scores to a level of below clinical concern (< 3). Results from linear mixed models demonstrated no statistically significant effects on any measures of swallowing function.\nFindings from this pilot study suggest potential signal for a higher intensity whole-body exercise program to improve self-reported swallowing function, given that heart rate and/or exertion intensity that met or exceeded the target was associated with positive changes in self-reported swallowing function, but not tongue or cough strength. Future research including a larger sample size and intervention controls is needed to further elucidate a relationship between whole-body exercise and swallowing.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) ranks as the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder; however, its epidemiological characteristics among middle-aged and older adults at global, regional, and national levels remain inadequately documented.\nThis study assessed temporal trends in PD among middle-aged and older adults by extracting incidence rates, disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates, and corresponding age-specific rates (ASRs) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database spanning 1990 to 2021. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was employed to analyze trends over the past 30 years. The slope index of inequality (SII) and concentration index (CI) were utilized to evaluate disparities in the burden of PD across various countries. Additionally, Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) modeling was applied to project DALY figures for the next 15 years.\nIn 2021, the global incidence and DALY rates for middle-aged and older adults with PD stood at 79.68 and 477.50 cases per 100,000 population, respectively. Both incidence and DALY rates have exhibited an upward trajectory over the past 32 years, with EAPCs of 1.2 (95% UI: 1.1-1.3) and 0.6 (95% UI: 0.5-0.7), respectively. Among the five sociodemographic index (SDI) regions, the high-middle SDI region reported the highest incidence and DALY rates for PD in 2021, at 93.93 and 512.29 cases per 100,000 population, respectively. A positive correlation was observed between the SDI and age-specific incidence rate (ASIR) as well as age-specific DALY rate (ASDR). Disparities in the burden of PD among middle-aged and older adults, associated with SDI, are on the rise and are primarily concentrated in high SDI countries. It is projected that the global incidence and DALY rates for middle-aged and older adults with PD will experience significant increases over the next 15 years.\nThe global burden of PD among middle-aged and older adults has markedly escalated over the past 32 years, particularly in high-middle SDI regions. These findings underscore the necessity for the development of effective interventions and public health policies, contributing to the attainment of the sustainable development goals established by the World Health Organization (WHO).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that primarily affects movement control. Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in driving the disease's progression. The persistent inflammatory state in the brain exacerbates neuronal damage, creating a cycle that perpetuates the neurodegenerative process. Glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, have potent anti-inflammatory properties and have been studied for their neuroprotective potential in different neurodegenerative diseases. However, their specific impact on PD remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of dexamethasone on a neuromelanin (NM)-driven model of PD. We demonstrated that dexamethasone administration significantly improved motor function and preserved dopaminergic neuron compared to untreated controls in our study. These neuroprotective effects were mediated, at least in part, by suppressing reactive microglia and reducing the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain. Our findings underscore the potential therapeutic benefits of dexamethasone in mitigating neuroinflammation and maintaining neuronal integrity in a NM-driven model of PD. These results advocate for further investigation into glucocorticoid-based therapies as adjunctive treatments for PD, particularly in scenarios where neuroinflammation contributes prominently to disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Resting tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with the activity in the basal ganglia and cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits/network. However, most insights stem from functional MRI research, and structural studies, which can provide basis for and constrain functional activity, remains limited.\nWe investigated the structural change in PD patients with resting tremor (PD-WR) from a network perspective. 42 early-stage PD-WR, 27 PD patients without resting tremor (PD-NR), and 56 healthy controls (HC) were included.\nPD-WR showed lower cortical thickness in several motor-related lobules. Compared to HC, significant atrophy was found in right lobule VIIA (t\u202f=\u202f-3.076, p\u202f=\u202f0.016, Cohen's d = 0.627), left lobule VI (t\u202f=\u202f-3.323, p\u202f=\u202f0.007, Cohen's d = 0.678), and right lobule VI (t\u202f=\u202f-3.052, p\u202f=\u202f0.017, Cohen's d = 0.623) in PD-WR. Compared to PD-NR, left lobule V also had a significant reduction (t\u202f=\u202f-2.958, p\u202f=\u202f0.023, d = -0.657). PD-WR had higher fractional anisotropy in cerebello-cortical connection compared to HC (t\u202f=\u202f3.209, p\u202f=\u202f0.009, d = 0.926), with reduced radial (t\u202f=\u202f-2.561, p\u202f=\u202f0.046, d = 0.739) and mean (t\u202f=\u202f2.614, p\u202f=\u202f0.046, d = 0.871) diffusivity compared to PD-NR. At the network level, better hierarchy (rho = 0.598, p\u202f=\u202f0.004), small-worldness (rho = 0.621, p\u202f=\u202f0.003), and increased nodal involvement of the thalamus (rho = 0.718, p\u202f=\u202f0.031) and motor cortex (rho = 0.660, p\u202f=\u202f0.055) were positively correlated with tremor amplitude.\nOur study supports the alternation of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit in PD-WR. However, further research with other forms of PD, a wide range of disease stage and larger sample size is needed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) significantly impacts mobility, with gait disturbances and muscle impairments contributing to a fall risk five times higher than similarly aged adults. Falls significantly impact the quality of life in those with PD, yet the role of ankle muscle function in gait disturbances remains underexplored. This study investigated whether deficits in ankle force and steadiness contribute to gait variability and fall risk, potentially uncovering therapeutic targets for fall prevention in individuals with PD compared with age-matched older adults (OA).\nA case-control design involving 15 individuals with PD and 15 age-matched OA patients was employed. Gait variables and variability were assessed during a 12-m walking task. Ankle muscle strength and force steadiness were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Statistical analyses, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, examined relationships between muscle function and gait variability.\nThe PD group exhibited reduced ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion strength compared to OA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Force steadiness was impaired in the PD group, particularly at lower submaximal intensities. In those with PD, lower plantarflexor (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0-0.69) and dorsiflexor (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0-0.67) strength were significantly correlated with a higher number of falls, as was impaired force steadiness (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No significant relationships were observed in the OA group.\nThese findings underscore the critical role of ankle muscle function in influencing gait variability in individuals with PD. The associations between reduced muscle strength, force steadiness, and increased gait variability highlight the potential of targeted ankle muscle-strengthening interventions to mitigate gait disturbances and reduce fall risk in this population.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that poses a significant challenge in terms of accurate and cost-effective diagnosis. This study focuses on the use of fractal features derived from nocturnal breathing signals to diagnose PD. Our study includes 49 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD group), 49 relatively healthy individuals without PD (HC group), 49 individuals without PD but with other diseases (NoPD group), as well as 12 additional PD patients and 200 healthy individuals for testing. Using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, we extracted fractal features from nocturnal breathing signals, with logistic regression models applied to diagnose PD, as demonstrated in receiver operating characteristic curves. Eight fractal features show significant diagnostic potential for PD, including generalized Hurst exponents for the Airflow, Thorax, and Abdomen signals and the multifractal spectrum width of the SaO2 signal. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the training data set of the PD and HC groups for all four signals is 0.911, and the AUC of the testing data set is 0.929. These results demonstrate the potential of this work to enhance the accuracy of PD diagnosis in clinical settings.",

PD patients exhibit abnormalities in the attentional network related to alerting, orienting, and executive control. While dopamine medications have well-documented effects on motor function, their impact on attention networks and the underlying neural mechanisms involved in motor functions remain unclear. In this study, we utilized a modified attention network test to investigate the neural correlates underlying attention network effects measured by electroencephalography (EEG) in 29 PD patients, both on and off dopamine medication and examined their association with motor performance. Interestingly, we found that dopamine medication specifically modulated the orienting effect of the attention network. We analyzed event-related potential components, time-frequency oscillations, and brain network connectivity, as determined by the weighted phase lag index, within the orienting effect under different dopamine medication states. We observed that event-related desynchronization in the beta",

The clusters were seen in the motor, somatosensory association, and prefrontal cortices. The reverse contrast did not show any significant clusters.\nIncreased perfusion of the motor cortex is in keeping with previous publications and motor phenomena seen in RBD.

    "abstract": "Higher intake of antioxidants is associated with reduced risk of various chronic diseases. However, the relationship between composite dietary antioxidants and frailty has not been characterized, especially in neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's disease (PD) where frailty is highly prevalent. This study aimed to investigate the association between composite dietary antioxidant index (CDAI), a composite score reflecting antioxidant vitamin and mineral intakes, and frailty risk in the general United States (US) population and PD patients.\nData from 21,354 participants \u226540\u202fyears in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2018 represented the general population sample, while 268 PD patients were analyzed separately. Frailty was defined using a validated index. Weighted logistic regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) examined overall and nonlinear CDAI-frailty associations, adjusting for sociodemographics, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities.\nIn the general population, each unit increase in CDAI was associated with a 3.7% lower likelihood of frailty after full adjustments. Vitamin A, C, E, selenium and carotenoids exhibited J-shaped relationships where frailty risk decreased below intake thresholds of 1093.04\u202f\u03bcg, 161.53\u202fmg, 13.66\u202fmg, 109.99\u202f\u03bcg, and 5057.50\u202f\u03bcg, respectively. In contrast, the CDAI- frailty inverse association was weaker among PD patients and only vitamin C (threshold 52.45\u202fmg) and zinc (9.35\u202fmg) showed nonlinear links.\nHigher dietary antioxidant intake was associated with lower frailty prevalence in the general US population, with vitamins A, C, E, selenium, and carotenoids exhibiting nonlinear J-shaped relationships. In contrast, these associations were weaker and less consistent among PD patients, with only vitamins C and zinc showing nonlinear correlations. These findings highlight population-specific differences in the role of dietary antioxidants in frailty and suggest the need for personalized nutritional strategies in PD frailty management.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease confronts challenges in drug delivery due to the blood-brain barrier. Intranasal delivery bypasses the blood-brain barrier for improved drug bioavailability, yet narrow nasal space and brief retention time hinder clinical applicability. We conducted a Bromocriptine Mesylate-loaded PLGA nanoparticles co-modified with low molecular weight protamine (LMWP) and lactoferrin (Lf) (LMWP/Lf-BCM-NPs) for nose-to-brain delivery. The resulting LMWP/Lf-BCM-NPs were uniform spheres with an average size of 248.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.25\u00a0nm and zeta potential of -2.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.74\u00a0mV. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed LMWP and Lf attachment. The co-modified nanoparticles showed improving cellular transport and good viability. The LMWP/Lf-BCM-NPs showed increased brain targeting efficiency in mice. In haloperidol-induced Parkinson mouse models, the LMWP/Lf-BCM-NPs showed increased brain targeting efficiency, enhanced behavioral regulatory effects, enhanced antioxidant effects and neuroprotection effects. This study paves the way for a novel, non-invasive brain-targeted therapy, offering a promising avenue for Parkinson's disease clinical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, but treatment options for PD are limited, and drug development has reached a bottleneck. With the progress of the aging population, the number of PD patients in China is increasing day by day, imposing a heavy burden on patients and society. Therefore, it is urgent to explore targeted medicine based on the pathogenesis of PD and disease targets. Ancient physicians have used the traditional Chinese medicine formula SiJunZi decoction (SJZD) to treat PD. However, it is less commonly used clinically now, and its pharmacological mechanism still needs to be further elucidated. In this study, based on network pharmacology research and molecular docking technology, the mechanism of SJZD in treating PD was revealed, showing that the extract of SJZD acts on cell microdomain membranes and lipid rafts, affecting ubiquitin-protein ligase binding and ubiquitin-like protein ligase binding processes, and plays a role in neurogenesis. Molecular docking results showed that Ellipticine and Hederagenin in SJZD exhibited significant effects on targets: CASP3, BCL2, and PTGS2. The effect of SJZD reversing MPP",

    "abstract": "Motor dysfunction profoundly affects individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) targeting the supplementary motor area (SMA), a critical region for movement-related processing, offers a promising approach to enhance motor function for PD.\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy of NIBS over the SMA (SMA-NIBS) in alleviating motor symptoms in PD.\nWe conducted literature searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Web of Science, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Scopus. The meta-analysis utilized an inverse variance method and a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed based on stimulation types (e.g., TMS and tDCS), stimulation protocols (e.g., facilitatory and inhibitory stimulation), and medication status during stimulation.\nTwenty randomized control trials involving 442 individuals with PD were included. Compared to sham stimulation, SMA-NIBS significantly improved motor function as measured by the motor section of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) (mean differences [MD]: -3.45, 95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI]: -5.65 to -1.26). Subgroup analysis revealed that only TMS (MD: -3.62, 95%CI: -6.15 to -1.08), not tDCS (MD: -2.47, 95\u00a0% CI: -5.03 to 0.08), has significant effect on motor function. Both facilitatory (MD: -2.59, 95\u00a0% CI: -3.37 to -1.82) and inhibitory stimulation (MD: -4.98, 95\u00a0% CI: -9.29 to -0.66) significantly improved the UPDRS-III score. Effectiveness was observed only during ON medication. Statistically significant effects of SMA-NIBS were reported on Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, not timed up and go test and walking speed.\nSMA-NIBS is a promising approach to enhance motor function in PD.",

    "abstract": "Falls are one of the most frequent difficulties in patients with Parkinson's disease. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between foot pain and the risk of falls in participants with Parkinson's disease compared to a group of participants without Parkinson's disease.\nThe subjects (124) were divided into two groups, cases (n\u00a0=\u00a062) and controls (n\u00a0=\u00a062). They completed the Downton scale that collects the following 5 dimensions: previous falls, medications, sensory deficit, mental state, and ambulation.\nAnalyzing the Downton scale using dimensions, a significant difference was observed between both groups in all dimensions except mental state. Regarding the global result of risk of falls, the participants who had a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease presented a high risk of falls, 40.3% compared to 3.2% of the non-Parkinson's disease group, with statistically significant differences (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). For the numerical value of the Downton scale, there was a clear statistically significant difference between groups (2.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.96 vs. 1.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.19).\nThis research confirms further evidence that people with Parkinson's disease who suffer from foot pain are at high risk of falling, regardless of gender.",

    "abstract": "L-dopa (LD) effects on visually guided saccades (VGS) have been poorly investigated in de novo Parkinson's disease (PD) patients through a standardized acute challenge test.\nTo assess the acute saccadic effects of LD as well as possible different patterns of VGS response to LD in a consistent population of de novo PD.\nVGS were assessed among de novo PD at baseline and 2\u00a0h after the administration of LD/carbidopa 250/25\u00a0mg. Baseline instrumental assessments were compared with healthy controls (HCs).\nThirty-two de novo PD and 17 HCs were enrolled. PD patients showed lower upward velocities and amplitude than HCs, improving after LD administration. Two subgroups were identified among PD patients based on percent improvement or worsening of the most significant changing VGS parameter after LD administration: Group A (19 patients, showing improvement) and B (13 patients, showing worsening). Group A had at baseline reduced vertical, especially downward, velocities, gain and amplitude compared to Group B, with a significant improvement after LD. Conversely, in Group B, an LD-induced worsening effect on both horizontal and vertical VGS parameters was found. Comparing the two identified groups based on clinical-demographic characteristics, higher prevalence of female sex was found in Group B.\nDe novo PD patients presented prominent vertical VGS impairment which improved acutely after LD administration. Different patterns of acute saccadic responses to LD were also shown, suggesting a possible role of VGS in PD phenotyping.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability is considered a late complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, growing evidence shows that balance and gait problems may occur early in the disease.\nTo describe balance, gait, and falls/near falls in persons with newly diagnosed, untreated PD (\"de novo\"), and to compare this with persons with mild-moderate PD (Later PD). In addition, we evaluated differences relative to PD subtypes in de novo PD.\nDe novo (n\u2009=\u200954) and Later (n\u2009=\u200958) PD were assessed regarding motor symptoms, balance, gait, and falls/near falls.\nAt least 25% of de novo PD had impaired reactive balance and/or comfortable gait speed\u2009\u2264\u20091.0\u00a0m/s. At least 50% had abnormal dynamic balance. A third reported balance problems during dual-tasking. Five persons (9%) reported falls/near falls. The median (q1-q3) motor symptom score was 21 (14-28) in de novo PD and 13.5 (9-20) in Later PD (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Later PD performed worse on more balance-demanding tests and a higher percentage of individuals reported falls/near falls (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.048). De novo PIGD PD (n\u2009=\u200910) exhibited worse motor symptoms, reactive and dynamic balance, gait speed, mobility, and freezing of gait as compared to the non-PIGD de novo PD (n\u2009=\u200937) (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.049).\nBalance and gait were impaired in de novo PD and most pronounced in PIGD subtype. In addition, balance difficulties during dual-tasking and falls/near falls were evident during this early stage. The lower scores of motor symptoms in Later PD did not result in better mobility, balance, or less falls/near falls indicating that medications have less effect on these symptoms.",

Later PD performed worse on more balance-demanding tests and a higher percentage of individuals reported falls/near falls (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.048). De novo PIGD PD (n\u2009=\u200910) exhibited worse motor symptoms, reactive and dynamic balance, gait speed, mobility, and freezing of gait as compared to the non-PIGD de novo PD (n\u2009=\u200937) (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.049).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent, chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and other brain regions. The aggregation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) into Lewy bodies and neurites is a key pathological feature associated with PD and its progression. Many therapeutic studies aim to target these aggregated forms of \u03b1-syn to potentially slow down or stop disease progression in PD. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent clinical trials involving vaccines and monoclonal antibodies targeting \u03b1-syn. Specifically, UB-312, AFFITOPE PD01A, PD03A and ACI-7104.056 are designed to provoke an immune response against \u03b1-syn (active immunisation), while Prasinezumab and Cinpanemab, MEDI1341 and Lu AF82422 focus on directly targeting \u03b1-syn aggregates (passive immunisation). Despite some promising results, challenges such as variable efficacy and trial discontinuations persist. Future research must address these challenges to advance disease-modifying therapies for PD around this therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "PD is marked by both motor and non-motor symptoms, with its pathophysiology involving many neural pathways and brain regions beyond the dopaminergic system. While mainly gray matter changes have been noted, white matter changes also exist in PD. Habenula, known for its role in reward processing, mood regulation, motor functions, and cognition, is of interest due to its connection to mood disorders in PD. This study aims to explore diffusion metrics and structural connectivity changes in the habenula of newly diagnosed PD patients using 7\u00a0T MRI.\n84 PDs and 38 HCs were recruited from Maastricht University Medical Centre. Clinical, demographic, and total Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores were recorded. A 7\u00a0T brain MRI was conducted. Diffusion metrics and structural connectivity were evaluated.\nThe mean diffusion metrics of Hb were not significantly different between the groups. However, in PD patients, there was an increase in mean structural connectivity from the right Hb to the right hippocampus (p\u2009=\u20090.006) and the right fusiform gyrus (p\u2009=\u20090.007). On the left side, enhanced connectivity was observed with the left pallidum (p\u2009=\u20090.040) and left accumbens (p\u2009=\u20090.009). In the PD group, a significant correlation was found between the BDI total score and increased structural connectivity from the right Hb to the left cingulate isthmus (R\nThis pioneering study examines diffusion metrics and structural connectivity of Hb in PD patients using high-resolution 7\u00a0T MRI.

    "abstract": "Depression and decreased dopamine transporter (DAT) availability are prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD), yet early predictive biomarkers are lacking. This study investigates the longitudinal associations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neuroglial activation markers, sTREM2 and YKL-40, and depression, as well as DAT availability, in PD patients.\nWe analyzed data from 172 PD subjects and 80 matched healthy controls from a large longitudinal study. A generalized linear mixed-effects model assessed the longitudinal associations of CSF sTREM2 and YKL-40 with depression and DAT availability. Causal mediation analysis determined if DAT decline mediated the effects of sTREM2 and YKL-40 on depression.\nCross-sectional analysis revealed a negative correlation between CSF sTREM2 and baseline depression scores in PD patients. CSF YKL-40 negatively correlated with baseline left caudate nucleus, left anterior putamen, and right anterior putamen specific binding ratios (SBR). Longitudinally, higher baseline CSF sTREM2 predicted faster depression progression (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.828, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and a rapid decline in right putamen SBR (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.072, p\u2009=\u20090.016). Similarly, higher baseline CSF YKL-40 predicted faster depression progression (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.586, p\u2009=\u20090.004) and a decline in left anterior putamen SBR (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.058, p\u2009=\u20090.035). Causal mediation analysis indicated that baseline CSF sTREM2 accelerated depression progression via its effect on right putamen and right anterior putamen SBR (Indirect effect\u2009=\u20090.103, p\u2009=\u20090.020; Indirect effect\u2009=\u20090.129, p\u2009=\u20090.016).\nCSF sTREM2 and YKL-40 are effective predictors for depression and DAT decline in PD, suggesting that neuroglial activation-induced dopaminergic neuron apoptosis significantly contributes to depression onset in PD.",

    "abstract": "Identify consensus and variability in deep brain stimulation (DBS) programming practices for Parkinson's disease.\nDBS programming relies on the personal experience and skills of programmers. Despite consensus statements, there aren't official guidelines for DBS programming, making it likely for protocols to vary among providers.\nWe administered an online survey to the Functional Neurosurgery Working Group of the Parkinson's Study Group to capture those actively programming DBS patients. We performed descriptive statistics and comparisons of responses based on career stage: early (0-10\u00a0years) versus later (>10\u00a0years).\nBoston Scientific (n\u00a0=\u00a015/31, 48%) and Medtronic (n\u00a0=\u00a014/35, 40%) are the two DBS systems ranked as most used, with less reported frequency of Abbott devices (n\u00a0=\u00a04/32, 12.5).

Our data also highlights aspects of DBS programming with less consensus, demonstrating the need for future evidence.",

    "abstract": "This work aimed to update and summarize the existing evidence on the effectiveness of robot-assisted training (RAT) in adults with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nWe conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis,\u00a0reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42022371124). Seven databases and two trial registries were searched for randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) addressing RAT alone or in addition to other treatments in adults with PD up to January 2024. Primary outcomes were disease-specific motor impairment, balance, mobility, freezing of gait, falls, number of people who fell at least once, and adverse events. Meta-analysis using a random-effects model was performed. Risk of bias (RoB) and certainty of the evidence for the primary outcomes were assessed using the Cochrane RoB Tool and the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, respectively.\nFifteen RCTs (629 randomized adults with PD) were included. Our results show that the evidence is very uncertain about the effectiveness of any kind of RAT, either focused on gait, balance or upper limb impairment, compared to any comparator (treadmill training, overground gait training, exercises without the exoskeleton, conventional physical therapy, balance training, and no treatment), mainly because of RoB, inconsistency in individual studies results, and very limited number (less than 200) of participants considered in each comparison.\nIn light of the aforementioned very low certainty evidence, clinical considerations should be drawn very carefully. High-quality studies are thus highly needed to investigate potential benefits, risks, and cost/benefit ratio of RAT in adults with PD.",

    "abstract": "Free-water imaging can predict and monitor dopamine system degeneration in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, brain cholinergic function has not been investigated to date in LRRK2 mutation carriers with or without PD using free-water imaging.\nTo investigate the effect of LRRK2 mutations on the cholinergic system in manifest and premanifest stages of PD using free-water imaging.\nWe recruited participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data set. We evaluated the effect of LRRK2 mutations on the cholinergic nuclei (i.e., cholinergic nuclei 1, 2, and 3 (Ch123), Ch4, and pedunculopontine nucleus) in manifest and premanifest stages of PD using free-water imaging. We compared free-water values between groups using ANCOVA with adjustment for age. Then, the discriminative power of the free-water content was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis.\nWe included 27 patients with LRRK2 PD, 33 LRRK2 mutation carriers without PD, 281 patients with idiopathic PD, and 98 healthy controls. We noted significant between-group differences in free-water content in Ch4 (p\u2009=\u20090.003). LRRK2 mutation carriers without PD had decreased free-water content in the Ch4 compared with healthy controls (p\u2009=\u20090.036) and idiopathic patients with PD (p\u2009=\u20090.001); LRRK2 patients with PD showed decreased tendency of free-water content in the Ch4 compared with idiopathic patients with PD (p\u2009=\u20090.074). Furthermore, ROC analysis\u00a0showed that free-water content in the Ch4 identified asymptomatic LRRK2 mutation carriers with a high specificity (84.7%).\nLRRK2 mutation is associated with decreased free-water content in the Ch4 (also referred to as nucleus basalis of Meynert, nbM), which might suggest early and sustained attempts to compensate for LRRK2-related dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and non-motor functions, including speech. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the audio spectrogram transformer (AST) model in detecting PD through vocal biomarkers, hypothesizing that its self-attention mechanism would better capture PD related speech impairments compared to traditional deep learning approaches. Speech recordings from 150 participants (100 from PC-GITA: 50 PD, 50 healthy controls (HC); 50 from Italian Parkinson's voice and speech (ITA): 28 PD, 22 HC) were analyzed using the AST model and compared against established architectures including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet34, vision transformer, and swin transformer. Audio preprocessing included sampling rate standardization to 16\u00a0kHz and amplitude normalization. The AST model achieved superior classification performance across all datasets: 97.14% accuracy on ITA, 91.67% on Parkinson's Colombian - Grupo de Investigaci\u00f3n en Telecomunicaciones Aplicadas (PC-GITA), and 92.73% on the combined dataset. Performance remained consistent across different speech tasks, with particularly strong results in sustained vowel analysis (precision: 0.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03, recall: 0.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03). The model demonstrated robust cross-lingual generalization, outperforming traditional architectures by 5%-10% in accuracy. These results suggest that the AST model provides a reliable, non-invasive method for PD detection through voice analysis, with strong performance across different languages and speech tasks. The model's success in cross-lingual generalization indicates potential for broader clinical application, though validation across more diverse populations is needed for clinical implementation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, \"body-first\" and \"brain-first\" subtype in Parkinson's disease (PD) was proposed based on the propagation of \u03b1-synuclein. In isolated RBD considered as\u00a0a premotor stage of body-first PD, \u03b1-synuclein was supposed to originate in the enteric nervous system and spreads via autonomic nervous system. Therefore, we hypothesized that body-first PD is more likely to have a delayed gastric emptying time and reduced cardiac sympathetic denervation. In this study, we aimed to assess gastric motility and its correlation with cardiac sympathetic denervation, dopamine transporter uptake in PD with the body-first PD in comparison with brain-first PD.\nWe investigated gastric scintigraphy, dual-phase 18F-FP-CIT PET, and cardiac MIBG scintigraphy in patients with PD. Based on the presence of RBD and delayed H/M ratio in MIBG scintigraphy, we classified patients into the body-first PD and brain-first PD groups.

    "abstract": "The progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in affected patient brains is one of the pathological features of Parkinson's disease, the second most common human neurodegenerative disease. Although the detailed pathogenesis accounting for dopaminergic neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease is still unclear, the advancement of stem cell approaches has shown promise for Parkinson's disease research and therapy. The induced pluripotent stem cells have been commonly used to generate dopaminergic neurons, which has provided valuable insights to improve our understanding of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis and contributed to anti-Parkinson's disease therapies. The current review discusses the practical approaches and potential applications of induced pluripotent stem cell techniques for generating and differentiating dopaminergic neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells. The benefits of induced pluripotent stem cell-based research are highlighted. Various dopaminergic neuron differentiation protocols from induced pluripotent stem cells are compared. The emerging three-dimension-based brain organoid models compared with conventional two-dimensional cell culture are evaluated. Finally, limitations, challenges, and future directions of induced pluripotent stem cell-based approaches are analyzed and proposed, which will be significant to the future application of induced pluripotent stem cell-related techniques for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "In clinical specialties focusing on neurological disorders, there is a need for comprehensive and integrated non-invasive, sensitive, and specific testing methods. Both Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy are classified as \u03b1-synucleinopathies, characterized by abnormal accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein protein, which provides a shared pathological background for their comparative study. In addition, both Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy involve neuronal death, a process that may release circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the bloodstream, leading to specific alterations. This premise formed the basis for investigating cell-free DNA as a potential biomarker. Cell-free DNA has garnered attention for its potential pathological significance, yet its characteristics in the context of Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy are not fully understood. This study investigated the total concentration, nonapoptotic level, integrity, and cell-free DNA relative telomere length of cell-free DNA in the peripheral blood of 171 participants, comprising 76 normal controls, 62 patients with Parkinson's disease, and 33 patients with multiple system atrophy. In our cohort, 75.8% of patients with Parkinson's disease (stage 1-2 of Hoehn & Yahr) and 60.6% of patients with multiple system atrophy (disease duration less than 3 years) were in the early stages. The diagnostic potential of the cell-free DNA parameters was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and their association with disease prevalence was examined through logistic regression models, adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, body mass index, and education level. The results showed that cell-free DNA integrity was significantly elevated in both Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy patients compared with normal controls ( P < 0.001 for both groups), whereas cell-free DNA relative telomere length was markedly shorter ( P = 0.003 for Parkinson's disease and P = 0.010 for multiple system atrophy). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that both cell-free DNA integrity and cell-free DNA relative telomere length possessed good diagnostic accuracy for differentiating Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy from normal controls. Specifically, higher cell-free DNA integrity was associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease (odds ratio [OR]: 5.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.54-24.19) and multiple system atrophy (OR: 10.10; 95% CI: 1.55-122.98). Conversely, longer cell-free DNA relative telomere length was linked to reduced risk of Parkinson's disease (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.04-0.54) and multiple system atrophy (OR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.01-0.57). These findings suggest that cell-free DNA integrity and cell-free DNA relative telomere length may serve as promising biomarkers for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, potentially reflecting specific underlying pathophysiological processes of these neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a prevalent neurological condition, is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons, leading to motor dysfunction and non-motor symptoms. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of combining levodopa/benserazide with pramipexole on PD patients, focusing on cognitive function, plasma monoamine neurotransmitter levels, and serum growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) levels.\nThis retrospective study included 120 PD patients admitted to the hospital between January 2021 and January 2023. Based on the treatment approaches, the patients were categorized into the control group (n = 61) and the observation group (n = 59). The control group received oral levodopa/benserazide tablets, while the observation group was treated with levodopa/benserazide tablets combined with pramipexole. The two experimental groups were assessed and compared across several parameters, including PD symptoms [Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)], cognitive function [Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)], the levels of plasma monoamine neurotransmitters, and serum GDF-15 and Ang-1 levels.\nThe response rate to treatment was more significant in the observation group (96.55%) compared to the control group (87.93%, p = 0.162). Post-treatment, both groups demonstrated a decline in their UPDRS and overall scores, with the observation group indicating substantially lower scores than the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, both groups showed improvements in MoCA scores, with the observation group exhibiting higher scores than the control group (p < 0.05). Similarly, we observed significantly increased dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and norepinephrine levels in both groups, with the observation group showing a more pronounced increase (p < 0.05). Additionally, we observed a significant decrease in serum GDF-15 levels and an increase in Ang-1 levels across both groups after treatment. However, the observation group exhibited lower GDF-15 levels and higher Ang-1 levels than the control group (p < 0.05).\nThe combined use of levodopa/benserazide and pramipexole proves beneficial for managing PD. This therapeutic regimen can improve cognitive abilities and plasma monoamine neurotransmitter levels in PD patients, reduce brain tissue damage and decrease serum levels of GDF-15.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) present progressive deterioration in both motor and non-motor manifestations. However, the absence of clinical biomarkers for disease progression hinders clinicians from tailoring treatment strategies effectively.\nTo identify electroencephalography (EEG) biomarker that can track disease progression in PD.\nA total of 116 patients with PD were initially enrolled, whereas 63 completed 2-year follow-up evaluation. Fifty-eight age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were recruited as the control group. All participants underwent EEG and clinical assessments. Long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of EEG data were analyzed using the detrended fluctuation analysis.\nPatients with PD exhibited higher LRTC in left parietal \u03b8 oscillations (P\u2009=\u20090.0175) and lower LRTC in centro-parietal \u03b3 oscillations (P\u2009=\u20090.0258) compared to controls. LRTC in parietal \u03b3 oscillations inversely correlated with changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III scores over 2\u2009years (Spearman \u03c1\u2009=\u2009-0.34, P\u2009=\u20090.0082). Increased LRTC in left parietal \u03b8 oscillations were associated with rapid motor progression (P\u2009=\u20090.0107), defined as an annual increase in UPDRS part III score\u2009\u22653. In cognitive assessments, LRTC in parieto-occipital \u03b1 oscillations exhibited a positive correlation with changes in Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores over 2\u2009years (Spearman \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.27-0.38, P\u2009=\u20090.0037-0.0452).\nLRTC patterns in EEG potentially predict rapid progression of both motor and non-motor manifestations in PD patients, enhancing clinical assessment and understanding of the disease. \u00a9 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is an established treatment option in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). LCIG treatment is usually initiated with a nasojejunal tube (NJT) test phase before percutaneous endoscopic transgastric jejunostomy (PEG-J) tube installation. However, some centers have used direct initiation with PEG-J. Data comparing these approaches are scarce. The objective of this study was to analyze the risks and benefits of direct PEG-J initiation after a positive levodopa challenge test (LCT) for selected patients compared to initiation with a temporary NJT test phase.\nThirty-three consecutive advanced PD patients commenced LCIG-treatment between February 2016 and December 2019 at Helsinki University Hospital. Of them, 11 (33%) selected patients had direct initiation without an NJT test phase. Treatment discontinuations and adverse events during the first 6\u00a0months of treatment were evaluated retrospectively. The duration of hospital stay related to the initiation of the treatment was compared between the groups.\nBetween the direct initiation and NJT test phase groups, there were no significant differences in treatment discontinuations (0 vs. 1, respectively); the number of inner tube or PEG-J tube replacements (1 vs. 3); or infection complications (1 vs. 3) during the first 6\u00a0months of treatment. Direct initiation significantly reduced the hospital stay related to treatment initiation (mean 7 vs. 9\u00a0days, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001).\nFor selected patients, the direct initiation of LCIG after a positive LCT, without a temporary NJT test phase, appears safe and does not lead to additional treatment discontinuations or complications.",

    "abstract": "This study is to explore the effects of paeoniflorin (PF) on oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD) via the HSF1-NRF1 axis. SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with PF and induced with \u03b1-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF), followed by gain- and loss-of-function assays. Afterward, detection was conducted on cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential ([Formula: see text]m), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels. The binding of HSF1 to NRF1 promoter was evaluated. HSF1 and NRF1 expression was examined. Lastly, PD mouse models were established, followed by observation of the behavioral features of mice. Apoptosis; cleaved-Caspase 3, cleaved-Caspase 8, repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa), GAP-43, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression; and superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were determined in mice and cells. HSF1 and NRF1 were downregulated, and HSF1 promoted NRF1 transcription and PF dose-dependently augmented HSF1 and NRF1 expression. PF dose-dependently reduced RGMa expression, ROS, MDA, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-6 levels; mitigated apoptosis; and lowered cleaved-Caspase 3, cleaved-Caspase 8, COX-2, and iNOS expression while improving cell viability; increasing [Formula: see text]m, GAP-43, and BDNF expression; and raising SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and IL-10 levels in PFF-induced SH-SY5Y cells. These effects were neutralized by HSF1 knockdown. In conclusion, PF dose-dependently activated the HSF1-NRF1 axis and alleviated OS and inflammation in PFF-treated mice, thereby impeding PD progression in mice.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a prevalent neurological condition that affects around 1% of adults over 60 worldwide. Deep brain stimulation and dopamine replacement therapy are common therapies for Parkinson's disease, yet they are unable to reverse the disease it simply because of the blood brain barrier. The use of bioengineered exosomes to treat Parkinson's disease is being studied because they have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Their natural ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and their biocompatibility make them highly suitable for delivering therapeutic agents to manage PD, specifically the role of astrocytes, microglial cells, and alpha-synuclein. It also explores the biogenesis and preparation of these bioengineered exosomes. In comparison to conventional nanocarriers, the modified exosomal-membrane-camouflaged abiotic nanocarriers show improved resilience and compatibility. Improved cellular absorption and targeted delivery of therapeutic payloads, such as medications and enzymes, are being shown in laboratory trials. A viable strategy for treating PD involves combining abiotic nanocarriers with bioengineered exosomal membranes. Despite their promising potential, successful clinical application requires overcoming hurdles related to scalable production, regulatory approval, and long-term safety evaluation. Nevertheless, the innovative use of bioengineered exosomes holds significant promise for advancing PD management and improving patient outcomes through more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis has shown promise in differentiating neurodegenerative Parkinsonian syndromes and has significantly advanced our understanding of diseases like progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in recent years.\nThe aim of this study was to develop, implement and compare MRI analysis algorithms based on artificial intelligence (AI) that can differentiate PSP not only from healthy controls but also from Parkinson disease (PD), by analyzing changes in brain structure and microstructure. Specifically, this study focused on identifying regions of interest (ROIs) and tracts of interest (TOIs) that are crucial for the algorithms to provide clinically relevant performance indices for the distinction between disease variants.\nMR data comprised diffusion tensor imaging (DTI - tractwise fractional anisotropy statistics (TFAS)) and T1-weighted (T1-w) data (texture analysis of the corpus callosum (CC)). One subject sample with 74 PSP patients and 63 controls was recorded at 3.0T at multiple sites. The other sample came from a single site, consisting of 66 PSP patients, 66 PD patients, and 44 controls, recorded at 1.5T. Four different machine learning algorithms (ML) and a deep learning (DL) neural network approach using Tensor Flow were implemented for the study. The training of the algorithms was performed on 80\u00a0% of the data, which included the entire single-site data and parts of the multiple-site data. The validation process was conducted on the remaining data, thereby consistently separating training and validation data.\nA random forest algorithm and a DL neural network classified PSP and healthy controls with accuracies of 92\u00a0% and 95\u00a0%, respectively. Particularly, DTI derived measures for the pons, midbrain tegmentum, superior cerebral peduncle, putamen, and CC contributed to high accuracies. Furthermore, DL neural network classification of PSP and PD with 86\u00a0% accuracy showed the importance of 19 structures. The four most important features were DTI derived measures for prefrontal white matter, the fasciculus frontooccipitalis, the midbrain tegmentum, and the CC area II. This DL network achieved a sensitivity of 88\u00a0% and specificity of 85\u00a0%, resulting in a Youden-index of 0.72.\nThe primary goal of the present study was to compare multiple ML-methods and a DL approach to identify the least necessary set of brain structures to classify PSP vs. controls and PSP vs. PD by ranking them in a hierarchical order of importance. That way, this study demonstrated the potential of AI approaches to MRI as possible diagnostic and scientific tools to differentiate variants of neurodegenerative Parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common disease of the central nervous system after Alzheimer's disease. Currently, no blood test or other laboratory tests are available to diagnose this condition. One of the practical methods in diagnosing and evaluating the progress of neurodegenerative diseases is the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT), with which it is possible to accurately measure the thickness of the layers of the retina, as well as the thickness and volume of the macula. The goal of this study was to determine the OCT findings in patients with Parkinson's disease compared to the normal population.\nThis study was conducted in 2019 at the Neurology Clinic of Farshchian Hospital, Hamadan (Iran). Sampling was performed based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study and the required sample size. Patients referred to the Neurology Department of Farshchian Hospital were first examined by a neurologist, then referred to the ophthalmology clinic for a complete ophthalmological examination. OCT imaging was performed by an experienced, skilled optometrist after pupillary dilation with tropicamide drops. RNFL thickness, macula and fovea, and the measured macular volumes were recorded along with other information, including age, sex, disease duration, severity of disease symptoms, and drug use. Finally, the data were analyzed using SPSS version 22 statistical software.\nA total of 103 individuals including 49 males (47.6%) and 54 females (52.4%) with a mean age of 70.66 years were examined. The subjects included two groups, patients (53 subjects) and control (50 subjects), who were matched in terms of age and gender distribution. The mean RNFL thickness and macular thickness and volume in the patient group were significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05). There was an inverse relationship between the thickness of the RNFL and the macula with the duration of the disease and the severity of the disease symptoms (P<0.05).\nIn this study, a significant decrease in RNFL thickness and macular thickness and volume was shown in patients with Parkinson's disease compared to the age- and sex-matched control group. It can be said that the changes in the macula and RNFL in Parkinson's disease and with progression of the disease are suitable markers for diagnosing and investigating the progression of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) signifies a poorer prognosis, yet its impact on white matter (WM) degeneration remains unclear. The study examined the effect of RBD on WM alterations in PD progression.\nThe study included 45 PD patients with possible RBD (PD-pRBD), 38 PD patients without possible RBD (PD-npRBD), and 79 healthy controls (HC). All patients underwent clinical assessments and diffusion MRI scans at least once a year for up to 4 visits. 79 HC underwent the same protocol at baseline. WM metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD), were calculated using tract-based spatial statistics. Linear mixed-effects models were conducted to examine the changes in clinical features and WM fibers.\nAt baseline, PD-npRBD showed increased RD in several regions, predominantly in bilateral uncinate fasciculus (UF) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), compared to HC (P\nPD patients with pRBD demonstrated more extensive WM degeneration and accelerated degeneration in the left ILF and UF during the disease course. However, due to the lack of PSG verification, these results should be interpreted cautiously while directly relating to RBD. These findings provide new insights into the neural structural basis associated with the potential impact of RBD on PD progression.",

Incidence rates were assessed during short-term (within 1\u00a0month), medium-term (within 6\u00a0months), and long-term (> 6\u00a0months) monitoring periods. A proportional meta-analysis was performed using random-effects and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs).\nWe included 691 PDP patients from 19 studies. During the short-term monitoring period, none of the 573 participants in 16 studies developed SNA. The pooled incidence of SNA was 0.001 (95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI]: 0.000-0.253, 525 participants, 15 studies) during the medium-term period and 0.002 (95\u00a0% CI: 0.000-0.015, 475 participants, 12 studies) during the long-term period. The pooled incidence of MMN was 0.004 (95\u00a0% CI: 0.000-0.281, 164 participants, 7 studies) for short- and medium-term periods and 0.013 (95\u00a0% CI: 0.002-0.094, 193 participants, 7 studies) in the long-term period. Funnel plot asymmetry indicated potential bias in the medium-term dataset of SNA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035).\nClozapine treatment in PDP patients may carry a very low risk of SNA and a low risk of MMN.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of miRNAs have been reported to be dysregulated in Parkinson's disease (PD), providing valuable assistance in improving its diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to analyze the expression and diagnostic value of miR-19b-3p in PD patients, as well as its relationship with inflammatory factors.\nWe recruited 50 PD patients and 50 healthy age- and gender-matched controls and collected demographic data and biochemical parameters from both groups. RT-qPCR was used to detect miR-19b-3p levels in serum. ELISA was used to detect serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic value of miR-19b-3p in PD patients.\nSerum miR-19b-3p expression was downregulated in PD patients compared with healthy controls. A negative correlation was found between miR-19b-3p levels and the MDS-UPDRS score in PD patients (r = -0.686, p < 0.01). In ROC curve analysis, the area under the curve of miR-19b-3p for prediction of PD was 0.779. In PD patients, serum miR-19b-3p levels were negatively correlated with serum IL-1\u03b2 (r = -0.556, p < 0.01) and TNF-\u03b1 levels (r = -0.592, p < 0.01).\nSerum miR-19b-3p might serve as a diagnostic and predictive biomarker for PD. The association detected between miR-19b-3p and two common markers of inflammation (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) may suggest a role for miR-19b-3p in PD-associated neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) severely affects the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in the later stages. Recently, PD patients with diabetes were found to have a higher risk of cognitive decline and developing dementia with a faster progression, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Diabetes-related white matter damage may partially explain the mechanism by which diabetes participates in PDD. Seventy PD patients were included. PD patients underwent diffusion tensor imaging from The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were collected and were divided into four groups: PD with diabetes without dementia, PD with dementia without diabetes, PD without dementia and diabetes. Tract-based spatial statistics analysis and region-of-interest-based analysis were performed. Factorial analysis with diabetes and dementia taken as the main effects was performed, and the differences between the white matter fibers of PD patients from the four groups were also analyzed. The interaction between diabetes and dementia in the damage of white matter in PD patients was also analyzed. We found that both diabetes and dementia were found to be related to the damage in internal capsule, corona radiata, and thalamic radiation of the PD patients. There is an interaction between diabetes and dementia in the white matter damage of PD patients. Both diabetes and dementia were found to be related to the damage in internal capsule, corona radiata, and thalamic radiation of the PD patients. Diabetes may participate in cognitive decline in PD patients via damaging cognition-related white matter tracts.",

    "abstract": "To explore the molecular mechanism of Sijunzi Decoction (SJZD) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) through the application of network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations, complemented by experimental verification.\nThe BATMAN-TCM, GeneCards, and DisGeNet databases were searched to screen the active components and therapeutic targets of SJZD. Cytoscape (3.7.1) was used to create a network diagram of the components and targets. The STRING platform was used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The Bioconductor database and RX64 (4.0.0) software were used to conduct Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis on the core target genes. The binding sites and binding energies between SJZD active components and the target were analyzed by molecular docking and dynamic simulation. Finally, the therapeutic effect and mechanism of SJZD were verified by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and Western blotting (WB).\nThis research identified 188 active compounds in SJZD, 1568 drug targets, 2069 PD targets, and 451 intersection targets related to PD. According to network analysis, Adenosine Triphosphate, Tridecanoic Acid, Hexadecanoic Acid, Pentadecanoic Acid, and Adenosine were identified as the core components of SJZD in the treatment of PD. The five targets with the highest Degree values in the PPI network were AKT1, INS, TNF, IL-6, and TP53. The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, in turn, determined that the administration of SJZD for the treatment of PD may engage processes such as xenobiotic stimulation and biological stimulus response. Furthermore, AGE-RAGE and cAMP signaling pathways related to diabetic complications may be involved. Molecular docking and kinetic simulations showed that IL-6 and AKT1 bind best to Adenosine. Experimental results showed that SJZD significantly reduced 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis of SH\u2043SY5Y cells by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and regulating the expression of apoptosis factors such as Bcl\u20432 and Bax.\nSJZD is essential in the processes of apoptosis and neuronal protection, acting through various components that target multiple pathways. Notably, the PI3K/AKT pathway is a verified SJZD-PD target, providing a reference for clinical precision drug use for PD.",

    "results": "This research identified 188 active compounds in SJZD, 1568 drug targets, 2069 PD targets, and 451 intersection targets related to PD. According to network analysis, Adenosine Triphosphate, Tridecanoic Acid, Hexadecanoic Acid, Pentadecanoic Acid, and Adenosine were identified as the core components of SJZD in the treatment of PD. The five targets with the highest Degree values in the PPI network were AKT1, INS, TNF, IL-6, and TP53. The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, in turn, determined that the administration of SJZD for the treatment of PD may engage processes such as xenobiotic stimulation and biological stimulus response. Furthermore, AGE-RAGE and cAMP signaling pathways related to diabetic complications may be involved. Molecular docking and kinetic simulations showed that IL-6 and AKT1 bind best to Adenosine. Experimental results showed that SJZD significantly reduced 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis of SH\u2043SY5Y cells by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and regulating the expression of apoptosis factors such as Bcl\u20432 and Bax.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between migraine and Parkinson's disease (PD) remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the causal and genetic associations between migraine and PD.\nGenetic data for migraine [any migraine (AM), migraine without aura (MO), and migraine with aura (MA)] and PD were sourced from the latest genome-wide meta-analyses conducted by the International Headache Genetics Consortium and the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium, respectively. Various analyses were performed to evaluate the potential causal associations and explore genetic correlations between these conditions.\nThe analyses indicated that AM (odds ratio [OR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-1.14; p\u2009=\u20090.785), MO (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84-1.07; p\u2009=\u20090.358), and MA (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95-1.06; p\u2009=\u20090.846) were not significantly associated with the risk of PD. Similarly, reverse analyses also demonstrated no significant causality between PD and the risks of migraine or its subtypes. After adjusting for coronary heart disease, AM (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90-1.10; p\u2009=\u20090.897), MO (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.03; p\u2009=\u20090.207), and MA (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93-1.07; p\u2009=\u20090.902) remained unrelated to PD risk. Likewise, PD was found to be unassociated with AM (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-1.02; p\u2009=\u20090.168), MO (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86-1.05; p\u2009=\u20090.287), and MA (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93-1.13; p\u2009=\u20090.669). These null findings persisted even when adjusting for hypertension. Apart from above causal inference results, no significant genetic correlation was found between AM (r\nOur study suggests that there is no significant causal association or genetic correlation between migraine and PD from a genetic perspective.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a significant correlate of Parkinson's Disease (PD), with positron emission tomography showing microglial activation early in the PD process and post-mortem tissue containing reactive microglia. Adipose-derived (AD) stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells have been shown to respond to pro-inflammatory conditions with secretion of anti-inflammatory paracrine factors. This pilot clinical trial was to examine the safety and clinical response using autologous ADSVF to treat PD. Nine PD subjects had baseline neurological exams and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39) and \"off-medication\" Movement Disorder Society (MDS) - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III assessments. Each subject had a liposuction procedure; the lipoaspirate was then processed via enzymatic digestion to yield SVF. All subjects were treated with a total dose of 30 million autologous SVF cells injected in the forehead and maxillary regions. Subjects were followed at 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-months for safety and potential clinical improvement. There were no SVF intervention-related serious adverse events. PDQ-39 scores at 12-months and 24-months were improved in 6 of 9 subjects evaluable and 4 of 7 subjects evaluable, respectfully. Scores were stable in 1 subject and worse in 2 subjects. MDS-UPDRS Part III scores were improved at 24, months in 3 evaluable subjects and were stable in 2 subjects. One subject required increased dopaminergic medication for increased tremor (disease progression). Autologous ADSVF via facial injections to treat PD was safe, showed evidence of clinical improvement at 12 and 24 months and should be further evaluated in a Phase II placebo-controlled clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have increased our understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD) genetics by identifying common disease-associated variants. However, much of the heritability remains unaccounted for and we hypothesized that this could be partly explained by epistasis, the statistical interaction between two or more genetic variants. Here, we developed a genome-wide non-exhaustive epistasis screening pipeline called Variant-variant interaction through variable thresholds (VARI3) and applied it to diverse PD GWAS cohorts. We used 14 cohorts of European ancestry (14,671 cases and 17,667 controls) as a discovery stage, identifying 14 significant candidate variant-variant interactions. We then used four independent cohorts (13,377 cases and 413,789 controls) as replication stage, successfully replicating three epistasis signals located nearby SNCA and within MAPT and WNT3. Admixture analysis showed that the epistatic effect on PD of those variants at these loci was observed in both European ancestry and Native American ancestry individuals. We assessed the functional impact of the epistasis signals across a range of functional/-omics datasets identifying significant single-variant eQTLs across brain tissues, epistasis eQTL signals in whole-blood, PD-relevant pathways and ontologies, and chromatin interactions between the regions of the interacting SNPs. In conclusion, we identified and replicated novel epistatic signals associated with PD risk across multiple diverse genetic ancestry cohorts, highlighting their enrichment in pathways relevant to Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) epidemiology and clinical features are sexually dimorphic. However, there are no data based on EEG functional connectivity (FC). Likewise, the contribution of sex hormones on brain FC has never been evaluated. Here, we aimed to investigate the association between biological sex and sex hormones on cortical FC changes in PD using high-density EEG. This study involved 69 early-stage PD patients (F/M 27/42) and 69 age-matched healthy controls (HC) (F/M 30/39). Sex hormone levels (total-testosterone (TT), estradiol (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH)) were assessed in PD patients. Data were recorded with a 64-channel EEG system. Source reconstruction method was used to identify brain activity. Cortico-cortical FC was analysed based on the weighted phase-lag index (wPLI) in \u03b8-\u03b1-\u03b2-low \u03b3 bands. Network-based statistic (NBS) was used to compare FC between genders in HC and PD and to study the relationship between FC and sex hormones in PD. PD exhibited a hypoconnected network at \u03b8 and \u03b1 bands and a hyperconnected network at \u03b2 band compared to HC. Male HC showed a hyperconnected network at \u03b1-band compared to female HC. Conversely, males with PD showed a hypoconnected network at \u03b1-band compared to females with PD. In females and males with PD, E2 positively correlated with \u03b1-FC, while gonadotropins positively correlated with \u03b2-FC. TT positively correlated with the \u03b8-FC only in males. Sex hormones shape EEG-FC in both males and females with PD, supporting their major influence on PD pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Chronic administration of Bacopa monnieri extract exerts neuroprotective potential in multiple animal models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and other cognitive impairments. However, the underlying mechanism of action remained unclear. Rotenone model of PD holds a great potential for investigating PD pathology and motor and nonmotor symptoms. Herein, we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of Bacopaside-I (BS-I), a major triterpenoid saponin of Bacopa monnieri extract, against rotenone-induced in vivo model of PD and explored the possible molecular mechanism. Rats were exposed to rotenone (2\u00a0mg/kg body weight) for a period of 4 consecutive weeks to induce PD-like behavior. BS-I (5, 15, and 45\u00a0mg/kg) was administered orally. Behavioral data (rotarod, foot printing, and grip strength test) suggest that BS-I plays a significant role in attenuating the motor function deficit. Exposure to rotenone reduces the dopamine level and increases oxidative stress, while BS-I treatment reversed these changes. Furthermore, chronic administration of BS-I increased the expression levels of dopamine transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) genes and the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons as compared to rotenone-exposed animals. Our study established the neuroprotective role of BS-I in PD model and laid the foundation for further evaluation of BS-I-based drug in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) impairment is a common and progressive abnormality in Parkinson's disease (PD), which ultimately leads to dementia. Individuals with PD exhibit altered electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns while engaging in tasks that require WM. The study examined the EEG patterns associated with WM maintenance in PD patients.\nThe study consisted of two groups of PD patients with a sign of dementia (PDD) who had a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score \u226424, PD patients with no sign of dementia (PDND) with an MMSE score >24, and a group of healthy individuals serving as controls (CON). We obtained EEG during a word memorization task using a 128-channel system. The spectral power of the EEG was computed using the fast Fourier transformation algorithm.\nCompared to both PDND and CON groups, PDD group exhibited higher power in the delta and beta frequency bands. Conversely, there was a notable decrease in power in the gamma band in both the PDD and PDND groups compared to the CON group. In addition, the PDD group exhibited higher power in the gamma band compared to the PDND group. Power in the alpha (LA1, LA2, and UA) and theta bands was greater in PDND and PDD compared to CON, but was similar between PDND and PDD groups.\nWhile performing WM tasks, PDD exhibits increased delta and beta power. These findings can be used as a quantitative biomarker to evaluate the severity of initial WM impairments, which could potentially develop into dementia in the future.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is a prevalent yet under-recognized non-motor symptom (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD), significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Despite its clinical importance, the relationship between fatigue and other motor and non-motor symptoms remains poorly understood. Its frequent co-occurrence with other NMS further complicates both diagnosis and management, often leading to underdiagnosis and suboptimal treatment. This gap in understanding is largely due to the limited exploration of fatigue in PD.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of fatigue at baseline and up to 10\u00a0years after symptom onset in a large, well-characterized PD cohort (PPMI) and to explore its associations with other non-motor symptoms (NMS). By providing insights into the prevalence and correlations of fatigue, our goal is to highlight the need for early identification and management, guiding future research efforts.\n\u00a0We conducted a retrospective study using the PPMI database. Fatigue was assessed using item 1.13 of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Logistic regression was used to analyze the impact of different variables on fatigue, while point-biserial correlation analysis gauged the relationship between continuous variables and fatigue.\nAt baseline study visit, 52% (575) of patients reported experiencing fatigue, with 9% reporting moderate to severe fatigue early in the disease course. Higher scores on several scales were significantly associated with an increased risk of fatigue, though most associations were weak. Significant associations included the REM Sleep Behavioral Disorder Questionnaire (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.11), Geriatric Depression Scale (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.11), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02), SCOPA-Autonomic Dysfunction (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.03-1.06), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.04-1.08), and Apathy (OR: 2.90, 95% CI: 2.4-3.5).\nOver half of patients reported fatigue at baseline, underscoring its significant prevalence early in PD. The predominantly weak associations with other NMS highlight the necessity for comprehensive patient screening and targeted interventions, as addressing one NMS may not effectively alleviate others.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, resulting in symptoms such as tremors, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, and potential cognitive and affective disturbances. The effective delivery of pharmacological agents to the central nervous system is hindered by various factors, including the restrictive properties of the blood\u2012brain barrier and blood\u2012spinal cord barrier, as well as the physicochemical characteristics of the drugs. Traditional drug delivery methods may not provide the therapeutic concentrations necessary for functional restoration in PD patients. However, lipid-based nanoparticles (NPs) offer new possibilities for enhancing the bioavailability of established treatment regimens and developing innovative therapies that can modify the course of the disease. This review provides a concise overview of recent advances in lipid-based NP strategies aimed at mitigating specific pathological mechanisms relevant to PD progression. This study also explores the potential applications of nanotechnological innovations in the development of advanced treatment modalities for individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "Clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are classified into motor and non-motor symptoms. Mental disorders, especially depression, are one of the major non-motor manifestations of PD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, 21 neurotransmitters associated with mental disorders were measured in serum samples from patients and controls using the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) assay. Additionally, five clinical scales-the MDS Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD)-were used to evaluate the severity of both motor and non-motor symptoms in PD patients. Analysis of neurotransmitter metabolism revealed significant changes in the tryptophan (Trp) metabolic pathway in PD patients. Specifically, levels of Trp, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KA), nicotinamide (NAM), and 5-methoxyltryptamine (MeOTA) were substantially decreased. Additionally, three other excitation/inhibiting amino acids-glutamic acid (Glu), 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and aspartic acid (Asp)-also declined. Moreover, neurotransmitter conversion ratios, such as KA/KYN, nicotinamide/niacin (NAM/NA), 5-hydroxytryptophan/tryptophan (5-HTP/Trp), and quinolinic acid/kynurenic acid (QA/KA), provided more dynamic insights into disrupted neurotransmitter metabolism. Correlation analyses between scale scores and neurotransmitter levels showed that concentrations of xanthurenic acid (XA) and the turnover rate of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) were negatively correlated with UPDRS scores, while 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and GABA levels were negatively correlated with non-motor symptoms in PD patients. In summary, this study elucidates, for the first time, the potential association and dynamics between altered neurotransmitter metabolism and the etiology of PD in terms of motor and non-motor functions. These findings offer novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) characterized by inflammation and protein erroneous deposition, whose pathological mechanisms have not been elucidated. NcRNA plays important role in PD, especially when circRNA sponges miRNA, which leads to the breakdown of downstream regulation. The aim of this study is to investigate the dynamic changes between upregulated circRNA and downregulated miRNA during the pathogenesis of PD and their impact on downstream miRNA targets.\nWe conducted bioinformatics on sequencing data of substantia nigra (SN) and striatum, and intersected differentially expressed genes (Degs) to determine core role of circFTO-miR-187-3p-EEF2 axes in the progression of PD. Firstly, therapeutic effect of knock-down circFTO in PD and its impact on EEF2 were determined in mouse, using immunohistochemistry, HE, Nissl, TUNEL staining and Western blot (WB). Targeted binding relationship between circFTO, miR-187-3p, and EEF2 was determined through RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation assays (RIP) and dual luciferase reporter assay. The significance of gene in apoptosis was confirmed through flow cytometry, lentiviral transduction, quantitative real-time PCR, and WB.\nCircFTO is upregulated and miR-187-3p is downregulated in SN of PD. EEF2 was the core of neural repair related modules in both SN and striatum using Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI). The binding regulation relationship between circFTO-miR-187-3p-EEF2 was determined through structural analysis, RIP, and dual luciferase reporter assay. After knocking-down circFTO, animals showed alleviated symptoms, decreased levels of oxidative stress and EEF2. Upregulation of miR-187-3p or si-circFTO in SH-SY5Y cells can reduce cell apoptosis, EEF2, and oxidative stress. Moreover, individual interference with EEF2 can partially counteract the induction of 6-OHDA on apoptosis.\nExcessive circFTO sponging miR-187-3p leads to the inability of miR-187-3p to effectively regulate expression of EEF2, resulting in the progression of PD. Moreover, interference with circFTO can effectively reduce brain inflammation and oxidative stress.",

Molecular and clinical signatures of PD in asymptomatic phases help understand the earliest pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease. We aimed to investigate whether blood epigenetic markers are associated with inter-individual variation of striatal DAT binding among healthy elderly individuals. We also investigated whether this potential inter-individual variation can manifest as dysfunction of particular cognitive domains.

    "abstract": "Abnormal reactive saccade, with reduced saccadic gain, impaired smooth pursuit, and unwarranted reactions are clinically used to assess people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). However, there are inconsistent findings related to other saccade parameters such as latency and transition times. This study aimed to identify differences in the reflexive saccade parameters of early stage PwPD and aged-matched control (AMC).\nIn this observational study, the reactive eye-gaze was recorded for 70 participants (42 PwPD) and parameters of reflexive saccades and eye-gaze fluctuations were extracted. These parameters were then statistically analyzed using the Mann-Whitney \nResults showed that PwPD had significantly shorter latency than AMC for reflexive saccadic movement away from the center of the screen. The overshoot as a fraction of the screen width, a measure of the inaccuracy in reaching the target, was also significantly higher for PwPD. PwPD had greater horizontal and vertical eye gaze fluctuation with a steady target. The numbers of invalid saccades, i.e., when the gaze goes in the opposite direction from the target movement or is considered anticipatory, were similar for both groups; PwPD with 33.43% and AMC with 25.71%.\nThis study shows that there are significant differences in the reflexive saccade of PwPD and AMC measured using an inexpensive eye-tracking device. The presence of invalid saccade trials, and differences between towards and away from screen center, both of which were not considered in earlier studies, may explain the discrepancies between earlier studies. The outcome of this study has the potential to be made a device that would assist neurologists in the assessment of PwPD.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the presence and comparison of microvascular abnormalities in essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson disease (PD) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) and to show the relationship between retinal microvascular changes and disease stage in the patient group. A total of 176 eyes, including 26 PD diagnosed according to the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank criteria, 31 ET diagnosed according to the Washington heights-inwood genetic study of ET (WHIGET) criteria and 31 healthy controls, were included in the study. Unified PD assessment scale (UPDRS) motor scores, non-motor symptom scale (NMS), modified Hoehn&Yahr stages (mH&Y) and Fahn-Toloso-Marin grading scale were recorded. All patients were evaluated in terms of visual acuity, fundus examination, intraocular pressure measurements, and refractive errors in Ophthalmology department. Deep macular vascular density was significantly decreased in PD compared to both the controls and ET(P\u2005<\u2005.05). In the measurements in the inferior quadrant of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) of the optic disc (OD), the values of the controls were significantly higher than those of PD in both eyes (P\u2005=\u2005.014 and P\u2005=\u2005.010). Radial peripapillary capillarity density in the left eye was substantially lower in ET than in controls (P\u2005=\u2005.045). In both eyes, OD radial peripapillary capillarity inside the disc small values of PD were significantly lower than those of ET and controls (P\u2005<\u2005.05). In our study, deep macular vascular density, RNFL and radial peripapillary capillarity were significantly lower in PD compared with ET and control groups, and radial peripapillary capillarity was lower in ET compared with control group. This study provides valuable information regarding the potential of OCT-A as a diagnostic tool for PD and ET.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative motor disorders worldwide with postural instability, bradykinesia, resting tremor and rigidity being the most common symptoms of the disease. Despite the fact that the molecular mechanisms of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis have already been well described, there is still no coherent picture of the etiopathogenesis of this disease. According to modern concepts, neurodegeneration is induced mainly by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, dysregulation of cerebral proteostasis, apoptotic dysregulation, and impaired autophagy. This review describes how various factors contribute to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Understanding the factors affecting fundamental cellular processes and responsible for disease progression may help develop therapeutic strategies to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from the disease. The review also discusses the role of calpains in the development of Parkinson's disease. It is known that \u03b1-synuclein is a substrate of calcium-dependent proteases of the calpain family. Truncated forms of \u03b1-synuclein are not only involved in the process of formation of the aggregates, but also increase their toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily characterized by motor symptoms, but non-motor symptoms, including skin manifestations, are increasingly recognized. These remain underexplored despite their potential impact on quality of life.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical features of skin findings in PD patients, with a focus on identifying potential pathogenetic links between dermatological conditions and PD.\nA total of 215 PD patients were included. Comprehensive dermatological examinations were performed, and demographic and clinical data were collected. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 23.0, with significance set at P < 0.05.\nSkin conditions were found in 92.1% of PD patients. Xerosis, seborrheic dermatitis, and hyperhidrosis were the most common findings. Pre-PD xerosis was associated with an earlier stage of PD (P = 0.001). Use of PD medications, such as levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone, was linked to a lower incidence of seborrheic dermatitis (P = 0.040). A significant correlation was also noted between rosacea and cherry angioma (P = 0.01).\nDermatological conditions are prevalent in PD and may precede its motor symptoms. Skin assessments could aid early diagnosis and management of PD, highlighting the need for further research on their pathogenetic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder. The pathological feature of PD is abnormal \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) formation and transmission. Recent evidence demonstrates that \u03b1-syn preformed fibrils (\u03b1-syn PFFs) can be detected in the serum of patients with PD. The peripheral blood \u03b1-syn PFF can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and aggravate neuronal damage, but the mechanism remains to be elucidated. We constructed the PD mouse models of different severity: the mild pathology (A53T ONLY) and the severe pathology (A53T + Brain FIB); this was followed by \u03b1-syn PFFs intravenous injection. Then, we used endothelium-specific Lag3 knockout mice (Lag3-ECs-CKO) to decrease the blood \u03b1-syn PFFs spreading. We observed that intravenous transmission of \u03b1-syn PFFs significantly aggravated motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss, neuroinflammation, and pathologic \u03b1-syn deposition in A53T ONLY, but not in A53T + Brain FIB. Blocking endothelial Lag3 endocytosis by Lag3-ECs-CKO decreased the blood \u03b1-syn PFFs spreading and improved the symptoms and pathogenesis of PD mice. Our findings reveal the role of peripheral blood \u03b1-syn PFFs transmission in the mild pathology or early-stage PD and the mechanism of endothelial Lag3 endocytosis in the pathology of \u03b1-syn transmission. Targeting endothelial Lag3 to prevent \u03b1-syn from spreading from the blood to the brain may be a disease-modifying therapy in early-stage PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the inability of dopamine production from amino acids. Therefore, changes in amino acid profile in PD patients are very critical for understanding disease development. Determination of amino acid levels in PD patients with a cumulative approach may enlighten the disease pathophysiology.\nA systematic search was performed until February 2023, resulting in 733 articles in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases to evaluate the serum amino acid profile of PD patients. Relevant articles in English with mean/standard deviation values of serum amino acid levels of patients and their healthy controls were included in the meta-analysis.\nOur results suggest that valine, proline, ornithine and homocysteine levels were increased, while aspartate, citrulline, lysine and serine levels were significantly decreased in PD patients compared to healthy controls. Homocysteine showed positive correlations with glutamate and ornithine levels. We also analyzed the disease stage parameters: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III) score, Hoehn-Yahr Stage Score, disease duration and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) of patients. It was observed that LEDD has a negative correlation with arginine levels in patients. UPDRS III score is negatively correlated with phenylalanine levels, and it also tends to show a negative correlation with tyrosine levels. Disease duration tends to be negatively correlated with citrulline levels in PD patients.\nThis cumulative analysis shows evidence of the relation between the mechanisms underlying amino acid metabolism in PD, which may have a great impact on disease development and new therapeutic strategies.",

Homocysteine showed positive correlations with glutamate and ornithine levels. We also analyzed the disease stage parameters: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III) score, Hoehn-Yahr Stage Score, disease duration and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) of patients. It was observed that LEDD has a negative correlation with arginine levels in patients. UPDRS III score is negatively correlated with phenylalanine levels, and it also tends to show a negative correlation with tyrosine levels. Disease duration tends to be negatively correlated with citrulline levels in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) afflicted more than 8.5 million people globally in 2019, as the prevalence of the condition more than doubled during the preceding 25 years. Both non-motor symptoms, such as mood disorders and cognitive impairment, and motor symptoms, such as tremors and rigidity, are indicative of this progressive neurodegenerative disease. Recent data indicates a significant role for the gut microbiome in PD pathogenesis and progression, emphasizing the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement, this systematic review summarizes our current knowledge about the function of the gut microbiome in PD, highlighting recurrent microbial alterations and assessing microbiome-based treatment strategies. The review revealed several consistent patterns in the gut microbiota of PD patients, including reduced microbial diversity and specific taxonomic alterations, including a drop in ",

    "abstract": "Paper symptom diaries are a common tool for assessing motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, but there are concerns about inaccuracies in the assessment of motor fluctuation due to recall bias and poor compliance. We, therefore, developed an electronic diary with reminder and real-time recording functions.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the electronic diary, we compared compliance and motor fluctuation assessment with a paper diary. Nineteen PD patients were recruited and recorded paper diaries every 30\u2009min from 8\u2009am to 8\u2009pm for 7\u2009days, followed by 7\u2009days of electronic diary recording using a smartphone and smartwatch. Prior to the recording period, the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)-39 and the Movement Disorders Society-sponsored Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Revised (MDS-UPDRS) 1, 2, 3, 4 were measured. Patients completed a patient questionnaire on the usability of the diaries after the recording period.\nTotal reported time was significantly longer in paper diaries, but there was no significant difference in the number of entries (paper 115 [71-147] vs. electronic 109 [93-116], \nElectronic diaries are useful tools that more accurately reflect PD motor fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the correlation between the total burden of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD) and Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA cross-sectional design was employed, involving 422 patients with PD. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted to identify CSVD markers. SCD was assessed using the Cognitive Complaints Inventory (CCI).\nLogistic regression analyses revealed that the total burden of CSVD and specific imaging markers, including Deep White Matter Hyperintensities (DWMH), Periventricular Hyperintensities (PVH), and Enlarged Perivascular Spaces (EPVS), were significant predictors of SCD. The total burden of CSVD demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy for SCD in PD patients.\nThe findings suggest that the total burden of CSVD, as measured by MRI, could serve as a potential biomarker for early identification of cognitive decline in PD, highlighting the importance of considering vascular factors in the early detection of cognitive changes in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) is one of the most severe and disabling non-motor symptoms in the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), significantly impacting the prognosis of PD patients. In recent years, there has been an increase in literature on PDP. However, bibliometrics has rarely been applied to PDP research. This study provides an overview of the current state of PDP research and predicts future trends in this field.\nThe literature search was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection, with the search terms (Parkinson* AND (psychotic* OR hallucination* OR illusion* OR delusion* OR misperception* OR psychosis OR psychoses)). VOSviewer and CiteSpace software were employed to perform bibliometric analysis and visual representation of the search results.\nA total of 603 articles were effectively included. Since 2017, there has been a significant upward trend in publications related to PDP. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada were the top three contributing countries in terms of publication volume, with France also having a strong influence in this field. \nResearch on PDP has garnered increasing attention. This study visualizes PDP research over the past 25\u2009years to analyze global hotspots and trends. It offers researchers a valuable perspective for identifying key topics and understanding research trajectories in this expanding field.",

    "abstract": "From the perspective of a Parkinson's patient, this paper aims to elucidate some of the unreasonable and difficult-to-understand realities in Korea, from diagnosis to treatment, with a view to improving the system and policies. Adequate procedures for furnishing information to patients following a diagnosis are lacking. To date, no websites have been established by doctors, public institutions, or the government to provide adequate information. This dearth of information creates a problematic situation that gives rise to patients receiving erroneous or misleading information, thereby wasting their time, financial resources, and ultimately, impacts their health. It is recommended that the government establish an authoritative organization to provide information about Parkinson's disease in order to prevent harm and promote non-motor and motor symptom treatments, such as psychotherapy, as demonstrated in the United States and the United Kingdom. In Korea, the Korea Parkinson Association, a nonprofit private organization, has initiated a campaign for understanding and consideration. With the support of the government and society, an environment can be created where people with Parkinson's disease can live with dignity as members of society.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects motor function due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. It presents significant challenges, impacting millions worldwide with symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, leading to decreased quality of life and increased morbidity. The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is multifaceted, involving complex interactions between genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and aging, with oxidative stress playing a central role in neuronal degeneration. Glutathione S-Transferase enzymes are critical in the cellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress, catalysing the conjugation of the antioxidant glutathione to various toxic compounds, thereby facilitating their detoxification. Recent research underscores the importance of Glutathione S-Transferase in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, revealing that genetic polymorphisms in Glutathione S-Transferase genes influence the risk and progression of the disease. These genetic variations can affect the enzymatic activity of Glutathione S-Transferase, thereby modulating an individual's capacity to detoxify reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics, which are implicated in Parkinson's disease neuropathological processes. Moreover, biochemical studies have elucidated the role of Glutathione S-Transferase in not only maintaining cellular redox balance but also in modulating various cellular signalling pathways, highlighting its neuroprotective potential. From a therapeutic perspective, targeting Glutathione S-Transferase pathways offers promising avenues for the development of novel treatments aimed at enhancing neuroprotection and mitigating disease progression. This review explores the evident and hypothesized roles of Glutathione S-Transferase in Parkinson's disease, providing a comprehensive overview of its importance and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by motor dysfunction due to gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system. Currently, medications such as levodopa preparations, offer only temporary symptomatic relief without preventing neuronal loss or halting disease progression. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a particular type of wolfberry or goji berry, the fruit of Lycium barbarum L., has been historically regarded for its neuroprotective properties, potentially offering therapeutic benefits for PD. However, scientific validation of these effects remains limited.\nThis study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of wolfberry glycopeptide (WGP) on PD progression in various animal models, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for its therapeutic action.\nDiverse canonical animal models, including 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated rats, and \u03b1-synuclein overexpressed hSNCA\nAfter establishing the animal models and administering WGP treatment, PD-like behaviors were assessed using pole test, rotarod test and gait analysis. Dopaminergic neurons loss in the midbrain and striatum was detected by means of immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Inflammatory markers in these brain regions were measured by ELISA.\nWGP treatment significantly alleviated motor deficits as well as progressive dopaminergic neurons loss. Mechanistically, WGP exerted its neuroprotective effects by regulating iron homeostasis, specifically through the modulation of key proteins such as TFRC, FTH1, and FPN. This function contributed to reducing the accumulation of lipid peroxidation in nigrostriatal system, thereby mitigating neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration.\nOur findings underscore the innovative potential of WGP as a neuroprotective agent in PD, with a unique mechanism of action targeting iron homeostasis and lipid peroxidation-driven neurodegeneration. This study advances the understanding of TCM's therapeutic contributions to neurodegeneration and positions WGP as a strong candidate for further clinical development in PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "The lack of patient and public involvement in oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) intervention studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) can bias the choice of outcomes to be measured in these studies. This study aimed to obtain perspectives of individuals living with OD in PD and family members/caregivers on OD intervention outcomes that are important to them. This is part of a larger Core Outcome Set project. A mixed methods study with an international online cross-sectional survey and subsequent focus groups involving people with OD in PD and family members/caregivers was conducted. Survey results were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Intervention outcomes rated most important, significantly different, inconclusive, or identified as missing in the survey were clarified in follow-up focus groups with seven previous survey participants. Focus group data were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed following inductive and deductive content analysis using NVivo. Twelve outcomes were rated as important by\u2009\u2265\u200980% of the 62 survey participants. The most important outcomes were penetration/aspiration and laryngeal sensation. Fear of choking was added as an important but missing intervention outcome. In the focus groups, findings from the survey were validated. Four content categories with eleven sub-categories were identified. OD intervention outcome priorities by people with OD in PD and family members/caregivers show only partial agreement with outcomes measured in published intervention studies on OD in PD. This highlights the importance of stakeholder involvement in the design and implementation of these studies to make findings relevant to all.",

    "abstract": "Sequential working memory refers to the cognitive ability to maintain and/or manipulate a set of ordered representations within a short period. It remains unclear whether sequential working memory is impaired in patients with young onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD).\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the sequential working memory in patients with YOPD.\nSixty-three YOPD patients (29 women) and one hundred age- and education-matched healthy controls participated in three well-established sequential working memory tests. The YOPD patients were\u00a0categorized into akinetic rigid type (PD-ART) and non-akinetic rigid type (PD-NART). Participants were asked to maintain digit sequences in mind in the digit span forward (DST-F) and to maintain and manipulate digit sequences in mind in the digit span backward (DST-B) and adaptive digit ordering tests (DOT-A).\nThe PD-ART group scored lower and had higher ordering costs (difference between the DST-F and DOT-A scores) than the healthy control group in the DOT-A. Moreover, in the PD-ART group, the daily levodopa equivalent dose for dopamine D2/3 receptor agonists positively correlated with the DOT-A score and negatively correlated with the DOT-A ordering cost, suggesting that patients who took a greater dose of dopamine D2/3 receptor agonists tended to have higher DOT-A scores and lower DOT-A ordering costs.\nThese results indicated that the impaired sequential working memory may be one of markers of identifying early cognitive impairment in patients with YOPD, especially in PD-ART patients. The dopamine D2/3 receptor agonists can recover this impairment to some extent.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a highly heterogeneous and therefore a possible cause of translation failure of drugs from animal testing to human treatments can be because existing models cannot replicate the entire spectrum of PD features. One of the theories of the origin of neurodegenerative diseases assumes metabolic dysfunction as a common fundamental thread of disease development. Intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin induces insulin resistance in the brain (Alzheimer's disease animal model). The aim of this project is to examine whether metabolic dysfunction caused by direct application of streptozotocin to brain region affected in PD (striatum) can induce characteristic PD symptoms. Adult male Wistar rats were given streptozotocin bilaterally or unilaterally in striatum. PET scan, cognitive, behavioural and motoric functions were tested one month after administration. Metabolite and protein analysis was done by untargeted metabolomics, ELISA and Western blot. Rats administered bilaterally showed motoric deficit, cognitive deficit of spatial learning and memory, fear conditioned and recognition memory, and anxiety-like behaviour, accompanied by impaired brain glucose uptake and metabolism. The results provide first evidence that bilateral intrastriatal administration of streptozotocin (particularly lower dose) can cause development of the hallmark PD symptoms. As metabolic dysfunction is increasingly associated with PD, an animal model with hypermetabolism in the early-on could be a better PD model for testing diverse therapeutics and the results could be better translated to humans. Further characterization is needed for understanding possible underlying mechanism and development of a new animal model for unique PD endophenotype expressing motoric, cognitive and metabolic symptomatology.",

    "abstract": "Treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) focus on symptom reduction through dopaminergic therapies, without clear evidence of disease-modifying effects. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists may reduce neuroinflammation by decreasing microglia activation in PD. Clinical trials suggest these agents have disease-modifying potential in PD.\nEvaluate the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists in PD.\nPubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GLP-1 agonists for PD, up to July 2024. The risk of bias was assessed using the RoB-2 tool, and statistical analysis was performed with RevMan 5.4.1 software.\nGLP-1 receptor agonists showed a beneficial effect on MDS-UPDRS part III motor scores compared to placebo. Off-medication state, there was a -1.22 point improvement (95%CI -2.46, 0.22; P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). On-medication state, scores improved by -2.52 points (95%CI -4.02, -1.01; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The global MDS-UPDRS score showed a -3.43-point difference (95%CI -6.48, -0.48; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Cognitive performance, assessed via the Mattis DRS-2, improved by 1.32 points (95%CI 0.16, 2.52; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). There were no significant differences in the NMSS (-0,19; 95%IC -3,44, 3,05; P\u00a0=\u00a00.91), in MADRS (-1,04; 95%IC -2,57, 0,48; P\u00a0=\u00a00.18), or PDQ-39 (-0,91; 95%IC -2,22, 0,39; P\u00a0=\u00a00.17).\nGLP-1 receptor agonists improved motor and cognitive performance in PD, suggesting potential symptomatic benefits.

    "abstract": "In recent years, special attention has been paid to highlighting the antiparkinsonian effect of linagliptin. However, the mechanism of its action has not yet been well investigated. The present study aimed to verify the neuroprotective effect of linagliptin in the rotenone model of Parkinson's disease (PD) and further explore its potential molecular mechanisms. Rats were intoxicated with rotenone (2\u00a0mg/kg/day; sc) and treated with linagliptin (10\u00a0\u2009mg/kg/day; po) for 14 consecutive days. The present finding showed that linagliptin ameliorated the histopathological changes of rotenone on substantia nigra and striata. Linagliptin decreased \u03b1-synuclein immunoreactivity along with an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and striatal dopamine content. This was reflected in the marked improvement of the behavior and motor deficits in rotenone-intoxicated rats. On the molecular level, linagliptin upregulated sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/ nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling, reduced ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) protein expression, restored glutathione (GSH) content, and elevated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) level in rats with rotenone intoxication. Moreover, linagliptin inhibited NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)/caspase-1/interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) cascade with subsequent reduction in gasdermin D (GSDMD) expression. Therefore, the present study reveals the ability of linagliptin, through the activation of SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling, to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis and protect against rotenone-induced parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "Disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) are a major unmet need in Parkinson disease (PD). To date, trials investigating DMT candidates in PD most often used a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Unfortunately, RCTs to date have not led to a breakthrough, in part because of the large sample sizes and length of follow-up required. In the interest of testing DMT candidates in a more efficient manner, it may be worthwhile to perform futility trials, which are smaller clinical trials that have originally been developed as phase 2 trials in oncology and more recently been used in progressive multiple sclerosis. In this investigation, we used original, patient-level data from DATATOP and PRECEPT, 2 large RCTs in early PD, to explore the feasibility of using the Simon 2-Stage futility trial design in early PD.\nThis is a post hoc analysis of original, patient-level data from the DATATOP and PRECEPT RCTs in early PD. In our analyses, we use descriptive statistics, survival analysis, and binary logistic regression to explore thresholds of change in the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score as the primary outcome measure, length of follow-up, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and projected sample sizes for Simon 2-Stage futility trials in early PD. We also performed bootstrapping experiments to illustrate the ability of trials using the Simon 2-Stage futility design to identify selegiline as nonfutile and tocopherol as futile.\nPRECEPT included 806 participants (mean age 59.7 years, SD 10.3, 64.4% male), and DATATOP included 800 participants (mean age 61.1 years, SD 9.5, 64.4% male). Our analyses suggest that futility trials using the Simon 2-Stage methodology are feasible in PD. We propose a 5-point worsening on the UPDRS motor score as the primary outcome measure and a length of follow-up of 12 months. Trial simulations based on these data suggest the required sample size for such clinical trials to be lower than 200 participants.\nBased on our analysis of DATATOP and PRECEPT, phase 2 clinical trials using the Simon 2-Stage methodology are feasible in PD and may offer an opportunity to expedite the discovery of promising treatments in early PD.",

    "abstract": "The plant Cissus tuberosa Moc is abundant in phenolics, has been documented to have neuroprotective properties. The study seeks to determine the neuroprotective effects of C. tuberosa ethanolic extract (CTE) against Parkinson's disease by evaluating its impact on motor dysfunction, cognitive deficits, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration in paraquat-induced Parkinson's disease models. The research hypothesizes that CTE can modulate key biomarkers involved in Parkinson's pathology, including \u03b1-synuclein, interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), assessed through qRT-PCR, as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-\u03b1, evaluated through ELISA. Parkinson disease was induced by using paraquat intraperitoneally. The study was designed by considering various groups with their respective treatments, control group treated normally, disease control receiving paraquat (1 mg/kg, i.p.), standard treated grabbed with (levodopa+carbidopa), and three treatment groups received plant extract (150, 300, 600 mg/kg) respectively for 21 days study period. Both behavioral, and biochemical analysis were performed. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of several phenolic compounds. CTE significantly improved motor function and cognitive performance in rats, showing a dose-dependent reduction in paraquat-induced neurotoxicity (150 < 300 < 600 mg/kg, P<0.001). CTE significantly restored antioxidant enzyme levels (P<0.001), contributing to the alleviation of oxidative stress. Neurotransmitter levels were significantly improved in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.001), while acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels were significantly reduced (P<0.001). CTE treatment showed significant restoration of brain tissue, reducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, thereby preserving normal brain structure. ELISA testing demonstrated a significant (P<0.001) downregulation of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in CTE-treated groups. qRT-PCR results showed significant downregulation of \u03b1-synuclein, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression in CTE-treated groups compared to the diseased group, suggesting neuroprotective effects. The study concludes that CTE has potential therapeutic effects in alleviating Parkinson's disease symptoms, primarily through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety is a prevalent symptom of Parkinson's disease, but is often under-recognised and challenging to characterise. The present study aimed to develop a comprehensive new scale that characterised the specific and nuanced experience of anxiety in people living with Parkinson's disease. A shortened version of the scale was also developed. The psychometric properties of both versions of the scale were assessed for reliability and validity.\nSecondary analyses were conducted on data from 254 people with Parkinson's disease and anxiety collected in a modified Nominal Group Technique ranking survey. Secondary analyses included exploratory factor analysis, reliability and validity analyses, and confirmatory factor analysis.\nA standardised scale of anxiety and Parkinson's disease, in its long Comprehensive Anxiety and Parkinson's Scale - 54 (CAPS-54) and short versions (CAPS-24), was developed. Reliability and validity analyses of the scales demonstrated excellent factorial and internal consistency, as well as good convergent validity.\nThe CAP Scales offer researchers and clinicians a more comprehensive means of assessing the experience of anxiety in the context of Parkinson's disease than is currently available. Initial validation of the scales is promising. Future validation and identification of clinical boundaries with an independent sample is recommended.\nAnxiety is a prevalent but under-recognised symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease; current assessment measures focus on common anxiety presentations.The Comprehensive Anxiety and Parkinson\u2019s Scales (CAP-54 and CAP-24) offer a more comprehensive means of assessing the experience of anxiety in the context of Parkinson\u2019s disease than is currently available.Using the CAP Scales may allow therapists to better tailor their interventions to the specific form of anxiety that their patients with Parkinson\u2019s may experience.",

    "abstract": "The application of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as vehicles for anti-Parkinson's agents represents a significant advance, yet their clinical translation is hampered by challenges in efficient brain delivery and complex blood-brain barrier (BBB) targeting strategies. In this study, we engineered dopamine onto the surface of adipose-derived stem cell EVs (Dopa-EVs) utilizing a facile, two-step cross-linking approach. This engineering enhanced neuronal uptake of the EVs in primary neurons and neuroblastoma cells, a process shown to be competitively inhibited by dopamine pretreatment and dopamine receptor antibodies. Notably, Dopa-EVs demonstrated increased brain accumulation in mouse Parkinson's disease (PD) models. Therapeutically, Dopa-EVs administration led to the rescue of dopaminergic neuronal loss and amelioration of behavioural deficits in both 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and \u03b1-Syn PFF-induced PD models. Furthermore, we observed that Dopa-EVs stimulated autophagy evidenced by the upregulation of Beclin-1 and LC3-II. These findings collectively indicate that surface modification of EVs with dopamine presents a potent strategy for targeting dopaminergic neurons in the brain. The remarkable therapeutic potential of Dopa-EVs, demonstrated in PD models, positions them as a highly promising candidate for PD treatment, offering a significant advance over current therapeutic modalities.",
