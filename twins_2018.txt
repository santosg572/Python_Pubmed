    "abstract": "What impact does formal punishment have on antisocial conduct-does it deter or promote it? The findings from a long line of research on the labeling tradition indicate formal punishments have the opposite-of-intended consequence of promoting future misbehavior. In another body of work, the results show support for deterrence-based hypotheses that punishment deters future misbehavior. So, which is it? We draw on a nationally representative sample of British adolescent twins from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study to perform a robust test of the deterrence versus labeling question. We leverage a powerful research design in which twins can serve as the counterfactual for their co-twin, thereby ruling out many sources of confounding that have likely impacted prior studies. The pattern of findings provides support for labeling theory, showing that contact with the justice system-through spending a night in jail/prison, being issued an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO), or having an official record-promotes delinquency. We conclude by discussing the impact these findings may have on criminologists' and practitioners' perspective on the role of the juvenile justice system in society.",

    "abstract": "The fetal period has a critical and long-lasting impact on the regulation of metabolic processes and a life-long predisposition for obesity and metabolic syndrome. The exact mechanisms are unknown, but epigenetic regulation likely plays a major role. Twins represent an excellent model to study these mechanisms, as they share the same intrauterine environment and similar or even the same genetic information. We examined cord blood levels of adipocyte fatty-acid binding protein 4 (A-FABP or FABP4), a novel adipokine correlated with obesity and metabolic disease in children and adults.\nTo examine A-FABP levels in the cord blood of twins with concordant and discordant growth and in singletons with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).\nCohort study of 36 twin pairs (25 growth concordant and 11 growth discordant), and 42 singleton pregnancies (28 IUGR and 13 normally grown controls, 1 HELLP).\nCord blood A-FABP levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nA-FABP levels were higher in the smaller of growth discordant dichorionic (DC) twins versus their co-twins (109.46\u2005\u00b1\u200562.80 ng/mL vs. 72.93\u2005\u00b1\u200536.66 ng/mL, \nIncreased A-FABP levels might be associated with an increased metabolic risk in growth-restricted (twins) and prematurely born infants.",

    "abstract": "Does fetal reduction of triplet pregnancies to singleton result in superior obstetric and neonatal outcomes compared with triplets reduced to twins?\nA historical cohort study including 285 trichorionic and dichorionic triplet pregnancies that underwent abdominal fetal reduction at 11-14 weeks in a single tertiary referral centre. The study population comprised two groups: reduction to twins (n\u202f=\u202f223) and singletons (n\u202f=\u202f62). Main outcome measures were rates of pregnancy complications, preterm delivery and neonatal outcomes. Non-parametric statistical methods were employed.\nTriplet pregnancies reduced to twins delivered earlier (36 versus 39 weeks, P < 0.001) with higher prevalence of Caesarean section (71.1% versus 32.2%, P < 0.001) compared with triplets reduced to singletons. Preterm delivery rates were significantly higher in twins compared with singletons prior to 37 weeks (56.9% versus 13.6%, P < 0.001), 34 weeks (20.2% versus 3.4%, P\u202f=\u202f0.002) and 32 weeks (9.6% versus 0%, P\u202f=\u202f0.01). No significant difference was found in the rate of pregnancy loss before 24 weeks (1.3% in twins versus 4.8% in singletons, P\u202f=\u202f0.12) or in the rate of intrauterine fetal death after 24 weeks (0.4% versus 0%, P\u202f=\u202f1.0). Both groups had comparable obstetrical complications and neonatal outcomes, except for higher rates of neonatal intensive care unit admission in twins (31.9% versus 6.8%, P < 0.001).\nReduction of triplets to singletons rather than twins resulted in superior obstetric outcomes without increasing the procedure-related complications. However, because the rate of extreme prematurity in pregnancies reduced to twins was low, the overall outcome of those pregnancies was favourable. Therefore, the option of reduction to singletons should be considered in cases where the risk of prematurity seems exceptionally high.",

In this article we are reporting a case of conjoined twins diagnosed in our department. During a examination in the XXI week of gestation, a 24 years old woman, with the presence of labial herpes simplex following an ultrasound examination was suspected of carrying conjoined twins. To confirm, we performed prenatal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which proved the existence of cephalothoracoomphalopagus.",

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopment is sensitive to genetic and pre/postnatal environmental influences. These effects are likely mediated by epigenetic factors, yet current knowledge is limited. Longitudinal twin studies can delineate the link between genetic and environmental factors, epigenetic state at birth and neurodevelopment later in childhood. Building upon our study of the Peri/postnatal Epigenetic Twin Study (PETS) from gestation to 6 years of age, here we describe the PETS 11-year follow-up in which we will use neuroimaging and cognitive testing to examine the relationship between early-life environment, epigenetics and neurocognitive outcomes in mid-childhood. Using a within-pair twin model, the primary aims are to (1) identify early-life epigenetic correlates of neurocognitive outcomes; (2) determine the developmental stability of epigenetic effects and (3) identify modifiable environmental risk factors. Secondary aims are to identify factors influencing gut microbiota between 6 and 11 years of age to investigate links between gut microbiota and neurodevelopmental outcomes in mid-childhood. Approximately 210 twin pairs will undergo an assessment at 11 years of age. This includes a direct child cognitive assessment, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging, biological sampling, anthropometric measurements and a range of questionnaires on health and development, behavior, dietary habits and sleeping patterns. Data from complementary data sources, including the National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy and the Australian Early Development Census, will also be sought. Following on from our previous focus on relationships between growth, cardiovascular health and oral health, this next phase of PETS will significantly advance our understanding of the environmental interactions that shape the developing brain.",

The focus is on Dorothy Burlingham's (1952; Twins: A study of three sets of identical twins with 30 charts. London, UK: Imago) classic, in-depth study of three identical twin-pairs. Implications for how twins are raised currently will be examined. Reviews are presented of twin research concerning monozygotic twins with maturity-onset diabetes, gene editing of fetal Chinese twins, educational disadvantage of early-born twins, and developmental trajectories of twins' prenatal movements. Some unusual experiences and situations involving twins that warrant media attention are also summarized. They include twins with nearly identical license plates, a rare case of fetus-in-fetu, twin brothers killed at Pearl Harbor, the death of a 96-year-old twin Holocaust survivor, the accidental death of male-female twin toddlers in a heated car and confusion over identical twin politicians.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are one of the main tools for studying the interaction between genes and the environment in the development of complex diseases such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The Isfahan Twin Registry (ITR) was launched in Isfahan in 2017 as a pilot study to establish a nationwide twin registry in Iran and aims to obtain comprehensive information about complex diseases and their risk factors from twins and multiples living in Isfahan. ITR will continue to recruit twins and multiples until all twins residing in Isfahan are registered in the registry. Twins are identified from welfare agencies, public health homes, maternity hospitals, Persian Twins Association and the local media. Demographic information, twin similarities, lifestyle, family history of diseases and past medical history are collected using validated questionnaires. Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure are measured by health professionals. Hematology panel, fasting blood sugar, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and quantitative C-reactive protein are measured by an automated analyzer. Extra samples are obtained for future studies. For twins aged under 6 years, parents complete the questionnaires for their children and a brief questionnaire for themselves. Currently, 998 persons (395 pairs and 67 multiples) are registered in the ITR and have provided their data. Results of preliminary data analysis are discussed in this article. We plan to carry out longitudinal assessments. ITR can play an important role in future epigenetic, biomarkers and omics studies using the biobank materials.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy is associated with increased coarctation-associated complications. We report the successful management of emergency lower-segment cesarean delivery in a patient with coarctation of aorta. A parturient at 34 weeks of gestation of a twin pregnancy with uncorrected coarctation of aorta was taken for emergency lower-segment cesarean delivery to be performed using epidural anesthesia. A mixture of lignocaine (lidocaine), bupivacaine, and fentanyl was administered epidurally. In view of unsatisfactory motor action, general anesthesia had to be administered. However, because of sufficient analgesia due to the epidural drugs, optimal hemodynamic control was achieved. A combination of general and epidural anesthesia minimizes adverse effects of coarctation of aorta, with improved maternal and fetal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To establish the changes in perinatal morbidity and mortality in twin pregnancies in Finland, a retrospective register research was conducted. Our extensive data from a 28-year study period provide important information on the outcome of twin pregnancies in Finland that has previously not been reported to this extent.\nAll 23,498 twin pregnancies with 46,996 children born in Finland during 1987-2014 were included in the study. Data were gathered from the Medical Birth Register and the Hospital Discharge Register (Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Finland) regarding perinatal mortality (PNM) and morbidity. For statistical analysis, binomial regression analysis and crosstabs were performed. The results are expressed in means, percentages and ranges with comparison to singletons when appropriate. Odds ratios from binomial regression analysis are reported. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThere were 46,363 liveborn and 633 stillborn twins in Finland during 1987-2014. Perinatal mortality decreased markedly, from 45.1 to 6.5 per 1000 for twin A and from 54.1 to 11.9 per 1000 for twin B during the study period. Yet, the PNM difference between twin A and B remained. Early neonatal mortality did not differ between twins, but has decreased in both. Asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, need for antibiotics and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) stay were markedly more common in twin B.\nIn Finland, PNM and early neonatal mortality in twins decreased significantly during 1987-2014 and are nowadays very low. However, twin B still faces more complications. The outline provided may be used to further improve the monitoring and thus perinatal outcome of twins, especially twin B.",

    "abstract": "Seventeen-day-old twins were hospitalized for neonatal herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) with central nervous system disease and internal capsule and thalamic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They were treated with the usual intravenous (IV) treatment and oral therapy for 6 months. The clinical course was good in both children with negative HSV polymerase chain reaction on completion of IV therapy. The neurological condition recurred in one child with new radiological lesions at 7 months of age, 2 weeks after discontinuation of oral treatment. Cerebral lesions highlighted on the MRI scan are specific to the neonatal period and impact long-term prognosis. The likely genetic predisposition in this case is interesting and requires further investigation. In addition, this case raises questions about the duration of oral acyclovir suppressive therapy.",

    "abstract": "The T cell repertoire in each individual includes T cell receptors (TCRs) of enormous sequence diversity through the pairing of diverse TCR \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains, each generated by somatic recombination of paralogous gene segments. Whether the TCR repertoire contributes to susceptibility to infectious or autoimmune diseases in concert with disease-associated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) polymorphisms is unknown. Due to a lack in high-throughput technologies to sequence TCR \u03b1-\u03b2 pairs, current studies on whether the TCR repertoire is shaped by host genetics have so far relied only on single-chain analysis. Using a high-throughput single T cell sequencing technology, we obtained the largest paired TCR\u03b1\u03b2 dataset so far, comprising 965,523 clonotypes from 15 healthy individuals including 6 monozygotic twin pairs. Public TCR \u03b1- and, to a lesser extent, TCR \u03b2-chain sequences were common in all individuals. In contrast, sharing of entirely identical TCR\u03b1\u03b2 amino acid sequences was very infrequent in unrelated individuals, but highly increased in twins, in particular in CD4 memory T cells. Based on nucleotide sequence identity, a subset of these shared clonotypes appeared to be the progeny of T cells that had been generated during fetal development and had persisted for more than 50 y. Additional shared TCR\u03b1\u03b2 in twins were encoded by different nucleotide sequences, implying that genetic determinants impose structural constraints on thymic selection that favor the selection of TCR \u03b1-\u03b2 pairs with entire sequence identities.",

    "abstract": "We estimated the incidence of CH in twins, analyse the clinical features of CH cases in twins and further evaluate the CH screening strategy and recall procedures for twins.\nA retrospective investigation of the screening results and confirmed cases in 724,791 newborns was conducted from 2015 to 2017 in Guangzhou. Clinical features were compared between twins with CH and singletons with CH. In addition, the twins were further divided into same-sex twins and different-sex twins to analyse the characteristics and incidence of CH and to compare differences in the confirmed cases in the 2 groups.\nThe incidence of CH in same-sex twins was 1/593, which was much higher than the incidence of CH in singletons (1/1323) and different-sex twins (1/3060). Of the 20 twins diagnosed with CH, 17 were same-sex twins and 3 were different-sex twins. Among the six pairs of same-sex twins with CH, four had TSH inconsistency, which reached 67%. Eight of the 17 cases of same-sex twins diagnosed with CH had negative results at the first screening.\nDistinguishing same-sex twins from different-sex twins during newborn screening is more feasible. The incidence of CH in same-sex twins is much higher than that in the general population and the risk of transient CH is relatively high. In positive cases in same-sex twins, the simultaneous recall of the twin can effectively avoid a missed diagnosis. The screening center should properly evaluate the recall strategy and screening procedure for twins, especially twins of the same-sex.",

Possible correlation among other attributes such as breastfeeding, socioeconomic status, oral habits, frequency of brushing, and sweet intake were also assessed.\nA sample of 40 monozygotic children between the age group of 6 and 12 was selected. The parents were asked to complete the questionnaire and report with their children. Then dental examinations were carried out and the prevalence of dental caries among the twins were assessed.\nAmong the total samples, 61.5% exhibited caries. Lower birth weight twins showed an increased chance of caries (72.22%), compared to higher birth weight twins (68.18%). Second of the twins had an increased risk of dental caries (70%) compared to the first (60%). 90% of the male twins and 45% of the female twins had caries. The association between dental caries and other variables were also assessed; those who were exclusively breastfed had an increased risk (70%) of caries. Evaluation of socioeconomic status and caries revealed a risk of for the high (65%), middle (62.5%), and lower groups (58.33%). Children without oral habits showed a higher prevalence (73.3%) of caries when compared to those without any habits (50%). It was noticed that the brushing frequency is not related to the severity of caries. The strongest association was noticed between excessive sweet liking and prevalence of dental caries.\nThe study revealed difference in caries prevalence among monozygotic twins in relation to birth weight, birth order, and gender. It was found that variations in caries prevalence existed with other attributes also.\nZarina R, Kuriakose S, ",

    "abstract": "Intussusception, a common cause of intestinal obstruction in children, typically requires medical reduction. Here, we describe the case of a pair of twins who had simultaneous intussusception and were positive for fecal adenovirus-strongly indicating that adenovirus infection may be a main cause of the intussusception.\nTwo 1-year-old twin girls were brought to Cathay General Hospital one after another on the same day. Both presented with intermittent abdominal pain, abdominal distension, diarrhea, and loss of appetite.\nTheir laboratory data were adenovirus positivity in rectal swab culture. Intussusception was diagnosed through a lower gastrointestinal series.\nThe twins were treated with reduction for intussusception.\nBoth patients recovered well, without recurrence.\nMost cases of intussusception are idiopathic. However, some potential risk factors-as strongly suggested by the current cases-are genetic factors and adenovirus infection.",

    "abstract": "Despite being developed from one zygote, heterokaryotypic monozygotic (MZ) co-twins exhibit discordant karyotypes. Epigenomic studies in biological samples from heterokaryotypic MZ co-twins are of the most significant value for assessing the effects on gene- and allele-specific expression of an extranumerary chromosomal copy or structural chromosomal disparities in otherwise nearly identical germline genetic contributions. Here, we use RNA-Seq data from existing repositories to establish within-pair correlations for the breadth and magnitude of allele-specific expression (ASE) in heterokaryotypic MZ co-twins discordant for trisomy 21 and maternal 21q inheritance, as well as homokaryotypic co-twins. We show that there is a genome-wide disparity at ASE sites between the heterokaryotypic MZ co-twins. Although most of the disparity corresponds to changes in the magnitude of biallelic imbalance, ASE sites switching from either strictly monoallelic to biallelic imbalance or the reverse occur in few genes that are known or predicted to be imprinted, subject to X-chromosome inactivation or A-to-I(G) RNA edited. We also uncovered comparable ASE differences between homokaryotypic MZ twins. The extent of ASE discordance in MZ twins (2.7%) was about 10-fold lower than the expected between pairs of unrelated, non-twin males or females. The results indicate that the observed within-pair dissimilarities in breadth and magnitude of ASE sites in the heterokaryotypic MZ co-twins could not solely be attributable to the aneuploidy and the missing allelic heritability at 21q.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that many psychiatric disorders etiologically represent the extreme end of dimensionally distributed features rather than distinct entities. The extent to which this applies to eating disorders (EDs) is unknown.\nWe investigated if there is similar etiology in (a) the continuous distribution of the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2), (b) the extremes of EDI-2 score, and (c) registered ED diagnoses, in 1481 female twin pairs at age 18 years (born 1992-1999). EDI-2 scores were self-reported at age 18. ED diagnoses were identified through the Swedish National Patient Register, parent-reported treatment and/or self-reported purging behavior of a frequency and duration consistent with DSM-IV criteria. We differentiated between anorexia nervosa (AN) and other EDs.\nThe heritability of the EDI-2 score was 0.65 (95% CI 0.61-0.68). The group heritabilities in DeFries-Fulker extremes analyses were consistent over different percentile-based extreme groups [0.59 (95% CI 0.37-0.81) to 0.65 (95% CI 0.55-0.75)]. Similarly, the heritabilities in liability threshold models were consistent over different levels of severity. In joint categorical-continuous models, the twin-based genetic correlation was 0.52 (95% CI 0.39-0.65) between EDI-2 score and diagnoses of other EDs, and 0.26 (95% CI 0.08-0.42) between EDI-2 score and diagnoses of AN. The non-shared environmental correlations were 0.52 (95% CI 0.32-0.70) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.38-0.79), respectively.\nOur findings suggest that some EDs can partly be conceptualized as the extreme manifestation of continuously distributed ED features. AN, however, might be more distinctly genetically demarcated from ED features in the general population than other EDs.",

    "abstract": "The INO80 family of chromatin remodellers are multisubunit complexes that perform a variety of tasks on nucleosomes. Family members are built around a heterohexamer of RuvB-like protein, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase,nuclear actin and actin-related proteins, and a few complex-specific subunits. They modify chromatin in a number of ways including nucleosome sliding and exchange of variant histones. Recent structural information on INO80 and SWR1 complexes has revealed similarities in the basic architecture of the complexes. However, structural and biochemical data on the complexes bound to nucleosomes reveal these similarities to be somewhat superficial and their biochemical activities and mechanisms are very different. Consequently, the INO80 family displays a surprising diversity of function that is based upon a similar structural framework.",

    "abstract": "It is well-established that the prenatal period is a critical and sensitive period of an individual's life, linking prenatal circumstances to short- and long-term outcomes such as infant mortality, educational and occupational success. However, little is known about how prenatal nurture affects intermediate outcomes and noncognitive characteristics such as behavior and behavioral problems. In this paper, I investigate the effects of birth weight on behavioral problems at age 12. I comprehensively control for confounders related to family background and genetics by employing a research design exploiting differences among Danish monozygotic twins. I find that birth weight has a statistically significant negative effect on behavioral problems measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and that birth weight affects boys and girls differently: birth weight is significantly negatively associated with emotional problems among girls and hyperactivity among boys.",

    "abstract": "Twins are considered to be at an increased risk for perinatal mortality and morbidities, but it is unclear whether preterm twins are at an increased risk for poor developmental outcomes when compared to preterm singletons. Our aim was to compare the neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm twins vs singletons at 5 years of age.\nVery low birth weight and very low gestational age infants (twins n\u2009=\u200966, singletons n\u2009=\u2009157) were recruited as a part of the PIPARI project in the Turku University Hospital, covering a regional population. Cognitive development, neuropsychological performance, and neurodevelopmental impairments (including cerebral palsy, hearing deficit, visual impairment, and intellectual disability) were evaluated at 5 years of age.\nTwins and singletons had otherwise similar perinatal background factors, except for the higher proportion of preterm rupture of membranes in singletons. Twins had cognitive and neuropsychological outcomes that were otherwise comparable with singletons, but they had a slightly lower verbal intelligence quotient (estimate -5.81, 95% CI -11.14 to -0.48, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Being a twin was not a risk for neurodevelopmental impairments.\nOur study shows that, contrary to a common hypothesis, the overall neurodevelopment of very preterm twins does not significantly differ from that of preterm singletons.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal diagnoses (MSD) are one of the largest diagnostic groups for disability pensions (DP). This study investigated the associations between life events and DP due to MSD, considering sociodemographic, health, and familial factors.\nThe study sample included 18,530 Finnish twins, 24-64\u00a0years old at baseline, who responded to a questionnaire in 1981 including a 21-item life event inventory. Information on DP with diagnosis codes (ICD codes: M00-M99) were obtained from the official national pension registers. Life events were divided into family- and work-related events. \"Positive change in life\" was analyzed separately. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nDuring the follow-up of 23\u00a0years, 1273 (7%) individuals were granted DP due to MSD. In discordant pair analysis, family-related events (\u2265\u20094 events) increased (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.31, 2.03) and the absence of such events decreased (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48, 0.95) the risk of DP due to MSD. For work-related events (\u2265\u20093 events), the risk estimates were non-significant when controlling for familial factors. Having had a positive change in life decreased the risk of DP due to MSD (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65, 0.96) while controlling for familial confounding, but were non-significant in the full model controlling for various covariates (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75, 1.12).\nThe associations between life events and the risk of DP due to MSD are complex and potentially affected by familial and other confounding factors including sociodemographics and health.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins provide a unique opportunity to better understand complex genetic diseases and the relative contribution of heritable factors in shaping the immune system throughout life. Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorders (CVID) are primary antibody defects displaying wide phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, with monogenic transmission accounting for only a minority of the cases. Here, we report a pair of monozygotic twins concordant for CVID without a family history of primary immunodeficiency. They featured a remarkably similar profile of clinical manifestations and immunological alterations at diagnosis (established at age 37) and along the subsequent 15 years of follow-up. Interestingly, whole-exome sequencing failed to identify a monogenic cause for CVID, but unraveled a combination of heterozygous variants, with a predicted deleterious impact. These variants were found in genes involved in relevant immunological pathways, such as ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. In most cases, the development of the disease is sporadic and is not associated with any currently known mutations associated with PD. It is believed that changes associated with the epigenetic regulation of gene expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The study of individuals with an almost identical genetic background, such as monozygotic twins, is one of the best approaches to the analysis of such changes. A whole-transcriptome analysis of dermal fibroblasts obtained from three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PD was carried out in this work. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes were identified in the three pairs of twins. These genes were included in seven processes within two clusters, according to the results of an enrichment analysis. The cluster with the greatest statistical significance included processes associated with the regulation of the differentiation of fat cells, the action potential, and the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The most significant genes, which occupied a central position in this cluster, were PTGS2, SCN9A, and GRIK2. These genes can be considered as potential candidate genes for PD.",

    "abstract": "The Louisville Twin Study (LTS) began in 1958 and became a premier longitudinal twin study of cognitive development. The LTS continuously collected data from twins through 2000 after which the study closed indefinitely due to lack of funding. Now that the majority of the sample is age 40 or older (61.36%, N\u2009=\u20091770), the LTS childhood data can be linked to midlife cognitive functioning, among other physical, biological, social, and psychiatric outcomes. We report results from two pilot studies in anticipation of beginning the midlife phase of the LTS. The first pilot study was a participant tracking study, in which we showed that approximately 90% of the Louisville families randomly sampled (N\u2009=\u2009203) for the study could be found. The second pilot study consisted of 40 in-person interviews in which twins completed cognitive, memory, biometric, and functional ability measures. The main purpose of the second study was to correlate midlife measures of cognitive functioning to a measure of biological age, which is an alternative index to chronological age that quantifies age as a function of the breakdown of structural and functional physiological systems, and then to relate both of these measures to twins' cognitive developmental trajectories. Midlife IQ was uncorrelated with biological age (-\u2009.01) while better scores on episodic memory more strongly correlated with lower biological age (-\u2009.19 to -\u2009.31). As expected, midlife IQ positively correlated with IQ measures collected throughout childhood and adolescence. Additionally, positive linear rates of change in FSIQ scores in childhood significantly correlated with biological age (-\u2009.68), physical functioning (.71), and functional ability (-\u2009.55), suggesting that cognitive development predicts lower biological age, better physical functioning, and better functional ability. In sum, the Louisville twins can be relocated to investigate whether and how early and midlife cognitive and physical health factors contribute to cognitive aging.",

    "abstract": "Recent pulmonary functional MRI findings of spatially and temporally persistent ventilation abnormalities in patients with asthma contrast with previous in\u00a0silico modeling studies that suggest that in asthma, ventilation defects may be randomly distributed. In a case study that used pulmonary MRI, CT imaging, and pulmonary function tests, we prospectively evaluated over the course of 7 years, nonidentical female adult twins, each with a lifelong history of asthma. We evaluated pulmonary function and MRI ventilation heterogeneity at baseline and follow-up after 7 years. In both twins, there was a spatially identical MRI ventilation defect and an abnormal subsegmental left-sided upper lobe airway that persisted in the same spatial location after 7 years. If ventilation defects are randomly distributed, this bears a probability of approximately one per 130,000 people. Our MRI observations in related patients with asthma suggest that ventilation abnormalities may not be randomly distributed in patients with asthma and persist distal to airway abnormalities for long periods of time.",

Our objective was to identify factors related to successful delayed delivery of the second twin, among cases in which the interval after delivery of the first twin was above 24h.\nA descriptive, retrospective and multicenter study of all delayed interval deliveries in dichorionic twins in 4 perinatal centers in Paris over a 14-year period.\nIn 13 cases of delayed interval delivery, delivery of twin 1 was at a median of 18 weeks' gestation (range 14WG+2days to 24WG), and none survived. Delivery of the second twin occurred at a median of 25 weeks' gestation +3 days, 51 days after twin 1 (range 13-138 days). Seven of the 13s twins (54 %) survived. There were 5 cases of chorioamnionitis and 1 case of maternal disseminated intravascular coagulation. Poor outcome was not significantly associated with the gestational age, presentation for PPROM or inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and white blood cell count) at the time of delivery of twin 1.\nDelayed-interval delivery of the second twin may prolong pregnancy and lead the second twin child to a viable term of birth; but carries a risk of maternal complications.",

    "abstract": "To construct monochorionic (MC) twin-specific longitudinal Doppler references for umbilical artery pulsatility index (UA-PI), middle cerebral artery (MCA) PI and peak systolic velocity (PSV) and ductus venosus (DV) PI derived from a strictly selected cohort of uncomplicated MC twins. The secondary aim of the study was to compare our findings with singleton reference charts.\nA retrospective evaluation was made of all consecutive uncomplicated MC twin pregnancies referred to our Unit from 2010 to 2018. Fortnightly serial examinations were performed of UA-PI, MCA-PI, MCA-PSV and DV-PI, according with the clinical protocol, from 20 to 37 weeks of gestation. We included cases with at least four ultrasound examinations, delivery at our hospital and complete neonatal follow up. A two-step method was used to trace the estimated centile curves: estimation of the median was performed with appropriate fractional polynomials by a multilevel model and estimation of the external centiles through the residuals (quantile regression). The comparison with singletons was made by plotting the references derived from the present study on the referred charts commonly used for singletons.\nThe study group comprised 150 uncomplicated MC twin pairs. Estimated centiles (3rd, 5th, 10th, 50th, 90th, 95th, 97th) of UA-PI, MCA-PI, MCA-PSV and DV-PI in function of the gestational age are presented. The comparison with singletons showed substantial differences, with higher UA-PI and lower MCA-PI and PSV median values in MC twins. Median DV PI values were similar to the values for singletons, while the upper centiles were higher in MC twins.\nThis study sets out MC twin-specific longitudinal references for UA-PI, MCA-PI, MCA-PSV and DV-PI derived from the largest series of uncomplicated MC twin pregnancies presently available. The comparison with singleton reference values underscores the deviation from physiology that is intrinsic to these unique pregnancies and supports the need for MC twin-specific charts.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. Recent studies demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in the development of congenital heart defects (CHD). In this study, we aimed at identifying the specific patterns of miRNAs in blood of monozygotic twin pairs discordant for CHD and to assess whether miRNAs might be involved in the development or reflect the consequences of CHD.\nmiRNA microarray analysis and Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were employed to determine the miRNA abundance level from 12 monozygotic twins discordant for CHD and their non-CHD co-twins (n = 12). Enrichment analyses of altered miRNAs were performed using bioinformatics tools.\nCompared with non-CHD co-twins, profiling analysis indicated 34 miRNAs with a significant difference in abundance level (p<0.05, fold change \u2265 1.3), of which 11 miRNAs were up-regulated and 23 miRNAs were down-regulated. Seven miRNAs were validated with RT-qPCR including miR-511-3p, miR-1306-5p, miR-421, miR-4707-3p, miR-4732-3p, miR-5189-3p, and miR-890, and the results were consistent with microarray analysis. Five miRNAs namely miR-511-3p, miR-1306-5p, miR-4732-3p, miR-5189-3p, and miR-890 were found to be significantly up-regulated in twins < 10 years old. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the 7 validated miRNAs were involved in phosphatidylinositol signaling, gap junction signaling, and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes.\nOur data show deregulated miRNA abundance levels in the peripheral blood of monozygotic twins discordant for CHD, and identify new candidates for further analysis, which may contribute to understanding the development of CHD in the future. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the target genes of these miRNAs are likely involved in signaling and communication of cardiomyocytes.",

    "abstract": "Given the increasing realization of the important functions of the gut microbial community in human health, it is important to determine whether the increased age of the host coupled with inevitable environmental changes can alter the stability of individual microbial strains of the gut microbial community. Since early studies demonstrated that pairs of twins possess the related gut microbial communities, to gain insights into the temporal stability of the reservoir of gut microbial strains in humans, we have assessed the strain relatedness of samples from two previously published data sets that were obtained from twin children and adults (36-80 years old) who have been either living together or apart for different times.\nWe analyzed the two data sets; twin children (n = 24) and adults (n = 50) using our previously developed strain-tracking program called Window-based Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) Similarity (WSS) that can distinguish a related strain pair from a non-related strain pair based on the overall genome-wide SNV similarity. To independently substantiate the identification of distinct microbial genomic variants (herein strains) observed from WSS analysis, we used analysis by StrainPhlAn.\nAnalysis of the twin children data set revealed a significantly (P-value <0.05) higher number of the shared strain pairs with a predominance of Bacteroides vulgatus between individual sets of twin pairs than the twin adult data set. Additional analysis on the adult twins showed that twins who have been living apart less than 10 years shared significantly more related strain pairs than twins living apart between 10 to 60 years. Eighty-year-old twins who had been living together for 79 years then separated for 1 year showed the highest number of related strain pairs consisting of B. vulgatus, Eubacterium eligens, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. The next highest number of related strain pairs was found in 56-year-old twins who had been living together for 51 years then separated for 5 years (B. vulgatus and Coprococcus eutactus as related strains), 73-year-old twins living together for 66 years and then separated for 7 years (Bacteroides uniformis and Clostrium sp. L2-50 as related strains) and 36-year-old twins separated for 19 years (shared strains of Alistipes shahii and E. eligens). Finally, a sporadic appearance of a single shared strain that did not show a correlation with time of separation was observed in three twin sets that had separation times between 22 to 54 years.\nWe conclude from our strain-tracking analysis of twins that certain gut microbial strains can be shared between individuals in some cases for decades. Changes in the host environmental conditions over time can impact the stability landscape of the gut microbial community resulting in the appearance of new strains that could potentially impact microbe interactions that are essential for function in human health.",

    "results": "Analysis of the twin children data set revealed a significantly (P-value <0.05) higher number of the shared strain pairs with a predominance of Bacteroides vulgatus between individual sets of twin pairs than the twin adult data set. Additional analysis on the adult twins showed that twins who have been living apart less than 10 years shared significantly more related strain pairs than twins living apart between 10 to 60 years. Eighty-year-old twins who had been living together for 79 years then separated for 1 year showed the highest number of related strain pairs consisting of B. vulgatus, Eubacterium eligens, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. The next highest number of related strain pairs was found in 56-year-old twins who had been living together for 51 years then separated for 5 years (B. vulgatus and Coprococcus eutactus as related strains), 73-year-old twins living together for 66 years and then separated for 7 years (Bacteroides uniformis and Clostrium sp. L2-50 as related strains) and 36-year-old twins separated for 19 years (shared strains of Alistipes shahii and E. eligens). Finally, a sporadic appearance of a single shared strain that did not show a correlation with time of separation was observed in three twin sets that had separation times between 22 to 54 years.",

    "abstract": "There is an important interplay between epigenetic factors and body weight, and previous work has identified ten sites where DNA methylation is robustly associated with body mass index (BMI) cross-sectionally. However, interpretation of the associations is complicated by the substantial changes in BMI often occurring in late-life, and the fact that methylation is often driven by genetic variation. This study therefore investigated the longitudinal association between these ten sites and BMI from midlife to late-life, and whether associations persist after controlling for genetic factors.\nWe used data from 535 individuals (mean age 68) in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) with longitudinal measures of both DNA methylation from blood samples and BMI, spanning up to 20 years. Methylation levels were measured with the Infinium Human Methylation 450K or Infinium MethylationEpic array, with seven of the ten sites passing quality control. Latent growth curve models were applied to investigate longitudinal associations between methylation and BMI, and between-within models to study associations within twin pairs, thus adjusting for genetic factors.\nBaseline DNA methylation levels at five of the seven sites were associated with BMI level at age 65 (cg00574958 [CPT1A]; cg11024682 [SREBF1]), and/or change (cg06192883 [MYO5C]; cg06946797 [RMI2]; cg08857797 [VPS25]). For four of the five sites, the associations remained comparable within twin pairs. However, the effects of cg06192883 were substantially attenuated within pairs. No change in DNA methylation was detected for any of the seven evaluated sites.\nFive of the seven sites investigated were associated with late-life level and/or change in BMI. The effects for four of the sites remained similar when examined within twin pairs, indicating that the associations are mainly environmentally driven. However, the substantial attenuation in the association between cg06192883 and late-life BMI within pairs points to the importance of genetic factors in this association.",

    "abstract": "Subjective organization (SO) facilitates storage and retrieval of information but is often impaired following traumatic brain injury. No study has compared measures of SO using association rule analyses to clustering analyses. Moreover, there have been no studies investigating whether patients post-brain injury subjectively organize non-verbal information.\nThis study investigates the relationship between SO and recall of words and symbols with participants discordant for traumatic brain injury. Additionally, the authors explored the conditions under which clustering or association rule measures of SO were best used.\nTwo female monozygotic twins discordant for traumatic brain injury completed a multi-trial free recall test of words and symbols. The authors examined whether measures of SO derived from clustering analysis or association rule modeling could differentiate organizational abilities between participants' data.\nThe twin following sequential traumatic brain injuries demonstrated significantly less SO and recall relative to the twin without a traumatic brain injury. Both twins subjectively organized verbal and non-verbal information and each measure could differentiate the twins' performance.\nThe quantitative analysis of SO can provide clinicians with valuable information concerning a patient's recall performance. This study illustrates practical issues that may influence a clinician's choice of these techniques.",

    "abstract": "Elasmobranchs display various reproductive modes, which have been key to their evolutionary success. In recent decades there has been a rise in the number of reported cases of foetal abnormalities including fertilised, double-embryos held within one egg capsule, hereafter referred to as twins. Previously, the occurrences of twin egg cases have been reported in two batoid and one shark species. We report the first cases of twins in three species of oviparous elasmobranchs: the undulate ray (Raja undulata), the nursehound (Scyliorhinus stellaris), and the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). We investigated the genetic relationships between the twins in S. stellaris, and S. canicula using microsatellite markers. Whilst the S. stellaris twins displayed the same genotypes, we found that the S. canicula twin individuals arose through heteropaternal superfecundation. This is the first reported incidence of such a paternity in elasmobranchs. The relationship between environmental change and reproductive strategy in elasmobranchs is unclear and further research is needed to determine its effect on the prevalence and mechanisms of formation of elasmobranch twins.",

    "abstract": "Natural and synthetic nanoparticles composed of fivefold twinned crystal domains have distinct properties. The formation mechanism of these fivefold twinned nanoparticles is poorly understood. We used in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy combined with molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that fivefold twinning occurs through repeated oriented attachment of ~3-nanometer gold, platinum, and palladium nanoparticles. We discovered two different mechanisms for forming fivefold twinned nanoparticles that are driven by the accumulation and elimination of strain. This was accompanied by decomposition of grain boundaries and the formation of a special class of twins with a net strain of zero. These observations allowed us to develop a quantitative picture of the twinning process. The mechanisms provide guidance for controlling twin structures and morphologies across a wide range of materials.",

    "abstract": "The lack of obstetricians in Japan has prevented the implementation of a 24-hour delivery monitoring system for high-risk deliveries such as twin vaginal delivery at many obstetric facilities. To examine the outcomes of a 1-day trial of the vaginal delivery of twins at 36-37 weeks' gestation.\nWe induced the vaginal delivery of twins at 36-37 weeks' gestation of 256 women who provided consent between January 2007 and December 2016 using the following protocol: 1) administration of 0.5 mg oral prostaglandin E2 every 1 hour (maximum: 1.5 mg) in the morning; 2) intravenous administration of oxytocin and amniotomy in the afternoon; and 3) selection of caesarean delivery when vaginal delivery was not expected by evening. We examined their perinatal outcomes in a chart review.\nThe completion rates of vaginal delivery in total, nulliparous, and multiparous women were 79%, 72%, and 84%, respectively. There were no cases of neonatal asphyxia. The total incidence of neonatal respiratory disorders was 2.1%, but there were no cases of persistent pulmonary hypertension. The total incidence of postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion was 2.7%.\nThe 1-day planned vaginal delivery of twins at 36-37 weeks' gestation appears valid and safe, and our findings suggest that it can be an option for the delivery of twins.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify possible implications and risk factors in monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies having a bipartite placenta.\nBetween 2014 and 2019 data on such pregnancies was prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Monochorionicity was confirmed either by the presence of a T-sign, one chorion and two separate amnion cavities, or by histological examination postnatally. Bipartite placenta was diagnosed when two placenta lobes were identified with no placental connection between them. Risks of bipartite placenta in MCDA twins were evaluated by background data, prenatal and postnatal outcome.\nFive twin pregnancies were included in the study. 60 % (n = 3) were complicated by twin-twin-transfusion syndrome (TTTS), 20 % by selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) (n = 1) and 20 % (n = 1) by severe fetal malformations. In every case an intervention was indicated, but in only 60% (n = 3) possible, due to poor surgical conditions. Overall fetal\u00a0survival rate at birth was 90 %. Neonatal survival rate was 66.63%.\nBipartite placenta is a very rare phenomenon in MCDA twin pregnancies. It seems to be associated with a higher rate of complications, such as TTTS and sIUGR and might induce surgical difficulties in prenatal interventions.",

Skewed XCI toward one parental X has been observed in several complex human traits, but the extent to which genetics and environment influence skewed XCI is largely unexplored. To address this, we quantify XCI-skew in multiple tissues and immune cell types in a twin cohort. Within an individual, XCI-skew differs between blood, fat and skin tissue, but is shared across immune cell types. XCI skew increases with age in blood, but not other tissues, and is associated with smoking. XCI-skew is increased in twins with Rheumatoid Arthritis compared to unaffected identical co-twins. XCI-skew is heritable in blood of females >55 years old (h",

    "abstract": "Twins Research Australia (TRA) is a community of twins and researchers working on health research to benefit everyone, including twins. TRA leads multidisciplinary research through the application of twin and family study designs, with the aim of sustaining long-term twin research that, both now and in the future, gives back to the community. This article summarizes TRA's recent achievements and future directions, including new methodologies addressing causation, linkage to health, economic and educational administrative datasets and to geospatial data to provide insight into health and disease. We also explain how TRA's knowledge translation and exchange activities are key to communicating the impact of twin studies to twins and the wider community. Building researcher capability, providing registry resources and partnering with all key stakeholders, particularly the participants, are important for how TRA is advancing twin research to improve health outcomes for society. TRA provides researchers with open access to its vibrant volunteer membership of twins, higher order multiples (multiples) and families who are willing to consider participation in research. Established four decades ago, this resource facilitates and supports research across multiple stages and a breadth of health domains.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this longitudinal analysis of untreated monozygotic and dizygotic twins were to investigate vertical changes of the craniofacial structures during growth, to determine the concordance between genetically twins and to assess the genetic component for the various aspects of vertical growth.\nThe sample consisted of 34 pairs of untreated monozygotic twins (23 male, 11 female) and 30 untreated dizygotic siblings of multiple birth (8 male, 8 female and 14 mixed) from the Forsyth Moorrees Twin Study (1959-1975); lateral cephalograms taken from 6 to 18\u00a0years of age were analysed at 3-year intervals.\nCephalograms were traced, and longitudinal changes between twins in six angular and proportional vertical cephalometric variables (SN-NL, ML-NL, SN-ML, y-axis, PFH/AFH and LAFH/AFH) were analysed with intraclass correlation coefficients and linear regression modelling.\nThe concordance between monozygotic/dizygotic twins at 18\u00a0years of age was moderate to high with intraclass correlation coefficient values between 0.51 and 0.66. Additionally, sex differences in concordance at 18\u00a0years of age were found for three variables. High heritability (66%-79%) was observed for 5 of the 6 variables (LAFH/AFH, ML-NL, y-axis, SN-ML, PFH/AFH), while SN-NL showed limited heritability (34%).\nAlthough monozygotic/dizygotic twins share at least part of their genetic material, differences in the vertical dimension were found. This supports the complex developmental mechanism of the human face and the varying influence of genetic and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Aging is intimately linked to system-wide metabolic changes that can be captured in blood. Understanding biological processes of aging in humans could help maintain a healthy aging trajectory and promote longevity. We performed untargeted plasma metabolomics quantifying 770 metabolites on a cross-sectional cohort of 268 healthy individuals including 125 twin pairs covering human lifespan (from 6\u00a0months to 82\u00a0years). Unsupervised clustering of metabolic profiles revealed 6 main aging trajectories throughout life that were associated with key metabolic pathways such as progestin steroids, xanthine metabolism, and long-chain fatty acids. A random forest (RF) model was successful to predict age in adult subjects (\u226516\u00a0years) using 52 metabolites (R",

    "abstract": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy or Kennedy disease (KD) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a pathogenic CAG expansion in the first exon of the androgen receptor. Proximal muscle atrophy, weakness, contraction fasciculations, bulbar involvement, and sensory disturbances are part of the clinical picture of KD. We report the unusual genetic and phenotypic expression in 2 monozygotic twins. Genetic analysis has shown abnormal expansion of CAG repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene on chromosome X different between the twin brothers (44, respectively, 46) but with large phenotypical differences including onset age, evolution, and clinical features. Disease began at age 31 for the first brother, respectively, and at 56 years for the second one and consisted of muscle wasting and progressive impairment of walking. In addition, the second brother did not manifest bulbar involvement 3 years after clinical onset and has more sensory features. Besides classical EMG testing, we evaluate sensory participation in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy with sudoscan device and confirmed the sensory deficit. We discussed epigenetic factors potentially involved in KD that could play a role in the phenotypical differences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case describing CAG trinucleotide repeats in monozygotic twins and also the first sudoscan diagnostic of sensory disturbances in Kennedy syndrome.",

Reprogramming factors were delivered by co-electroporation of three episomal-based plasmids expressing OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, L-MYC and LIN28. The hiPSCs showed a normal karyotype, expressed pluripotency-associated markers, displayed the capacity for in vitro differentiation into the three germ layers and were Epstein Barr virus-free.

    "abstract": "The analysis of twin data presents a unique challenge. Second-born twins on average weigh less than first-born twins and have an elevated risk of perinatal mortality. It is not clear whether the risk difference depends on birth order or their relative birth weight. This study evaluates the association between birth order and perinatal mortality by birth order-specific weight difference in twin pregnancies.\nWe adopt generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) which are a flexible version of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), to model the association. Estimation of such models for correlated binary data is challenging. We compare both Bayesian and likelihood-based approaches for estimating GAMMs via simulation. We apply the methods to the US matched multiple birth data to evaluate the association between twins' birth order and perinatal mortality.\nPerinatal mortality depends on both birth order and relative birthweight. Simulation results suggest that the Bayesian method with half-Cauchy priors for variance components performs well in estimating all components of the GAMM. The Bayesian results were sensitive to prior specifications.\nWe adopted a flexible statistical model, GAMM, to precisely estimate the perinatal mortality risk differences between first- and second-born twins whereby birthweight and gestational age are nonparametrically modelled to explicitly adjust for their effects. The risk of perinatal mortality in twins was found to depend on both birth order and relative birthweight. We demonstrated that the Bayesian method estimated the GAMM model components more reliably than the frequentist approaches.",

    "abstract": "A gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of how genetic and environmental risk factors converge at the molecular level to result in the emergence of autism symptoms. We compared blood-based gene expression signatures in identical twins concordant and discordant for autism spectrum condition (ASC) to differentiate genetic and environmentally driven transcription differences, and establish convergent evidence for biological mechanisms involved in ASC.\nGenome-wide gene expression data were generated using RNA-seq on whole blood samples taken from 16 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins and seven twin pair members (39 individuals in total), who had been assessed for ASC and autism traits at age 12. Differential expression (DE) analyses were performed between (a) affected and unaffected subjects (\nIn the discordant twin analysis, three genes showed evidence for DE at FDR\u2009<\u200910%: \nIdentical twins stably discordant for ASC are rare, and as such the sample size was limited and constrained to the use of peripheral blood tissue for transcriptomic and methylomic profiling. Given these primary limitations, we focused on transcript-level analysis.\nUsing a cohort of ASC discordant and concordant MZ twins, we add to the growing body of transcriptomic-based evidence for an immune-based component in the molecular aetiology of ASC. Whilst the sample size was limited, the study demonstrates the utility of the discordant MZ twin design combined with multi-omics integration for maximising the potential to identify disease-associated molecular signals.",

    "abstract": "Despite a genetic component in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD), monozygotic twin pairs often display discordance for PD. Here, we describe the generation of six human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from dermal fibroblasts of three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PD. We used non-integrating Sendai virus and the iPSC lines were comprehensively characterized. These lines provide a valuable resource for studying molecular differences between the affected and unaffected monozygotic twin and their response to genetic and non-genetic factors that might be involved in the development of PD.",

    "abstract": "The first known documented case of monochorionic-diamniotic twins with Coffin-Siris syndrome is described in this study. This case is notable because of the phenotypic differences between infants despite having identical genomes and causative variants. Also unique to this case is the clinical influence of early diagnosis using precision medicine techniques.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to compare the latency from membrane rupture to delivery and subsequent neonatal outcomes in twin gestations complicated by preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) of the presenting versus non-presenting sac.\nThis was a retrospective study of twin pregnancies over a 7-year period diagnosed with PPROM between 12 and 37 weeks gestation with a latency period to delivery of >24 hours. The ruptured sac was identified by ultrasound scan. The study compared the latency period from PPROM to delivery and subsequent neonatal morbidity and mortality resulting from rupture of the presenting versus non-presenting sac. Obstetric and neonatal outcomes were evaluated using a matched-cohort subset analysis (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2).\nDuring the study period, 77 twin pregnancies diagnosed with PPROM satisfied the inclusion criteria. The mean latency periods from PPROM to delivery were 10.1 days (n\u202f=\u202f7) when the presenting sac ruptured and 41.3 days (n\u202f=\u202f10) when the non-presenting sac ruptured (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Neonatal death was higher with PPROM of the presenting than the non-presenting sac (21.4% vs. 0%, respectively; P\u202f=\u202f0.05). Neonates were more likely to be affected by retinopathy of prematurity (57% vs. 19%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but less likely to have persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (0% vs. 25%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) when the rupture occurred in the presenting sac. The rates of other neonatal adverse outcomes were similar between the two groups.\nIn twin gestations there is a longer latency from PPROM to delivery and fewer neonatal complications when rupture occurs in the non-presenting rather than the presenting sac.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex contains a significant quantity of intracortical myelin, but the genetics of cortical myelination (CM) in humans is not well understood. Relatively novel MRI-derived measures now enable the investigation of cortical myelination in large samples. In this study, we use a genetically-informative neuroimaging sample of 1096 young adult subjects from the Human Connectome Project in order to investigate genetic and environmental variation in CM and its relationships with cerebral surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT). We found that genetic factors account for approximately 50% of the observed individual differences in mean cortical myelin, 75% of the variation in total SA, and 85% of the variance in global mean CT. Although significant genetic influences were found throughout the cortex, both CM and SA demonstrated a posterior predominance, with disproportionately strong effects in the parietal and occipital lobes and significantly overlapping heritability maps (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Yet despite showing similar spatial heritability patterns, we found evidence that CM is genetically independent from SA at both global and vertex levels; genetically-mediated relationships between CM and CT were similarly small in magnitude. We also found small but statistically significant genetic associations between NIH Toolbox Total Cognition score and CM in the temporal lobe and insula. SA-cognition and CT-cognition correlations were less widespread compared to CM and both patterns were similar to those reported in prior studies.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate if hereditary factors, leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and metabolic health interact with resting fat oxidation (RFO) and peak fat oxidation (PFO) during ergometer cycling.\nWe recruited 23 male monozygotic twin pairs (aged 32-37\u00a0years) and determined their RFO and PFO with indirect calorimetry for 21 and 19 twin pairs and for 43 and 41 twin individuals, respectively. Using physical activity interviews and the Baecke questionnaire, we identified 10 twin pairs as LTPA discordant for the past 3\u00a0years. Of the twin pairs, 8 pairs participated in both RFO and PFO measurements, and 2 pairs participated in either of the measurements. We quantified the participants' metabolic health with a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test.\nFat oxidation within co-twins was correlated at rest [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)\u2009=\u20090.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.78] and during exercise (ICC\u2009=\u20090.67, 95% CI 0.33-0.86). The LTPA-discordant pairs had no pairwise differences in RFO or PFO. In the twin individual-based analysis, PFO was positively correlated with the past 12-month LTPA (r\u2009=\u20090.26, p\u2009=\u20090.034) and the Baecke score (r\u2009=\u20090.40, p\u2009=\u20090.022) and negatively correlated with the area under the curve of insulin (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.42, p\u2009=\u20090.015) and glucose (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.31, p\u2009=\u20090.050) during the oral glucose tolerance test.\nHereditary factors were more important than LTPA for determining fat oxidation at rest and during exercise. Additionally, PFO, but not RFO, was associated with better metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate electrodeposition as a synthesis method for fabrication of Al coatings, up to 10 \u03bcm thick, containing a high density of genuine growth twins. This has not been expected since the twin boundary energy of pure Al is very high. TEM methods were used to analyze deposited Al and its nanoscaled twins. DFT methods confirmed that the influence of the substrate is limited to the layers close to the interface. Our findings are different from those achieved by sputtering of Al coatings restricted to a thickness less than 100 nm with twins dominated by epitaxial effects. We propose that in the case of electrodeposition, a high density of twins arises because of fast nucleation and is additionally promoted by a monolayer of adsorbed hydrogen originating from water impurities. Therefore, electrodeposition is a viable approach for tailoring the structure and properties of thicker, deposited Al coatings reinforced by twins.",

    "abstract": "Is B-cell CLL/lymphoma 6 (BCL6) endometrial expression, a surrogate biomarker of endometriosis, elevated in women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (uRPL) and unexplained infertility (UI) compared to fertile subjects?\nEndometrial BCL6 expression is elevated to a similar degree in women with uRPL and UI compared to fertile controls.\nEndometriosis has been linked to the genesis of endometrial progesterone resistance and to specific nuclear proteins, including endometrial BCL6. BCL6 overexpression (immune histologic score\u2009>\u20091.4) has been strongly associated with poor reproductive outcomes in IVF cycles in women with UI. Our previous data have demonstrated an accuracy of 94% for diagnosing endometriosis, and BCL6 protein is elevated in the decidua of women with uRPL.\nIn this case-control study, at a tertiary university teaching hospital, 110 samples (control \nLH-timed endometrial biopsies were obtained from women with UI, uRPL (two or more consecutive losses) and normal fertile subjects during the mid-secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Endometrial BCL6 protein levels were compared in women with UI and uRPL and fertile controls using western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (HSCORE).\nThe mean age of the uRPL group was significantly higher than the others [mean (SD)] control\u2009=\u200932.7 (2.6); uRPL\u2009=\u200935.8 (3.7); UI\u2009=\u200932.7 (4.4); \nWe studied subjects with two consecutive pregnancy losses rather than the definition adopted in Europe of three losses. The findings may lack external validity in other clinical settings (e.g. low prevalence of endometriosis).\nBased on the data presented here, we postulate that the degree of BCL6 expression may represent a continuum of progesterone resistance and response to inflammation that occurs in women with endometriosis, yielding different degrees of infertility, from uRPL to UI.\nThis study was supported by NICHD/NIH R01 HD067721 (SLY and BAL), by Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior: Grant 99999.003035/2015-08 (BAL) and by CAPES/PROAP (RFS).

    "abstract": "To develop a practical scoring system to assist clinicians in differentiating leptospirosis and hantavirus infections, whose epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics are literally like identical twins.\nThe study population consisted of 162 patients admitted to hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of leptospirosis (LG group, n\u2009=\u200992) and hantavirus infections (HG, group\u2009=\u200970) between January 2000 and January 2019. The two groups were compared in terms of demographic, clinical and laboratory features. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined from ROC analysis for findings of significance in the diagnosis of leptospirosis, and a scoring system for diagnosis was developed (\"MICE\" score). During the development of this scoring system, we were careful to employ parameters that would not affect one another statistically, to reflect the involvement of very different systems (such as the hematological, hepatic, renal, and musculoskeletal systems) due to the multisystemic effect of the disease in the organism, and to ensure that the system should be simple to apply and understand. Accordingly, five parameters, serum WBC, creatinine, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, and C-reactive protein, were employed in the \"MICE\" scoring system.\nThree cut-off values were determined using ROC analysis for the five parameters included in the MICE system. Accordingly, scores of 0, 1, or 2 were given based on the values WBC (/\u03bcL):\u2009\u2264\u20097500, 7500-15,000, and\u2009>\u200915,000; total bilirubin (mg/dL):\u2009\u2264\u20093, 3-10, and\u2009>\u200910; CRP (mg/dL):\u2009\u2264\u20095, 5-15, and\u2009>\u200915; creatinine (mg/dL):\u2009\u2264\u20091.5, 1.5-3, and\u2009>\u20093; CK (U/L):\u2009\u2264\u2009500, 500-1000,\u2009>\u20091000. AUC was calculated as 0.964 at ROC analysis, while the most noteworthy cut-off point was obtained when MICE score was\u2009\u2265\u20093, exhibiting 93.5% sensitivity, 92.9% specificity, PPV 94.5% and NPV 91.5%. A test score\u2009\u2265\u20093 was regarded as positive. In addition, our patients were evaluated using other current scoring systems in addition to \"MICE,\" and our scoring system exhibited a greater diagnostic power in our subjects.\nLeptospirosis and hantavirus infections can be accurately predicted by the MICE scoring system. Early diagnosis and rational treatment will also help to lower the mortality rates in these diseases.",

Participants were 3592 individuals (764 dizygotic [DZ] and 430 monozygotic [MZ] twin pairs) from the FinnTwin16 study. The DQS (0-12 points) was constructed from a short 14 item food frequency questionnaire. Anthropometric measures and eating styles were self-reported. Nutrient intakes were calculated from food diaries completed in a subsample of 249 individuals (45 same-sex DZ and 60 MZ twin pairs). Twins were analyzed both as individuals and as twin pairs. The DQS was inversely associated with body mass index (\u03b2 = -0.12, per one-unit increase in DQS, ",

    "abstract": "Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are characterized by lower extremity spasticity and weakness. HSP is often caused by mutations in SPG genes, but it may also be produced by inborn errors of metabolism. We performed next-generation sequencing of 4813 genes in one adult twin pair with HSP and severe muscular weakness occurring at the same age. We found two pathogenic compound heterozygous variants in MTHFR, including a variant not referenced in international databases, c.197C>T (p.Pro66Leu) and a known variant, c.470G>A (p.Arg157Gln), and two heterozygous pathogenic variants in POLG, c.1760C>T (p.Pro587Leu) and c.752C>T (p.Thr251Ile). MTHFR and POLG mutations were consistent with the severe muscle weakness and the metabolic changes, including hyperhomocysteinemia and decreased activity of both N(5,10)methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and complexes I and II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. These data suggest the potential role of MTHFR and POLG mutations through consequences on mitochondrial dysfunction in the occurrence of spastic paraparesis phenotype with combined metabolic, muscular, and neurological components.",

    "abstract": "The Longitudinal Israeli Study of Twins (LIST) focuses on the developmental, genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in children's and adolescents' social behavior. Key variables have been empathy, prosocial behavior, temperament and values. Another major goal of LIST has been to study gene-environment correlations, mainly concerning parenting. LIST includes 1657 families of Hebrew-speaking Israeli twins who have participated at least once in the study. Children's environment and their development are assessed in a multivariate, multimethod fashion, including observed, parent-reported and self-reported data. The current article summarizes and updates recent findings from LIST. For example, LIST provided evidence for the heritability of human values with the youngest sample to date, and the first genetic investigation of adolescents' identity formation. Finally, future aims of LIST are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by maternal genetic deficiency of a gene that encodes E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase (gene symbol UBE3A) mapping to chromosome 15q11-q13. AS leads to stiff and jerky gait, excess laughter, seizures, and severe intellectual disability. In some parts of the brain, the paternally inherited UBE3A gene is subject to genomic imprinting by the action of the UBE3A-antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS) on the paternally inherited allele. Consequently, only the maternally inherited UBE3A gene is expressed in mature neurons. AS occurs due to deletions of the maternal 15q11\u2009-\u200913 region, paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), imprinting center defects, mutations in the maternal UBE3A gene, or other unknown genetic malfunctions that result in a silenced maternal UBE3A gene in the specific imprinted regions of the brain.\nA potential treatment strategy for AS is to increase methylation of UBE3A-ATS to promote expression of the paternal UBE3A gene and thus ameliorate the clinical phenotypes of AS. We treated two sets of male identical twins with class I deletions with a 1 year treatment trial of either betaine and folic acid versus placebo. We found no statistically significant changes in the clinical parameters tested at the end of the 1 year trial, nor did we find any significant adverse events.\nThis study tested the hypothesis that by increasing the methylation of the UBE3A-antisense transcript in Angelman syndrome to promote expression of the silenced paternal UBE3A gene we may ameliorate the clinical phenotypes of AS. We treated two sets of identical twins with placebo versus betaine and folic acid. Although this study represented a novel approach to treating Angelman syndrome, the differences in the developmental testing results was not significant. This paper also discusses the value of monozygotic twin studies in minimizing confounding variables and its utility in conducting small treatment studies.\nNCT00348933 . Registered 6 July 2006.",

    "abstract": "Multisensory integration of information from the talker's voice and the talker's mouth facilitates human speech perception. A popular assay of audiovisual integration is the McGurk effect, an illusion in which incongruent visual speech information categorically changes the percept of auditory speech. There is substantial interindividual variability in susceptibility to the McGurk effect. To better understand possible sources of this variability, we examined the McGurk effect in 324 native Mandarin speakers, consisting of 73 monozygotic (MZ) and 89 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. When tested with 9 different McGurk stimuli, some participants never perceived the illusion and others always perceived it. Within participants, perception was similar across time (",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified over 120 risk loci for psoriasis. However, most of the variations are located in non-coding region with high frequency and small effect size. Pathogenetic variants are rarely reported except HLA-C*0602 with the odds ratio being approximately 4.0 in Chinese population. Although rare variations still account for a small proportion of phenotypic variances in complex diseases, their effect on phenotypes is large. Recently, more and more studies focus on the low-frequency functional variants and have achieved a certain amount of success.\nWhole genome sequencing and sanger sequencing was performed on 8 MZ twin pairs discordant for psoriasis to scan and verified the de novo mutations (DNMs). Additionally, 665 individuals with about 20 years' medical history versus 2054 healthy controls and two published large population studies which had about 8 years' medical history (including 10,727 cases versus 10,582 controls) were applied to validate the enrichment of rare damaging mutations in two DNMs genes. Besides, to verify the pathogenicity of candidate DNM in C3, RNA-sequencing for CD4\nA total of 27 DNMs between co-twins were identified. We found six of eight twins carry HLA-C\u22170602 allele which have large effects on psoriasis. And it is interesting that a missense mutation in SPRED1 and a splice region mutation in C3 are found in the psoriasis individuals in the other two MZ twin pairs without carrying HLA-C*0602 allele. In the replication stage, we found 2 loss-of-function (LOF) variants of C3 only in 665 cases with about 20 years' medical history and gene-wise analysis in 665 cases and 2054 controls showed that the rare missense mutations in C3 were enriched in cases (OR\u202f=\u202f1.91, P\u202f=\u202f0.0028). We further scanned the LOF mutations of C3 in two published studies (about 8 years' medical history), and found one LOF mutation in the case without carrying HLA-C*0602. In the individual with DNM in C3, RNA sequencing showed the expression level of C3 in skin was significant higher than healthy samples in public database (TPM fold change\u202f=\u202f1.40, P\u202f=\u202f0.000181) and ELISA showed protein C3 in peripheral blood was higher (~2.2-fold difference) than the other samples of twins without DNM in C3.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that DNM in C3 is the likely pathological mutations, and it provided a better understanding of the genetic etiology of psoriasis and additional treatments for this disease.",

However, several other studies belong in this category, such as Dr Josef Mengele's horrifying twin research conducted at the Auschwitz concentration camp, Dr John Money's misguided attempt to turn an accidentally castrated male twin into a female, Russian scientists' cruel medical study of conjoined female twins and Dr Peter Neubauer's secret project that tracked the development of separated twins. Reviews of current twin research span twins' representation of self-image, twins with Kleine-Levin Syndrome, heteropaternal twinning in lemurs and factors affecting risk of dental caries. Media coverage includes a pair of high-society models, a book about the 'Winkelevii' twins, Super Bowl twin teammates, a family with three sets of fraternal twins, a twin sister surrogate and a near presidential twin.",

    "abstract": "The new West Japan Twins and Higher Order Multiple Births Registry was established by recruiting young twins and multiple births and by referrals from public health centers in the 1990s. The participants included in the survey comprised over 7800 twins and 4241 higher order multiples, and their families. Specifically, the present registry contains one of the largest triplet samples in the world. For these twins and multiples, data on year of delivery, mode of delivery, gestational age, intrapartum complications, longitudinal physical measures, motor milestones, cerebral palsy and feeding methods were obtained from records in the Maternal and Child Health Handbooks and schools. Participating mothers were asked to indicate family structure, parental educational history, maternal sleeping time, maternal health condition, maternal and paternal age at multiple delivery, complications during pregnancy, handedness of multiples and age at menarche of multiples. However, the zygosity differed among the various collaborating public health centers according to factors such as the time of investigation. Follow-up questionnaires have been mailed out every 3-4 years for longitudinal studies. This article describes the goals of this registry, recruitment of multiples and the focus of the study. The goals of this registry are not only to conduct research on human genetics and maternal and child health, but also to contribute to providing appropriate information for families with multiples.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins, considered genetically identical, cannot be distinguished using regular short tandem repeats (STR) typing, thus presenting a challenge for forensic geneticists. In paternity testing, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nuclear DNA can help distinguish MZ twins. However, the unique features of the mitochondrial genome, such as high copy number, small genome size, and high substitution rate, make it a promising source for applications in forensic science.\nWhole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on blood samples, and bioinformatic analysis was used to distinguish between MZ twins. Amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) was used to confirm the WGS results. This methodology was further applied to forensic samples from criminal cases. Amplicon sequencing was also performed to further exclude the innocent twin.\nThe monozygosity of the twins was confirmed using STR typing. Only one potential somatic mutation, m.6903\u202fT\u202f>\u202fC (2.6%), in the mitochondrial genome of one of the twins was verified when the sequence depth was set to 2000-fold, while no other distinguishing locus in the nuclear genome was identified. By dividing the number of C-reads by total reads, WGS data confirmed the amount of the minor component C to be 2.6%, which was further confirmed by ARMS-PCR. In addition, the heterogeneous locus was used to identify samples obtained from four criminal cases for forensic testing. Two heterogeneous loci in the sperm DNA of the other twin were identified by amplicon sequencing, and the amount of minor component T in m.6935C\u202f>\u202fT and m.6938C\u202f>\u202fT was estimated to be 17.91% and 18.79%, respectively.\nThe biological samples taken from the MZ twins were distinguished using a combination of WGS, allele-specific PCR, and deep-amplicon sequencing. Compared with nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA exhibited a higher potential for distinguishing between the MZ twins. The distinguishing feature of the mitochondrial DNA was the heterogeneous SNPs that occurred in only one twin. One SNP was further verified in the samples from the criminal cases and helped identify the perpetrator in case 1 and case 2. Furthermore, two heterogeneous SNPs found by amplicon sequencing helped to exclude the innocent twin in all four cases. Our findings demonstrated that a combination of deep sequencing and molecular analysis can be an effective way to distinguish between identical twins and can be used to analyze samples from criminal cases.",

    "abstract": "Fetoplacental neuroblastoma metastasis has been postulated as a mechanism accounting for concordant cases where one twin develops a primary tumour and the second twin manifests the disease without an identifiable primary site. These tumours may originate and spread concomitantly due to the same genetic background shared by monozygotic twins. This study investigated the molecular profile of stage MS neuroblastoma presenting concomitantly in monozygotic twins. Comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) was done for each of the twin liver tumour and peripheral blood samples at diagnosis. Comparison of copy-number variation (CNV) regions revealed a set of CNVs that were common to both tumour specimens and not apparent in the blood. The CNV signature in both twins' tumours was highly similar, suggesting a common clonal origin. Additional findings included large deletion of chromosome 10 and amplification of chromosome 17. Notably, both liver samples had amplification of a short region involving DEIN (chromosome 4q34.1). Similar CNVs strongly support a common clonal origin and metastatic spread from one twin to the other. DEIN is a long-coding RNA (IncRNA) that has been found highly expressed in stage MS neuroblastoma and is likely involved in biological processes such as cell migration and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the human blood circulation has been under investigation since its initial observation in 1948. Plasma cfDNA is known to be significantly elevated in diseased people. Due to possible variation in the population, evaluating cfDNA as a non-invasive biomarker at disease onset alone may not be sensitive enough to accurately diagnose diseases, particularly early stage cancers on a personal level. To understand the factors that define the cfDNA levels on the personal level and for better use as a non-invasive biomarker, we isolated cfDNA from the plasma of healthy individuals with varying degrees of genetic and/or environmental similarities (monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, sibling pairs, and unrelated individuals) as well as from patients with varying stages of breast and ovarian cancer undergoing treatment. Cell-free DNA levels were quantified by a fluorometer (ng/ml) and/or real-time PCR (copies/ml). The associations between individuals with various degrees of genetic and/or environmental similarities and their plasma cfDNA levels were evaluated. The ACE model (A = additive genetic, C = common environment, and E = specific environmental factors) was used to determine the proportion of each factor on the cfDNA levels. We found a high correlation (r = 0.77; p < 0.0001) in plasma cfDNA levels between monozygotic twins (n = 39). However, the correlation was gradually reduced to moderate (r = 0.47; p = 0.016) between dizygotic twins (n = 13) and low correlation (r = 0.28; p = 0.043) between sibling pairs (n = 26). The ACE model analysis showed that the plasma cfDNA level of a given healthy individual is influenced both by genetic and the environmental components in similar proportions (53% and 47%, respectively; A = 53%, C = 22.5%, E = 24.5%). Moreover, while age had no effect, gender significantly influenced the individual's plasma cfDNA level. As expected, cfDNA levels were significantly higher in both breast (n = 26) (p<0.0001) and ovarian (n = 64) (p<0.0001) cancer patients compared to the healthy individuals. Our study demonstrated that both genome and environmental factors modulate the individual's cfDNA level suggesting that its diagnostic sensitivity may be improved only if the person's cfDNA level is known prior to disease presentation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study is to provide a comprehensive overview of identical twin kidney transplantation in the modern era. We provide epidemiologic trends in the US twin population from 1959 to 2000, current methods to identify zygosity, outcomes for identical twin transplants, and a comprehensive management strategy for identical twin kidney transplantation. By 2019, we project that 433\u00a0010 dizygotic and monozygotic twins will be alive and at risk for developing ESRF. Monozygosity between a donor-recipient pair can be confirmed by concordance in sex, blood type, and HLA antigen match with precision testing using 13/17 Short Tandem Repeat\u00a0sequencing to a likelihood of nearly 100%. Among identical twin transplants from 2001 to 2017, excellent patient and kidney graft survival rates were noted. Approximately 50% of kidney transplant recipients of identical twins transplant did not receive maintenance immunosuppression, and no differences in graft survival were noted among patients with and without immunosuppression at 6 and 12\u00a0months (P\u00a0=\u00a0.8 and .7). Patients with glomerulonephritis as the cause of ESRF had lower graft survival (P\u00a0=\u00a0.06) suggesting that recurrent glomerulonephritis as a likely cause of graft loss among these recipients.",

    "abstract": "Only few studies have investigated the genomewide transcriptome of normative cognitive aging. We therefore aimed at investigating blood gene expression patterns associated with cognitive aging using a population-based sample of 235 middle-aged monozygotic twin pairs with longitudinal data on cognitive function. This unique setup enabled examination of gene expression differences associated with individual and intrapair differences in cognitive level and change while controlling for underlying genetic variation and shared early environment. Overall, increased expression of several gene sets was found to strongly correlate with a lower cognitive level and cognitive decline. The most significantly correlated gene sets were related to protein metabolism, translation, RNA metabolism, infectious disease, and the immune system, which are all processes previously linked to transcription signatures of pathological and normal brain aging, and aging in blood. The results of our study thus suggest that gene expression patterns of cognitive level and decline in our sample mirror those seen in cognitively impaired individuals, which could point toward a more generic response to cognitive aging and aging in general.",

    "abstract": "We investigated key event-related brain potential markers (ERPs) derived from a flanked continuous performance task (CPT) and whether these would show phenotypic associations with ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) in a population-based sample. We further explored whether there was preliminary evidence that such ERPs could also index genetic risk for ADHD (depending on finding phenotypic associations). Sixty-seven male-only twin pairs (N = 134; aged 12-15) from a subsample of the Twins' Early Development Study, concordant and discordant for ADHD symptoms, performed the flanked CPT (or CPT-OX) while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. ERPs were obtained for cue (P3, CNV or contingency negative variation), go (P3, N2) and nogo trials (P3, N2). We found no phenotypic associations between CPT-derived ERPs and ADHD-the sizes of the estimated phenotypic correlations were nonsignificant and very small (r's = -.11 to .04). Twin-model fitting analyses using structural equation modelling provided preliminary evidence that some of the ERPs were heritable (with the most robust effect for go-P3 latency), but there was limited evidence of any genetic associations between ERPs and ADHD, although with the caveat that our sample was small and hence had limited power. Overall, unlike in previous research, there was no evidence of phenotypic (nor preliminary evidence for genetic) associations between ADHD and CPT-derived ERPs in this study. Hence, it may be currently premature for genetic analyses of ADHD to be guided by CPT-derived ERP parameters (unlike alternative cognitive-neurophysiological approaches which may be more promising). Further research with better-powered, population-based, genetically-informative and cross-disorder samples are required, which could be facilitated by emerging mobile EEG technologies.",

NatPAT will have a nationally representative sample of elementary school-aged twins in the United States. The overall goal of the project is to uncover salient factors, including genetic and environmental influences, which contribute to the co-development of reading and math performance during the critical developmental period of elementary school. Here we present the specific aims, methods and materials, and future directions of the project.",

    "abstract": "Although mirror images are noted in some twins, no such reports are available for twins and subjects with schizophrenia.\nThe study was to assess the occurrence of mirror image finger patterns in apparent monozygotic twins with schizophrenia. Another objective was to elucidate these characteristics among sib pairs with schizophrenia for comparison with those of the twins.\nEight apparent monozygotic twin pairs and eight sib pairs with schizophrenia were investigated. The frequency of identical patterns in the right side finger of one twin and the corresponding left side finger of the other twin was assessed, and similarly on other sides. Similar assessment was made in sib pairs with schizophrenia and normal sib pairs.\nThe left middle finger pattern of one of the twin pair was found to be the mirror image of the right middle finger of the other twin in all the twin pairs studied and so was in seven of the sib pairs with schizophrenia. These mirror images of sib pairs with schizophrenia was more than those of normal sib pairs. This difference was accentuated with significantly more of these patterns in the twins in comparison to those among normal sib pairs. Notably, no difference emerged between the sib pairs with schizophrenia and the twins in any of their finger pairs.\nMirror images that are probably due to factors like abnormal genotypes and L- DNA, appear to be promising tools to study the etiology of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "To assess the hemodynamic influence of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) on diastolic function, using left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) E/e' measured in the same cardiac cycle using the dual-gate Doppler (DD) method.\nThis study included 56 monochorionic twin pregnancies that underwent fetoscopic laser surgery (FLS) for TTTS in 2015-2018. E/e' by the DD method was measured 24 h before and 4-7 days after FLS.\nRecipients showed higher LV-E/e' Z score in stage I-, II-, and III-recipients (IIIr) and higher RV-E/e' Z score in stage III-donors and IIIr than donors (p < 0.05). After FLS, LV-E/e' Z score of recipients significantly decreased due to LV-E velocity Z score decrease (p < 0.05). RV-E/e' Z score after FLS significantly decreased due to RV-e' velocity Z score increase in recipients (p < 0.05).\nE/e' by the DD method helped assess cardiac changes of recipients. LV-E/e' could assess early hemodynamic changes by TTTS, and RV-E/e' can assess later influence on cardiac diastolic function. Furthermore, in recipient twins, the decrease in LV-E/e' after FLS might reflect the improvement of volume overload and the decrease in RV-E/e' might reflect the improvement of diastolic relaxation function in the RV.",

    "abstract": "Variants in GABRA1 have been associated with different epilepsies ranging from mild generalized forms to epileptic encephalopathies. Despite the broad clinical spectrum, phenotypes were found to be largely concordant within families. Contrary to this observation, we report monozygotic twin sisters with generalized epilepsy due to the c.541C>T; p.(Pro181Ser) de novo variant in GABRA1. One experienced juvenile absence seizures promptly responding to first-line medication, whereas the second developed severe treatment-refractory epilepsy with febrile, absence, atonic, and tonic-clonic seizures indicating marked intrafamilial variability in GABRA1-related epilepsy. Moreover, we provide a molecular characterization of the novel variant based on recently published structural data.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disabling disease of the CNS. Inflammatory features of MS include lymphocyte accumulations in the CNS and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The preclinical events leading to established MS are still enigmatic. Here we compared gene expression patterns of CSF cells from MS-discordant monozygotic twin pairs. Six \"healthy\" co-twins, who carry a maximal familial risk for developing MS, showed subclinical neuroinflammation (SCNI) with small MRI lesions. Four of these subjects had oligoclonal bands (OCBs). By single-cell RNA sequencing of 2752 CSF cells, we identified clonally expanded CD8+ T cells, plasmablasts, and, to a lesser extent, CD4+ T cells not only from MS patients but also from subjects with SCNI. In contrast to nonexpanded T cells, clonally expanded T cells showed characteristics of activated tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells. The TRM-like phenotype was detectable already in cells from SCNI subjects but more pronounced in cells from patients with definite MS. Expanded plasmablast clones were detected only in MS and SCNI subjects with OCBs. Our data provide evidence for very early concomitant activation of 3 components of the adaptive immune system in MS, with a notable contribution of clonally expanded TRM-like CD8+ cells.",

    "abstract": "Twin or multiple pregnancies often have neonatal complications. Common complications include low birth weight, respiratory distress, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (>5\u00a0days) and low APGAR score especially on second twin. (1) To compare referral rates of newborn hearing screening in twins and triplets between risk and non-risk babies for hearing loss, (2) to determine the effects of birth order on referral rates in twins and triplets. A retrospective study was carried out from the case records of the neonates enrolled in the referral based NICU hearing screening program during April 2013 to December 2014 at Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chennai. 1405 neonates (723 males and 682 females) in the age range of 3-28\u00a0days were screened during this period among which 76 were twins (38 pairs) and 9 were triplets (3 sets). We classified them further into non risk and risk babies among twins according to the Joint Committee for Infant Hearing (JCIH) recommendations. A dual step hearing screening protocol was used to screen the neonates. They were initially tested with distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) then with automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) before discharged from the hospital. Out of 76 (100%) twin babies 43 (56.58%) babies had one or more risk factors for hearing loss. Most common risk factors were low birth weight, premature birth, mechanical ventilation >5\u00a0days, hyperbilirubinemia, infections, ototoxic medications and family history of hearing loss. Each risk factor was observed in equal proportion in 1st born and 2nd born twins. 12 (15.76%) risk babies and 11 (14.47%) non risk babies failed in DPOAE testing. Out of 9 triplets babies (3 set) 3 babies had risk factors for hearing loss. One baby in 2nd born babies group failed AABR screening. Referral rates were slightly higher in 2nd born twins when compared to 1st born twins in DPOAE testing. Chi square test did not reveal any significant association between referral rates with risk factors and birth order (",

We herein report cases of SCA8 in Japanese monozygotic twins that presented with nystagmus, dysarthria, and limb and truncal ataxia. Their ATXN8OS CTA/CTG repeats were 25/97. They showed similar manifestations, clinical courses, and cerebellar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging. Some of their pedigrees had nystagmus but not ataxia. These are the first monozygotic twins with SCA8 to be reported anywhere in the world. Although not all subjects with the ATXN8OS CTG expansion develop cerebellar ataxia, these cases suggest the pathogenesis of ATXN8OS repeat expansions in hereditary cerebellar ataxia.",

    "abstract": "We describe the use of virtual reality technology for surgical planning in the successful separation of thoracopagus conjoined twins. Three-dimensional models were created from computed tomography angiograms to simulate the patient's anatomy on a virtual stereoscopic display. Members of the surgical teams reviewed the anatomical models to localize an interatrial communication that allowed blood to flow between the two hearts. The surgical plan to close the 1-mm interatrial communication was significantly modified based on the pre-procedural spatial awareness of the anatomy presented in the virtual visualization. The virtual stereoscopic display was critical for the surgical team to successfully separate the twins and provides a useful case study for the use of virtual reality technology in surgical planning. Both twins survived the operation and were subsequently discharged from the hospital.",

    "abstract": "It is desirable for twin researchers to be aware of the needs and concerns of families of multiples and provide participants with appropriate and useful feedback and advice based on scientific evidence. Our most recent database on families with twins throughout Japan is based on a questionnaire survey conducted in 2016. Mailed questionnaires, consisting of over 500 items, were used to collect the basic data. The response rate was 38% (566/1478). This is part of a nationwide study designed to assess the long-term effect of perinatal conditions on mothers of multiples. Its aim was to study the growth and development of multiples in childhood, and for the creation of a multifetal mother and child health handbook, and to conduct a genetic epidemiologic study to test the developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis. One of the ultimate aims of this research was to provide evidence-based information on parenting of multiples for families with multiples.",

    "abstract": "The Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) is a longitudinal twin study that recruited over 16,000 twin-pairs born between 1994 and 1996 in England and Wales through national birth records. More than 10,000 of these families are still engaged in the study. TEDS was and still is a representative sample of the population in England and Wales. Rich cognitive and emotional/behavioral data have been collected from the twins from infancy to emerging adulthood, with data collection at first contact and at ages 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 21, enabling longitudinal genetically sensitive analyses. Data have been collected from the twins themselves, from their parents and teachers, and from the UK National Pupil Database. Genotyped DNA data are available for 10,346 individuals (who are unrelated except for 3320 dizygotic co-twins). TEDS data have contributed to over 400 scientific papers involving more than 140 researchers in 50 research institutions. TEDS offers an outstanding resource for investigating cognitive and behavioral development across childhood and early adulthood and actively fosters scientific collaborations.",

    "abstract": "Rotavirus has been associated with neonatal seizures and specific white matter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities. We describe monochorionic twins who not only tested positive for rotavirus with these white matter MRI abnormalities but who also showed an electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern characteristic of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), which has so far solely been described in epileptic encephalopathies with a poor prognosis. This report suggests that rotavirus infection must be added to the list of causes of EIEE EEG, and that the outcome then is likely more favorable. As MRI and EEG signs of rotavirus encephalopathy were present in one twin with only subtle neurologic symptoms, rotavirus may well cause insidious central nervous system complications more often. We suggest considering rotavirus infection in neonates presenting with seizures, and to add rotavirus infection to the differential diagnosis of EIEE.",

    "abstract": "The debate upon the relative importance of nature vs nurture in the development of human behaviour can be traced back to ancient times. Traditional epidemiology and genetic epidemiology have confirmed the association of environmental and genetic factors with behavioural traits. Current genomic studies are identifying genetic variants associated with various behavioural traits. However, exploring the relationship of abundant environmental factors with the complex epigenome that mediates human behaviour is just at its beginning. Identical twins can serve as perfect experiments for studying the environmental impact on behavioural epigenetics advantaged by enriched power in association analysis due to controlling of their genetic make-ups. Recent development in causal inference using twin-based models adds more values in twins. This review briefly introduces the various approaches in making use of twins in studying behavioural epigenetics from experiment design to practical applications. Exploring the epigenome of twins using the powerful twin-based study designs and analytical approaches will help identifying causal epigenetic markers mediating environmental exposures and behavioural traits enabling both pharmaceutical intervention and effective prevention.",

    "abstract": "Most studies have revealed that the incidence of morbidity and mortality of preterm male infants is greater than that of preterm female infants. Recently, conflicting outcomes have been reported regarding mixed-gender twins. The aim of this study was to estimate the association between gender and outcome in newborn twins of different gender.\nWe conducted a retrospective review of mixed-gender twins weighing < 1500\u2009g that were born at Shamir Medical Center (Assaf Harofeh) between the years 1995 and 2016 (158 newborns). The incidence of morbidity and mortality until discharge from the hospital were evaluated while looking at gender differences.\nNo significant differences were found in neonatal mortality or morbidity between females and males from different-gender twins. Even after considering confounding variables (gestational age, birth weight & birth order) in linear and logistic regression models, no significant differences were found between the genders.\nOur study suggests that there are no significant differences in neonatal mortality or morbidity among different-gender twins. Our results support the need for further studies.",

    "abstract": "Multifetal gestation is often complicated by the development of preeclampsia. In some twin gestations, preeclampsia develops in association with restricted fetal growth of only one fetus. Instead of termination of the entire pregnancy, we investigated an alternative approach to the management of such pregnancies that might allow unharmed survival of the normal twin. We present a case of preeclampsia in twin discordance with severe fetal growth restriction at 25 weeks of gestation. Preeclampsia was linked to a lethal condition in one twin and was treated with selective feticide in an effort to reverse preeclampsia. Inasmuch as the fetal prognosis was extremely poor for the abnormal fetus, selective feticide was a reasonable therapeutic option. Maternal symptoms resolved, allowing continuation of the pregnancy for 4 weeks before delivery of the healthy fetus. We maintain that selective termination induced a decrease in the release of substances involved in the physiopathology of preeclampsia, which allowed the continuation of the pregnancy with close follow-up. This report highlights the link between placental pathology and the disease process of preeclampsia and further supports selective termination as a reasonable management strategy in carefully selected cases of discordant twins.",

    "abstract": "The Children of the Twins Early Development Study (CoTEDS) is a new prospective children-of-twins study in the UK, designed to investigate intergenerational associations across child developmental stages. CoTEDS will enable research on genetic and environmental factors that underpin parent-child associations, with a focus on mental health and cognitive-related traits. Through CoTEDS, we will have a new lens to examine the roles that parents play in influencing child development, as well as the genetic and environmental factors that shape parenting behavior and experiences. Recruitment is ongoing from the sample of approximately 20,000 contactable adult twins who have been enrolled in the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) since infancy. TEDS twins are invited to register all offspring to CoTEDS at birth, with 554 children registered as of May 2019. By recruiting the second generation of TEDS participants, CoTEDS will include information on adult twins and their offspring from infancy. Parent questionnaire-based data collection is now underway for 1- and 2-year-old CoTEDS infants, with further waves of data collection planned. Current data collection includes the following primary constructs: child mental health, temperament, language and cognitive development; parent mental health and social relationships; parenting behaviors and feelings; and other socioecological factors. Measurement tools have been selected with reference to existing genetically informative cohort studies to ensure overlap in phenotypes measured at corresponding stages of development. This built-in study overlap is intended to enable replication and triangulation of future analyses across samples and research designs. Here, we summarize study protocols and measurement procedures and describe future plans.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the structural similarity of the optic disc and peripapillary region between monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs. Through these analyses, we sought to determine whether these structures are more likely to be affected by genetic or environmental factors.\nUsing fundus photographs of 362 MZ twins, cup-to-disc ratio, tilt ratio of the optic disc, and the angle between the major temporal retinal vessels were measured. We also checked for the presence of peripapillary atrophy (PPA) and, if present, recorded its size and direction. We compared the level of consistency of these parameters and axial length (AL) between the right and left eyes within each individual and also between the corresponding paired eyes of the twins. Subgroup analysis was performed according to age and the difference in the AL between the twin pairs.\nThe mean (SD) age of the twins included in this study was 38.6 years (8.1). The size of the PPA was significantly correlated with the AL, but not with the intraocular pressure. For PPA-related factors, the level of consistency was weaker between corresponding paired eyes of the twins than between the right and left eyes within each individual. The level of consistency of the AL was the strongest in both comparisons. The level of consistency of both PPA-related factors and tilt ratio between the corresponding paired eyes of the twins was weaker in the group with a larger intertwin difference of AL than in the group with a smaller difference. Subgroup analyses by age (older age group, 45.3\u00b16.3\u2009y; younger age group, 32.4\u00b12.7\u2009y) showed that the level of consistency of PPA-related factors was weaker in the older age group than in the younger age group, after adjusting the AL.\nUnlike AL and cup-to-disc ratio, similarity of PPA between MZ twins decreased with age, suggesting that PPA could be formed as a result of various factors in addition to genetic ones.",

    "abstract": "Localized aggressive periodontal disease is an uncommon finding observed in adolescents and children. Studies have been conducted to elucidate the etiology, contributing factors, and genetic roles in the phenomena. In particular, twin studies have shown genetic makeup to be a substantial risk factor for periodontitis. This case is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first to be presented in literature of a same dwelling, set of monozygotic twins, displaying similar presentation of localized aggressive periodontitis, however with different microbial profiles.\nA set of 17-year-old black male monozygotic twins were referred for a full-mouth periodontal evaluation and any necessary periodontal treatment on July 7, 2007. A full-mouth radiographic series, periodontal charting, and intraoral photographs were performed on each individual. A family history was obtained through the biological mother, which yielded no known history of early tooth loss or treatment of severe periodontal disease. The father was not involved in the rearing of the children and his periodontal history was unavailable. An initial and surgical treatment plan was developed. Microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples was collected on the affected sites. Initial treatment with scaling and root planing, subgingival irrigation, with administration of systemic antibiotics, and oral hygiene instruction, were rendered on both individuals.\nWithin limitations of this report, it is demonstrated that different microbial pattern exists on aggressive periodontitis even in genetically identical individuals with the same environmental exposure.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twining is a rare medical phenomenon, with an overall prevalence of 1.47 per 100\u2009000 births. This report describes a successful separation of xypho-omphalopagus conjoined twins complicated by unbalanced blood shunting through the porto-systemic anastomoses within the shared liver parenchyma. Significant extrauterine twin-twin transfusion syndrome caused by unbalanced shunting is an extremely rare, and probably under-recognized, hemodynamic complication in conjoined twins necessitating urgent separation. Progressive deterioration with a poor outcome can be prevented if the condition is recognized in a timely manner.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a severe and debilitating mental disorder diagnosed by evaluation of affective, cognitive and physical depression symptoms. Severity of these symptoms strongly impacts individual's quality of life and is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. One of the molecular mechanisms allowing for an interplay between these factors is DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification playing a pivotal role in regulation of brain functioning across lifespan. The aim of this study was to investigate if there are DNA methylation signatures associated with depression symptomatology in order to identify molecular mechanisms contributing to pathophysiology of depression. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of continuous depression symptomatology score measured in a cohort of 724 monozygotic Danish twins (346 males, 378 females). Through EWAS analyses adjusted for sex, age, flow-cytometry based blood cell composition, and twin relatedness structure in the data we identified depression symptomatology score to be associated with blood DNA methylation levels in promoter regions of neuropsin (KLK8, p-value\u2009=\u20094.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910",

    "abstract": "The 2020 Strategic Impact Goal introduced by the American Heart Association (AHA) aims at improving cardiovascular health (CVH) of all Americans by 20%. AHA defined ideal CVH across seven established modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Prior studies have indicated that ideal CVH also benefits brain health and cognitive aging, but it is possible that this association is explained by familial factors.\nWe examined 272 male monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs (total 544 subjects) free of overt cardiovascular disease and dementia from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Memory and learning were measured by Trail Making tests and Wechsler Memory Scale (Immediate and Delayed Memory tests and Visual Reproductive Test). Each of the seven CVH components (smoking, body mass index, physical activity, diet, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose) was scored per established criterion.\nThe mean age of the twins was 55 years, 96% were whites, and 61% monozygotic. When considering twins as individuals, for every unit increase in CVH score (indicating better cardiovascular health), twins demonstrated faster cognitive processing speed (Trail B: - 5.6\u200as, 95% CI - 10.3, - 0.9; p\u200a=\u200a0.03) and better story recall, both immediate (0.35, 95% CI 0.06, 0.62; p\u200a=\u200a0.02) and delayed (0.39, 95% CI 0.08, 0.70; p\u200a=\u200a0.01).\nBetter CVH is associated with better cognitive health in several domains. As suggested by within-pair analysis, this association is largely explained by familial factors, implying that early life exposures are shared determinants of both brain health and cardiovascular health.",

    "abstract": "Although intertwin size difference is an important measure of fetal growth, the appropriate cut point to define discordance is unclear. Few studies have assessed intertwin differences in estimated fetal weight longitudinally or in relation to size differences at birth.\nThe objectives of the study were to estimate the magnitude of percentage differences in estimated fetal weight across gestation in dichorionic twins in relation to a fixed discordance cut point and compare classification of aberrant fetal growth by different measures (estimated fetal weight differences, birthweight discordance, small for gestational age).\nWomen aged 18-45 years from 8 US centers with dichorionic twin pregnancies at 8 weeks 0 days to 13 weeks 6 days gestation planning to deliver in participating hospitals were recruited into the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Dichorionic Twins study and followed through delivery (n\u00a0= 140; 2012-2013). Ultrasounds were conducted at 6 targeted study visits to obtain fetal biometrics and calculate estimated fetal weight. Percent estimated fetal weight and birthweight differences were calculated: ([weight\nMedian estimated fetal weight percentage difference increased across gestation (5.9% at 15.0, 8.4% at 38.0 weeks), with greater disparities at higher percentiles (eg, 90th percentile: 15.6% at 15.0, 26.3% at 38.0 weeks). As gestation advanced, an increasing percentage of pregnancies were classified as discordant using a fixed cut point: 10% at 27.0, 15% at 34.0, and 20% at 38.0 weeks. Birthweight discordance and small for gestational age classifications differed (P\u00a0= .002); for birthweight discordance \u226518% vs <18%: 44% vs 71% had neither small for gestational age; 56% vs 18% had 1 small for gestational age; no cases (0%) vs 11% had both small for gestational age, respectively. Estimated fetal weight percent difference varied across gestation by birthweight discordance plus small for gestational age classification (P\u00a0= .040). Estimated fetal weight percentage difference increased with birthweight discordance \u226518% (neither small for gestational age: 0.46%/week [95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.84]; 1 small for gestational age: 0.57%/week [95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.90]) but less so without birthweight discordance (neither small for gestational age: 0.17%/week [95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.28]; 1 small for gestational age: 0.03%/week [95% confidence interval, -0.17 to 0.24]); both small for gestational age: 0.10%/week [95% confidence interval, -0.15 to 0.36]).\nThe percentage of dichorionic pregnancies exceeding a fixed discordance cut point increased over gestation. A fixed cut point for defining twin discordance would identify an increasing percentage of twins as discordant as gestation advances. Small for gestational age and percentage weight differences assess distinct aspects of dichorionic twin growth. A percentile cut point may be more clinically useful for defining discordance, although further study is required to assess whether any specific percentile cut point correlates to adverse outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Variation in facial emotion processing abilities may contribute to variability in penetrance for psychotic symptoms in 22q11.2DS. However, the precise nature of the social cognitive dysfunction (i.e., facial expression perception vs. emotion recognition), the potential additional roles of genetic and environmental variabilities, and consequently the possibility of using this neurocognitive marker in clinical monitoring remain unclear. The present case study aimed at testing the hypothesis that when confounding factors are controlled, the presence of psychotic symptoms in 22q11.2DS is associated, at the individual level, with a neural marker of facial expression perception rather than explicit emotional face recognition. Two monozygotic twins with 22q11.2DS discordant for psychiatric manifestations performed (1) a classical facial emotion labelling task and (2) an implicit neural measurement of facial expression perception using a frequency-tagging approach in electroencephalography (EEG). Analysis of the periodic brain response elicited by a change of facial expression from neutrality indicated that the twin with psychotic symptoms did not detect emotion among neutral faces while the twin without the symptoms did. In contrast, both encountered difficulties labelling facial emotion. The results from this exploratory twin study support the idea that impaired facial expression perception rather than explicit recognition of the emotion expressed might be a neurocognitive endophenotype of psychotic symptoms that could be reliable at a clinical level. Although confirmatory studies should be required, it facilitates further discussion on the etiology of the clinical phenotype in 22q11.2DS.",

    "abstract": "A growing evidence base supports early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) for young children with autism spectrum disorder. We have found only one study exploring the outcome of EIBI for children with Rett syndrome, which reported little effect. It suggested that future studies should employ more fine-grained outcome measures. We provided EIBI for twin 3-year-old girls with Rett syndrome for a period of 3 years. We analyzed raw scores and standard scores from a measure of adaptive behavior and a detailed assessment of skills across 25 areas. We detected moderate but clinically meaningful gains in areas such as communication and self-help. Gains are discussed from a quality of life perspective and whether the moderate effects can justify the resources required in EIBI.",

    "abstract": "The chromatin remodeling AT-Rich interaction domain containing 1B protein (ARID1B) also known as BAF-associated factor, 250-KD, B (BAF250B) codified by the ARID1B gene (MIM#614556), is a small subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF or BAF complex, an ATP-dependent protein machinery which is able to activate or repress gene transcription, allowing protein access to histones through DNA relaxed conformation. ARID1B gene mutations have been associated with two hereditary syndromic conditions, namely Coffin-Siris (CSS, MIM#135900) and Nicolaides-Baraitser syndromes (NCBRS, MIM#601358), characterized by neurodevelopment delay, craniofacial dysmorphisms and skeletal anomalies. Furthermore, intellectual impairment and central nervous system (CNS) alterations, comprising abnormal corpus callosum, have been associated with mutations in this gene. Moreover, ARID1B anomalies resulted to be involved in neoplastic events and Hirschprung disease. Here we report on two monozygotic male twins, displaying clinical appearance strikingly resembling NCBRS and CSS phenotype, who resulted carriers of a novel 6q25.3 microdeletion, encompassing only part of the ARID1B gene. The deleted segment was not inherited from the only parent tested and afflicted the first exons of the gene, coding for protein disordered region. We also provide, for the first time, a review of previously published ARID1B mutated patients with NCBRS and CSS phenotype and a computer-assisted dysmorphology analysis of NCBRS and ARID1B related CSS individuals, through the Face2Gene suite, confirming the existence of highly overlapping facial gestalt of both conditions. The present findings indicate that ARID1B could be considered a contributing gene not only in CSS but also in NCBRS phenotype, although the main gene related to this latter condition is the SMARCA2 gene (MIM#600014), another component of the BAF complex. So, ARID1B study should be considered in such individuals.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in KDM5C (lysine (K)-specific demethylase 5C) were causally associated with up to 3% of X-linked intellectual disability (ID) in males. By exome and Sanger sequencing, a novel frameshift KDM5C variant, predicted to eliminate the JmjC catalytic domain from the protein, was identified in two monozygotic twins and their older brother, which was inherited from their clinically normal mother, who had completely skewed X-inactivation. DNA methylation (DNAm) data were evaluated using the Illumina 450\u202fK Methylation Beadchip arrays. Comparison of methylation levels between the three patients and male controls identified 399 differentially methylated CpG sites, which were enriched among those CpG sites modulated during brain development. Most of them were hypomethylated (72%), and located mainly in shores, whereas the hypermethylated CpGs were more represented in open sea regions. The DNAm changes did not differ between the monozygotic twins nor between them and their older sibling, all presenting a global hypomethylation, similar to other studies that associated DNA methylation changes to different KDM5C mutations. The 38 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were enriched for H3K4me3 marks identified in developing brains. The remarkable similarity between the methylation changes in the monozygotic twins and their older brother is indicative that these epigenetic changes were mostly driven by the KDM5C mutation.",

    "abstract": "Low birth-weight (bw), low birth-length (bl), unfavourable intrauterine conditions and post-natal catch-up growth can have an impact on growth and metabolic health later in life.\nWe studied genetically identical twins with intra-twin bw-differences due to twin-twin transfusion syndrome from birth to adolescence and analysed the long-term impact of bw and catch-up growth on metabolic parameters.\nForty-three postpubertal monozygotic twin-pairs (mean age 17.4 years) were examined. Twenty-two pairs were discordant (intra-twin bw- and/or bl-difference \u22651 SDS) of which 12 (55%) experienced catch-up growth. Auxological parameters and blood pressure were measured, a fasting blood sample was collected and bio-impedance spectroscopy was carried out.\nIrrespective of differences in birth parameters and postnatal catch-up growth, a significant intra-twin correlation was found for nearly all measured parameters of body composition (skinfold, waist-hip circumference, relative body fat/lean body mass) and metabolic health (total, and low-density lipoprotein-C/high-density lipoprotein-C, Apolipoprotein A and B, C-peptide). As an exception to this, and only for the former smaller twins who showed postnatal catch-up growth, a significantly higher fasting insulin level was found compared to that of the co-twins (mean insulin level: 8.4 vs. 5.7 \u00b5IU/mL; p < 0.01). Auxology remained different until adulthood: even in subjects with catch-up growth the former smaller twins were significantly lighter (mean-body mass index-SDS: -0.42 vs. 0.21; p < 0.05) and shorter (mean height-SDS: -0.07 vs. 0.37; p < 0.05) than their co-twins.\nIn this special group of monozygotic twins with intra-twin bw-differences and catch-up growth, we found that the genetic background was a more important factor in determining later metabolic health than bw and/or catch-up growth.",

As an exception to this, and only for the former smaller twins who showed postnatal catch-up growth, a significantly higher fasting insulin level was found compared to that of the co-twins (mean insulin level: 8.4 vs. 5.7 \u00b5IU/mL; p < 0.01). Auxology remained different until adulthood: even in subjects with catch-up growth the former smaller twins were significantly lighter (mean-body mass index-SDS: -0.42 vs. 0.21; p < 0.05) and shorter (mean height-SDS: -0.07 vs. 0.37; p < 0.05) than their co-twins.",

    "abstract": "A cycle in a brain network is a subset of a connected component with redundant additional connections. If there are many cycles in a connected component, the connected component is more densely connected. Whereas the number of connected components represents the integration of the brain network, the number of cycles represents how strong the integration is. However, it is unclear how to perform statistical inference on the number of cycles in the brain network. In this study, we present a new statistical inference framework for determining the significance of the number of cycles through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance, which was recently introduced to measure the similarity between networks across different filtration values by using the zeroth Betti number. In this paper, we show how to extend the method to the first Betti number, which measures the number of cycles. The performance analysis was conducted using the random network simulations with ground truths. By using a twin imaging study, which provides biological ground truth, the methods are applied in determining if the number of cycles is a statistically significant heritable network feature in the resting-state functional connectivity in 217 twins obtained from the Human Connectome Project.

    "abstract": "To compare complication rates following amniocentesis in twin gestations, according to sampling technique and number of needle insertions.\nA retrospective cohort study of all women with twin gestations who underwent amniocentesis and delivered in a single university affiliated medical center during 2002-2016. Amniocentesis was performed either through one uterine entry with passage through the inter-twin membrane or through two different entries to the two amniotic sacs. Pregnancy outcome of women that underwent single needle insertion amniocentesis, was compared to this of double needle insertion. Primary outcome was neonatal complications within 4 weeks after amniocentesis (late abortion, chorioamnionitis, preterm premature rupture of membranes, or hospitalization due to related symptoms). Secondary outcomes were gestational week at delivery and labor characteristics.\nThe study group comprised 212 women. Of them, 73 (34.4%) underwent a single uterine insertion and 139 (65.6%) two separate needle insertions. Baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups. The amniocentesis complication rate was 13.7% in the single insertion group and 16.5% in the double insertion group (p\u2009=\u20090.587). Multivariate analysis found that a single insertion method had no statistically significant influence on complication rate, after making adjustments for potential confounders (OR\u2009=\u20091.085, 95% CI 0.4-2.9; p\u2009=\u20090.871). Other labor characteristics were similar between the groups.\nNeedle insertion technique in twin gestation amniocentesis was not associated with procedure related complications.",

Twin studies provide significant insight into how many genetic and environmental factors determine dental and craniofacial characteristics.\nThe aim of the study was to determine the genetic influence on craniofacial complex using a twin study model.\nThe study sample comprised 52 pairs of twins who were referred to the Orthodontic Department, School of Dental medicine, University of Sarajevo. Informed consent was obtained by the parents of the children included in the study. Twenty pairs of twins were diagnosed as monozygotic while 32 pairs were diagnosed as dizygotic. Zygosity was diagnosed by physical characteristics similarity. Nineteen variables were measured: 10 dental variables, 9 cephalometric.\nBased on the findings of this study, t-test showed significant genetic effect on the length of cranial base (p = 0.03), corpus of maxilla (p = 0.02) and mandibular length (p = 0.03), and also for B-angle (p = 0.04).

The primary outcome was whether a child met the National Minimum Standard (NMS) cut-off in literacy and numeracy domains. Robust multivariable Poisson models were used to obtain adjusted relative risks (aRRs), and mediation analysis conducted to assess contributing factors on the causal pathway.\nOf 351\u00a0791 liveborn infants, 10\u00a0365 (2.9%) were twins. After adjusting for maternal covariates and compared with singletons, twins had an increased risk of not meeting the NMS for all five literacy and numeracy domains (aRR 1.27-1.45, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Gestational age alone mediated up to 73% of aRRs and small for gestational age further attenuated these effects with only minimal risk remaining after adjusting for all mediators (aRR 0.94-1.07).\nAlmost all of the educational disadvantage experienced by twins, compared with singletons, is attributable to the risk associated with shorter gestational age, and partly by poor foetal growth.

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are rare developmental anomalies. There is a paucity of literature other than case reports and small case series. The aim of this study was to examine national outcomes and identify predictors of mortality in newborn conjoined twins.\nWe reviewed data on newborn conjoined twins from the Kids' Inpatient Database (1997-2012).\nA total of 240 patients were identified for a nationally weighted incidence of 1 per 100,000 live births. The majority of conjoined twins were female (n\u00a0= 190 [81%]). The most commonly associated anomalies were cardiac (n\u00a0= 87 [36%]), gastrointestinal (n\u00a0= 41 [17%]), and abdominal wall (n\u00a0= 32 [13%]) defects. Fifty-six (23%) patients underwent operative procedures, including 28 (12%) neonatal separation surgeries. The overall mortality rate was 61%; most deaths occurred within 24 hours (99 of 146 [68%]) to 48 hours (129 of 146 [88%]) after birth. Mortality was higher in female compared with male children (66% vs 38%, P\u00a0= .025), premature compared with full-term children (72% vs 44%, P\u00a0= .007), and in children with extremely low birth weight (95% vs 59%, P\u00a0= .002). Congenital diaphragmatic hernias were seen in 15 (6%) patients and were uniformly fatal (100% vs 58%, P\u00a0= .029). Mortality was highest in hospitals not designated as children's hospitals (72%) compared with children's hospitals (44%) (P\u00a0= .007).\nConjoined twins are rare anomalies who are susceptible to extremely high perinatal mortality, especially in female children, those who are premature, or those who have low birth weight. These data support caring for these complex patients at hospitals equipped to care for this fragile population.",

Fifty-six (23%) patients underwent operative procedures, including 28 (12%) neonatal separation surgeries. The overall mortality rate was 61%; most deaths occurred within 24 hours (99 of 146 [68%]) to 48 hours (129 of 146 [88%]) after birth. Mortality was higher in female compared with male children (66% vs 38%, P\u00a0= .025), premature compared with full-term children (72% vs 44%, P\u00a0= .007), and in children with extremely low birth weight (95% vs 59%, P\u00a0= .002). Congenital diaphragmatic hernias were seen in 15 (6%) patients and were uniformly fatal (100% vs 58%, P\u00a0= .029).

    "abstract": "We describe two cases of monochorionic twins with severe anemia in the surviving twin after cord occlusion. The first one was a case of discordant malformation (anencephalia) and the second one was a case of early severe selective intrauterine growth restriction type II in a dichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancy. In both cases, the cord of the occluded fetus had a marginal insertion. Both of them presented hydrops 2\u00a0d after the occlusion, having measurements of the peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) above 1.5\u00a0multiples of the median (MoM). In the first one intrauterine transfusion was performed with pretransfusion measurement of fetal hemoglobin of 3.3\u2009g/dL. An extensive area of destruction of brain tissue at the right parietal-temporal-occipital level was diagnosed at 300\u00a0weeks. In the second one, expectant management was decided and a grade\u00a03 intraventricular hemorrhage associated with moderate ventriculomegaly was detected at 22\u00a0weeks' gestation. We hypothesize that the surviving fetus after the occlusion can become bloodless and hypovolemic when its blood is poured into the placental and umbilical circulation of the occluded twin through the vascular anastomoses between them. It should not be assumed that cord occlusion removes the risk of transfusional brain injury in surviving-cotwins.",

    "abstract": "Twins experience altered growth compared to singletons. The primary aim of this study was to compare growth and body composition (BC) of twin and singleton preterm infants from birth to 3 months according to gestational age (GA). Secondary aims were to evaluate the effect of chorionicity and mode of feeding on twins' BC.\nAnthropometric measurements and BC were performed at term and 3 months in preterm infants (GA\u2009<\u200937 weeks). Infants were categorized as: extremely, very, moderate and late preterm infants. Chorionicity was assigned as monochorionic, dichorionic or multichorionic. Mode of feeding was recorded as any human milk feeding vs formula feeding.\nFive hundred and seventy-six preterm infants were included (223 twins). Late-preterm twins were lighter and shorter at each study point; fat-free mass (FFM) was lower in these infants at each study point, compared to singletons. No differences were found between twins and singleton on the other category. Multichorionic infants had an FFM deficit compared to monochorionic and dichorionic at term, whereas no differences were found at 3 months. FFM at term was negatively associated with being twin and formula-fed.\nTwins and singletons born before 34 weeks' GA showed similar anthropometry and BC. Conversely, twin late-preterm infants showed different growth and BC compared to singletons.",

    "abstract": "To review the perinatal and long-term outcomes of symmetric and ventrally conjoined twins evaluated prenatally by ultrasound and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nFrom March 2010 to January 2019, cases of symmetric and ventrally conjoined twins, who were prenatally diagnosed and referred to the Cl\u00ednica Diagn\u00f3stico por Imagem (CDPI), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for prenatal evaluation by ultrasound and MRI were selected. The postnatal information was collected from hospitals where the twins were born and/or treated and from parents' verbal and written information.\nFour cases of symmetrical and ventrally conjoined twins were selected. Of these, two were omphalopagi and two thoracopagi. One pair of thoracomphalopagus died early \nDespite the apparently similar conditions of twins with ventral fusion, ventrally attached twins have very different outcomes, most adverse for thoracomphalopagus and related to the singular anatomy of the pair, associated malformations and the extension of the adhesion, requiring individual evaluation of the cases. Fetal MRI is as an important tool for the postnatal surgery management of twin neonates, providing crucial information in cases where urgent separation is required.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social communication coupled with stereotyped behaviors and restricted interests. Despite the high concordance rate for diagnosis, there is little information on the magnitude of genetic contributions to specific ASD behaviors. Using behavioral/trait severity scores from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) diagnostic instrument, we compared the phenotypic profiles of mono- and dizygotic twins where both co-twins were diagnosed with ASD or only one twin had a diagnosis. The trait distribution profiles across the respective twin populations were first used for quantitative trait association analyses using publicly available genome-wide genotyping data. Trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were then used for case-control association analyses, in which cases were defined as individuals in the lowest (Q1) and highest (Q4) quartiles of the severity distribution curves for each trait. While all of the ASD-diagnosed twins exhibited similar trait severity profiles, the non-autistic dizygotic twins exhibited significantly lower ADI-R item scores than the non-autistic monozygotic twins. Case-control association analyses of twins stratified by trait severity revealed statistically significant SNPs with odds ratios that clearly distinguished individuals in Q4 from those in Q1. While the level of shared genomic variation is a strong determinant of the severity of autistic traits in the discordant non-autistic twins, the similarity of trait profiles in the concordantly autistic dizygotic twins also suggests a role for environmental influences. Stratification of cases by trait severity resulted in the identification of statistically significant SNPs located near genes over-represented within autism gene datasets.",

    "abstract": "Uterine rupture is a rare occurrence that requires a high index of suspicion, particularly in a primigravid patient who presents prior to the onset of labor. Mortality rates are particularly high in primigravid patients.\nA 36-year-old gravida 1, para 0 patient with dichorionic diamniotic twins presented at 28-weeks of gestation with abdominal pain. The pain was initially intermittent and felt to be musculoskeletal in origin. Ultrasound imaging after 3 days of worsening abdominal pain revealed extrauterine fluid, prompting an urgent MRI. MRI diagnosed the uterine rupture with hemoperitoneum and herniation of both amniotic sacs outside of the uterus, including one twin's torso and extremities, prompting emergency cesarean section. The premature twins required 2-month hospitalizations and had no neurodevelopmental impairments at 2-year follow-up.\nWe present a unique case of rupture of an unscarred uterus in a primigravid patient prior to the onset of labor. Multiple gestation is a risk factor. This report adds to a handful of cases in which a history of endometriosis or extrauterine pelvic surgery was also present. The use of ultrasound and MRI to evaluate nonspecific abdominal pain led to the diagnosis and survival of both the mother and her premature twins.",

    "abstract": "The COllaborative project of Development of Anthropometrical measures in Twins (CODATwins) project is a large international collaborative effort to analyze individual-level phenotype data from twins in multiple cohorts from different environments. The main objective is to study factors that modify genetic and environmental variation of height, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) and size at birth, and additionally to address other research questions such as long-term consequences of birth size. The project started in 2013 and is open to all twin projects in the world having height and weight measures on twins with information on zygosity. Thus far, 54 twin projects from 24 countries have provided individual-level data. The CODATwins database includes 489,981 twin individuals (228,635 complete twin pairs). Since many twin cohorts have collected longitudinal data, there is a total of 1,049,785 height and weight observations. For many cohorts, we also have information on birth weight and length, own smoking behavior and own or parental education. We found that the heritability estimates of height and BMI systematically changed from infancy to old age. Remarkably, only minor differences in the heritability estimates were found across cultural-geographic regions, measurement time and birth cohort for height and BMI. In addition to genetic epidemiological studies, we looked at associations of height and BMI with education, birth weight and smoking status. Within-family analyses examined differences within same-sex and opposite-sex dizygotic twins in birth size and later development. The CODATwins project demonstrates the feasibility and value of international collaboration to address gene-by-exposure interactions that require large sample sizes and address the effects of different exposures across time, geographical regions and socioeconomic status.",

    "abstract": "The National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC) Twin Registry is one of the oldest, national population-based twin registries in the USA. It comprises 15,924 White male twin pairs born in the years 1917-1927 (N = 31.848), both of whom served in the armed forces, chiefly during World War II. This article updates activities in this registry since the most recent report in Twin Research and Human Genetics (Page, 2006). Records-based data include information from enlistment charts and Veterans Administration data linkages. There have been three major epidemiologic questionnaires and an education and earnings survey. Separate data collection efforts with the NAS-NRC registry include the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) subsample, the Duke Twins Study of Memory in Aging and a clinically based study of Parkinson's disease. Progress has been made on consolidating the various data holdings of the NAS-NRC Twin Registry. Data that had been available through the National Academy of Sciences are now freely available through National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA).",

    "abstract": "This article reviews the Southern Illinois Twins/Triplets and Siblings Study (SITSS) and describes some of the findings related to recent projects that were completed using this sample. At this time, the SITSS has enrolled 375 twin pairs, 12 triplet families, 1 family of quadruplets, 98 nontwin sibling pairs and 287 singletons. Testing begins for twins and triplets as young as age 1 and then occurs yearly on their birthdays until 5 years of age. Through age 20, various follow-up studies have been conducted on the SITSS sample to examine their social, emotional, and cognitive development across childhood and adolescence from a behavioral genetic perspective. A variety of methodologies have been used to investigate gene-environment correlations (rGE) and gene-environment interactions (GxE). Advanced statistical procedures (e.g., genetic likelihood indices and multilevel modeling) have been utilized to further investigate genetic underpinnings of behavior. Recent results have indicated genetic influences on the aggressiveness of preschoolers' media preferences, increased problem behaviors related to young children's overestimation of self-competence, and the influence of early life temperament and internalizing problems on adolescent health behaviors. Additionally, the SITSS has provided evidence for evocative rGE for various behaviors (aggression, prosocial and play), as well as findings supporting interactions between the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) and the environment (peer victimization, prenatal birth complications and parental sensitivity). Together, by use of multitrait and multimethodological investigations, this behavior genetic data set assists in furthering our understanding of biological and environmental influences on children's development.",

    "abstract": "Adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF) is necessary to maintain brain metabolism and function. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is an emerging MRI technique offering a non-invasive and reliable quantification of CBF. The genetic basis of CBF has not been well documented, and one approach to investigate this is to examine its heritability. The current study aimed to examine the heritability of CBF using ASL data from a cohort of community-dwelling older twins (41 monozygotic (MZ) and 25 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs; age range, 65-93 years; 56.4% female). The results showed that the cortex had higher CBF than subcortical gray matter (GM) regions, and CBF in the GM regions of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory was lower than that of the middle (MCA) and posterior (PCA) cerebral arteries. After accounting for the effects of age, sex and scanner, moderate heritability was identified for global CBF (",

    "abstract": "The aetiology of trigger digits has been debated since Notta first described them in 1850. Aetiology has been segregated for adult and paediatric presentations. While an adult trigger digit is most likely an acquired inflammatory process, the same is not true for cases in children: no inflammatory reaction is seen on microscopic evaluation. We wish to add strength to a genotypical aetiology for paediatric cases.\nWe present two cases of monozygotic twins with trigger digits managed in our institution. A comprehensive review of literature was conducted for cases of trigger digit in monozygotic twins to support our theory.\nOur two sets of twins enjoyed a full recovery from surgery at one-month follow-up. A total of seven other cases of monozygotic twins were found in literature.\nOur cases add to the growing body of evidence supporting a genotypical aetiology for paediatric trigger digit.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is said to be beneficial to many bodily functions. However, the effects of PA in the brain are still inadequately known. The authors aimed to uncover possible brain modulation linked with PA. Here, they combine 4 of their studies with monozygotic twins, who were within-pair discordant in PA for a minimum of 1 year.\nThe authors performed brain imaging, brain electrophysiology, and cardiovascular and body composition assessments, and collected questionnaire-based data. The present synopsis elucidates the differences associated with differing PA history in conditions without genetic variability. They present new structural and electrophysiological results. Participants, healthy, 45 male monozygotic twins (mean age 34.5 [1.5] y) differed in aerobic capacity and fat percentage (P < .001).\nMore active co-twins showed larger gray matter volumes in striatal, prefrontal, and hippocampal regions, and smaller gray matter volumes in the anterior cingulate area than less active co-twins. Functionally, visual and somatosensory automatic change detection processes differed between more and less active co-twins.\nIn monozygotic twins, who differed in their PA history, differences were observed in identifiable anatomic brain locations involved with motor control and memory functions, as well as in electrophysiological measures detecting brain's automatic processes. Better aerobic capacity may modify brain morphology and sensory function.",

Proband was defined as the twin in the pair with a positive test at the first screening and a confirmed diagnosis of CH.\nSeven screening discordant twin pairs became concordant for CH within the first month of life (pairwise concordance of 14.9%) because seven screening negative cotwins showed high TSH values when retested. During long-term follow-up (range, 3 to 21 years), hypothyroidism was diagnosed in two monozygotic screening negative cotwins at the age of 9 months and 12 years, respectively. Furthermore, the twin analysis showed that 95% of liability to transient CH was explained by genetic factors and 5% by environmental (unshared) factors, whereas 64% of phenotypic variance of permanent CH was explained by common environmental factors (shared during the fetal life) and 36% by unshared environmental factors.\nThis study showed that the introduction of rescreening permits the diagnosis of CH in a greater number of twins. It also showed the importance of long-term follow-up in both twins in the pair, and the role of nongenetic factors in the etiology of permanent CH.",

We studied the survival of 306,966 children, including 9,280 twins, over the period 1970-2013 in six Arab countries (Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Mauritania, Sudan and Tunisia) based on the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) database. With the use of relative survival models, we estimated the mortality of twins relative to singletons by including socioeconomic and demographic variables. This study confirms the results of previous studies on the excess risk of death of twins compared to singletons. There is evidence that excess mortality decreases with follow-up; in addition, male twins have a higher risk of death compared to females for all countries except Tunisia. Wealth index and education levels of women are factors that influence the risk of mortality. It is recommended that these findings are considered when performing future health and population strategies in these Arab countries.",

    "abstract": "Blood and lymphatic systems work in close collaboration to ensure their respective physiological functions. The lymphatic vessel network is being extensively studied, but has been overlooked as compared to the blood vasculature mainly due to the problematic discrimination of lymphatic vessels from the blood ones. This issue has been fortunately resolved in the past decade leading to the emergence of a huge amount of data in lymphatic biology revealing many shared features with the blood vasculature. However, this likeliness between the two vascular systems may lead to a simplistic view of lymphatics and a direct transcription of what is known for the blood system to the lymphatic one, thereby neglecting the lymphatic specificities. In this context, this review aims to clarify the main differences between the two vascular systems focusing on recently discovered lymphatic features.",

    "abstract": "Head injury during development has been associated with behavioral changes such as impulsivity and antisocial behavior. This study investigates the extent to which behavioral changes associated with childhood head injury are sustained through adolescence and emerging adulthood.\nSurvey data was collected at 5 waves spanning 12 years (ages 9-20) from the University of Southern California Risk Factors for Antisocial Behavior twin study. Impulsivity was measured by errors of commission in a Go/NoGo behavioral task, and aggression was measured through youth self-report using the Reactive-Proactive Aggression Questionnaire. Head injury was assessed retrospectively using caregiver questionnaires at twin ages 14-15 years and self-reported at ages 19-20 years.\nParticipants with a head injury in early childhood showed significant delay in the normative developmental decline of impulsivity relative to the noninjured by mid-adolescence (ages 14-15.) Moreover, earlier age at injury was related to a slower decrease in impulsivity and greater increase in reactive aggression scores. Finally, among discordant monozygotic twin pairs, the twin with a head injury experienced significantly less decline in impulsivity by ages 19-20 than the noninjured co-twin.\nThese findings indicate early childhood head injury may play a significant role in blunting the decline in impulsivity across development, exposing an additional risk factor for antisocial behavior.

    "abstract": "Previous research has indicated that genetic and environmental factors shape physiological activity. Cortisol levels, in particular, have received significant attention, with studies indicating substantive heritability estimates across various sampling techniques. A related line of research has indicated that genetic and environmental factors that explain variability in cortisol levels may vary across context and experiences by way of gene-environment interactions (G \u00d7 Es). Despite these findings, a limited number of studies have examined the extent to which interpersonal relationships may operate as a moderator. The current study focused on co-twin relationship quality as a source of moderation, as twins are more likely to have contact with one another and to form close, interpersonal relationships with their co-twin relative to singleton siblings. Using a sample of 298 adult twins from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS), we examined the extent to which genetic and environmental factors that explain variability in urinary cortisol levels varied across levels of co-twin relationship quality. The heritability of cortisol levels was greater and nonshared environmental influences were lower at greater levels of relationship quality. These findings suggest that the heritability of cortisol may vary across context, and positive relationships with others may moderate such factors.",

    "abstract": "Hand grip strength is a measure of muscular strength and is used to study age-related loss of physical capacity. In order to explore the biological mechanisms that influence hand grip strength variation, an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of hand grip strength in 672 middle-aged and elderly monozygotic twins (age 55-90\u00a0years) was performed, using both individual and twin pair level analyses, the latter controlling the influence of genetic variation. Moreover, as measurements of hand grip strength performed over 8\u00a0years were available in the elderly twins (age 73-90 at intake), a longitudinal EWAS was conducted for this subsample. No genome-wide significant CpG sites or pathways were found, however two of the suggestive top CpG sites were mapped to the COL6A1 and CACNA1B genes, known to be related to muscular dysfunction. By investigating genomic regions using the comb-p algorithm, several differentially methylated regions in regulatory domains were identified as significantly associated to hand grip strength, and pathway analyses of these regions revealed significant pathways related to the immune system, autoimmune disorders, including diabetes type 1 and viral myocarditis, as well as negative regulation of cell differentiation. The genes contributing to the immunological pathways were HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DMA, HLA-DPB1, MYH10, ERAP1 and IRF8, while the genes implicated in the negative regulation of cell differentiation were IRF8, CEBPD, ID2 and BRCA1. In conclusion, this exploratory study suggests hand grip strength to associate with differentially methylated regions enriched in immunological and cell differentiation pathways, and hence merits further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This study examines the expressive language and speech of twins, relative to singletons, at 3 and 5 years, with the aim of determining if a twinning effect occurs during this developmental period. The possibility of twins outgrowing a twinning effect was investigated. Method A weighted population-based sample of 185 twins and 1,309 closely spaced singletons who participated in the Growing Up in Ireland study was analyzed. Their development was compared using a standardized expressive vocabulary assessment and parent interview at 3 and 5 years as well as teacher reports at 5 years. Causal steps mediation analyses were subsequently conducted to determine if gestation and birth weight mediated twin-singleton differences in expressive vocabulary development. Results Twins' expressive vocabulary scores were slightly lower than those of singletons at 3 years, but there was no significant difference at 5 years. More parents of twins reported \"a little\" concern about their child's expressive language and speech skills at 3 years, although there was no significant twin-singleton difference 2 years later. Teachers' ratings of twins' and singletons' expressive language and speech skills at 5 years were comparable. Shorter gestations and lower birth weights mediated twins' lower expressive vocabulary scores at 3 years. Conclusions A very small twinning effect on expressive vocabulary development exists at 3 years and is outgrown by 5 years. Twins born after shorter gestations or at a lower birth weight are at an increased risk of having less developed expressive vocabulary skills at 3 years.",

    "abstract": "Lynch syndrome (LS) is a highly penetrant inherited cancer predisposition syndrome, characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes. Despite several genetic variations that have been identified in various populations, the penetrance is highly variable and the reasons for this have not been fully elucidated. This study investigates whether, besides pathogenic mutations, environment and low penetrance genetic risk factors may result in phenotype modification in a Tunisian LS family.\nA Tunisian family with strong colorectal cancer (CRC) history that fulfill the Amsterdam I criteria for the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome was proposed for oncogenetic counseling. The index case was a man, diagnosed at the age of 33\u00a0years with CRC. He has a monozygotic twin diagnosed at the age of 35\u00a0years with crohn disease. Forty-seven years-old was the onset age of his paternal uncle withCRC. An immunohistochemical (IHC) labeling for the four proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) of the MisMatchRepair (MMR) system was performed for the index case. A targeted sequencing of MSH2, MLH1 and a panel of 85 DNA repair genes was performed for the index case and for his unaffected father.\nThe IHC results showed a loss of MSH2 but not MLH1, MSH6 and PMS2 proteins expression. Genomic DNA screening, by targeted DNA repair genes sequencing, revealed an MSH2 pathogenic mutation (c.1552C>T; p.Q518X), confirmed by Sanger sequencing. This mutation was suspected to be a causal mutation associated to the loss of MSH2 expression and it was found in first and second degree relatives. The index case has smoking and alcohol consumption habits. Moreover, he harbors extensive genetic variations in other DNA-repair genes not shared with his unaffected father.\nIn our investigated Tunisian family, we confirmed the LS by IHC, molecular and in silico investigations. We identified a novel pathogenic mutation described for the first time in Tunisia. These results come enriching the previously reported pathogenic mutations in LS families. Our study brings new arguments to the interpretation of MMR expression pattern and highlights new risk modifiers genes eventually implicated in CRC. Twins discordance reported in this work underscore that disease penetrance could be influenced by both genetic background and environmental factors.",

Genomic DNA screening, by targeted DNA repair genes sequencing, revealed an MSH2 pathogenic mutation (c.1552C>T; p.Q518X), confirmed by Sanger sequencing. This mutation was suspected to be a causal mutation associated to the loss of MSH2 expression and it was found in first and second degree relatives. The index case has smoking and alcohol consumption habits. Moreover, he harbors extensive genetic variations in other DNA-repair genes not shared with his unaffected father.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) twins are at an increased risk of developing congenital heart defects (CHDs) compared to singletons and dichorionic twins. The development of acquired CHDs in this specific group of twins is associated with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of the reported birth prevalence of CHDs in liveborn MC twins with and without TTTS. Twelve studies were included in this review. Compared to the reference population, MC twins were 6.3 times more likely to be born with a CHD (59.3 per 1000 liveborn twins; relative risk (RR) 6.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.4-9.1), and TTTS twins had a 12-fold increased risk of having a CHD at birth (87.3 per 1000 live births; RR 12.4, 95% CI: 8.6-17.8). The increased incidence of CHDs can mainly be attributed to the risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (35/1000 TTTS twin live births vs. 0.5/1000 singleton live births). We recommend an expert fetal echocardiogram in all MC twins, follow-up scans in the event of TTTS, and a postnatal cardiac evaluation in all TTTS survivors.",

    "abstract": "Broad and potent neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) with multiple epitope specificities evolve in HIV-1-infected children. Herein, we studied two antiretroviral-naive chronically HIV-1 clade C-infected monozygotic pediatric twins, AIIMS_329 and AIIMS_330, with potent plasma bnAbs. Elite plasma neutralizing activity was observed since the initial sampling at 78\u2009months of age in AIIMS_330 and persisted throughout, while in AIIMS_329 it was seen at 90 months of age, after which the potency decreased over time. We evaluated potential viral characteristics associated with the varied immune profiles by generating single genome-amplified pseudoviruses. The AIIMS_329 viruses generated from the 90-month time point were neutralization sensitive to bnAbs and contemporaneous plasma antibodies, while viruses from the 112-month and 117-month time points were resistant to most bnAbs and contemporaneous plasma. AIIMS_329 viruses developed resistance to plasma neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) plausibly by N160 glycan loss and V1 and V4 loop lengthening. The viruses generated from AIIMS_330 (at 90 and 117 months) showed varied susceptibility to bnAbs and autologous contemporaneous plasma antibodies, while the viruses of the 112-month time point, at which the plasma nAb specificities mapped to the V2 glycan, V3 glycan, and CD4 binding site (CD4bs), were resistant to contemporaneous plasma antibodies as well as to most bnAbs. Chimeric viruses were constructed from 90-month-time-point PG9-sensitive AIIMS_329 and AIIMS_330 viruses with swapped V1V2 regions of their respective evolved viruses (at 112 and 117 months), which led to higher resistance to neutralization by PG9 and autologous plasma antibodies. We observed the evolution of a viral pool in the AIIMS_330 donor comprising plasma antibody neutralization-sensitive or -resistant diverse autologous viruses that may have contributed to the development and maintenance of elite neutralizing activity.",

    "abstract": "This case study examined the hypothesis that longer outdoor time results in normal vision and refractive status, using unique genetically informative kinships. The participants were the members of 29-year-old doubly exchanged monozygotic male twin pairs from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, in South America. Comprehensive ophthalmological examinations, including uncorrected and corrected visual acuity, refraction and keratometry, and visual life history interviews were undertaken; all examinations were conducted by two ophthalmologists blind to the hypothesis, relatedness, and rearing status of the four participants. Normal uncorrected vision and refractive status were present in the two rural-raised, unrelated brothers, relative to their urban-raised counterparts. Uncorrected visual acuities were 20/160 and 20/200 for the city-raised twins and 20/20 and 20/30 for the country-raised twins. Premature birth, low birth weight, computer use, and reading time could not explain these differences. It was concluded that time spent outdoors appears to be a significant factor in the development of myopia, reinforcing extant findings via a novel experimental approach.",

    "abstract": "Differences in concordance rates between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been used to estimate genetic influences in PD pathogenesis. We hypothesized that \"discordance\" may not in all cases adequately reflect the multifaceted disease manifestation of PD that involves a continuum from prodromal to definite PD. Deep clinical phenotyping, combining motor, nonmotor, and imaging modalities in five monozygotic, seemingly discordant twin pairs revealed motor and/or nonmotor features and/or nigral hyperechogenicity in all of the five putatively unaffected twins. In conclusion, our data suggest that concordance rates in monozygotic twins may be higher than previously appreciated.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the consistency of 3 commonly used direct-to-consumer genetic testing kits. Genetic testing kits are widely marketed by several companies but the consistency of their results is unclear. Because identical twins share the same DNA, their genetic testing results should provide insight into test consistency.\nForty-two identical twins (21 pairs) provided samples for 3 testing companies. Outcomes were concordance of ancestry results when twin pairs were tested by the same company and the same participant was tested by different companies. Concordance of 8 self-reported traits with 23andMe genetic analyses were also examined.\nConcordance of ancestry results when twin pairs were tested by the same company was high, with mean percentage agreement ranging from 94.5% to 99.2%. Concordance of ancestry results when participants were tested by 2 different companies was lower, with mean percentage agreement ranging from 52.7% to 84.1%. Concordance of trait results was variable, ranging from 34.1% for deep sleep and detached earlobes to 90.2% for cleft chin.\nThe consistency of consumer genetic testing is high for ancestry results within companies but lower and more variable for ancestry results across companies and for specific traits. These results raise questions about the usefulness of such testing.",

    "abstract": "A literature review was carried out to identify pre and perinatal characteristics associated with variation in Apgar scores in population-based studies. The parameters identified in the literature search were included in the classical twin design study to estimate effects of pre and perinatal factors shared and nonshared by twins and to test for a contribution of genetic factors in 1- and 5-min Apgar scores in a large sample of Dutch monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. The sample included MZ and DZ twins (N = 5181 pairs) recruited by the Netherlands Twin Register shortly after birth, with data on prenatal characteristics and Apgar scores at first and/or fifth minutes. The ordinal regression and structural equation modeling were used to analyze the effects of characteristics identified in the literature review and to estimate genetic and nongenetic variance components. The literature review identified 63 papers. Consistent with the review, we observed statistically significant effects of birth order, zygosity and gestational age (GA) for 1- and 5-min Apgar scores of both twins. Apgar scores are higher in first-born versus second-born twins and DZ first-born versus MZ first-born twins. Birth weight had an effect on the 5-min Apgar of the first born. Fetal presentation and mode of delivery had different effects on Apgar scores of first- and second-born twins. Parental characteristics and chorionicity did not have significant main effects on Apgar scores. The MZ twins' Apgar correlations equaled the DZ Apgar correlations. Our analyses suggest that individual differences in 1- and 5-min Apgar scores are attributable to shared and nonshared pre and perinatal factors, but not to genotypic factors of the newborns. The main predictors of Apgar scores are birth order, zygosity, GA, birth weight, mode of delivery and fetal presentation.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes for the first time various forms of conjoined twins in the common whitefish Coregonus maraena originating from the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea. The occurrence of conjoined twins was observed during the hatching of whitefish under controlled conditions. Two types of twins were identified: symmetric (parapagus) and asymmetric (parasitic form). The percentage of conjoined twins among the whitefish did not exceed 0.01% of the hatched larvae. The forms of twins observed in this study were similar to conjoined twins occurring among humans. One main type, parapagus, was identified in the group of symmetric twins with 3 subtypes: diprosopus parapagus, dicephalic parapagus and dithoracic parapagus. In its parasitic form, the parasitic twin occurred as a 'cyclops' or just as an eye growing out of the other twin's head. We conclude that fish, as well as their fertilised eggs, can be used as a model system to observe how such twins are joined in humans because of the similarity with conjoined twins occurring in humans. Because of internal fertilisation in fish, as well as the size and transparency of egg cells in these animals, it is possible to observe the process of fertilisation, cell division and formation of an embryo and subsequently of twins, as a model for humans.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and environmental influences on age at menarche (AAM) have rarely been examined in Asian females. This study aimed to investigate the heritability of AAM in South Korean female twins. The AAM data from 1370 female twins (933 monozygotic [MZ] twins, 294 dizygotic [DZ] twins and 160 female members of opposite-sex DZ twins) born between 1988 and 2001 were analyzed. The age of the sample at the time of the assessment ranged from 16 to 28 years with a mean of 19.3 (SD = 2.2) years. The mean AAM in the total sample was 12.49 (SD = 1.41) years. Although the mean AAM decreased with increasing birth years, it levelled off in birth years 2000-2001. Maximum likelihood MZ and DZ twin correlations were 0.72 [95% CI (0.67, 0.76)] and 0.35 [95% CI (0.19, 0.50)], respectively. The results of model-fitting analysis indicated that the additive genetic and individual-specific environmental effects were 72% [95% CI (67%, 76%)] and 28% [95% CI (24%, 33%)], respectively. Neither nonadditive genetic nor shared environmental effects were significant.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterised by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons. ALS exhibits high phenotypic variability including age and site of onset, and disease duration. To uncover epigenetic and transcriptomic factors that may modify an ALS phenotype, we used a cohort of Australian monozygotic twins (n\u2009=\u20093 pairs) and triplets (n\u2009=\u20091 set) that are discordant for ALS and represent sporadic ALS and the two most common types of familial ALS, linked to C9orf72 and SOD1. Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip, EpiTYPER and RNA-Seq analyses in these ALS-discordant twins/triplets and control twins (n\u2009=\u20092 pairs), implicated genes with consistent longitudinal differential DNA methylation and/or gene expression. Two identified genes, RAD9B and C8orf46, showed significant differential methylation in an extended cohort of >1000 ALS cases and controls. Combined longitudinal methylation-transcription analysis within a single twin set implicated CCNF, DPP6, RAMP3, and CCS, which have been previously associated with ALS. Longitudinal transcriptome data showed an 8-fold enrichment of immune function genes and under-representation of transcription and protein modification genes in ALS. Examination of these changes in a large Australian sporadic ALS cohort suggest a broader role in ALS. Furthermore, we observe that increased methylation age is a signature of ALS in older patients.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a high-performance hyperspectral camera based on the Fourier-transform approach, where the two delayed images are generated by the Translating-Wedge-Based Identical Pulses eNcoding System (TWINS) [Opt. Lett. 37, 3027 (2012)], a common-path birefringent interferometer that combines compactness, intrinsic interferometric delay precision, long-term stability and insensitivity to vibrations. In our imaging system, TWINS is employed as a time-scanning interferometer and generates high-contrast interferograms at the single-pixel level. The camera exhibits high throughput and provides hyperspectral images with spectral background level of -30dB and resolution of 3 THz in the visible spectral range. We show high-quality spectral measurements of absolute reflectance, fluorescence and transmission of artistic objects with various lateral sizes.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated significant relationships between obesity and brain structure. Both phenotypes are heritable, but it is not known whether they are influenced by common genetic factors. We investigated the genetic etiology of the relationship between individual variability in brain morphology and BMIz using structural MRI in adolescent twins.\nThe sample (n\u202f=\u202f258) consisted of 54 monozygotic and 75 dizygotic twin pairs (mean(SD) age\u202f=\u202f13.61(0.505), BMIz\u202f=\u202f0.608(1.013). Brain structure (volume and density of gray and white matter) was assessed using VBM. Significant voxelwise heritability of brain structure was established using the Accelerated Permutation inference for ACE models (APACE) program, with structural heritability varying from 15 to 97%, depending on region. Bivariate heritability analyses were carried out comparing additive genetic and unique environment models with and without shared genetics on BMIz and the voxels showing significant heritability in the APACE analyses.\nBMIz was positively related to gray matter volume in the brainstem and thalamus and negatively related to gray matter volume in the bilateral uncus and medial orbitofrontal cortex, gray matter density in the cerebellum, prefrontal lobe, temporal lobe, and limbic system, and white matter density in the brainstem. Bivariate heritability analyses showed that BMIz and brain structure share \u223c1/3 of their genes and that \u223c95% of the phenotypic correlation between BMIz and brain structure is due to shared additive genetic influences. These regions included areas related to decision-making, motivation, liking vs. wanting, taste, interoception, reward processing/learning, caloric evaluation, and inhibition.\nThese results suggested genetic factors are responsible for the relationship between BMIz and heritable BMIz related brain structure in areas related to eating behavior.",

    "abstract": "Although some cases describing delayed birth of the second twin have been published recently, delay of delivery beyond 36 weeks seems scarce. We report a case of delayed-interval delivery wherein prolongation of the second twin's delivery until term with a subsequent favorable infantile outcome. In this case, the stillbirth of the first twin occurred at 25 weeks' gestation. Prophylactic tocolysis was performed with ritodrine and magnesium sulfate, and a McDonald cerclage was performed 2 days after delivery of the first twin. Ampicillin and gentamicin were also administered for the purpose of prevention of intrauterine infection. No clinical sign of chorioamnionitis was found thereafter, and full term uneventful delivery was achieved. With this experience, we believe that delayed-interval delivery can be effective in prolonging gestation and should be an option if the first twin developed an extreme preterm delivery.",

    "abstract": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is the most common vasculitis in childhood that affects medium-sized arteries, particularly coronary arteries. The etiology remains unknown; however, many studies suggest that specific genetic factors and/or some infectious agents underlie the onset. Here, we report a set of identical twin boys who simultaneously developed KD, emphasizing the genetic component of etiology. The patients were 4-year-old twin boys who previously had been healthy and had no family history of KD. Twin A, on admission, met four of five diagnostic criteria for KD. Echocardiogram ruled out coronary artery lesion, and he was treated with 2 g/kg IVIG and aspirin, to which he responded well. Twin B, unlike his brother, met only three of the diagnostic criteria, so was diagnosed as incomplete KD. However, due to the history and shared genetic potential for KD, laboratory investigations and echocardiogram were done. His echocardiogram revealed coronary artery lesion. He was also treated with IVIG and aspirin.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins are widely regarded as genetically identical, and traditional DNA typing methods are insufficient in identifying MZ twins. So the discrimination of MZ twins become a forensic problem. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, endogenous, non-protein-coding RNA molecules of approximately 22 nucleotides in length, and exist extensively in a variety of eukaryotic cells. MiRNAs regulate gene expression and play fundamental roles in multiple biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis as well as aging and disease processes. The goal of this study is to explore the differential expression of miRNAs within MZ twin pairs, and aimed to find new biomarkers for distinguishing MZ twins. Thus, the miRNA expression profiles of seven pairs of healthy MZ twins of different sex and age were analyzed by miRNA microarray. A total of 545 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in these MZ twin pairs, and 2, 5, 22, 53 and 132 differentially expressed miRNAs were shared across six, five, four, three and two pairs of MZ twins respectively. These findings had been confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays on select miRNAs, including miR-151a-3p, miR-3653-3p, miR-142-3p, miR-4325, miR-16-5p, let-7i-5p, miR-222-3p, miR-550b-3p, miR-4791 and miR-27a-3p. The results demonstrated that there are differences in the expression of miRNAs within MZ twin pairs, suggesting a role of miRNAs in identifying MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "The second recorded case of sesquizygotic (SQZ) twins is summarized. It is suspected that SQZ twins result from the fertilization of an egg by two separate spermatozoa, followed by division of the fertilized ovum. Next, recent studies examining how differences in parental affection affect co-twins' personality profiles, the prenatal demise of fetuses during twin pregnancy, a forensic case of heteropaternal superfecundation and selective feticide in dichorionic twins are reviewed. Finally, summaries of newsworthy items featuring an identical twin Oscar winner, a case of 'superfecundated' twins born to a gay couple, identical twins who try partly living apart and new molecular techniques to distinguish an innocent identical twin from his or her guilty co-twin are presented.",

    "abstract": "Maternal pre-pregnancy weight has been related with young singletons' cognitive and behavioral development, but it is not clear if it has an effect on temperament. We used a twin cohort to evaluate the association between maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and infants' temperament. The mothers of 834 twins answered questions regarding their pre-pregnancy BMI and their 0- to 18-month-old children's temperament using the Revised Infant Behavior Questionnaire. Three temperamental dimensions were examined: activity level, distress to limitation and duration of orienting. The relationship between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and each temperamental component was investigated by means of multilevel mixed-effects linear regression analysis. We found no clear evidence of an association of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI with twins' temperament. The development of temperament is influenced by a large number of factors, probably different from those influencing children's emotional and behavioral development.",

The comparison of twins with different intrauterine growth allows evaluating the effect of the restriction, excluding maternal factors and prenatal mana gement. Our objective was to assess the effect of IUGR on acute and chronic morbidity, and mortality of extreme preterm twins.\nTwins weighing less than 1500 grams and gesta tion equal to or less than 30 weeks, of the Neocosur Network. Separate analyses were performed on concordant twin pairs, and on mild and severe discordant twins, evaluating the effect of IUGR on morbidity and mortality. A multivariate analysis was performed in order to establish the impact of this effect.\n459 twin pairs, 227 concordant twins, 110 of mild discordance, and 122 of severe discordance. Among the concordant ones, there was only a difference in oxygen uptake at 36 weeks. In those of mild discordance, the smaller twin presented a lower frequency of hyaline membrane disease and required fewer doses of surfactant, but had a higher risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death. In severe discordant twins, the smaller one presented higher mortality, sepsis, use and permanence in mechanical ventilation, despite the lower frequency of hyaline membrane disease. In multiple regression analysis, the combined risk of BPD or death was higher in the smaller twin and of severe discordance.\nIn discordant twins, the acute respiratory pathology was more frequent in the larger one, although the risk of BPD or death was higher in the one with IUGR.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twin pregnancies are at high risk of adverse outcomes, but it is not possible to predict which pregnancies will develop complications. The aim of the study was to evaluate, in monochorionic twin pregnancies, whether first-trimester ultrasound (nuchal translucency [NT], crown-rump length [CRL]), and maternal serum biomarkers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 [sFlt-1] and placental growth factor [PlGF]), are prognostic factors for fetal adverse outcome composite, twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), growth restriction, and intrauterine fetal death (IUFD).\nA cohort study of 177 monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies. Independent prognostic ability of each factor was assessed by multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for standard prognostic factors. Factors were analysed as continuous data; thus, the reported ORs relate to\u00a0either 1% change in NT or CRL inter-twin percentage discordance or one unit of measure in each serum biomarker.\nThe odds of the fetal adverse outcome composite were significantly associated with increased NT inter-twin percentage discordance (adjusted OR 1.03 [95% CI 1.01, 1.06]) and CRL inter-twin percentage discordance (adjusted OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.07, 1.29]). TTTS was significantly associated with increased NT discordance (adjusted OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.03, 1.10]) and decreased PlGF (adjusted OR 0.42 [95% CI 0.19, 0.93]). Antenatal growth restriction was significantly associated with increased CRL discordance (adjusted OR 1.20 [95% CI 1.08, 1.34]). Single and double IUFD were associated with decreased PlGF (adjusted OR 0.34 [95% CI 0.12, 0.98]) and (adjusted OR 0.18 [95%CI 0.05, 0.58]) respectively.\nThis study has identified potential individual prognostic factors in the first trimester (fetal biometric and maternal serum biomarkers) that show promise but require further robust evaluation in a larger, prospective series of MC twin pregnancies, so that their usefulness both individually and in combination can be defined.\nISRCTN 13114861 (retrospectively registered).",

    "abstract": "Many studies have shown that multifetal reduction of high-order multiple pregnancies results in improved pregnancy outcomes. However, whether conducting elective fetal reduction from dichorionic twins after in vitro fertilization (IVF) is worthwhile remains controversial. This study aimed to determine whether elective fetal reduction of dichorionic twins after IVF and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) is associated with increased take-home baby rate.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of 3600 dichorionic twin pregnancies after IVF-ET. The reduced group included 71 women with transvaginal elective fetal reduction between 7 and 8\u00a0weeks of gestation. The control group (n\u00a0=\u00a03529) comprised women who were managed expectantly. Propensity score matching was conducted before pregnancy outcomes were compared.\nThe take-home baby rate was significantly lower in the reduced group (83.1% vs 92.8%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). The total miscarriage rate was significantly higher in the reduced group (12.7% vs 6.2%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Although preterm delivery rate was lower in the reduced group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), over 90% were over 32\u00a0weeks, whereas the proportions were equal in the reduced group.\nIn dichorionic twin pregnancies after IVF-ET, elective fetal reduction to singleton significantly decreased the chance of taking home live babies.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the long-term impact of birth weight (BW) on thyroid function in genetically identical twins with intra-twin BW differences from birth to adolescence.\nIn total, 52 monozygotic twin pairs underwent at least one analysis of thyroid function at mean ages of 10.1\u00a0years (27 pairs), 15.1\u00a0years (35 pairs), and 17.4\u00a0years (36 pairs); 18 pairs donated blood at all time points. BW difference of <1 SDS was defined as concordant, BW difference \u22651 SDS as discordant.\nIn concordant twins, no significant differences were observed. In the discordant group, smaller twins had higher mean thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) than their larger co-twins at 10.1\u00a0years (3.6 vs 2.5 \u03bcU/mL; P\u00a0=\u00a0.04) and 15.1\u00a0years (2.6 vs 2.2 \u03bcU/mL; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08). Smaller twins showed lower mean thyroxine than larger co-twins at 10.1\u00a0years (7.8 vs 8.2\u00a0\u03bcg/dL P\u00a0=\u00a0.05) and 17.4\u00a0years (7.7 vs 8.4\u00a0\u03bcg/dL; P\u00a0=\u00a0.03), and a tendency at 15.1\u00a0years (6.9 vs 7.4\u00a0\u03bcg/dL; P\u00a0=\u00a0.09).

This may be due to a delay in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis maturation, with TSH resistance during childhood and early adolescence in children with low BW.",

The slightly more hydrophobic peptide, Placa-HrTH-II, co-elutes with the synthetic peptide of the same sequence and is less active in biological assays than Placa-HrTH-I.

    "abstract": "Litter size affects fetal development but its relation to diet-induced fatty liver later in life is unknown.\nThis aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that litter size influences postweaning fatty liver development in response to soybean oil-supplemented diet.\nWeanling twin (TW) or triplet (TP) male lambs (n\u00a0=\u00a016) were fed a control diet or 2% soybean oil-supplemented diet (SO) for 90 d. Liver tissue morphology, biochemical parameters, and lipid metabolic enzymes were determined. Hepatic gene expression was analyzed by RNA sequencing (n\u00a0=\u00a03), followed by enrichment analysis according to Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Differentially expressed genes involved in lipid metabolism were further verified by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (n\u00a0=\u00a04). All data were analyzed by a 2-factor ANOVA, apart from differentially expressed genes, which were identified by the Benjamini-Hochberg approach (q value \u22640.05).\nSO increased liver triglyceride (by 55%) and nonesterified fatty acid (by 54%) concentrations in TPs (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) but not in TWs (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). SO also induced a 2.3- and 2.1-fold increase in the liver steatosis score of TPs and TWs, respectively (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Moreover, SO reduced the activity of lipolytic enzymes including hepatic lipase and total lipase in TPs by 47% and 25%, respectively (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). In contrast, activities of lipogenic enzymes, including malic enzyme and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, were significantly higher in TPs (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Moreover, TPs had higher expression of lipogenic genes, such as FASN (by 45%) and APOB (by 72%), and lower expression of lipolytic genes, such as PRKAA2 (by 28%) and CPT1A (by 43%), compared with TWs (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).\nTPs have a gene expression profile that is more susceptible to SO-induced fatty liver than that of TWs, which indicates that insufficient maternal nutrient supply at fetal and neonatal stages may increase the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",

    "abstract": "Longitudinal, genetically informative studies of the association between cigarette smoking and depressive symptoms among adolescents are limited. We examined the longitudinal association of cigarette smoking with subsequent depressive symptoms during adolescence in a Finnish twin cohort. We used prospective data from the population-based FinnTwin12 study (maximum N\u2009=\u20094152 individuals, 1910 twin pairs). Current smoking status and a number of lifetime cigarettes smoked were assessed at the age of 14 and depressive symptoms at the age of 17. Negative binomial regression was conducted to model the association between smoking behavior and subsequent depressive symptoms among individuals, and within-pair analyses were conducted to control for unmeasured familial confounding. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, school grades, drinking alcohol to intoxication, health status, family structure, parental education, and smoking, as well as for pre-existing depressiveness. The results of the individual-level analyses showed that cigarette smoking at the age of 14 predicted depressive symptoms at the age of 17. Compared to never smokers, those who had smoked over 50 cigarettes (incidence rate ratio, IRR\u2009=\u20091.43, 95% CI 1.28-1.60) and regular smokers (IRR\u2009=\u20091.46, 95% CI 1.32-1.62) had higher depression scores. The associations were attenuated when adjusted for measured covariates and further reduced in within-pair analyses. In the within-pair results, the estimates were lower within monozygotic (MZ) pairs compared to dizygotic (DZ) pairs, suggesting that shared genetic factors contribute to the associations observed in individual-based analyses. Thus, we conclude that cigarette smoking is associated with subsequent depressive symptoms during adolescence, but the association is not independent of measured confounding factors and shared genetic influences.",

It is within this context that our commentary surrounding the question of the enforceability of Chinese regulations in such a case.

    "abstract": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an overgrowth disorder with a heterogeneous phenotypic spectrum. There is an increased prevalence of monozygotic twinning in BWS. Given the epigenetic nature and phenotypic spectrum that defines BWS, twins are often discordant for clinical features, and clinicians are faced with the challenge of diagnosing and managing these twins. We present a cohort of multiple pregnancies in which one or more child from each pregnancy was diagnosed with BWS. We conducted a chart review of monochorionic and dichorionic gestations. Clinical scores for monochorionic twins demonstrated phenotypic discordance between the proband and twin. Based on linear regression analysis, a higher clinical score in the proband correlated with larger phenotypic discordance between twin siblings. Despite phenotypic discordance, however, we observed a consistent additive clinical score for a pregnancy (proband's plus twin's scores from a pregnancy). This idea of a finite degree of affectedness for a pregnancy implies a finite number of epigenetically affected cells. This further corroborates the idea that timing of monozygotic monochorionic twinning correlates with the disruption of establishment and/or maintenance of imprinting. The difference in clinical score between a proband and their twin may be due to diffused mosaicism, whereby there is an asymmetric distribution of affected cells among the multiple fetuses in a monozygotic monochorionic pregnancy, leading to a spectrum of variably affected phenotypes. Based on these findings, we recommend an algorithm for a conservative approach to clinically evaluate all children in a monozygotic multiple gestation affected by BWS.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with a modest concordance rate in monozygotic twins, which strongly argues for involvement of epigenetic factors. We observe highly similar peripheral blood mononuclear cell-based methylomes in 45 MS-discordant monozygotic twins. Nevertheless, we identify seven MS-associated differentially methylated positions (DMPs) of which we validate two, including a region in the TMEM232 promoter and ZBTB16 enhancer. In CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells we find an MS-associated differentially methylated region in FIRRE. Additionally, 45 regions show large methylation differences in individual pairs, but they do not clearly associate with MS. Furthermore, we present epigenetic biomarkers for current interferon-beta treatment, and extensive validation shows that the ZBTB16 DMP is a signature for prior glucocorticoid treatment. Taken together, this study represents an important reference for epigenomic MS studies, identifies new candidate epigenetic markers, and highlights treatment effects and genetic background as major confounders.",

    "abstract": "To review the clinical features of a male twin affected with glutaric academia type I (GA-I) and analyze the variations of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) gene.\nClinical data of the pair of twins and their parents were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples, and variants of GCDH genes were detected by capture sequencing using a customized panel. Variants of the twins and their parents were verified by Sanger sequencing.\nThe level of glutaric acyl carnitine (C5DC + C6OH) was 3.26 \u03bcmol/L in the male twin. The relative level of glutaric acid in urine was 547.51 by gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Cerebral ultrasonography showed that the patient had subependymal hemorrhage, but no serious clinical manifestation was noted. After treating with special formula milk powder and L-carnitine, the boy showed good growth and development. Two heterozygous variants of the GCDH gene were detected in the patient, among which c.416C>G was suspected to be pathogenic, while c.109_110delCA was unreported. The variants were respectively inherited from his parents. The twin girl only carried the c.416C>G variant.\nGA-I can be diagnosed by mass spectrometry, urine gas chromatographic mass spectrometry, imaging as well as genetic diagnosis. Early diagnosis and intervention is important.",

    "abstract": "The symmetry of twins is described by chromatic point groups obtained from the intersection group {\\cal H}^* of the oriented point groups of the individuals {\\cal H}_i extended by the operations mapping different individuals. This article presents a revised list of twin point groups through the analysis of their groupoid structure, followed by the generalization to the case of allotwins. Allotwins of polytypes with the same type of point group can be described by a chromatic point group like twins. If the individuals are all differently oriented, the chromatic point group is obtained in the same way as in the case of twins; if they are mapped by symmetry operation of the individuals, the chromatic point group is neutral. If the same holds true for some but not all individuals, then the allotwin can be seen as composed of twinned regions described by a twin point group, that are then allotwinned and described by a colour identification group; the allotwin is then described by a chromatic group obtained as an extension of the former by the latter, and requires the use of extended symbols reminiscent of the extended Hermann-Mauguin symbols of space groups. In the case of allotwins of polytypes with different types of point groups, as well as incomplete (allo)twins, a chromatic point group does not reveal the full symmetry: the groupoid has to be specified instead.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are popular, because twins are believed to be the same/similar in genes and environmental exposures. It is well documented, however, that the firstborns are healthier at birth. We use the entire U.S. record of twin births during 1995-2000 to show that the survival duration parameters differ between twins depending on the birth order. We also find that wiser (i.e., older or educated) or married (i.e., resource-richer) mothers take more care of the weaker, which is a \"compensating\" behavior reducing the twin difference, as opposed to \"reinforcing (the twin difference)\" behavior. The systematic survival pattern difference and the mother's intervention against nature send cautions to twin studies that regard twins homogeneous to interpret their findings accordingly. Since the survival duration in our data is 97% right-censored in one year, we devise a quantile-based 'fixed-effect' semiparametric estimator that can handle heavy censoring, which is our methodological contribution.",

    "abstract": "The Nordic countries have comprehensive, population-based health and medical registries linkable on individually unique personal identity codes, enabling complete long-term follow-up. The aims of this study were to describe the NorTwinCan cohort established in 2010 and assess whether the cancer mortality and incidence rates among Nordic twins are similar to those in the general population. We analyzed approximately 260,000 same-sexed twins in the nationwide twin registers in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Cancer incidence was determined using follow-up through the national cancer registries. We estimated standardized incidence (SIR) and mortality (SMR) ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) across country, age, period, follow-up time, sex and zygosity. More than 30,000 malignant neoplasms have occurred among the twins through 2010. Mortality rates among twins were slightly lower than in the general population (SMR 0.96; CI 95% [0.95, 0.97]), but this depends on information about zygosity. Twins have slightly lower cancer incidence rates than the general population, with SIRs of 0.97 (95% CI [0.96, 0.99]) in men and 0.96 (95% CI [0.94, 0.97]) in women. Testicular cancer occurs more often among male twins than singletons (SIR 1.15; 95% CI [1.02, 1.30]), while cancers of the kidney (SIR 0.82; 95% CI [0.76, 0.89]), lung (SIR 0.89; 95% CI [0.85, 0.92]) and colon (SIR 0.90; 95% CI [0.87, 0.94]) occur less often in twins than in the background population. Our findings indicate that the risk of cancer among twins is so similar to the general population that cancer risk factors and estimates of heritability derived from the Nordic twin registers are generalizable to the background populations.",

    "abstract": "Somatization is known to be more prevalent in Asian than in Western populations. Using a South Korean adolescent and young adult twin sample (N = 1754; 367 monozygotic male, 173 dizygotic male, 681 monozygotic female, 274 dizygotic female and 259 opposite-sex dizygotic twins), the present study aimed to estimate heritability of somatization and to determine common genetic and environmental influences on somatization and hwabyung (HB: anger syndrome). Twins completed self-report questionnaires of the HB symptoms scale and the somatization scale via a telephone interview. The results of the general sex-limitation model showed that 43% (95% CI [36, 50]) of the total variance of somatization was attributable to additive genetic factors, with the remaining variance, 57% (95% CI [50, 64]), being due to individual-specific environmental influences, including measurement error. These estimates were not significantly different between the two sexes. The phenotypic correlation between HB and somatization was .53 (p &lt; .001). The bivariate model-fitting analyses revealed that the genetic correlation between the two symptoms was .68 (95% CI [.59, .77]), while the individual-specific environmental correlation, including correlated measurement error, was .41 (95% CI [.34, .48]). Of the additive genetic factors of 43% that influence somatization, approximately half (20%) were associated with those related to HB, with the remainder being due to genes unique to somatization. A substantial part (48%) of individual environmental variance in somatization was unrelated to HB; only 9% of the environmental variance was shared with HB. Our findings suggest that HB and somatization have shared genetic etiology, but environmental factors that precipitate the development of HB and somatization may be largely independent from each other.",

    "abstract": "While snus has been the focus of increasing public health interest, twin studies have examined neither sources of individual variation for its use nor the sources of resemblance between snus and cigarette use. Twins from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health Panel were assessed by self-report questionnaire for the initiation of regular use and maximal quantity used for snus and cigarettes. Twin modeling was performed using OpenMx on data from 2767 twins including 856 complete pairs. Fitting univariate twin models produced similar results for cigarette initiation and quantity with estimates of additive genetic, shared environmental and unique environmental effects of approximately 77%, 0% and 23%, respectively. Estimates of snus initiation and quantity were, respectively, approximately 53%, 26% and 21%. Joint analyses suggested that the genetic, shared environmental and unique environmental correlations between cigarette and snus initiation and quantity were +.82, 0 and +.42, respectively. However, these results could not be statistically distinguished from a model which postulated that resemblance between cigarette initiation and quantity resulted from genetic and unique environmental correlations of +.47 and +.43. Compared with cigarette initiation and quantity of use in Norwegian twins, the role of genes was less prominent and shared environment more prominent for initiation and quantity of use of snus. Joint analyses of both tobacco phenotypes suggested, but did not confirm definitively, that genetic risk factors for cigarette and snus use were similar but not identical, while shared environmental factors existed that were specific to snus use.",

    "abstract": "To understand the health impact of long-duration spaceflight, one identical twin astronaut was monitored before, during, and after a 1-year mission onboard the International Space Station; his twin served as a genetically matched ground control. Longitudinal assessments identified spaceflight-specific changes, including decreased body mass, telomere elongation, genome instability, carotid artery distension and increased intima-media thickness, altered ocular structure, transcriptional and metabolic changes, DNA methylation changes in immune and oxidative stress-related pathways, gastrointestinal microbiota alterations, and some cognitive decline postflight. Although average telomere length, global gene expression, and microbiome changes returned to near preflight levels within 6 months after return to Earth, increased numbers of short telomeres were observed and expression of some genes was still disrupted. These multiomic, molecular, physiological, and behavioral datasets provide a valuable roadmap of the putative health risks for future human spaceflight.",

    "abstract": "CFTR modulator therapy with ivacaftor is a treatment option for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients with at least one copy of a R117H-7T mutation in the CFTR gene. Desirable effects of this therapy are improvement of lung function, decrease in exacerbation rate, normalization or reduction of sweat chloride and weight gain. Monogenetic CF-twins carry identical genetic information, so therapy response and side effects are expected to be nearly identical under this specific therapy.\nIn monozygotic twins, at the age of 55, two pathogenic variants in the CFTR gene (F508del and R117H-7T) were detected. Both patients presented with a borderline sweat test (30-59\u2009mmol/L) and despite the same genetic information and similar life circumstances the disease proceeds completely different. While one patient has severe pulmonary involvement with chronic P. aeruginosa infection, her twin sister is almost unimpaired. Liver or pancreatic involvement was not seen in either patient. Due to the presence of one copy of a R117H-7T mutation, CFTR modulator therapy with ivacaftor was initiated in both. Response and side effects were significantly different. In the less affected patient, we observed an improvement in lung function and a normalization of sweat chloride. In the severely affected patient, no functional response to treatment was seen, but stabilization of the disease state with a decrease in exacerbation and hospitalization rate and weight gain as well as a normalization of sweat chloride. There was an increase in liver enzymes in the less affected patient, which normalized after halving the dose of ivacaftor, while the therapeutic effect was maintained.\nDespite nearly identical genetic information, as in monogenetic twins, therapy response and onset of side effects of CFTR modulating therapy are very different. In patients with late diagnosis and severe pulmonary involvement, ivacaftor does not seem to improve lung function, whereas in patients with late diagnosis and low disease severity a relevant therapy response was obtained. In addition to lung function, additional clinical parameters such as reduction of exacerbation and hospitalization rate and weight gain should be used to assess therapy response, especially in severely affected patients.",

    "abstract": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is the most common inherited metabolic disease with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. It is characterised by raised serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), leading to premature coronary artery disease. Children with FH are subjected to early and enhanced atherosclerosis, leading to greater risk of coronary events, including premature coronary artery disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pair of monochorionic diamniotic identical twins with a diagnosis of heterozygous FH, resulting from mutations in both LDLR and ABCG8 genes.\nThis is a rare case of a pair of 8-year-old monochorionic diamniotic identical twin, who on family cascade screening were diagnosed as definite FH, according to the Dutch Lipid Clinic Criteria (DLCC) with a score of 10. There were no lipid stigmata noted. Baseline lipid profiles revealed severe hypercholesterolaemia, (TC\u2009=\u200910.5\u2009mmol/L, 10.6\u2009mmol/L; LDL-c\u2009=\u20098.8\u2009mmol/L, 8.6\u2009mmol/L respectively). Their father is the index case who initially presented with premature CAD, and subsequently diagnosed as FH. Family cascade screening identified clinical FH in other family members including their paternal grandfather who also had premature CAD, and another elder brother, aged 10\u2009years. Genetic analysis by targeted next-generation sequencing using MiSeq platform (Illumina) was performed to detect mutations in LDLR, APOB100, PCSK9, ABCG5, ABCG8, APOE and LDLRAP1 genes. Results revealed that the twin, their elder brother, father and grandfather are heterozygous for a missense mutation (c.530C\u2009>\u2009T) in LDLR that was previously reported as a pathogenic mutation. In addition, the twin has heterozygous ABCG8 gene mutation (c.55G\u2009>\u2009C). Their eldest brother aged 12\u2009years and their mother both had normal lipid profiles with absence of LDLR gene mutation.\nA rare case of Asian monochorionic diamniotic identical twin, with clinically diagnosed and molecularly confirmed heterozygous FH, due to LDLR and ABCG8 gene mutations have been reported. Childhood FH may not present with the classical physical manifestations including the pathognomonic lipid stigmata as in adults. Therefore, childhood FH can be diagnosed early using a combination of clinical criteria and molecular analyses.",

Here we report and analyze two variants in the BMP7 prodomain in monozygotic twins with hypospadias.\nPatients with hypospadias were prospectively recruited. After informed consent was obtained, DNA was extracted from blood. The coding regions of 1034 genes [including 64 known diagnostic genes and candidate genes for disorder/difference of sex development (DSD)] were sequenced using a targeted capture approach (HaloPlex, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), combined with massively parallel sequencing. The resulting variants were filtered for rarity in the general population (<1%) and in our screen. Quality, depth of the reads, and predicted pathogenicity were also considered. The consequences of the identified mutations on BMP7 expression was determined by Western blot analysis on culture media from transfected cells, and activity measured using a SMAD 1/5-responsiveness luciferase assay.\nWe analyzed DNA from 46 patients with hypospadias.

    "abstract": "Differences between men and women are being continuously identified in many human diseases. The underlying reasons are not yet fully understood. Beside the influence of endogenous hormones and life style, intrinsic sex-specific dimorphisms at the cellular level may also play a role. HUVECs from twin pairs of opposite sex provide an excellent tool to address the question of sex-specific differences at the molecular level. We compared for the first time protein levels of male and female HUVECs from dizygotic twins using a proteomic approach. To investigate differences under basal and stress conditions, cells were either left untreated or wounded and serum starved for different time points. Approximately 10% of all proteins monitored showed significant sexual dimorphisms in their level under the different conditions tested. The majority of the proteins displayed a higher abundance in female cells. The magnitude of the difference in protein levels between male and female cells was rather small. The most prominent differences throughout all conditions were observed for several X-chromosome encoded proteins with higher levels in female (UBA1, HDHD1) or in male cells (G6PD). Proteins involved in basic cellular processes, such as gene expression and translation (e.g. HMGN1, SRP54) displayed sex-specific levels in particular conditions only. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides novel insights into sexual dimorphic protein levels in HUVECs from twin pairs of the opposite sex. The findings identify proteins with sex-specific differences in their levels under different cell culture conditions. The study also highlights the presence of X-chromosome encoded proteins escaping X-chromosomal inactivation. The results emphasize the need to consider the cellular sex of male and female HUVECs in in vitro experiments.",

    "abstract": "This project investigated paternity among 14 sets of twins born into a colony of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) on St. Catherines Island, GA. Female L. catta commonly mate with >1 male, and twins of different sexes confirm that dizygotic twinning can occur in this species. However, no study has previously evaluated twins using genetic data to measure the proportion of mono versus dizygotic twinning in L. catta, and no study has tested for heteropaternity (sirehood by two different males) in this species. We predicted that L. catta would show a predominance of dizygosity and evidence for heteropaternity.\nPaternity was determined for 28 infants (14 sets of twins) via paternity exclusion analyses using 10 polymorphic microsatellite markers, and data were collected on sexual behavior across four mating seasons during the first cycle of mating in each year, which overlapped with the conceptive periods of these infants.\nAll twins were found to be dizygotic, as evidenced by dissimilar multilocus genotypes between the two infants of each twin pair. Heteropaternity was found in 3 of 14 (21% of) twin pairs, whereas the remaining 11 pairs of twins (79%) shared the same sire. In one case of heteropaternity, one sire was a resident male, and one sire was an extra-group male. An extra-group male also sired one of the same-sire twin pairs. All other sires of twins were group residents.\nFemale multiple mating, which is common to many primates including L. catta, can be viewed as an adaptive reproductive strategy whose function-in addition to fertility assurance or stimulating sperm competition-may be to increase the genetic diversity of a female's offspring, even among infants born in the same birth event. Therefore, during the course of primate evolution, the adaptive benefits of heteropaternity would be expected to have contributed to positive selection for female promiscuity.",

    "abstract": "To explore the mechanism and duration of false positive results of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) caused by vanishing twins.\nTo detect the variation of cell-free fetal DNA fraction before and after the fetal death and explore its influence on the results of NIPT at different gestational weeks. Prenatal diagnosis was also carried out on amniotic fluid sample derived from the survivor twin. After birth, the two placentas and papyraceous fetus were obtained to ascertain the definitive genetic diagnosis and pathological changes through fluorescence in situ hybridization, fluorescence quantitative PCR and histopathological examination. Eight cases of vanishing twins leading to discordant NIPT results were reviewed for determining the duration of this influence.\nThe vanishing twin has led to immediate flooding of cfDNA into the maternal plasma due to necrotic cytotrophoblasts, which in turn caused increased release of fetal DNA in a short time. However, this did not change the NIPT result for a period of time. The tissue and chorionic villi of perished fetus presented extensive degenerative necrosis.\nThe false positive NIPT result caused by vanishing twins may be attributed to continuous release of DNA fragments into the maternal plasma by the fetuses. The influence of the vanished fetuses, which may lead to discordant NIPT results, can last for at least 7-8 weeks but no more than 12-14 weeks during the first and second trimester.",

The pathogenesis of the syndrome is not yet fully understood, though altered sympathetic regulation or response to cardiac sympathetic stimuli is likely to be involved. We present a unique and clinically detailed report of identical twin sisters, who both developed Takotsubo syndrome in association to mental stress shortly after menopause, also covering a potential relapse of disease in one of the twins, supporting the theory of a genetic contribution to the development of the syndrome proposed by previous case reports and small genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune fibrosing disease with an incompletely understood genetic and non-genetic etiology. Defining its etiology is important to allow the development of effective predictive, preventative, and therapeutic strategies. We conducted this epigenomic study to investigate the contributions of DNA methylation to the etiology of SSc while minimizing confounding due to genetic heterogeneity.\nGenomic methylation in whole blood from 27 twin pairs discordant for SSc was assayed over 450\u2009K CpG sites. In silico integration with reported differentially methylated cytosines, differentially expressed genes, and regulatory annotation was conducted to validate and interpret the results.\nA total of 153 unique cytosines in limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) and 266 distinct sites in diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) showed suggestive differential methylation levels in affected twins. Integration with available data revealed 76 CpGs that were also differentially methylated in blood cells from lupus patients, suggesting their role as potential epigenetic blood biomarkers of autoimmunity. It also revealed 27 genes with concomitant differential expression in blood from SSc patients, including IFI44L and RSAD2. Regulatory annotation revealed that dcSSc-associated CpGs (but not lcSSc) are enriched at Encyclopedia of DNA Elements-, Roadmap-, and BLUEPRINT-derived regulatory regions, supporting their potential role in disease presentation. Notably, the predominant enrichment of regulatory regions in monocytes and macrophages is consistent with the role of these cells in fibrosis, suggesting that the observed cellular dysregulation might be, at least partly, due to altered epigenetic mechanisms of these cells in dcSSc.\nThese data implicate epigenetic changes in the pathogenesis of SSc and suggest functional mechanisms in SSc etiology.",

It also revealed 27 genes with concomitant differential expression in blood from SSc patients, including IFI44L and RSAD2. Regulatory annotation revealed that dcSSc-associated CpGs (but not lcSSc) are enriched at Encyclopedia of DNA Elements-, Roadmap-, and BLUEPRINT-derived regulatory regions, supporting their potential role in disease presentation. Notably, the predominant enrichment of regulatory regions in monocytes and macrophages is consistent with the role of these cells in fibrosis, suggesting that the observed cellular dysregulation might be, at least partly, due to altered epigenetic mechanisms of these cells in dcSSc.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant neural and cognitive response to emotional faces has been observed in people at familial risk of an affective disorder. In this functional MRI study of monozygotic twins, we explored neural correlates of the attentional avoidance of emotional faces that we had previously observed in high-risk versus affected twins, and whether an abnormal neural response to emotional faces represents a risk endophenotype.\nWe recruited unaffected monozygotic twins with a co-twin history of mood episodes (high-risk), monozygotic twins with previous mood episodes (affected) and monozygotic twins with no personal or first-degree history of mood episodes (low-risk) between December 2014 and January 2017 based on a nationwide register linkage. Participants viewed fearful and happy faces while performing a gender discrimination task during functional MRI (fMRI) and performed emotional faces dot-probe and facial expression recognition tasks outside the scanner.\nA total of 129 monozygotic twins underwent whole-brain fMRI. Highrisk twins (n = 38) displayed greater medial and superior prefrontal response to emotional faces than affected twins (n = 62). This greater activity correlated with stronger attentional avoidance of emotional faces in high-risk twins. In contrast, high-risk and affected twins showed no aberrant neural activity to emotional faces compared with low-risk twins (n = 29).\nA limitation of this study was its cross-sectional design.\nGreater recruitment of the medial and superior prefrontal cortex during implicit emotion processing in high-risk versus affected twins may represent a compensatory or resilience mechanism. In contrast, aberrant neural response to emotional faces does not seem to be a risk endophenotype for affective disorders.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the developmental trajectories of general and breathing movements in fetal twins. Fetal movement patterns were assessed from real-time ultrasound recordings performed at 12-15, 20-23, and 28-32\u00a0weeks of gestation in 42 twin pairs. Results indicated that both general movements and breathing movements followed a curvilinear, inverted U-shaped curve. Developmental trajectories were unrelated within pairs of twins and were not associated with gestational age at birth and birth weight. However, sex differences were found for general movements with males displaying more time making general movements at 21\u00a0weeks and a steeper decline in time spent making general movements during the second half of pregnancy than females. These age-related changes in fetal movements may reflect CNS development. These findings also suggest that twins' behavioral development is largely independent of co-twin development, gestational age at birth, and birth weight, but not of fetal sex.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in life expectancy, low socioeconomic status is associated with a shorter lifespan. This study was conducted to investigate socioeconomic differences in mortality by comparing preventable with non-preventable causes of death in 39\u00a0506 participants from the Swedish Twin Registry born before 1935.\nChildhood social class, own education, own social class and social mobility were used as separate indicators of socioeconomic status. These data were linked to the Swedish Cause of Death Register. Cause of death was categorized as preventable or non-preventable mortality according to indicators presented in the Avoidable Mortality in the European Union (AMIEHS) atlas. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we tested the association between the socioeconomic measures and all-cause mortality, preventable mortality and non-preventable mortality. Additional co-twin control analyses indicated whether the associations reflected genetic confounding.\nThe social gradient for mortality was most prominent for the adult socioeconomic measures. There was a social gradient in both preventable mortality and non-preventable mortality, but with an indication of a moderately stronger effect in preventable causes of death. In analyses of social mobility, those who experienced life-time low socioeconomic status (SES) or downward social mobility had an increased mortality risk compared with those with life-time high SES and upward social mobility. Adjustments for genetic confounding did not change the observed associations for education, social class or social mobility and mortality. In the co-twin control analyses of reared-apart twins, the association between childhood social class and mortality weakened, indicating possible genetic influences on this association.\nOur results indicate that there is an association between low adult socioeconomic status and increased mortality independent of genetic endowment. Thus, we do not find support for indirect social selection as the basis for mortality inequalities in Sweden.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins are at risk for developing twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) throughout pregnancy. This may lead to myocardial dysfunction in the recipient and/or donor twin that persists beyond delivery. Selective laser photocoagulation of the communicating placental vessels (SLPCV) attempts to mitigate the cardiovascular outcomes. The objective of this study was to characterize early postnatal myocardial performance in MCDA twins with TTTS with and without SLPCV.\nA prospective study was performed of four MCDA twin groups: (1) uncomplicated MCDA twins, (2) MCDA twins with selective fetal growth restriction, (3) MCDA twins with TTTS following SLPCV (TTTS with SLPCV), and (4) MCDA twins with TTTS who did not undergo SLPCV (TTTS without SLPCV). Fifty-four twin pairs were enrolled: 23 uncomplicated MCDA twin pairs, 15 pairs with selective fetal growth restriction, seven TTTS pairs with SLPCV, and seven TTTS pairs without SLPCV. In each group, twin pairs were divided by birth weight into donor (smaller) and recipient (larger) and compared. Echocardiography was performed on day 1, day 2, and between days 5 and 7 of age, and myocardial performance was characterized by speckle-tracking echocardiography-derived left ventricular and right ventricular longitudinal strain (LS) and systolic strain rate (LSR). Longitudinal strain and longitudinal systolic strain rate are expressed as absolute values.\nCompared with all recipient groups, recipient TTTS without SLPCV infants had lower left ventricular LS (16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03% vs 22%-24%, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and right ventricular LS (15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% vs 21%-24%, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) on day 1 that persisted throughout the first week of age. Left ventricular LSR (1.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 vs 2.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0sec\nBiventricular performance is diminished in recipient MCDA twins with TTTS who are not treated with SLPCV, highlighting the need for close monitoring of their hemodynamic status during the early neonatal period.",

However, for individual identification in complex situations, such as monozygotic \uff08MZ\uff09 twins assumed to be genetically identical, it is impossible to distinguish one from the other by using traditional forensic DNA typing system. Therefore, how to discriminate the MZ twins has become and will continue to be one of the difficult problems in forensic field.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated genetic differences between monozygotic (MZ) twins. To test the hypothesis that early post-twinning mutational events associate with phenotypic discordance, we investigated a cohort of 13 twin pairs (n\u2009=\u200926) discordant for various clinical phenotypes using whole-exome sequencing and screened for copy number variation (CNV). We identified a de novo variant in PLCB1, a gene involved in the hydrolysis of lipid phosphorus in milk from dairy cows, associated with lactase non-persistence, and a variant in the mitochondrial complex I gene MT-ND5 associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We also found somatic variants in multiple genes (TMEM225B, KBTBD3, TUBGCP4, TFIP11) in another MZ twin pair discordant for ALS. Based on the assumption that discordance between twins could be explained by a common variant with variable penetrance or expressivity, we screened the twin samples for known pathogenic variants that are shared and identified a rare deletion overlapping ARHGAP11B, in the twin pair manifesting with either schizotypal personality disorder or schizophrenia. Parent-offspring trio analysis was implemented for two twin pairs to assess potential association of variants of parental origin with susceptibility to disease. We identified a de novo variant in RASD2 shared by 8-year-old male twins with a suspected diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifesting as different traits. A de novo CNV duplication was also identified in these twins overlapping CD38, a gene previously implicated in ASD. In twins discordant for Tourette's syndrome, a paternally inherited stop loss variant was detected in AADAC, a known candidate gene for the disorder.",

In litter-bearing species, chromosomal females passively exposed to prenatal testosterone from male littermates exhibit altered physical and behavioral traits as adults. The consequences of such effects are less well understood in humans, but recent near-doubling of twinning rates in many countries since 1980, secondary to advanced maternal age and increased reliance on in vitro fertilization, means that an increasing subset of females in many populations may be exposed to prenatal testosterone from their male co-twin.

    "abstract": "Little is known about adolescent mental health problems, including social phobia, as risk factors for future work incapacity. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between social phobia in adolescence and unemployment and sickness absence (SA) in early adulthood, also evaluating the role of familial factors (genetics and shared environment).\nA sample of 2845 Swedish twins born in 1985-86 in Sweden was followed longitudinally in the population-based and prospective Twin study of CHild and Adolescent Development. Information on twins' social phobia was collected at ages 13-4, 16-7 and 19-20 years. Logistic regression providing odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was used to analyze the associations between social phobia, unemployment and SA during the follow-up 2006-12. The influence of familial factors was evaluated by conditional logistic regression.\nPresence of social phobia during adolescence was associated with increased odds for unemployment and SA in young adulthood. For unemployment, the highest OR was at the age of 13-4 years (1.58 [95% CI: 1.22-2.06]), and the associations became null after adjusting for familial factors. For SA, the highest OR was at the age of 19-20 years (1.73 [95% CI: 1.13-2.65]), and the estimates changed slightly after adjusting for familial factors.\n: Results suggest that social phobia experienced in adolescence contribute to early adulthood unemployment and SA. Familial factors seemed to explain the association between social phobia and unemployment.",

    "abstract": "Pure magnetite experiences a first-order phase transition (the Verwey transition) near 120-125\u00a0K wherein the mineral's symmetry changes from cubic to monoclinic. This transformation results in the formation of fine-scale crystallographic twins and is accompanied by a profound change in magnetic properties. The Verwey transition is critical to a variety of applications in environmental magnetism and paleomagnetism because its expression is diagnostic for the presence of stoichiometric (or nearly stoichiometric) magnetite and cycling through the Verwey transition tends to remove the majority of multidomain magnetic remanence. Internal and external stresses demonstrably affect the onset of the Verwey transition. Dislocations create localized internal stress fields and have been cited as a possible source of an altered Verwey transition in deformed samples. To further investigate this behavior, a laboratory-deformed magnetite sample was examined inside a transmission electron microscope as it was cooled through the Verwey transition. Operating the microscope in the Fresnel mode of Lorentz microscopy enabled imaging of the interactions between dislocations, magnetic domain walls, and low-temperature crystallographic twin formation during the phase transition. To relate the observed changes to more readily measurable bulk sample magnetic behavior, low-temperature magnetic measurements were also taken using SQUID magnetometry. This study allows us, for the first time, to observe the Verwey transition in a defect-rich area. Dislocations, and their associated stress fields, impede the development of monoclinic magnetite twin structures during the phase transition and increase the remanence of a magnetite sample after cooling and warming through the Verwey transition.",

    "abstract": "Hexagonal close packed (HCP) Mg and Zr are being used in transportation and nuclear industries, respectively. The ductility and formability of these materials is significantly limited by the activation of prevalent deformation twinning. Twins in HCP polycrystals usually nucleate at grain boundaries (GBs), propagate into the grain, and they either terminate at opposing GBs (isolated-twins) or transmit into a neighboring grain (adjoining-twin-pairs: ATPs). Because twin interfaces provide a path for crack propagation, twin transmission is relevant to material ductility. This study combines electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) based statistical analysis of twinning microstructures and crystal plasticity modeling, to characterize twin thickening processes away from and near GBs. Analysis of deformed Mg and Zr microstructures reveals that local twin thicknesses at GBs are statistically larger for ATPs compared to isolated-twins. Further, thicknesses are found to decrease with increasing GB misorientation angle. Full-field Fast-Fourier-Transform micromechanics modeling shows that shear-transformation induced backstress are locally relaxed at GBs for ATPs, but not for isolated-twins. As a consequence, ATPs can thicken locally at GBs and the preferential site for twin thickening shifts from the middle of the twin to common GB.",

Uncultured amniotic fluid was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-array). Conventional G-banded karyotyping analysis was performed on the cultured amniotic fluid.\nMetaphase chromosome analysis showed that one of the twins had a mos 45,X[11]/46,XX[26] karyotype, while the other had a normal karyotype. FISH and SNP-array applied on uncultured amniotic fluid revealed about 30% mosaicism in one of the twins. The twins were confirmed to be monozygotic by SNP-array analysis.\nTo avoid confusion arising from discordant karyotypes in MCDA twins with abnormal non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) results, dual amniocentesis should be carried out to obtain amniotic fluid samples for chromosomal as well as molecular analysis. To determine the ratio of 45,X and 46,XX cells in Turner syndrome can provide valuable information for prenatal genetic counseling.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which prenatal intrauterine testosterone affects cognitive development in females has been of interest. Previous twin research has, however, been limited in its attempts to disentangle prenatal and psychosocial environmental factors influencing cognitive development. The current study applied a novel approach to addressing this concern. Specifically, the nonverbal cognitive performances of female opposite-sex dizygotic co-twins (DZOSfs) and female opposite-sex virtual co-twins (same-age unrelated siblings or VTOSfs) were compared to separate the biological and environmental influences on the nonverbal IQ score and its component subtests. The DZOSf twins showed a trend toward outperforming the younger VTOSf twins on the Block Design subtest only. Using these biologically and environmentally informative kinships offers a novel approach to understanding sex differences in nonverbal cognition. Including VTOSfs as a comparison group creates an experimental design that eliminates confounds and spurious associations left unaddressed in prior twin research.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of twin anemia-polycythemia sequence with blood chimerism in monochorionic dizygotic twins born to a 30-year-old woman who conceived via ovulation induction. The neonates developed twin anemia-polycythemia sequence; the female twin had anemia and the male had polycythemia. We detected blood chimerism using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Twin anemia-polycythemia sequence carries not only perinatal risks, but also genetic and immunological implications due to blood chimerism. Although previous reports have described twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome in monochorionic dizygotic twins, we report the first case of twin anemia-polycythemia sequence in monochorionic dizygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Locked twins is a rare and dangerous multiple pregnancy and generally occurs in about 1 in every 1000 twin births. A 23-year-old female with gravida 1, para 0 pregnancy was admitted. The head of the first fetus was locked to the chin of the second fetus (alive) at the top of the symphysis pubis. The uterus was relaxed with isoflurane. The legs and the back of the baby were extended to the symphysis pubis. The head of the second baby was gently positioned to the posterior walls of uterine cavity on the upper side of it. So, the locked head of the first baby was released and both fetuses were delivered vaginally. The second baby was in good condition. By recognizing the probable cases, radiological diagnosis, and punctual cesarean delivery, it is possible to avoid the fetal morbidity and mortality in locked twins.",

    "abstract": "Studies with twins provide fundamental insights to lifespans of humans. We aim to clarify if monozygotic and dizygotic twin individuals differ in lifespan, that is, if zygosity matters. We investigate whether a possible difference in mortality after infancy between zygosities is stable in different age cohorts, and whether the difference remains when twins with unknown zygosity are taken into account. Further, we compare the distribution of long-livers, that is, the upper-tail of the lifespan distribution, between monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twin individuals. The Danish Twin Registry provides a nationwide cohort of 109,303 twins born during 1870 to 1990 with valid vital status. Standard survival analysis is used to compare mortality in monozygotic and dizygotic twin individuals and twin individuals with unknown zygosity. The mortality of monozygotic and dizygotic twin individuals differs slightly after taking into consideration effects of birth- and age-cohorts, gender differences, and that twins are paired. However, no substantial nor systematic differences remain when taking twins with unknown zygosity into account. Further, the distribution of long-livers is very similar by zygosity, suggesting the same mortality process. The population-based and oldest twin cohort ever studied suggests that monozygotic and dizygotic twins have similar lifespans.",

Because many unaffected twins were still alive, previous concordance estimates were based on incomplete information. Ninety-five percent of twins are now deceased. Here, we update concordance and heritability through 2015 using National Death Index data. In total, we identified 30 concordant and 193 discordant pairs. Proband-wise concordance was 0.20 in monozygotic and 0.13 in dizygotic pairs. Heritability was 0.27 overall, 0.83 in pairs diagnosed \u226450, and 0.19 in pairs diagnosed >50.

    "abstract": "High-risk pregnancies, such as twin pregnancies, deserve particular attention as mortality is very high in this group. With a view to inform policy and national guidelines development for the Sustainable Development Goals, we reviewed national training materials, guidelines, and policies underpinning the provision of care in relation to twin pregnancies and assessed care provided to twins in 8 Eastern and Southern African countries: Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\nWe located policies and guidelines by reviewing national repositories and by contacting experts to systematically map country-level maternal and newborn training materials, guidelines, and policies. We extracted recommendations for care for twins spanning ante-, intra-, and postpartum care that typically should be offered during twin pregnancies and childbirth. We compared care provided for mothers of twins to that provided for mothers of singletons during the ante-, intra-, and postpartum period and computed neonatal mortality rates using the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data for each country. There was a paucity of guidance on care specifically for twin or multiple pregnancies: None of the countries provided clear guidance on additional number of antenatal care visits or specific antenatal content, while 7 of the 8 countries recommended twins to be delivered in a comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care facility. These results were mirrored by DHS results of 73,462 live births (of which 1,360 were twin) indicating that twin pregnancies did not receive more frequent or intensified antenatal care. The percentage of twin deliveries in hospitals varied from 25.3% in Mozambique to 63.0% in Kenya, and women with twin deliveries were between 5 and 27 percentage points more likely to deliver in hospitals compared to women with singleton live births; this difference was significant in 5 of the 8 countries (t test p < 0.05). The percentage of twin deliveries by cesarean section varied from 9% in Mozambique to 36% in Rwanda. The newborn mortality rate among twins, adjusted for maternal age and parity, was 4.6 to 7.2 times higher for twins compared to singletons in all 8 countries.\nDespite the limited sample size and the limited number of clinically relevant services evaluated, our study provided evidence that mothers of twins receive insufficient care and that mortality in twin newborns is very high in Eastern and Southern Africa. Most countries have insufficient guidelines for the care of twins. While our data do not allow us to make a causal link between insufficient guidelines and insufficient care, they call for an assessment and reconceptualisation of policies to reduce the unacceptably high mortality in twins in Eastern and Southern Africa.",

    "abstract": "Retinoblastoma has an increased inheritance risk of germline RB1 mutations in offspring and siblings, especially twins. Three families, each having one retinoblastoma-affected twin, were selected for genetic analysis and DNA profiling. Germline RB1 mutations were found in all probands. DNA profiling carried on similar-looking twins of families I and II, proved them to be fraternal. This study demonstrates the importance of genetic analysis of RB1 gene for risk prediction in retinoblastoma families. It also emphasizes that DNA profiling is a mandate for genetic screening of families with twins, thus adding a new dimension in counseling of retinoblastoma.",

    "abstract": "Identifying environmental risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders is challenging due to the number of potential confounders. Twins are of particular interest for researchers interested in studying these types of problems due to their inherent control for the influence of genetic factors. In twin studies, this population can allow environmental risk factors to be more easily identified, and this type of study design may allow the role of biomechanics in injury and disease to be further explored. At present, it is unclear if foot function displays more similarity between certain types of twins. In this study, we hypothesized that the plantar pressures of monozygotic (identical) twins would be more similar between pairs than dizygotic (non-identical) twins. We measured static and dynamic plantar pressures from five pairs of each twin type. Statistical parametric modeling was used to compare pressure distributions at the sensor level. For >80% of stance phase, the pixel level analysis indicated that monozygotic twins had less variation in plantar pressure between pairs. The average z-statistic across the entire trial was 0.88 for the monozygotic group and 1.13 for the dizygotic group. In this study we provide evidence of greater similarity of plantar pressures in monozygotic twin pairs compared to dizygotic twins. This finding supports the use of co-twin studies investigating potentially modifiable environmental and biomechanical risk factors for musculoskeletal conditions that affect the foot and ankle.",

In crude analyses, MH was associated with lower mortality in singletons. In multivariable analyses, the effects of GA and size differed between twins and singletons with and without MH. The best-fitting models included continuous birth weight (rather than SGA) and were stratified by GA. In these models, MH was associated with lower mortality in singletons-but not twins-born after week 25.\nIn this cohort of very preterm infants, the association between MH and mortality differed between singletons and twins and across strata of GA at birth. These estimates cannot be interpreted causally, but suggest that, from a descriptive/predictive standpoint, singletons with MH born after week 25 have lower mortality than singletons born to women without MH.",

    "abstract": "Detection of a single yolk sac on early first trimester ultrasound was previously thought to be a reliable diagnostic feature of monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) twin pregnancies.\nTo determine the frequency of two yolk sacs in MCMA twin pregnancies and the association of yolk sac number with pregnancy outcomes.\nA retrospective cohort analysis of MCMA twins managed at a tertiary obstetric centre from January 2003 until February 2017. All MCMA twin pregnancies were diagnosed on tertiary centre ultrasound and, where possible, placental histopathology postnatally. All MCMA twin pregnancies, including conjoined twins, with available first trimester ultrasounds from 5 to 11 weeks' gestation were included in the analysis. MCMA pregnancies without available first trimester ultrasounds and triplet pregnancies which included a MCMA pair were excluded from the study.\nSixty-seven MCMA cases were identified over 14 years. Thirty-eight cases were included in the analysis. There was one yolk sac identified in 26 cases (68%) and two yolk sacs in 12 cases (32%). Two yolk sacs were associated with a higher proportion of male fetuses (33%, 4 out of 12, vs. 8%, 2 out of 26; p = 0.01). There were no other significant differences between one and two yolk sacs for maternal or neonatal outcomes.\nTwo yolk sacs are present in up to a third of all MCMA twin pregnancies, dispelling the original concept that a single yolk sac is diagnostic of MCMA pregnancies. Yolk sac number should not be used to determine amnionicity. The presence of two yolk sacs on first trimester ultrasound is associated with an increased rate of male fetuses. The number of yolk sacs has no other significant impact on perinatal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The virome is one of the most variable components of the human gut microbiome. Within twin pairs, viromes have been shown to be similar for infants, but not for adults, indicating that as twins age and their environments and microbiomes diverge, so do their viromes. The degree to which the microbiome drives the vast virome diversity is unclear. Here, we examine the relationship between microbiome and virome diversity in 21 adult monozygotic twin pairs selected for high or low microbiome concordance. Viromes derived from virus-like particles are unique to each individual, are dominated by Caudovirales and Microviridae, and exhibit a small core that includes crAssphage. Microbiome-discordant twins display more dissimilar viromes compared to microbiome-concordant twins, and the richer the microbiomes, the richer the viromes. These patterns are driven by bacteriophages, not eukaryotic viruses. Collectively, these observations support a strong role of the microbiome in patterning for the virome.",

    "abstract": "Twin births among users of assisted reproductive technology (ART) pose serious risks to both mothers and infants. However, patients may prefer twins and may be unaware of the risks of twin pregnancies. Increasing use of elective single embryo transfers (eSET) through improved patient education could help to reduce twin births and related adverse health consequences. A systematic review of PUBMED and EMBASE databases was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of patient education among ART users on knowledge of twin pregnancy risks, desire for twins, preference for or use of eSET, and twin pregnancy rates. Of 187 references retrieved, six met the selection criteria. Most focused on patients undergoing their first ART cycle aged <\u00a035\u202fyears. Patient education was delivered via written materials, DVDs or discussion. Four studies reporting on knowledge of risks or desire for twins showed significant effects of oral and written descriptions of multiple pregnancy complications, risks of twins versus singletons, and DVDs with factual information. Five studies showed increased eSET use or preference after patients were educated on the risks of multiple pregnancy and success rates associated with different types of ART procedures, when combined with clinic policies that supported single blastocyst transfers or provided options for insurance. In younger ART users, patient education on twin pregnancy risks and success rates of eSET may improve knowledge of twin pregnancy risks and increase use of eSET, and may be important for wider implementation of eSET in countries such as the USA where the use of eSET remains low. Clinic policies of single blastocyst transfers or financial incentives may strengthen these effects.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to periodontal disease, but the underlying susceptibility pathways are not fully understood. Epigenetic mechanisms are malleable regulators of gene function that can change in response to genetic and environmental stimuli, thereby providing a potential mechanism for mediating risk effects in periodontitis. The aim of this study is to identify epigenetic changes across tissues that are associated with periodontal disease.\nSelf-reported gingival bleeding and history of gum disease, or tooth mobility, were used as indicators of periodontal disease. DNA methylation profiles were generated using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in whole blood, buccal, and adipose tissue samples from predominantly older female twins (mean age 58) from the TwinsUK cohort. Epigenome-wide association scans (EWAS) of gingival bleeding and tooth mobility were conducted in whole blood in 528 and 492 twins, respectively. Subsequently, targeted candidate gene analysis at 28 genomic regions was carried out testing for phenotype-methylation associations in 41 (tooth mobility) and 43 (gingival bleeding) buccal, and 501 (tooth mobility) and 556 (gingival bleeding) adipose DNA samples.\nEpigenome-wide analyses in blood identified one CpG-site (cg21245277 in ZNF804A) associated with gingival bleeding (FDR\u2009=\u20090.03, nominal p value\u2009=\u20097.17e-8) and 58 sites associated with tooth mobility (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05) with the top signals in IQCE and XKR6. Epigenetic variation at 28 candidate regions (247 CpG-sites) for chronic periodontitis showed an enrichment for association with periodontal traits, and signals in eight genes (VDR, IL6ST, TMCO6, IL1RN, CD44, IL1B, WHAMM, and CXCL1) were significant in both traits. The methylation-phenotype association signals validated in buccal samples, and a subset (25%) also validated in adipose tissue.\nEpigenome-wide analyses in adult female twins identified specific DNA methylation changes linked to self-reported periodontal disease. Future work will explore the environmental basis and functional impact of these results to infer potential for strategic personalized treatments and prevention of chronic periodontitis.",

    "abstract": "Age at menarche (AAM) is the point in development when the female starts her first menstrual period and is one of the first milestones in female reproductive life. A combination of genetic and environmental factors plays a role in the timing of female's age at menarche.\nThis study's purpose was to investigate the association between the biological sex of the co-twin and the age at menarche experienced by the female twin. Females from pairs of female-female twins (n = 12,176) and female-male twins (n = 2286) were collected through the Washington State Twin Registry.\nEnvironmental and genetic analyses were conducted. There was no significant difference between females with female twins and females with male twins regarding early, late or normal age at menarche (P = 0.87). However, the adjusted odds of early menarche among females with female twins were 35% lower than females with male co-twins (0.65, 95% CI 0.50-0.83). When using Falconer's formula, an estimated heritability of 0.81 was found with shared (21.8%) and non-shared (40.8%) environmental factors contributing to the age at menarche.\nHaving a male twin during fetal life as a co-twin does not change the age of menarche in future life, although female-female twins have lower age of menarche compared to females from female-male pair. Both genetic and environmental factors determine the age of menarche.",

The abilities, personalities and temperaments of these twins suggest future avenues for research in this interesting area. Next, findings from twin studies and case reports of twins with cleft lip and palate, dental caries, noninvasive prenatal testing and Capgras syndrome (with folie \u00e0 deux) are summarized.

    "abstract": "In this contribution, we compare the optical absorbance behaviour and the structural properties of lead(II)-phthalocyanine (PbPc) and tin(II)-phthalocyanine (SnPc) thin films. To this end, we employ a Ag(1\u20091\u20091) substrate terminated with a monolayer of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride constituting an internal interface whose main effect is an electronic decoupling of the phthalocyanine adlayer from the metal surface. As deduced from low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) measurements, the epitaxial relations and unit cell compositions of the prevailing PbPc monolayer and multilayer domains are confusingly similar to those of SnPc on PTCDA/Ag(1\u20091\u20091). However, SnPc and PbPc can be readily distinguished by their STM-induced switching behaviours: while the former is capable of reversible configurational changes, no effect on the latter could be achieved by us under comparable conditions. This corroborates earlier theoretical predictions and even renders the chemical identification of individual shuttlecock-shaped metal-phthalocyanines feasible.",

    "abstract": "A revised WHO classification of hematopoietic neoplasm introduced the new category 'Myeloid Neoplasms with Germline Predisposition', reflecting the growing importance of genetic testing for myeloid neoplasms. Here, we investigated monozygotic twins with the same de novo mutation in GATA2 but different phenotypes. The patient suffering a bleeding tendency was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and her monozygotic twin showed dysmegakaryopoietic features in the bone marrow. Targeted sequencing revealed the same germline mutation in GATA2, c.1192C\u2009>\u2009T, in both sisters and different somatic mutations in 14 genes between the sisters. The GATA2 mutation was absent in both parents, and their hemograms were normal. The methylation profile of the GATA2 promoter region was different between the twins, showing denser promoter methylation in the patient, correlated with MDS. Thus, we concluded that the twins had acquired a de novo GATA2 mutation but showed different phenotypes, possibly due to the critical role of epigenetic changes.",

    "abstract": "Fear and anxiety are conceptualized as responses to acute or potential threat, respectively. Adult twin studies found substantial interplay between genetic and environmental factors influencing fear disorders (phobias) and anxiety disorders. Research in children, however, has largely examined these factors independently. Thus, there exists a substantial knowledge gap regarding the underlying etiologic structure of these closely-related constructs during development. Symptom counts for five fear (criticism, the unknown, death, animal, medical) and four anxiety (generalized, panic, separation, social) dimensions were obtained for 373 twin pairs ages 9-14. Multivariate twin modeling was performed to elucidate the genetic and environmental influences distributed amongst these dimensions. The best fitting model contained one genetic, two familial environmental, and two unique environmental factors shared between fear and anxiety symptoms plus dimension-specific genetic and unique environmental factors. Although several environmental factors were shared between fear and anxiety dimensions, one latent factor accounted for genetic influences across both domains. While adult studies find somewhat distinct etiological differences between anxiety and phobic disorders, the current results suggest that their relative genetic and environmental influences are not as clearly demarcated in children. These etiological distinctions are more nuanced, likely contributing to the highly diffuse symptom patterns seen during development.",

    "abstract": "To examine genetic influences on interocular similarities in ocular refraction and components of refraction among elderly female twins.\nRefraction was assessed in 94 monozygotic (MZ) and 74 dizygotic (DZ) female twins aged 66-78\u00a0years. Absolute values of interocular differences (Aniso variables) in spherical refraction (SR), refractive astigmatism (AST), spherical equivalent (SE), corneal refractive power (CR), corneal astigmatism (CAST), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and axial length (AL) were calculated. The differences between sisters in each of the Aniso variables were calculated and graded into two categories, best differentiating the groups, here isometropic and anisometropic values. The cut-offs for grading as isometropic were AnisoSR\u00a0<\u00a00.75 D, AnisoAST\u00a0<\u00a00.5 D, AnisoSE\u00a0<\u00a01.0 D, AnisoCR\u00a0<\u00a00.5 D, AnisoCAST\u00a0<\u00a00.50 D, AnisoACD\u00a0<\u00a00.1\u00a0mm and AniosAL\u00a0<\u00a00.1\u00a0mm. Genetic influences on these traits were investigated by comparing the prevalence of isometropic and anisometropic differences between the MZ and DZ pairs in the Aniso variables and the interrelationships between the Aniso variables.\nWhen the Aniso variables were treated as continuous, no significant differences were found between the MZ and DZ subjects. When the proportions of isometropic intratwinpair interocular differences in the Aniso variables in the MZ and DZ cotwins were compared, the prevalences (MZ/DZ) were AnisoSR: 68%/60%; AnisoAST: 66%/57%; AnisoSE: 87%/68%; AnisoCR: 83%/78%; AnisoCAST: 69%/35%; AnisoACD: 77%/63%; and AnisoAL: 76%/60%. The differences were statistically significant for Aniso SE (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035, Fisher's exact test) and CAST (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). The greater homogeneity in the interocular differences between the MZ sisters supports the assumption that isometropia of different elements of refraction is genetically influenced and tending to continue up to older ages. In cases where AnisoSE was <1.0 D, higher CR in one eye was associated with shorter AL (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.398, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), thereby contributing to emmetropization, irrespective of zygosity. In the cases of AnisoSE \u22651 D, no similar influence on emmetropization was observed. The difference between sisters in AnisoSE was associated with the intratwinpair difference in Aniso AL, but not with the intratwinpair differences in AnisoCR, irrespective of zygosity.\nThe higher prevalence of similarities in isometropia of the spherical equivalent and corneal astigmatism between the MZ pairs compared to DZ pairs is consistent with the view that genetic influences on the refractive elements of the eye, tending to isometropia, continue into older age. The interrelation between CR and AL tends to maintain isometropia of SE irrespective of zygosity.",

    "results": "When the Aniso variables were treated as continuous, no significant differences were found between the MZ and DZ subjects. When the proportions of isometropic intratwinpair interocular differences in the Aniso variables in the MZ and DZ cotwins were compared, the prevalences (MZ/DZ) were AnisoSR: 68%/60%; AnisoAST: 66%/57%; AnisoSE: 87%/68%; AnisoCR: 83%/78%; AnisoCAST: 69%/35%; AnisoACD: 77%/63%; and AnisoAL: 76%/60%. The differences were statistically significant for Aniso SE (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035, Fisher's exact test) and CAST (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). The greater homogeneity in the interocular differences between the MZ sisters supports the assumption that isometropia of different elements of refraction is genetically influenced and tending to continue up to older ages. In cases where AnisoSE was <1.0 D, higher CR in one eye was associated with shorter AL (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.398, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), thereby contributing to emmetropization, irrespective of zygosity. In the cases of AnisoSE \u22651 D, no similar influence on emmetropization was observed. The difference between sisters in AnisoSE was associated with the intratwinpair difference in Aniso AL, but not with the intratwinpair differences in AnisoCR, irrespective of zygosity.",

    "abstract": "We describe a pair of female monozygotic twins with Dercum's disease (DD) who presented simultaneously with unprovoked pulmonary emboli. Several genetic determinants have been associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) but the overall influence of genetic factors is unknown. As yet there is no published evidence to support an increase in the risk of VTE in female monozygotic twins. DD is a rare condition characterized by multiple, painful lipomas. The underlying pathology of it is poorly understood. To date, there has been no recorded association with an increased risk of VTE but there have been reports of stroke-like events. It is unclear if these are caused by the condition itself or are co-incidental. We acknowledge the possibility of a coincidence but the two cases raise the question of an association between VTE and DD. This report should encourage further studies into the risk of VTE in female monozygotic twins and DD.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a common disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, and complex aetiology involving both environmental and genetic risk factors. Although some of the major risk factors for stoke, such as smoking and hypertension, are well-documented, the underlying genetic and detailed molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Exploring the relevant biochemical pathways may contribute to the clinical diagnosis of stroke and shed light on its aetiology. A comparative proteomic analysis of blood serum of a pair of monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for ischaemic stroke (IS) was performed using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach. To overcome the limit of reproducibility in the serum preparation, two separate runs were performed, each consisting of three technical replicates per sample. Biological processes associated with proteins differentially expressed between the twins were explored with gene ontology (GO) classification using the functional analysis tool g:Profiler. ANOVA test performed in Progenesis LC-MS identified 179 (run 1) and 209 (run 2) proteins as differentially expressed between the affected and unaffected twin (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, the level of serum fibulin 1, an extracellular matrix protein associated with arterial stiffness, was on average 13.37-fold higher in the affected twin. Each dataset was then analysed independently, and the proteins were classified according to GO terms. The categories overrepresented in the affected twin predominantly corresponded to stroke-relevant processes, including wound healing, blood coagulation and haemostasis, with a high proportion of the proteins overexpressed in the affected twin associated with these terms. By contrast, in the unaffected twin diagnosed with atopic dermatitis, there were increased levels of keratin proteins and GO terms associated with skin development. The identification of cellular pathways enriched in IS as well as the upregulation of fibulin 1 sheds new light on the underlying disease-causing mechanisms at the molecular level. Our findings of distinct proteomic signatures associated with IS and atopic dermatitis suggest proteomic profiling could be used as a general approach for improved diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "We report the case of two monozygotic twins with Thr272fs mutation in progranulin gene. Both patients developed frontotemporal dementia with 5 years difference in age at onset (Twin 1:73 years, Twin 2:68 years), with early behavioral, language, dysexecutive, and memory problems. They had the same formal education (5 years), but while Twin 1 dedicated more to social and leisure activity, Twin 2 worked all her life. At neuroimaging (MRI for Twin 1 and CT for Twin 2), they both showed asymmetric atrophy with left predominance. The two were discordant for total tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid, neuropsychological testing, and smoking habits. The description of the twins can help identify environmental factors that influence the onset and phenotype of frontotemporal dementia.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is known to cause neurocognitive problems, yet it often goes undetected or mistreated. The authors describe 9-year-old twins with snoring, enlarged tonsils, and excessive daytime sleepiness whose symptoms had been previously disregarded by health care professionals. At presentation, a dentist found the patients to be midface deficient and symptomatic. A home sleep test, prescribed by the dentist, revealed apnea-hypopnea index readings of 74/h and 16/h, respectively. The children were referred to an otolaryngologist, and a continuous positive airway pressure therapy trial resulted in improved cognition and temperament. Rapid maxillary expansion was then performed at the dentist office, followed by adenotonsillectomy by an ear, nose, and throat specialist and myofunctional rehabilitation with a speech pathologist for both patients. After treatment, results mimicked those reported during the continuous positive airway pressure trial, with substantially reduced apnea-hypopnea index of 0.9/h and 1.6/h. This case highlights the interdisciplinary nature of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea management and the need for all health care professionals to receive comprehensive sleep medicine training for proper diagnosis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Deregulation of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway is found in cancer with STAT5A/B controlling leukemic cell survival and disease progression. As mutations in STAT5B, but not STAT5A, have been frequently described in hematopoietic tumors, we used BCR/ABL as model systems to investigate the contribution of STAT5A or STAT5B for leukemogenesis. The absence of STAT5A decreased cell survival and colony formation. Even more drastic effects were observed in the absence of STAT5B. STAT5B-deficient cells formed BCR/ABL",

Despite advances in surgical techniques and critical care, the rate of complications and death is still high among twins with total fusion in which the superior sagittal sinus is shared. Here, we describe total-fusion craniopagus twins who at 10 months of age underwent successful surgical separation performed by a multidisciplinary team. Computer-aided design and modeling with a three-dimensional printer, custom-designed cranial distraction and constriction devices, and intraoperative navigation techniques were used. These techniques allowed for separation of the twins at an early age and harnessed the regenerative capacity of their young brains.",

    "abstract": "Whole-exome sequencing has established IQSEC2 as a neurodevelopmental disability gene. The IQSEC2 variant phenotype includes developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, hypotonia, autism, developmental regression, microcephaly and stereotypies but is yet to be fully described. Presented here are 14 new patients with IQSEC2 variants. In addition to the established features, we observed: gait ataxia in 7 of 9 (77.8%), drooling in 9 of 14 (64.2%), early feeding difficulties in 7 of 14 (50%), structural brain abnormalities in 6 of 13 (46.2%), brachycephaly in 5 of 14 (35.7%), and scoliosis and paroxysms of laughter each in 4 of 14 (28.6%). We suggest that these are features of the IQSEC2-related disorder. Gastrostomy requirement, plagiocephaly, strabismus and cortical blindness, each seen in 2 of 14 (14.3%), may also be associated. Shared facial features were noted in 8 of 14 patients, and shared hair patterning was identified in 5 of 14 patients. This study further delineates the IQSEC2 phenotypic spectrum and supports the notion of an emerging IQSEC2 syndrome. We draw parallels between the IQSEC2-related disorder and the Angelman-/Rett-/Pitt-Hopkins syndrome group of conditions and recommend the addition of IQSEC2 to epilepsy and developmental delay gene panels. We observed discordant phenotypes in monozygotic twins and apparent gonadal mosaicism, which has implications for recurrence risk counselling in the IQSEC2-related disorder.",

    "abstract": "Twins, particularly monochorionic (MC) pairs, are at increased risk for fetal death. Whereas previous work has sought to understand the mechanisms for this increased mortality, most studies analyze viable twin pregnancies or liveborn twin cohorts. In the Wisconsin Stillbirth Service Program cohort of 3,137 stillbirths and second trimester miscarriages, we identified 175 twin pregnancies for a twinning rate of 56/1,000, which is approximately double the general population. The excess of twins among miscarriages and stillbirths was attributable to MC pairs as the incidence of dizygotic (DZ) twinning was not increased compared to livebirth data. The leading causes of fetal demise among twins were twin-twin transfusion, acardia, and twin-twin disruption. Maternal causes of death, primarily premature rupture of membranes, were moderately increased in both MC and DZ twins relative to singletons. Although deceased twins were smaller than expected for viable twins at comparable gestational ages, placenta weights of deceased MC pairs were large compared to combined fetal weight, which indicates placental inefficiency likely due to vascular shunting. Co-twin survival was much lower for MC than for DZ pairs. Therefore, earlier diagnosis and treatment of MC twinning complications may decrease prenatal mortality.",

    "abstract": "Atypical growth patterns of the brain have been previously reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but these alterations are heterogeneous across individuals, which may be associated with the variable effects of genetic and environmental influences on brain development. Monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs with and without ASD (aged 6-15 years) were recruited to participate in this study. T1-weighted MRIs (n\u2009=\u2009164) were processed with FreeSurfer to evaluate structural brain measures. Intra-class correlations were examined within twin pairs and compared across diagnostic groups. ACE modeling was also completed. Structural brain measures, including cerebral and cerebellar gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume, surface area, and cortical thickness, were primarily influenced by genetic factors in TD twins; however, mean curvature appeared to be primarily influenced by environmental factors. Similarly, genetic factors accounted for the majority of variation in brain size in twins with ASD, potentially to a larger extent regarding curvature and subcortical GM; however, there were also more environmental contributions in twins with ASD on some structural brain measures, such that cortical thickness and cerebellar WM volume were primarily influenced by environmental factors. These findings indicate potential neurobiological outcomes of the genetic and environmental risk factors that have been previously associated with ASD and, although preliminary, may help account for some of the previously outlined neurobiological heterogeneity across affected individuals. This is especially relevant regarding the role of genetic and environmental factors in the development of ASD, in which certain brain structures may be more sensitive to specific influences.",

    "abstract": "Until now, little was known about the epidemiological characteristics of twins in China due to a lack of reliable national data. In this study, we aimed to analyze temporal trends and perinatal mortality of twins from China.\nData on twins between 2007 and 2014 were obtained from the China National Population-Based Birth Defects Surveillance System. Twin and singleton deliveries after at least 28 weeks of gestation were recruited and followed until postnatal day 42. Twinning rates were defined as the number of twin individuals per 1000 births(stillbirths and live births). The Weinberg's differential method was utilized to estimate the number of monozygotic and dizygotic twins.\nDuring 2007-2014, the twinning rate increased by 32.3% from 16.4 to 21.7 per 1000 total births with an average of 18.8\u2030. Among twins, both the perinatal mortality rate (26.1 per 1000 total births) and neonatal death rate (15.7 per 1000 live births) presented a downward tendency but remained at a high level. Large urban-rural and geographic disparities were identified in twinning rates, in perinatal and neonatal mortality, and in their temporal trends.\nThe upward trend of twinning rates in China paired with the relatively high rates of perinatal and neonatal mortality among twins highlights the need for improved perinatal care in the light of socio-demographic differences.",

    "abstract": "Here, we report phenotypic differences and similarities of monozygotic twins with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type\u00a05 harboring a partial deletion of chromosome 17q12. The proband and her twin sister manifested complete aplasia and marked hypoplasia, respectively, of the body and tail of the pancreas. Whereas both twins showed marked hypoplasia of the right kidney and multiple cysts in both kidneys, only the proband's sister showed hydronephrosis in the left kidney. The proband had profound defects in insulin and glucagon secretion, as well as mild renal dysfunction, whereas her sister had pronounced renal dysfunction accompanied by mild defects in insulin and glucagon secretion. Both twins manifested hypomagnesemia and hyperuricemia, but no apparent liver dysfunction or intellectual disability. The severity of renal and pancreatic defects differed between monozygotic twins with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type\u00a05, suggesting that the phenotypes of this condition are determined not solely by genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the relation between Hb levels and the size of the placental anastomoses.\nWe performed a retrospective review of all uncomplicated MC twins delivered vaginally at our center from 2002 to 2017. Hb levels at birth and on day 2 were retrieved. All MC placentas were routinely injected with colored dye and high-resolution pictures were taken for computer-based analysis. We measured the size of arterio-arterial (AA) and veno-venous (VV) anastomoses as well as the total venous size, defined as the sum of the diameter of first generation of placental veins within 5\u202fcm of each cord insertion. We assessed the relation between Hb levels and placental angioarchitecture.\nA total of 170\u202fMC twin pairs were analyzed. Median Hb level in twin 1 was significantly lower than that in twin 2 both at birth (16.0 versus 17.4\u202fg/dl, P\u202f=\u202f0.02) and on day 2 (14.6 versus 18.1\u202fg/dl, P\u202f=\u202f0.000000188). Inter-twin Hb difference on day 2 was positively correlated with the size of AA anastomoses (Spearman r\u202f=\u202f0.25, 95% CI 0.04-0.43, P\u202f=\u202f0.0161). The diameter of AA anastomoses was positively related to the total size of veins connecting to AA anastomoses in the placental territory of twin 2 (Spearman r\u202f=\u202f0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.66, P\u202f=\u202f0.0001).\nMC twins with larger AA anastomoses have higher Hb differences at birth. Higher Hb levels in second born twins may partly be due to increased placento-fetal transfusion through larger placental vessels.",

When diagnosed at early gestation, one can get adequate time to counsel the family on whether to continue with the pregnancy and proper intervention can be planned. On the other hand, undiagnosed cases may be first recognized in labor after they have caused labor-related complications. In the present case report, an undiagnosed case of a conjoined twin has presented in labor followed by delivery of one baby with the retention of the second baby. This presented a unique challenge to the managing team and required hysterotomy to effect delivery of the unborn baby. We report this case to highlight the importance of early diagnosis of a conjoined twin. On another hand where this does not happen and a conjoined twin is suspected for the first time after it has caused labor-related complications, the management should be individualized based on the clinical circumstance.",

    "abstract": "Chimerism is a phenomenon in which an individual has cells with different genetic content from different zygotes. In dizygotic twins (DTs), chimerism is believed to occur through placental anastomoses that enable the bidirectional exchange of hematopoietic stem cells. Little is still known about chimerism frequency in twins, but several studies have shown a relation between chimerism and some conditions such as autism, Alzheimer's disease, and a group of autoimmune diseases such as Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis. In addition to chimerism of ABO blood groups being possibly mistaken for ABO subgroups, these autoimmune diseases may affect other serologic immunohematologic tests. This study aimed to determine the frequency of chimerism in DTs through ABO and D testing using the tube method, column agglutination, and short tandem repeat (STR) assays. Among the 103 subjects assessed for this study, 24 subjects (12 pairs) were excluded because STR assays showed they were monozygotic; of the remaining, 70 subjects (35 pairs) were DTs and 9 subjects came from gestations of trizygotic triplets. No ABO or D chimerism was detected in any subject through serologic assays, and STR assays did not detect any blood chimerism. Although there was no evidence of chimerism found in this study, we emphasize the importance of observing the family background of individuals with suspected ABO subgroup in complex immunohematologic studies because ABO antigen-antibody reactions are similar in both circumstances, and chimerism can be overlooked. Moreover, the use of the STR analysis method in chimerism studies can be important to help differentiate chimerism and ABO subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) presents a set of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders with impairments in social communication and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior. Here, based on the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of three monozygotic twins discordant for ASD, we explored multiple patient-specific genetic variations and prioritized a list of ASD risk genes. Our results identified DVMT (discordant variation in monozygotic twin) observed in at least two twin pairs, including 14,310 SNPs, 2,425 indels, and 16,735 CNVs, referring to a total of 2,174 genes, and 37 of these were covered by all three types of variations. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of biological processes for 2,174 genes showed that the majority of these genes were related to neurodevelopmental processes. In addition, functional network analysis showed that there was a strong functional relevance between 37 genes covered by all three types of variations. In conclusion, for the first time, we conducted a comprehensive scan of genomic differences between monozygotic twins discordant for ASD, providing researchers with in-depth directions. It may also provide effective strategies for clinical treatment of individuals affected by ASD.",

    "abstract": "We are presenting a monozygotic twin brothers presented at different ages with different presentations. Twin-A presented at age of 18 days with salt losing crisis. Investigations revealed high plasma renin with low-normal aldosterone. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, stimulation test revealed low 17-OH progesterone at 0 and 60 minutes. Adrenocorticotropic hormone level and serum cortisol were normal, which excluded initial impression of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. He was diagnosed to have isolated primary hypoaldosteronism. At age of 18 months, he was noticed to have hyperpigmentation of lips and gum. Adrenal failure was suspected, and hydrocortisone was added. Twin-B presented at 9 years and 6 months of age with adrenal crisis. Both were having unilateral undescended testes. Adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) was suspected after his twin's presentation.\u00a0 Molecular analysis for gene study for both of them revealed adrenal insufficiency, NR0B1 (DAX1) gene mutation. In conclusion, gene analysis is important for the diagnosis of AHC and for genetic counseling.",

    "abstract": "Craniopagus twins are a rare phenomenon and present numerous challenges in separation. Due to the paucity of data, it is paramount to evaluate outcomes based on case studies to continue improving medical and surgical management of these patients. We present a case report of craniopagus twins cared for by the senior author (A.K.G.). The patients underwent extensive surgical planning and 2 attempts at cerebroendovascular embolization to reroute shared venous sinus drainage. After the 2 endovascular procedures, attempted separation at age 41 months was aborted due to intraoperative hemodynamic instability. Eleven-year follow-up shows the twins to be developing well in regard to social and cognitive development. Nonetheless, they have had numerous physical challenges including a fall in 2016 resulting in C1-C2 subluxation in twin B leading to partial spinal cord ischemia and left-sided weakness. The separation of craniopagus twins is fraught with technical, medical, and ethical challenges. Surgical separation of the twins is not always possible without significant risk of devastating consequences to one or both twins. Follow-up of the twins 11 years later raises the question: are some craniopagus twins better off without separation?",

    "abstract": "Structural brain abnormalities and cognitive deficits have been reported in patients with schizophrenia and to a lesser extent in their first-degree relatives (FDRs). Here we investigated whether brain abnormalities in nonpsychotic relatives differ per type of FDR and how these abnormalities are related to intelligent quotient (IQ). Nine hundred eighty individuals from 5 schizophrenia family cohorts (330 FDRs, 432 controls, 218 patients) were included. Effect sizes were calculated to compare brain measures of FDRs and patients with controls, and between each type of FDR. Analyses were repeated with a correction for IQ, having a nonpsychotic diagnosis, and intracranial volume (ICV). FDRs had significantly smaller ICV, surface area, total brain, cortical gray matter, cerebral white matter, cerebellar gray and white matter, thalamus, putamen, amygdala, and accumbens volumes as compared with controls (ds < -0.19, q < 0.05 corrected). Offspring showed the largest effect sizes relative to the other FDRs; however, none of the effects in the different relative types survived correction for multiple comparisons. After IQ correction, all effects disappeared in the FDRs after correction for multiple comparisons. The findings in FDRs were not explained by having a nonpsychotic disorder and were only partly explained by ICV. FDRs show brain abnormalities that are strongly covarying with IQ. On the basis of consistent evidence of genetic overlap between schizophrenia, IQ, and brain measures, we suggest that the brain abnormalities in FDRs are at least partly explained by genes predisposing to both schizophrenia risk and IQ.",

    "abstract": "Identification of the potential donor(s) of human germline-derived cells is an issue in many criminal investigations and in paternity testing. The experimental and statistical methodology necessary to work up such cases is well established but may be more challenging if monozygotic (MZ) twins are involved. Then, elaborate genome-wide searches are required for the detection of early somatic mutations that distinguish the cell sample and its donor from the other twin, usually relying upon reference material other than semen (e.g. saliva). The first such cases, involving either criminal sexual offenses or paternity disputes, have been processed successfully by Eurofins Genomics and Forensics Campus. However, when presenting the experimental results in court, common forensic genetic practice requires that the residual uncertainty about donorship is quantified in the form of a likelihood ratio (LR). Hence, we developed a general mathematical framework for LR calculation, presented herein, which allows quantification of the evidence in favour of the true donor in the respective cases, based upon observed DNA sequencing read counts.",

    "abstract": "To investigate associations between anthropometric measures (birthweight, weight gain and current BMI) and back pain; and to determine whether these associations differ between those born with low or full birthweight.\nThe cross-sectional associations between the lifetime prevalence of back pain and anthropometric measures (birthweight, weight gain and current BMI) among 2754 adult twins were investigated in three stages: total sample; within-pair case-control for monozygotic and dizygotic twins together; and within-pair case-control analysis separated by dizygotic and monozygotic. Results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nBirthweight was not associated with back pain (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.99-1.00), but a weak association was found between weight gain (OR 1.01; CI 1.00-1.01) or current BMI (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00-1.05) and back pain in the total sample analysis. These associations did not remain significant after adjusting for genetics. The associations did not differ between those whose were born with low or full birthweight.\nBirthweight was not associated with prevalence of back pain in adulthood. Weight gain and current BMI were weakly associated with back pain prevalence in the total sample analysis but did not differ between those born with low or full birthweight. However, the small-magnitude association only just achieved significance and appeared to be confounded by genetics and the early shared environment. Our results suggest that a direct link between these predictors and back pain in adults is unlikely. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.",

    "abstract": "Twin research has found genetic influence underlying vocational interests, work values, and job satisfaction. In addition, numerous studies have shown that monozygotic (MZ) twins generally display greater within-pair cooperation and social closeness than dizygotic (DZ) twins. These findings are illuminated by exploring the occupational histories of two female twin pairs, one set MZ and the other set DZ. This is followed by a review of timely twin-based research reports on molar pregnancy, social support, conjoined twinning, and immune discordance. Finally, news items regarding identical twin politicians, multiple birth marriages, a new Guinness World Record for twins, and a twin-family story from the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Santiago, Chile are both interesting and informative.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with periodontal traits considering genetic and environmental background in predominantly older female twins.\nThis was a cross-sectional study using self-reported questionnaires for periodontal traits in TwinsUK. Age-adjusted and age-stratified multivariate analyses were conducted for all twins. Subsequently, co-twin control analysis within genetically identical twins who were discordant for periodontal traits was performed by controlling for genetic confounders.\nData of twins aged 20-91 were available in 4,143 individuals for self-reported periodontitis and 4,244 for gum bleeding. Age-adjusted model showed increasing risk in the following: smoking, anxiety/stress and depression for both periodontal traits. Within discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins (514 individuals for periodontitis and 754 for gum bleeding), the association of anxiety/stress remained significant for both periodontitis (OR 1.60, CI: 1.02-2.52) and gum bleeding (OR 1.60, CI: 1.06-2.40). A significant relationship for depression remained for periodontitis (OR 1.68, CI: 1.04-2.70), but it was no longer significant for gum bleeding. Age stratification showed that the association of mood disorders with periodontal traits was generally stronger in older group.\nMultivariate analysis among discordant MZ female twins found mood disorders were independently associated with periodontal traits, suggesting that genetic/early-life environmental factors may not explain this association.",

    "abstract": "To assess neonatal and 2-year outcomes for preterm twins born after planned vaginal delivery compared with planned cesarean delivery.\nWomen with preterm cephalic first twins delivered after preterm labor or preterm prelabor rupture of membranes from 24 0/7 to 34 6/7 weeks of gestation, with both fetuses alive at the beginning of labor, were identified from the national prospective population-based Etude Epid\u00e9miologique sur les Petits Ages Gestationnels 2 cohort study. Planned vaginal delivery was defined as vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery performed during labor. Planned cesarean delivery was considered if performed during labor for the indication of preterm twins or before labor whatever the indication. A propensity score analysis was used to compare planned vaginal delivery and planned cesarean delivery. Outcomes analyzed separately for the first and second twins were survival at discharge, survival at discharge without severe morbidity, and survival at 2 years of corrected age without neurosensory impairment.\nAmong the 932 women with a twin pregnancy, 549 were excluded mainly as a result of the first twin in noncephalic presentation, cause of delivery other than preterm labor or preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, at least one twin died before labor, and gestational age at delivery less than 24 weeks of gestation. The planned vaginal delivery group included 276 women and the planned cesarean delivery group 107. For first and second twins, survival at discharge (97.7% vs 98.3% and 95.6% vs 97.1%, respectively), survival at discharge without severe morbidity (91.6% vs 88.8% and 90.3% vs 84.5%, respectively), and survival at 2 years of corrected age without neurosensory impairment (96.0% vs 95.4% and 92.9% vs 90.8%, respectively) did not differ significantly between the planned vaginal delivery and planned cesarean delivery groups. Propensity score analysis showed that planned cesarean delivery was not associated with improved outcomes with the caveat that the infrequency of death and disability limited the statistical power of the study to detect potentially clinically meaningful differences between planned modes of delivery.\nPlanned cesarean delivery for women in preterm labor or with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes was not associated with improved neonatal outcomes or 2-year outcomes.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the neural correlates of emotion regulation and -reactivity in adult unaffected monozygotic twins with a co-twin history of unipolar or bipolar disorder (high-risk), remitted or partially remitted twins with a personal history of unipolar or bipolar disorder (affected) and twins with no personal or first-degree family history of unipolar or bipolar disorder (low-risk).\nWe assessed 37 high-risk, 56 affected and 28 low-risk participants. Participants viewed unpleasant and neutral pictures during functional magnetic resonance imaging and were instructed to down-regulate their emotional response through reappraisal or mental imagery, as well as to maintain the elicited emotion.\nAfter adjusting for subsyndromal depressive symptoms, bilateral supplementary motor areas, posterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortices and the left frontal eye field showed less activity during reappraisal of unpleasant pictures in high-risk than low-risk participants. Notably, affected participants did not differ from high-risk or low-risk participants in neural response during reappraisal. There were no group differences in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex seed based functional connectivity during reappraisal or neural response during mental imagery or emotional reactivity.\nLesser response in dorsal midline areas might reflect familial risk related abnormalities during down regulation of emotional reactivity through reappraisal.",

    "abstract": "The role of epigenetic in regulating of the gene expression profile the embryo has been documented. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one of these epigenetic mechanisms. Twins are valuable models in determining the relative contributions of genetics and the environment. In this study, we compared differences in the expression levels of 44 miRNAs in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of identical twins to that of fraternal twins as a controls.\nIn this experimental study, CD133\nSignificant differences in expression were observed in both fraternal and identical twins to varying degrees, but variations alteration in expression of the miRNAs were higher in fraternal twins.\nIdentical twins had a positive correlation in miRNA expression, while the correlation was not statistically significant in fraternal twins. Altogether, more differences in miRNA expression level in fraternal twins can be attributed to the both genetics and the intrauterine environment. The contribution of the intrauterine environment and genetics to miRNAs expression in HSCs was estimated 8 and 92%, respectively. By comparing of miRNA expression in identical and fraternal twins and identification of their target genes and biological pathways, it could be possible to estimate the effects of genetics and the environment on a number of biological pathways.",

    "conclusions": "Identical twins had a positive correlation in miRNA expression, while the correlation was not statistically significant in fraternal twins. Altogether, more differences in miRNA expression level in fraternal twins can be attributed to the both genetics and the intrauterine environment. The contribution of the intrauterine environment and genetics to miRNAs expression in HSCs was estimated 8 and 92%, respectively. By comparing of miRNA expression in identical and fraternal twins and identification of their target genes and biological pathways, it could be possible to estimate the effects of genetics and the environment on a number of biological pathways.",

    "abstract": "The fasting-state serum bile acid profile in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been reported to differ when nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is compared to nonalcoholic fatty liver. However, there are few data comparing changes in NAFLD vs non-NAFLD, or whether the bile acid profile differs according to the degree of fibrosis.\nTo examine the serum bile acid profile across the entire spectrum of NAFLD.\nWe performed a cross-sectional analysis of two complementary cohorts: a Twin and Family cohort of 156 participants, and a biopsy-proven-NAFLD cohort of 156 participants with fasting bile acid profiling using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.\nIn the Twin and Family cohort (mean age 46.3\u00a0years and body mass index (BMI) 26.6\u00a0kg/m\nFasting-state serum bile acid profile alterations are seen across the entire spectrum of NAFLD. The total serum bile acids did not differ significantly between NAFLD vs non-NAFLD and nonalcoholic fatty liver vs nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but were significantly perturbed progressively as liver fibrosis increases.",

    "abstract": "Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of strabismus and subsequent ocular dominance and amblyopia. Our purpose was to compare the characteristics of sensory visual function in 2 adult monozygotic (genetically identical) twins who presented with esotropia at different ages.\nMonocular and binocular visual function was measured in the twins. Contrast sensitivity was used to assess monocular function. Suppressive and stereoscopic measurements were undertaken to assess binocular function. All tests were run using a 2-alternative forced choice psychophysical procedure. Eighteen short tandem repeats (STR) were genotyped across the genome in both twins to determine their exact relationship.\nTwin 1 (nondominant eye OD) was diagnosed with esotropia at 6 months of age, whereas twin 2 (nondominant eye OS) was diagnosed with esotropia at 5 years of age. They underwent a similar corrective surgical intervention soon after diagnosis to correct their esodeviations. Monocular contrast sensitivity was poorer for twin 1, particularly at intermediate spatial frequencies. In addition, twin 1 demonstrated complete suppression and unmeasurable stereoscopic function (>300 seconds). On the other hand, twin 2 demonstrated fusion, exhibited only mild suppression, and had near-normal (28 seconds) stereoscopic function. All STR alleles were identical in the twins, proving monozygosity.\nSensory measurements of monocular and binocular visual function in these genetically proven monozygotic twins were significantly different, with the earlier onset of esotropia associated with reduced visual function. Twin 2, whose esotropia was diagnosed at the age of 5 years, had near-normal visual function, both monocularly and binocularly. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first study of a genetically identical sibling pair with strabismus. By eliminating the genetic differences between these patients, we are able to make powerful observations about the effect of environment on visual function in strabismus.",

    "abstract": "Omphalopagus twins are joined ventrally in the umbilical region. In omphalopagus twins, liver's fusion is very frequent, being present in about 80% of cases. Two conjoined twins born in our Hospital were evaluated using plain x-rays, ultrasound (US), gastrointestinal xrays, Tc-99 hepatobiliary scintigraphy (SC) and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT). There was no bony connection on conventional xrays, neither bowel communication on GI x-rays study. US demonstrated the fusion of left hepatic lobes and a not-quantifiable vascular shunt. Normal biliary function was demonstrated by Tc-99 SC. The first CT scan (twin A) showed irregular lobules in the site of hepatic fusion, a portoportal shunt and a venous vessel to the inferior vena cava of twin B. Only the second CT scan (twin B) showed an arterio-arterial partiallyextrahepatic shunts. The double CT scan allows to increase the probability of a correct individuation and description of vascular shunts for an effective preoperatory assessment. The omphalopagus twins in our case underwent planned surgical separation at 5\u202fmonths of age. The surgery lasted 5\u202fh and was not affected by any intraoperative complications.",

    "abstract": "Dyslipidemia represents a strong and independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Plasma cholesterol, such as total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), is the common indicator of diagnosing dyslipidemia. Here based on 382 Chinese twin pairs, we explored the magnitude of genetic impact on TC, HDL-C, LDL-C variation and further searched for genetic susceptibility loci for them using genome-wide association study (GWAS). The ACE model was the best fit model with additive genetic parameter (A) accounting for 26.6%, common or shared environmental parameter (C) accounting for 47.8%, unique/non-shared environmental parameter (E) accounting for 25.6% for the variance in HDL-C. The AE model was the best fit model for TC (A: 61.4%; E: 38.6%) and LDL-C (A: 65.5%; E: 34.5%). While no SNPs reached the genome-wide significance level (",

    "abstract": "Major depression is a complex disorder with no single, direct causal mechanism. Morbidity has been linked to genetic processes, developmental history, and unique environmental exposures. Epigenetic mechanisms, especially DNA methylation, are also likely important factors in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). A community-based twin sample has many advantages for epigenetic studies, given the shared genetic and developmental histories of same-sex twin pairs. This article describes the rationale and study design for the Mood and Methylation Study in which 133 twin pairs (101 monozygotic and 32 dizygotic), both discordant and concordant for lifetime history of MDD, were evaluated on a large number of variables related to MDD. The twins also provided blood samples for an epigenome-wide association study of differentially methylated regions (DMR) relevant to MDD. Although MDD is typically considered a disorder of the central nervous system, it is unfeasible to obtain a large sample of brain tissues. However, epigenetic variation is not limited to the affected tissue but can also be detected in peripheral blood leukocytes. Thus, this study focused on monocytes for the major analyses. Additional plans for the study include gene expression analysis from the same set of twins using RNA-seq and validation of significant DMRs in postmortem brain tissues from a separate sample. Moreover, sufficient samples have been collected to perform future 'multi-omic' analyses, including metabolome, microbiome, and transcriptome. Our long-term goal is to understand how epigenomic and other 'omic' factors can be manipulated for diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic purposes for MDD and its related conditions.",

    "abstract": "X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) refers to a clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder, in which males are more heavily affected than females. Among the syndromic forms of XLID, identified by additional clinical signs as part of the disease spectrum, the association between XLID and severe myopia has been poorly characterized. We used whole exome sequencing (WES) to study two Italian male twins presenting impaired intellectual function and adaptive behavior, in association with severe myopia and mild facial dysmorphisms. WES analysis detected the novel, maternally inherited, mutation c.916G\u2009>\u2009C (G306R) in the X-linked heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 2 (HS6ST2) gene. HS6ST2 transfers sulfate from adenosine 3'-phosphate, 5'-phosphosulfate to the sixth position of the N-sulphoglucosamine residue in heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans. Low HS sulfation levels are associated with defective optic disc and stalk morphogenesis during mammalian visual system development. The c.916G>C variant affects the HS6ST2 substrate binding site, and its effect was considered \"deleterious\" by in-silico tools. An in-vitro enzymatic assay showed that the HS6ST2 mutant isoform had significantly reduced sulphotransferase activity. Taken together, the results suggest that mutant HS6ST2 is possibly involved in the development of myopia and cognitive impairment, characteristics of the probands reported here.",

However, the association between gestational age and long-term morbidity among twins remains unclear.\nTo examine the association of gestational age with child health and neurological development in early childhood among twins.\nPopulation-based longitudinal study.\nWe included 947 children from 479 pairs of twins with information on gestational age.\nHospitalization was used as an indicator of physical health, and responses to questions about age-appropriate behaviors were used as an indicator of neurobehavioral development. We conducted binomial log-linear regression analyses, controlling for both child and maternal variables in the model. We accounted for correlations within the pairs with generalized estimating equations.\nThe early term group (i.e., 37 to 38\u202fweeks of gestation) had a lower risk of poor child health and unfavorable neurodevelopment compared with the full term group (\u226539\u202fweeks of gestation) and preterm group (<37\u202fweeks of gestation). Compared with the early term group, the adjusted risk ratios for hospitalization for all causes during the period from 7 to 18\u202fmonths of age was 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.3-3.8) for very preterm children (<32\u202fweeks of gestation), 1.1 (0.8-1.6) for moderately and late preterm children (32 to 36\u202fweeks of gestation), and 1.8 (1.0-3.2) for full term children.\nWe observed a U-shaped association of gestational age with child health and neurodevelopment.

    "abstract": "Fetal stroke is an important cause of cerebral palsy but is difficult to diagnose unless imaging is undertaken in pregnancies at risk because of known maternal or fetal disorders. Fetal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging may show haemorrhage or ischaemic lesions including multicystic encephalomalacia and focal porencephaly. Serial imaging has shown the development of malformations including schizencephaly and polymicrogyra after ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. Recognised causes of haemorrhagic fetal stroke include alloimmune and autoimmune thrombocytopaenia, maternal and fetal clotting disorders and trauma but these are relatively rare. It is likely that a significant proportion of periventricular and intraventricular haemorrhages are of venous origin. Recent evidence highlights the importance of arterial endothelial dysfunction, rather than thrombocytopaenia, in the intraparenchymal haemorrhage of alloimmune thrombocytopaenia. In the context of placental anastomoses, monochorionic diamniotic twins are at risk of twin twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), or partial forms including Twin Oligohydramnios Polyhydramnios Sequence (TOPS), differences in estimated weight (selective Intrauterine growth Retardation; sIUGR), or in fetal haemoglobin (Twin Anaemia Polycythaemia Sequence; TAPS). There is a very wide range of ischaemic and haemorrhagic injury in a focal as well as a global distribution. Acute twin twin transfusion may account for intraventricular haemorrhage in recipients and periventricular leukomalacia in donors but there are additional risk factors for focal embolism and cerebrovascular disease. The recipient has circulatory overload, with effects on systemic and pulmonary circulations which probably lead to systemic and pulmonary hypertension and even right ventricular outflow tract obstruction as well as the polycythaemia which is a risk factor for thrombosis and vasculopathy. The donor is hypovolaemic and has a reticulocytosis in response to the anaemia while maternal hypertension and diabetes may influence stroke risk. Understanding of the mechanisms, including the role of vasculopathy, in well studied conditions such as alloimmune thrombocytopaenia and monochorionic diamniotic twinning may lead to reduction of the burden of antenatally sustained cerebral palsy.",

    "abstract": "Acute liver failure (ALF) in neonates is rare. Although the incidence is reported to be rare, neonatal hemochromatosis (NH) has to be considered as one of the causes of neonatal ALF. We present a pair of dichorionic twin who had a diverse clinical presentation of NH. One twin passed away despite medical treatment with exchange transfusion and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), whereas the other twin suffered from only mildly deranged liver function, which normalized spontaneously. Early identification of liver failure and clinical awareness of this disease entity are essential to its timely diagnosis and treatment. Antenatal management using IVIg prevents the recurrence of NH in subsequent pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by insensitivity to noxious stimulus and the absence of sweating. Fractures and joint destruction are common complications, but detailed studies on mineral and skeletal homeostasis are not available. Mental retardation is often reported, but detailed observations during childhood are lacking.\nA pair of 46-month-old Chinese identical twin brothers was presented at our hospital. The brothers had the typical manifestations of insensitivity to noxious stimulus, inability to sweat, and recurrent episodes of unexplained fever. Fortunately, they did not present common complications such as self-mutilation, trauma, bruise, and repeated bone fractures.\nTwo novel compound heterozygous variants of NTRK1 (c.632T\u200a>\u200aA and c.1253_1254delTC) were identified.\nThe patients were subjected to routine and specialist clinical examinations. Daily care and symptomatic treatment were given.\nX-ray films of proband 2 showed a fracture in the first metatarsal. Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and mild-to-moderate retardation of the Gesell developmental schedules (GDS), especially language and adaptability, were observed. Evaluation results for BMD and GDS in proband 2 were worse than those in his brother.\nThe current findings expand our knowledge about the spectrum of phenotypic and genotypic features of CIPA, which will help facilitate future genotype-phenotype association studies. Daily care by parents promotes favorable outcomes in patients.",

    "abstract": "T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data contain information about infections that could be used in disease diagnostics and vaccine development, but extracting that information remains a major challenge. Here we developed a statistical framework to detect TCR clone proliferation and contraction from longitudinal repertoire data. We applied this framework to data from three pairs of identical twins immunized with the yellow fever vaccine. We identified 600 to 1,700 responding TCRs in each donor and validated them using three independent assays. While the responding TCRs were mostly private, albeit with higher overlap between twins, they could be well-predicted using a classifier based on sequence similarity. Our method can also be applied to samples obtained postinfection, making it suitable for systematic discovery of new infection-specific TCRs in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "In monozygotic twins two embryos are formed from a single fertilized egg. In \"mirror image twins\" identical siblings have reverse asymmetric features in the right and left sides of the body. We report the case of twins with mirror-image hypermetropic anisometropia. They were referred to an ophthalmologist at the age of 3.5\u00a0years for amblyopia. Cycloplegic refraction of twin 1 was +1.00 in the right eye and +4.50 -0.75 \u00d7180 in the left eye; of twin 2, +4.75 -1.00 \u00d7180 and\u00a0+1.25. Keratometry and axial length were measured with Lenstar LS 900 when the twins were 6\u00a0years of age. In twin 1, the axial length was 22.18\u00a0mm in the right eye and 20.97 in the left eye; in twin 2, 20.94\u00a0mm and 22.13. Keratomtry of both eyes of these twins was relatively equal.",

    "abstract": "Recent discoveries highlight the importance of stochastic epigenetic changes, as indexed by epigenetic outlier DNA methylation signatures, as a valuable tool to understand aberrant cell function and subsequent human pathology. There is evidence of such changes in different complex disorders as diverse as cancer, obesity and, to a lesser extent, depression. The current study was aimed at identifying outlying DNA methylation signatures of depressive psychopathology. Here, genome-wide DNA methylation levels were measured (by means of Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip) in peripheral blood of thirty-four monozygotic twins informative for depressive psychopathology (lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses). This dataset was explored to identify outlying epigenetic signatures of depression, operationalized as extreme hyper- or hypo-methylation in affected co-twins from discordant pairs that is not observed across the rest of the study sample. After adjusting for blood cell count, there were thirteen CpG sites across which depressed co-twins from the discordant pairs exhibited outlying DNA methylation signatures. None of them exhibited a methylation outlier profile in the concordant and healthy pairs, and some of these loci spanned genes previously associated with neuropsychiatric phenotypes, such as GHSR and KCNQ1. This exploratory study provides preliminary proof-of-concept validation that epigenetic outlier profiles derived from genome-wide DNA methylation data may be related to depression risk.",

    "abstract": "Low birth weight is associated with perinatal and long-term morbidity and mortality, and may be a result of abnormal placental development and function. In studies of singletons, associations have been reported between features of placental morphology and birth weight. Evaluating similar associations within twin pairs offers a unique opportunity to control for key confounders shared within a twin pair, including gestational age, parental characteristics, and intrauterine environment. Data from 3 studies in the United States that were completed from 2012 to 2013, 2006 to 2008, and 1959 to 1966 were used in our analysis of 208 sets of dichorionic twins with unfused placentas. We used linear regression to model difference in birth weight within a twin pair as a function of differences in placental characteristics (i.e., thickness, 2-dimensional surface area, intraplacental difference in diameter). After controlling for sex discordance, a 75.3- cm2 difference in placental surface area, which reflects the interquartile range, was associated with a difference in birth weight of 142.1 g (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.9, 221.3). The magnitude of the association also may be larger for same-sex male pairs than same-sex female pairs (males: 265.8 g, 95% CI: 60.8, 470.8; females: 133.0 g, 95% CI: 15.7, 250.3). Strong associations between surface area and birth weight are consistent with reported results for singleton pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the effects of genetic and environment influences and sex on injury involvement using two sets of Finnish twin data. The younger participants were 955 twins born between 1983 and 1987, aged 20 to 24 years. The older participants were 12,428 twins born between 1930 and 1957, aged 33 to 60 years. Within-twin correlations in monozygotic and dizygotic twins suggested that genetic effects play no role in injury involvement among young twins, but do have some effect at older ages. The results indicated that environmental factors have greater importance in injury involvement than genetic factors in the younger twin data set (FT12), whereas in a middle-aged (33-60 years) twin data set, genetic effects explained about quarter of the variance in injury involvement. Sex was a strong contributing factor, with males being generally more prone to injuries than females.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of secondary urinary reconstruction of previously separated conjoined twins with exstrophic bladder and urinary incontinence. Patients were male and aged 13-year-old. Twin one had a history of failed enterocystoplasty that extruded and was visible like an exstrophic neobladder. He underwent a procedure to close bladder neck and reconfigure abdominal wall. After the procedure the patient developed a fistula that was treated, but it persisted and, for this reason, a catheterizable pouch was constructed and native bladder was discarded. Twin two required the immediately construction of catheterizable pouch using the Macedo's technique. Currently, both patients are continent at 4 hour intervals. The mean follow-up was 8 months. Modern continent urinary diversion techniques offer new perspectives and hope for such complex population.\nRelata-se caso de reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o urin\u00e1ria em g\u00eameos siameses previamente separados com apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o cl\u00ednica de bexiga extr\u00f3fica e incontin\u00eancia urin\u00e1ria.

    "abstract": "Trisomy 21, or Down syndrome (DS), is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 500-750 live births. The prevalence of DS has increased over the past two decades, correlating with a rise in the proportion of pregnancies complicated by advanced maternal age. There is also a correlation between advanced maternal age and dizygotic twinning rates. There is an increased risk of at least one twin being affected in dizygotic pregnancies compared to singletons. However, despite this greater relative risk, reports of concordance of DS in both dizygotic twins are very rare. Congenital heart disease (CHD) occurs in roughly 40% of individuals with DS, but there can be considerable phenotypic variation. The most common, atrioventricular septal defect accounts for only 40% of CHD seen in DS. There is also a higher incidence of CHD in twins, but also with a low incidence of concordance. There have been only five reported cases of concordant DS in dizygotic twins with confirmed chromosomal analyses; none of which describe concordant congenital heart disease. Here, we describe an unusual case of dizygotic twins of differing genders concordant for both Down syndrome and congenital heart disease of a strikingly similar presentation.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the placental characteristics of monochorionic twin pregnancies with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) classified according to the Gratac\u00f3s classification based on umbilical artery Doppler measurements.\nAll consecutive placentas from monochorionic twin pregnancies with sIUGR, (defined as a birthweight discordance > 25% and/or an estimated fetal weight in one twin <10th centile) examined between May 2002 and February 2018 were included in the study. Each placenta was injected with colored dye to study the angioarchitecture. Primary outcomes were placental share discordance and diameter of the arterio-arterial anastomoses in relation to the umbilical artery Doppler types of sIUGR (Gratac\u00f3s classification).\nOf the 83 sIUGR twins included, 27 were classified as Gratac\u00f3s type I, 24 as type II and 32 as type III. The median gestational age at delivery was 34.3 weeks for type I, compared to 31.2 weeks and 31.6 weeks for type II and type III respectively. A trend towards a higher placental share discordance in type III sIUGR was observed. The median arterio-arterial diameter was 1.7\u202fmm (0.8-2.6) in type I, 1.7\u202fmm (1.2-2.2) in type II and 2.8 (2.0-3.5) mm in type III (p\u202f<\u202f0.01).\nType III sIUGR placentas appear to be characterized by a larger diameter of the arterio-arterial anastomoses and a larger placental share discordance compared to type I and II sIUGR. The insights in the placental architecture of sIUGR placentas may offer new views on the pathophysiology of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Myopia is an increasingly prevalent condition globally. A greater understanding of contemporaneous, early life factors associated with myopia risk is urgently required, particularly in younger onset myopia as this correlates with higher severity and increased complications in adult life.\nAnalysis of a subset of the longitudinal, UK-based Twins Early Development Study (n=1991) recruited at birth between 1994 and 1996. Subjective refraction was obtained from the twin's optometrists; mean age 16.3 years (SD 1.7). Myopia was defined as mean spherical equivalent \u2264-0.75 dioptres. A life course epidemiology approach was used to appropriately weight candidate myopia risk factors during critical periods of eye growth. Adjusted ORs for myopia were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models at each life stage, together with variance explained (r\nFactors significantly associated with myopia included level of maternal education (OR 1.33, 95%\u2009CI 1.11 to 1.59), fertility treatment (OR 0.63, 95%\u2009CI 0.43 to 0.92), summer birth (OR 1.93, 95%\u2009CI 1.28 to 2.90) and hours spent playing computer games (OR 1.03, 95%\u2009CI 1.01 to 1.06). The total variance explained by this model was 4.4 % (p<0.001) and the AUROC was 0.68 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.72). Consistent associations were observed with socioeconomic status, educational attainment, reading enjoyment and cognitive variables, particularly verbal cognition, at multiple points over the life course.\nThis study identifies known and novel associations with myopia during childhood development; associated factors identified in early life reflect sociological and lifestyle trends such as rates of maternal education, fertility treatment, early schooling and computer games.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the impact of differences in nearwork and time spent outdoors on difference in refraction in monozygotic (MZ) twins.\nData on MZ twins aged 7 to 18 years from the Guangzhou Twin Eye Study were used in this analysis. A standard questionnaire was administered by personal interview to estimate time spent on nearwork and time spent outdoors. Spherical equivalent (SE) was measured by autorefraction under cycloplegia. The interaction between age and nearwork or time spent outdoors was also estimated.\nA total of 490 MZ twin pairs (233 male and 257 female) were eligible in this analysis, the mean age was 13.14 \u00b1 2.49. In the mixed-effects model, nearwork difference was a risk factor of discordance in myopic SE (\u03b2 = -0.11 diopter (D)/h, P = 0.009), the overall association between time outdoors difference and SE discordance was not significant (\u03b2 = -0.89 (D)/h, P = 0.120) although an interaction between time spent outdoors difference and age was detected (\u03b2 = 0.07 (D)/h, P = 0.002). Furthermore, difference in nearwork and time outdoors explained about 1.8% and 2.5% of the variation in SE discordance, respectively.\nGiven the very marked genetic similarity of MZ twins, and the small effects of known risk factors on SE discordance, we suggest that the SE discordance across MZ twins largely results from stochastic variations at the genomic or epigenetic levels, or from uncollected environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to revisit the topic of compensatory interactions between maxillary anterior teeth during development advanced by Sofaer et al. (1971). We addressed the hypotheses listed by Sofaer and colleagues using data derived from our Australian twin sample to investigate whether final tooth size in permanent maxillary central incisors and canines showed evidence of developmental compensation for adjacent missing or microdont lateral incisors. Such compensation is one factor interacting in the complex system of dental development.\nA 2D image analysis system was used to measure crown height from the labial view, labiopalatal crown width from the incisal view, and mesiodistal crown width from both the labial (MDl) and incisal (MDi) views of the permanent maxillary central incisors and canines on the dental study model of twins enrolled in a longitudinal study of dental development.\nDevelopmental variations of maxillary lateral incisors influence the morphogenesis of the adjacent teeth. For example, individuals with one missing lateral incisor and one lateral incisor of average dimensions, had significantly larger central incisors than the control group for the MDl and MDi dimensions (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Of the 7 monozygotic twin pairs, 6 were discordant in maxillary anterior hypodontia and microdontia, and 13 out of 14 dizygotic twin pairs were discordant.\nThis study provides further evidence of developmental interactions in the maxillary anterior region, partially supporting Sofaer and colleagues' hypotheses. These interactions are part of a complex adaptive system involving genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this longitudinal analysis of untreated monozygotic twins were to investigate the change of the facial soft tissues during growth, to determine the concordance of soft tissue growth patterns between genetically identical twins, and to assess the genetic component of soft tissue development.\nThe sample consisted of 33 pairs of untreated monozygotic twins (23 male, 10 female) from the Forsyth Moorrees Twin Study (1959-1975); lateral cephalograms taken from 6 to 18\u00a0years of age were analyzed at 3-year intervals. Cephalograms were traced, and longitudinal changes in the soft tissue profile between twins were analyzed with intraclass correlation coefficients and linear regression modelling.\nThe concordance between monozygotic twins at 18\u00a0years of age was moderate to high with intraclass correlation coefficients values between 0.37 and 0.87. Additionally, female twins showed higher concordance at 18\u00a0years of age than did male twins for all included variables. However, about 10% to 46% of the twin pairs had large differences in their soft tissue parameters, even after the growth period.\nAlthough monozygotic twins possess the same genetic material, differences in the soft tissues were found. This supports the complex developmental mechanism of the human face and the varying influence of genetic and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "To compare neonatal and infant mortality rates stratified by gestational age (GA) between singletons and twins and examine the three leading causes of death among them.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study using the U.S. vital statistics datasets. The study was restricted to nonanomalous live births at 24 to 40 weeks delivered in 2005 to 2014. We used multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error variance to examine the association between birth plurality (singleton vs. twin) and mortality outcomes within each GA, while adjusting for confounders. The results were presented as adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nOf 26,292,747 live births, 96.6% were singletons and 3.4% were twins. At 29 to 36 weeks of GA, compared with singletons, twins had a lower risk of neonatal mortality (aRR: 0.37-0.78) and infant mortality (aRR: 0.54-0.86). When examined by GA, the three leading causes of neonatal and infant mortality varied between singletons and twins.\nWhen stratified by GA, the risk of neonatal and infant mortality was lower at 29 to 36 weeks in twins than in singletons, though the cause of death varied.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins, resulting from a single fertilized egg giving rise to two separate embryos, are monozygotic and considered genetically identical. However, discordant phenotypes have been reported in monozygotic twins. We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 155 monochorionic pregnancies (312 twins) with major discordant structural anomalies coded by the ICD-10 system in order to describe the spectrum of anomalies, the management of the pregnancies, and the perinatal outcome. Treatment options included conservative management, selective feticide with bipolar cord coagulation, or complete termination. All survivors underwent at least 24 months of postnatal follow-up. Discordancy was complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome in eight pregnancies (5%) and by selective intrauterine growth restriction in 41 (26%). Major structural anomalies affected one system in 139 cases (90%) and multiple systems in 16 (10%). Median gestational age at diagnosis was 19.1 weeks (IQR 16.4-21.3). The most frequent single-system anomalies involved the nervous and circulatory systems. In total, 72 anomalous twins (46%) and 116 normal co-twins (74%) were delivered at a median gestational age of 34.6 weeks (IQR 31.0-36.3). Neonatal/infant death of the anomalous twin occurred in 22 cases (14%), with an overall survival rate of 32% (50/155). Surviving anomalous twins underwent major surgery in 22/50 cases (44%), four of whom (8%) now suffer from severe neurologic morbidity. This study shows that a wide spectrum of major discordant structural anomalies can be found in monochorionic pregnancies. The outcome for the anomalous twin is poor, while the survival rate for the normal co-twin was 71%, with a favorable overall prognosis.",

    "abstract": "The giant panda, native to mountains of south-west China, is one of the world's rarest bear species and is subject to considerable conservation effort. In captivity, the proportion of twins accounts for 54% of the total number of births. To date, little is known about zygosity in panda populations - specifically, the proportion of monozygotic and dizygotic twins. In this study, we used 10 microsatellite markers for reliable zygosity testing, and the probability of monozygotic twins was 99.963% when all 10 markers were concordant. Out of 43 studied twin pairs, no MZ twins were found, indicating that there may be no identical panda twins (or the incidence is very low). We speculate that the fertilized eggs of giant pandas do not have the capability to split into two identical embryos, or that this ability is very poor, which is likely due to delayed implantation that is common in bear species. The results of this study deepen our understanding of giant panda breeding, yield insight into panda twins' likely mechanism of formation, and reduce the uncertainty of individual identity in wild population surveys.",

    "abstract": "The selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDC) twins causes phenotypic growth discordance, which is correlated with metabolomic pertubations. A global, untargeted identification of the metabolic fingerprint may help elucidate the etiology of sIUGR. Umbilical cord blood and placentas collected from 15 pairs of sIUGR monochorionic twins, 24 pairs of uncomplicated twins, and 14 singletons diagnosed with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolomic analyses. Supervised multivariate regression analysis and pathway analysis were performed to compare control twins with sIUGR twins. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was utilized to explore metabolic differences within sIUGR co-twins. Linear logistic regression was applied to screen metabolites that significantly differed in concentration between control twins and sIUGR twins or IUGR singletons. Umbilical cord blood demonstrated better global metabolomic separation of sIUGR and control twins compared to the placenta. Disrupted amino acid and fatty acid metabolism as well as high levels of exposure to environmental xenobiotics were associated with sIUGR. The metabolic abnormalities in MCDA twins suggested that in utero growth discordance is caused by intrauterine and extrauterine environmental factors, rather than genetics. Thus, this study provides new therapeutic targets and strategies for sIUGR management and prevention.",

    "abstract": "Associations between well-being, resilience to trauma and the volume of grey-matter regions involved in affective processing (e.g., threat/reward circuits) are largely unexplored, as are the roles of shared genetic and environmental factors derived from multivariate twin modelling.\nThis study presents, to our knowledge, the first exploration of well-being and volumes of grey-matter regions involved in affective processing using a region-of-interest, voxel-based approach in 263 healthy adult twins (60% monozygotic pairs, 61% females, mean age 39.69 yr). To examine patterns for resilience (i.e., positive adaptation following adversity), we evaluated associations between the same brain regions and well-being in a trauma-exposed subgroup.\nWe found a correlated effect between increased well-being and reduced grey-matter volume of the pontine nuclei. This association was strongest for individuals with higher resilience to trauma. Multivariate twin modelling suggested that the common variance between the pons volume and well-being scores was due to environmental factors.\nWe used a cross-sectional sample; results need to be replicated longitudinally and in a larger sample.\nAssociations with altered grey matter of the pontine nuclei suggest that basic sensory processes, such as arousal, startle, memory consolidation and/or emotional conditioning, may have a role in well-being and resilience.",

    "abstract": "White matter (WM) microstructure, as determined by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of cognitive function and is also altered in neuropsychiatric disorders. Little is known about genetic and environmental influences on WM microstructure, especially in early childhood, an important period for cognitive development and risk for psychiatric disorders. We studied the heritability of DTI parameters, fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) along 34 tracts, including 10 bilateral fiber pathways and the respective subdivision, using quantitative tractography in a longitudinal sample of healthy children at 1\u2009year (N\u2009=\u2009215) and 2\u2009years (N\u2009=\u2009165) of age. We found that heritabilities for whole brain AD, RD, and FA were 0.48, 0.69, and 0.72 at age 1, and 0.59, 0.77, and 0.76 at age 2 and that mean heritabilities of tract-averaged AD, RD, and FA for individual bundles were moderate (over 0.4). However, the heritability of DTI change between 1 and 2\u2009years of age was not significant for most tracts. We also demonstrated that point-wise heritability tended to be significant in the central portions of the tracts and was generally spatially consistent at ages 1 and 2\u2009years. These results, especially when compared to heritability patterns in neonates, indicate that the heritability of WM microstructure is dynamic in early childhood and likely reflect heterogeneous maturation of WM tracts and differential genetic and environmental influences on maturation patterns.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the cognitive capacities associated with the development of school readiness is indispensable to support children's successful school transition. It has been shown that executive function (EF) in preschoolers is associated with both concurrent preacademic and subsequent academic skills. However, most research has controlled for the effect of general cognitive ability (GCA), and little research has examined non-English speaking children, which hinders the understanding of the development of school readiness in culturally diverse contexts. In addition, behavioral genetic research on the genetic and environmental influences on this association has been conducted with school-age children. Thus, the genetic and environmental influences on associations between GCA, EF, and preacademic skills during preschool age are unknown. We conducted multivariate behavioral genetic analyses on two waves of longitudinal data at 42 and 60 months of age from 171 and 135 pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic Japanese twins. The findings suggested that a genetic factor influenced GCA at 42 months and mediated preacademic ability at 60 months. In addition, another genetic factor emerged by 60 months that genetically mediated EF and math ability, independent of GCA. Preacademic ability at 60 months was affected by shared environments that influenced EF, rather than GCA, at 42 months. Moreover, shared environments that influenced preacademic ability at 42 months affected later GCA at 60 months. Finally, nonshared environments that had emerged by 60 months mediated these relationships, though the magnitude of this effect was modest.

    "abstract": "In June 2018, Mothers and Babies Reducing Risks through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK (MBRRACE-UK) published a Perinatal Surveillance report of an audit between 2013-2016. This noted that the stillbirth rate for twins nearly halved between 2014-2016; whereas the stillbirth rate for singletons remained static. There was a statistically significant reduction in the rate of stillbirth in twins over this period from 11.07 (95%\u00a0CI, 9.78-12.47) to 6.16 (95%\u00a0CI, 5.20-7.24) per 1000 total births. This commentary discusses these observations, the effects of twin chorionicity, and the potential obstetric and neonatal interventions, as well as public health improvements, that may have influenced these findings.",

    "abstract": "Myelomeningocele (MMC) is a common subtype of congenital neural tube defects (NTD). Although congenital malformations including NTD are more common in twins, concordance, especially in dizygotic twins, is extremely rare and is found mostly in same-sex twins. The role of genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of MMC is unclear.\nDizygotic twins of opposite sex were born at term to a 35-year-old woman conceived with in vitro fertilization (IVF) using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Prenatal ultrasonography (US) revealed concordant lumbosacral MMC at 18\u00a0weeks of gestation as well as ventriculomegaly and Arnold-Chiari malformation type II at 28\u00a0weeks. Both twins underwent surgical repair of the MMC within 48\u00a0h after birth and required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in the second week of life.\nThe case presented raises questions concerning the etiology of MMC, since in twins, it is compelling to attribute the etiology to genetic factors. In the literature, 22 pairs of twins with concordant MMC have been reported, and of the 10 dizygotic twins described, four were of opposite sex. However, in monozygotic twins, most of the cases are non-concordant; therefore, the role of genetics remains unclear. In addition, environmental factors such as nutrition, metabolic folic acid deficiency, and assisted conception with IVF and ICSI might play a role as well.\nThe appearance of concordant MMC in opposite-sex dizygotic twins, conceived by IVF using ICSI, intrigues questions concerning the etiology of MMC. In such cases, genetic counseling and evaluation should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Perinatal mortality is higher in twins. Effects of twin order have not previously been studied in the context of single fetal demise. Our objective was to determine whether death of the fetus more proximal to the cervix will result in worse perinatal outcomes. Our population included multiple pregnancies with two viable fetuses confirmed prior to 20 weeks' gestation with the subsequent death of at least one twin. All the pregnancies were managed at The Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne between 2006 and 2014. We excluded pregnancies of higher order multiples, the death of both twins simultaneously, and cases with incomplete outcome data. Maternal and neonatal data were reviewed. Of 46 pregnancies included, in 24 (52%), the dead twin was presenting. Gestational age at delivery was significantly earlier in these cases (mean difference: -5.0 weeks, 95% CI [-7.4, -2.6], p &lt; .001), and emergency cesarean rates were higher 67% versus 32% (OR 4.29, 95% CI [1.25, 14.7], p = .02). There were no differences in the frequency of chorioamnionitis, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, or placental abruption. Survival rates for co-twins were similar in both groups (presenting 83%; not presenting 91%; OR 0.41, 95% CI [0.07, 2.50], p = .29). The increase in neonatal morbidities was related to prematurity rather than to order. Findings were more common in dichorionic twins. Analysis was limited by a small sample size. If the dead twin is presenting, delivery is likely to occur earlier, with associated morbidity for the survivors. This is especially relevant for dichorionic twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and environmental influences on anthropometric measures can be investigated by comparing dizygotic (DZ) versus monozygotic (MZ) twins. Investigating cohorts living in different geographical areas across the globe can identify the variation in heritability versus environment.\n(1) To investigate the association between birth weight and anthropometric measurements during adulthood; (2) to study the genetic and environmental influences on body measures including birth weight, weight and height among twins; and (3) to assess the variation in heritability versus environment among two cohorts of twins who lived in different geographical areas.\nTwins were collected from two twin registers. Data on birth weight, adult weight and height in 430 MZ and 170\u2009DZ twins living in two geographically distinct parts of the world were collected. A genetic analysis was performed using MX software.\nBirth weight was associated with weight, height and BMI. Both MZ and DZ twins with low birth weight had shorter height during their adult life (p\u2009=\u20090.001), but only MZ twins with lower birth weight were lighter at adulthood (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Intra-pair differences in birth weight were not associated with differences in adult height (p\u2009=\u20090.366) or weight (p\u2009=\u20090.796). Additive genetic effects accounted for 53% of the variance in weight, 43% in height and 55% in birth weight. The remaining variance was attributed to unique environmental effects (15% for weight, 13% for height and 45% for birth weight and only 16% for BMI). Variability was found to be different in the two cohorts. The best fitting model for birth weight and BMI was additive genetic and non-shared environment and for weight and height was additive genetic, non-shared environment (plus common Environment).\nData suggests that the association between weight at birth and anthropometric measures in later life is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Living in different environments can potentially relate to variation found in the environment.",

    "abstract": "In general, it is extremely problematic to discriminate between monozygotic twins (MZTs), who share the same genomic DNA sequence, using traditional DNA-based identification methods such as short tandem repeat profiling. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have shown potential in forensic applications owing to their low molecular weight, abundant and tissue-specific expression. In this study, we utilized massively parallel sequencing technology to perform genome-wide profiling of miRNAs in the blood from four pairs of healthy MZTs. On average, 158 miRNAs were detected in each individual and 14% of which were differentially expressed within each pair of MZTs. The miRNAs with the most significant differences in expression between the twins were confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our results demonstrated that miRNAs have potential for use as molecular markers in MZTs discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Estimated energy requirement (EER) has not been defined for twin pregnancy. This study was designed to determine the EER of healthy women with dichorionic-diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancies.\nWe aimed to estimate energy deposition from changes in maternal body protein and fat; to measure resting energy expenditure (REE), physical activity level (PAL), and total energy expenditure (TEE) throughout pregnancy and postpartum; and to define the EER based on the sum of TEE and energy deposition for twin gestation.\nThis is a prospective study of 20 women with DCDA twin gestations. Maternal EER, energy deposition, REE, TEE, and PAL were obtained during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy and immediately postpartum. A mixed-effects linear regression model for repeated measures with random intercept was used to test for the effects of BMI groups and time.\nGains in total body protein (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 kg) and fat mass (5.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8 kg) resulted in total energy deposition of 67,042\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025,586 kcal between 0 and 30-32 weeks of gestation. REE increased 26% from 1392\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0162 to 1752\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0172 kcal/d across the 3 trimesters, whereas TEE increased 17% from 2141\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0283 to 2515\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0337 kcal/d. Physical activity decreased steadily throughout pregnancy. Reductions in physical activity did not compensate for the rise in REE and energy deposition, thus requiring an increase in dietary energy intake as pregnancy progressed. EER increased 29% from 2257\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0325 kcal/d in the first trimester to 2941\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0407 kcal/d in the second trimester, and stayed consistent at 2906\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0350 kcal/d in the third trimester.\nIncreased energy intake, on average \u223c700 kcal/d in the second and third trimesters when compared with the first trimester, is required to support gestational weight gain and the rise in energy expenditure of DCDA twin pregnancies.",

The heritability estimate of immediate recall (IR) was 0.37, 95% \u2009CI (0.21 to 0.43).\nThe results demonstrate that familial risk for dementia is reflected in the IR performance of cognitively healthy older persons. The finding of poorer IR performance in non-affected siblings compared with the general population, together with substantial heritability of IR, supports IR as a useful endophenotype for molecular genetic studies of dementia.",

    "abstract": "In complicated mono-chorionic twin pregnancies, vaso-occlusive techniques like bipolar cord coagulation (BPCC), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), interstitial laser ablation (ILA) of cord and fetoscopy guided cord coagulation with lasers are the methods proposed for selective fetal reduction. This study brings forth preliminary data of selective fetal reduction procedures at a tertiary care center in India.\nThis was a prospective observational study of 31 patients with complicated mono-chorionic twin pregnancies. Methods used were ILA, RFA and BPCC. Outcome measures included overall co-twin survival after selective feticide, survival rates with each method, miscarriage (defined as all fetal loss before 24 weeks), early fetal death (<24 hours after procedure) and late fetal death (>24 hours after the procedure) of co-twin.\nTechnical success was achieved in 30/31 (96.8%) of pregnancies. Over all take home baby rate was 63.3%. Live birth rates were 50%, 71.4% and 75% with ILA, RFA and BPCC respectively.\nData from initial cases of selective fetal reduction in complicated mono-chorionic twins suggests that these procedures are feasible but are associated with high adverse perinatal outcome.",

    "abstract": "Genetically identical twins can differ in their self-reported sexual orientations. However, whether the twins' subjective reports reflect valid differences in their sexual orientations is unknown. Measures of sexual orientation, which are free of the limitations of self-report, include genital arousal and pupil dilation while viewing sexual stimuli depicting men or women. We examined these responses in 6 male twin pairs and 9 female twin pairs who reported discordant sexual orientations. Across measures, heterosexual male twins responded more strongly to women than to men. Their homosexual co-twins showed an opposite pattern. Heterosexual female twins responded equally to both sexes, whereas their homosexual co-twins responded somewhat more to women than men. These differences within pairs were similar to differences between unrelated heterosexual and homosexual males and females. Our study provides physiological evidence confirming twins' discordant sexual orientations, thereby supporting the importance of the non-shared environment for the development of sexual orientation and sexual arousal.",

    "abstract": "The study of twins is a well-known and a unique method that is used to investigate the genetic contributions to physical features and diseases in human.\nTo estimate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental influence to observed variations in different dental features or traits.\nThirty twins in the age group of 15-30 years were selected for the study, and the dental caries experience scores, dental anomalies, and morphometric analysis of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins were compared.\nMZ twins unlike DZ twins showed within-pair resemblance in decayed, decayed missing and filled teeth (DMFT), and molar relation. No morphometric analysis parameters and dental anomalies had significant mean difference between the groups. Decay, filling, DMFT, spacing, mandibular irregularity, open bite, and mesiodistal width of the right and left canine showed a higher positive correlation in MZ than DZ twins. Heritability estimate was low for morphometric analysis parameters. There is genetic dominance in decay, DMFT, spacing, molar relation, and diastema. Pearson's correlation revealed a positive and statistically significant correlation among all morphometric analysis parameters for MZ twins, but not DZ twins. Dental caries has a higher concordance rate (87.5%), correlation (71.6%), and heritability (87.8%).\nMost of the dental parameters are significantly heritable with up to 85% of the variance attributable to genetic factors. Environmental factors play a major role in developing malocclusion and causing dental caries. Morphology of canines can be used as a supplementary tool to determine zygosity.",

Pearson's correlation revealed a positive and statistically significant correlation among all morphometric analysis parameters for MZ twins, but not DZ twins. Dental caries has a higher concordance rate (87.5%), correlation (71.6%), and heritability (87.8%).",

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to compare the prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) 3 and 12\u00a0months after vaginal vs cesarean delivery of twins after 34\u00a0weeks of gestation.\nThis was a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted at 172 French maternity units and included 2812 primiparous women with twins with no prior history of UI. Participants were enrolled at the time of delivery and followed up to 12\u00a0months postpartum. The primary outcome was the prevalence of UI, both stress and urge, 3\u00a0months postpartum, based on the patient reporting any frequency of urine leakage to the first question of the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF). The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory - Short Form 20 (PFDI-20), Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire - Short Form 7 (PFIQ-7), Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12), and Medical Outcome Study Short Form-12 (SF-12) were also used.\nThe ICIQ-SF was completed by 1155 (39.8%) and 800 (27.5%) women, respectively, at 3 and 12\u00a0months postpartum; 556 (48%) had delivered vaginally and 599 (52%) by cesarean section. The prevalence of UI at 3\u00a0months was 26% overall and was significantly higher in the vaginal delivery group at both 3\u00a0months (35% vs 17% in the cesarean group, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and 12\u00a0months postpartum (38% vs 24%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). UI was predominantly stress or mixed. The risk factors for UI at 3\u00a0months, determined by multivariate modeling, were vaginal delivery [odds ratio (OR) 3.073, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-4.105, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and body mass index >25 in early pregnancy (OR 1.620, 95% CI 1.188-2.209, p\u2009=\u20090.0023).\nVaginal delivery is a risk factor for UI at 3\u00a0months after twin birth.",

The primary end point was the postnatal urinary incontinence rate 3\u00a0months postpartum. The secondary end points were the pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) at 3 and 12\u00a0months based on PFDI-20, PFIQ-7, PISQ-12, and SF-12 responses.\nA total of 2812 patients in 172 French maternity units were recruited between February 2014 and March 2015: 1076 (38%) responded at 3 and 12\u00a0months (61% at 3\u00a0months); 1155 were analyzed at 3\u00a0months (556 VD and 599 CS) and 800 at 12\u00a0months (394 VD and 406 CS).

    "abstract": "The present study investigates the procedure-related fetal loss rate and obstetrical outcomes of selective feticide in dichorionic twins.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the data of 44 cases of dichorionic twins. Two different indications for selective feticide were set: (i) the presence of genetic or congenital anomaly; and (ii) an obstetrical indication specified as a past maternal history of preterm delivery that caused fetal death or cerebral palsy of the child. Primarily, data on procedure-related fetal loss and obstetrical outcomes were retrieved. Additionally, data on obstetrical outcomes by reduction time and by indication of SF were obtained.\nSelective feticide was performed in 44 cases - specifically, in 23 cases with genetic or congenital anomaly and in 21 cases with obstetrical indications. The median gestational age at delivery was 38\u2009+\u20094 weeks. One pregnancy loss (2.3%, 1/44) occurred within 4 weeks after the procedure. The overall pregnancy loss rate throughout the pregnancy term was 2.3% (1/44). When selective feticide was performed at 15\u2009weeks and beyond, the birth weight was significantly decreased compared with when selective feticide was performed earlier than 15\u2009weeks.\nTransabdominal ultrasound-guided selective feticide in dichorionic twins is an effective and safe procedure. If a patient desires to maximize her chances of having a healthy child and decrease the risk of prematurity, the option of selective feticide should be considered in certain cases of twin pregnancies. Selective feticide may be a reasonable alternative to expectant management or termination of the whole twin pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is endemic in many countries worldwide, with a prevalence of 12 million people infected, and an estimated annual incidence of 500 000 visceral leishmaniasis cases. In Europe visceral leishmaniasis is considered endemic mainly in the Mediterranean countries and cases in non-endemic European countries north of the Alps have primarily been reported in returning travellers. The incubation period is typically described between 6\u00a0weeks to 6\u00a0months. The cases presented highlight the occurrence of longer incubation periods and illustrate the individual variability for progression from infection to disease.\nWe report the cases of 18-months-old twin girls living at the German-Swiss border, who developed visceral leishmaniasis 7 and 15\u00a0months after travelling to Tuscany. They presented with fever of unknown origin and pancytopenia. Both had splenomegaly and in the first case haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or leukaemia was initially included in the differential diagnosis. Diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis was confirmed by presence of intracytoplasmic localised leishmania parasites on bone marrow aspirate and/or positive leishmania serology. Both girls responded well to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B. The mother and two older siblings remained uninfected, while the father was diagnosed to be an asymptomatic carrier.\nVisceral leishmaniasis is an important differential diagnosis for fever of unknown origin and pancytopenia in young children living in countries with endemic disease and highlights the importance of obtaining a detailed travel history. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and acute leukaemia present with similar symptoms and consequently are important differential diagnoses. Factors determining progression from infection to disease are not fully understood but younger age seems to be an important risk factor. Screening of siblings from affected individuals therefore may be warranted.",

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and acute leukaemia present with similar symptoms and consequently are important differential diagnoses. Factors determining progression from infection to disease are not fully understood but younger age seems to be an important risk factor. Screening of siblings from affected individuals therefore may be warranted.",

    "abstract": "One of a pair of monozygous twins was diagnosed and died of small cell carcinoma of the ovary of hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) at the age of 30\u00a0years. Her sister remained unaffected and was very concerned about her risk for developing SCCOHT. By performing comprehensive molecular analysis using whole exome sequencing (WES) approach, we showed that the deceased twin's tumour has bi-allelic somatic genetic defects (a pathogenic frameshift deletion in SMARCA4 and LOH on chr19p). Results of WES of constitutional DNA from her unaffected sister were confirmatory. Based on our findings, we concluded that the living twin is not at risk for SCCOHT and does not need to consider preventive oophorectomy.",

    "abstract": "Inherited factors and maternal behaviors are thought to play an important role in the etiology of several congenital malformations. Twin studies can offer additional evidence regarding the contribution of genetic and lifestyle factors to common birth anomalies, but few large-scale studies have been reported.\nWe included data from twins (20,803 pairs) from the population-based California Twin Program. We compared concordance in monozygotic (MZ) to dizygotic (DZ) twins for the following birth anomalies: clubfoot, oral cleft, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, deafness, cerebral palsy, strabismus, and congenital heart defects. Each birth anomaly was also examined for the associations with birth characteristics (birthweight and birth order) and parental exposures (age, smoking, and parental education).\nThe overall prevalence of any selected birth anomaly in California twins was 38 per 1,000 persons, with a slightly decreasing trend from 1957-1982. For pairwise concordance in 6,752 MZ and 7,326 like-sex DZ twin pairs, high MZ:DZ concordance ratios were observed for clubfoot (CR 5.91; P = 0.043) and strabismus (CR 2.52; P = 0.001). Among the total 20,803 pairs, parental smoking was significantly associated with risk of spina bifida (OR 3.48; 95% CI, 1.48-8.18) and strabismus (OR 1.61; 95% CI, 1.28-2.03). A significant quadratic trend of increasing risk for clubfoot, spina bifida, and strabismus was found when examining whether father smoked, mother smoked, or both parents smoked relative to non-smoking parents (P = 0.029, 0.026, and 0.0005, respectively).\nOur results provide evidence for a multifactorial etiology underlying selected birth anomalies. Further research is needed to understand the biological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "This secondary analysis aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors associated with monozygotic twins (MZTs) after assisted reproductive technology (ART).\nIn this retrospective cohort observational study, the treatment cycles were compared between MZT and non-MZT pregnancies using logistic regression analyses. Of the 11,501 patients with 13,225 pregnancies, 166 MZTs were diagnosed (1.44% in ART pregnant patients; 1.25% in pregnant cycles).\nResults of the logistic analysis revealed that embryo stage at transfer and number of good-quality embryos were independent predictive factors for MZTs. The thresholds for two factors were 3.5 and 3.5. The efficacy of embryo stage at transfer and number of good-quality embryos for MZTs were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic curves. The areas under the curve (AUCs) for these two parameters were 0.708 and 0.633, respectively. Adding number of good quality embryos increased the discriminative ability of the model (AUC\u2009=\u20090.745).\nThe incidence of MZTs, subsequent to ART, is quite high. Extended culture (\u22653.5 days), together with the number of good-quality embryos (\u22653.5), conferred the greatest risk of producing MZTs.",

The areas under the curve (AUCs) for these two parameters were 0.708 and 0.633, respectively. Adding number of good quality embryos increased the discriminative ability of the model (AUC\u2009=\u20090.745).",

    "abstract": "More education is associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) and likelihood of being obese. Obesity and BMI also have a strong genetic basis. Given these observations, we investigate whether more education can reduce obesity by attenuating the underlying genetic risk of being obese, through gene-environment (GxE) interactions. We estimate associations between (i) education, (ii) a genetic risk score (GRS) and (iii) GxE interactions between education and the GRS through Ordinary least Squares (OLS) and twins fixed-effect regressions using data on female twins from the TwinsUK database. OLS estimates show that there are significant associations of education and genetics. Female twins with a university education are 14.3 percentage points less likely to be obese compared to twins with less than compulsory education, and a 1 standard deviation increase in the GRS increases the likelihood of being obese by 5.2 percentage points. The GxE interactions are statistically insignificant, suggesting that the marginal association of the GRS with obesity does not differ by educational attainment. When controlling for confounding through twins fixed-effects, we find a smaller role of genetics. The association of the GRS with obesity decreases to 0.040. Associations of educational attainment are substantially reduced and insignificant. GxE interactions also remain insignificant. Overall, we find little evidence of any GxE interactions.",

    "abstract": "A bezoar is a collection of packed indigestible matter that accumulates in the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion by the patient. It may be made of hair (trichobezoar), vegetable or fruit (phytobezoar), or other indigestible materials. Trichobezoars are thought to form due to hair's natural enduring nature, as they get matted and stick together in the gut. We present the case of a young female who was 16-weeks pregnant with twins presenting to the general surgery clinic with abdominal pain, vomiting and a palpable abdominal mass, which eventually turned out to be a massive trichobezoar manifesting as Rapunzel syndrome. Rapunzel syndrome is a large trichobezoar extending from the stomach into the small intestine. This is perhaps the first reported case of Rapunzel syndrome in a patient pregnant with twins.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation arrays are widely used in epigenome-wide association studies and methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) studies. Here, we performed the first genome-wide analysis of monozygotic (MZ) twin correlations and mQTLs on data obtained with the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC array) and compared the performance of the EPIC array to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450 array) for buccal-derived DNA.\nGood-quality EPIC data were obtained for 102 buccal-derived DNA samples from 49 MZ twin pairs (mean age\u2009=\u20097.5\u00a0years, range\u2009=\u20091-10). Differences between MZ twins in the cellular content of buccal swabs were a major driver for differences in their DNA methylation profiles, highlighting the importance to adjust for cellular composition in DNA methylation studies of buccal-derived DNA. After adjusting for cellular composition, the genome-wide mean correlation (r) between MZ twins was 0.21 for the EPIC array, and cis mQTL analysis in 84 twins identified 1,296,323 significant associations (FDR 5%), encompassing 33,749 methylation sites and 616,029 genetic variants. MZ twin correlations were slightly larger (p\u2009<\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nWe conclude that the contribution of familial factors to individual differences in DNA methylation and the effect of mQTLs are larger for novel EPIC probes, especially those within regulatory elements connected to active regions specific to the investigated tissue.",

After adjusting for cellular composition, the genome-wide mean correlation (r) between MZ twins was 0.21 for the EPIC array, and cis mQTL analysis in 84 twins identified 1,296,323 significant associations (FDR 5%), encompassing 33,749 methylation sites and 616,029 genetic variants.

    "abstract": "Alcohol involvement has familial associations with bulimic symptoms (i.e., binge eating, inappropriate compensatory behaviors), with several studies indicating a genetic overlap between the two. It is unclear whether overlapping familial risk with alcohol involvement extends to other eating disorder symptoms. Understanding the genetic overlap between alcohol involvement and other eating disorder symptoms may aid in more targeted interventions for comorbid alcohol use-eating disorder symptoms. Thus, we investigated associations between alcohol involvement and 2 core eating disorder symptoms: drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction in adolescent female and male twins.\nWe assessed 3 levels of alcohol involvement: alcohol use in the last month, having ever been intoxicated, and alcohol intoxication frequency via self-report. The Eating Disorder Inventory-II assessed drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction. Sex-specific biometrical twin modeling examined the genetic overlap between alcohol involvement and eating disorder symptoms.\nPhenotypic associations between alcohol involvement, drive for thinness, and body dissatisfaction were significantly greater in girls compared with boys. A majority of the associations between alcohol involvement, drive for thinness, and body dissatisfaction in girls, but not boys, met our threshold for twin modeling (phenotypic r\u00a0>\u00a00.20). Moderate genetic correlations were observed between the 3 aspects of alcohol involvement and drive for thinness. Moderate genetic correlations were observed between alcohol use and intoxication frequency and body dissatisfaction.\nTogether with the literature on alcohol involvement and bulimic symptoms, these findings suggest a generalized association between alcohol involvement and eating disorder symptoms in girls, whereas this association may be symptom specific in boys. Genetic correlations indicate that the amount and direction of this genetic overlap differs across specific symptoms. When intervening on comorbid alcohol involvement and eating disorder symptoms, it may be important to target-specific eating disorder symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited disease caused by mutations in genes that are primarily involved in DNA damage response or repair. The disease is often characterized by congenital malformations, progressive bone marrow failure, abnormal skin pigmentation patterns and susceptibility to cancer. The present study describes a pair of 4-year-old male twins, both of whom had been suffering from upper respiratory tract infections for >2 years. There was no indication of discomfort including fever, coughing, bleeding or fatigue from either child when the upper respiratory tract infection disappeared. Physical examination of the twins did not reveal anything significant, and no external anomalies were observed. In order to obtain additional diagnostic evidence, next-generation gene sequencing, chromosome breakage analysis and comet assays were performed. The results revealed double heterozygous mutations in the Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 gene of the twins, therefore providing a conclusive diagnosis of FA. The case highlights how difficulties in clinical diagnosis may be overcome by including genetic screening tests into the range of diagnostic tests, which may also reveal unexpected results.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twinning is a rare congenital malformation, and the resultant huge body wall defects after separation of conjoined twins represent a real challenge to surgeons.\nFrom 2004 to 2009, authors performed body wall reconstruction for 2 pairs of thoraco-omphalopagus twins and 1 pair of ischiopagus tetrapus twins. Before separation, the techniques of tissue expansion and tractive training were adopted to acquire sufficient skin for final coverage. After separation, the defects of thoracic cage and abdominal myofascial system were repaired with synthetic materials. The closure of the wounds was performed with artificial skin temporarily or by the use of local flaps in 1 stage.\nThe first pair of thoraco-omphalopagus twins died of circulatory and respiratory failure after emergency surgery, and the other 2 pairs of conjoined twins survived. The second pair of thoraco-omphalopagus twins had wound dehiscence and partial flap necrosis after surgery. The expanded polytetrafluoroethylene mesh in 1 sister of the ischiopagus twins was removed because of local infection 4 years after surgery.\nCompressive anatomical understandings and advanced skills in plastic surgery are required for body wall reconstruction in the separation of conjoined twins. In addition, the multidisciplinary team approach has an important role for obtaining satisfactory final surgical outcome.",

I examine the effects of birth weight on child health and growth using information from 66 countries. I account for missing data and measurement error using instrumental variables and adopt an identification strategy based on siblings and twins. I find a consistent effect of birth weight on mortality risk, stunting, wasting, and coughing, with some evidence for fever, diarrhoea, and anaemia. Bounds analysis indicates that coefficients may be substantially underestimated due to mortality selection. Improving the pre-natal environment is likely to be important for helping children reach their full potential.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy loss during the late embryonic and early fetal periods influences dairy herd economy. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the effects of a single or double GnRH dose administered at the time of pregnancy diagnosis (28-34 days post-AI) on the pregnancy survival of cows in their third lactation or further carrying live singletons or unilateral twins, and (2) examine the impacts of GnRH treatment on subsequent twin reduction in twin pregnancies. Cows carrying singletons (n = 1,054) or unilateral twins (n = 379) were assigned at the time of pregnancy diagnosis to the following groups: control (no treatment), GnRH (100 \u03bcg GnRH), and 2GnRH (200 \u03bcg GnRH). Pregnancy loss was recorded in 180 of the 1,433 cows (12.6%) at 58-64 days post-AI. Based on the odds ratios, there was a significant (P < 0.0001) interaction between the treatment group and twin pregnancy. This interaction implies that control cows carrying twins were 3.2 times more likely to suffer pregnancy loss than the other cows, whereas the GnRH and 2GnRH treatment groups cows carrying singletons or twins had pregnancy loss rates similar to the control cows carrying singletons. Twin reduction was observed in 35 twin pregnancies (9.2%). Cows in the GnRH and 2 GnRH groups were seven times more likely to show twin reduction than control cows. Our results indicate that GnRH administered at the time of pregnancy diagnosis had no beneficial effects in cows carrying singletons. In contrast, for twin pregnancies, the treatment increased the rate of pregnancy survival and was accompanied by an increase in the twin reduction rate.",

    "abstract": "AML with the RAM immunophenotype is associated with extremely poor prognosis. We report a rare case of monozygotic twins presenting simultaneously at the age of 2\u00a0years with RAM AML. Each twin underwent a myeloablative 7/10 unrelated umbilical cord blood transplant. Pretransplant Twin A's bone marrow was negative for MRD by flow cytometry (<0.01%) unlike Twin B's bone marrow (0.07%). Twin A is alive in remission 3\u00a0years from transplant. Twin B developed primary graft failure, but subsequently rescued with a haploidentical stem cell transplant. However, she relapsed and died 13\u00a0months from diagnosis. The twins' clinical courses demonstrate that upfront intensive chemotherapy to achieve negative MRD, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant as postremission intensification strategy, should be considered in this high-risk AML.",

    "abstract": "Indomethacin is a commonly used medication against preterm delivery. Several reports of fetal ductal constriction have been described after indomethacin use in the literature; however, there are no previously documented reports describing an association between Twin-Twin Transfusion syndrome and a constrictor effect of indomethacin on the ductus arteriosus. Two patients were referred to our department for Twin-Twin Transfusion syndrome and each underwent placental laser surgery. Constriction of the ductus arteriosus occurred as early as 20 and 24 weeks' gestation following maternal use of indomethacin after laser surgery. Spontaneous amelioration was observed after discontinuation of the drug. The constrictor effect of indomethacin on the ductus arteriosus can be observed even after a single dose and as early as 20 weeks of gestation in complicated monochorionic twin pregnancies. We emphasize meticulous use of indomethacin in complicated monochorionic twin pregnancies because the constrictive effect seems to be independent of gestational age.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins represent an interesting nutritional challenge as nutrient delivery and absorption is greatly affected by anatomy and, therefore, unique to each twin pair. Nutritional support is essential to optimize growth and development in the neonatal period; however, very little data exists on the topic in this population. Conjoined twins require individualized nutritional assessment that focuses on the interaction between the metabolic rate, nutrient uptake, and nutrient delivery of each twin in the dyad. This report describes one center's experience with monitoring growth, establishing nutrient requirements, and determining substrate utilization in three sets of conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, constant load bending tests were performed on a nanocrystalline Ni nanowire specimen at different deformation temperatures using molecular dynamics simulation to investigate deformation behavior and mechanisms responsible for fracture. The nature of the fracture occurred in this nanowire specimen is found to transit from brittle to ductile as the temperature rises from 500 to 800\u00a0K. Also, with an increase in temperature, the fracture strain is increased indicating more plastic deformation prior to fracture. In the case of 500\u00a0K and 600\u00a0K deformation temperatures, fracture occurred along the shear band due to slip-twin interaction. On the other hand, at comparatively higher deformation temperatures, such as 700\u00a0K and 800\u00a0K, twinning and detwinning mechanisms are responsible for accommodating large plastic strain before fracture thus imparting plasticity in the specimen. It has also been found that formation and collapse of the stacking fault tetrahedron causes fracture of nanocrystalline Ni nanowire at 800\u00a0K.",

    "abstract": "Increasing numbers of twin pregnancies necessitate investigation of the risk factors associated with obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS). The aims of this study were to establish the incidence of OASIS, and compare women delivering twins to those delivering singletons in risk of OASIS plus maternal, neonatal, and obstetric outcomes.\nA retrospective cohort study was undertaken and included women delivering in a tertiary London maternity unit between 1999 and 2015; 51\u2009957 eligible women with singleton and 261 with twin pregnancies were identified. Women delivering twins were compared to those delivering singletons in the occurrence of maternal, neonatal, and obstetric outcomes using unadjusted relative risks. A secondary analysis was performed, and conditional logistic regression used to derive an adjusted relative risk of OASIS. Women delivering singletons were matched to those delivering twins for age, parity, ethnicity, gestation, and mode of delivery in a ratio of 2:1.\nCompared to the singleton group, mothers delivering twins had significantly more instrumental deliveries (RR [95%CI] 1.92 [1.67-2.27]; P\u2009<\u20090.0001), smaller fetuses (2754.1 vs 3383.8\u2009g; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and were older (32.9 vs 31.0 years; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). The twin group was not significantly different to the singleton group in risk of OASIS (RR 0.61 [0.27-1.33], P\u2009=\u20090.205). The conditional logistic regression demonstrated similar results for the risk of OASIS (adjusted RR\u2009=\u20090.58 [0.22-1.47]; P\u2009=\u20090.253).\nWomen delivering twins vaginally were not at a significantly higher risk of sustaining OASIS compared to those delivering singletons.",

Here we discuss the strategies found to be useful in planning for and responding to distinctive circumstances encountered throughout hospitalization, as well as lessons learned. Areas of focus include ensuring privacy, designing adequate unit accommodations to meet space and equipment needs, staffing considerations and adaptations to typical neonatal intensive care nursing interventions. The utility of a team-based approach to interdisciplinary care coordination is also discussed. With adequate preparation and thoughtful innovation, most tertiary neonatal intensive care units can readily adapt to the unique needs of conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a common autoimmune disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Epigenome-wide association studies can identify environmentally mediated epigenetic changes such as altered DNA methylation, which may also be influenced by genetic factors. To investigate possible contributions of DNA methylation to the aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis with minimum confounding genetic heterogeneity, we investigated genome-wide DNA methylation in disease-discordant monozygotic twin pairs.\nGenome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in 79 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for rheumatoid arthritis using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (Illumina). Discordant twins were tested for both differential DNA methylation and methylation variability between rheumatoid arthritis and healthy twins. The methylation variability signature was then compared with methylation variants from studies of other autoimmune diseases and with an independent healthy population.\nWe have identified a differentially variable DNA methylation signature that suggests multiple stress response pathways may be involved in the aetiology of the disease. This methylation variability signature also highlighted potential epigenetic disruption of multiple RUNX3 transcription factor binding sites as being associated with disease development. Comparison with previously performed epigenome-wide association studies of rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes identified shared pathways for autoimmune disorders, suggesting that epigenetics plays a role in autoimmunity and offering the possibility of identifying new targets for intervention.\nThrough genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in disease-discordant monozygotic twins, we have identified a differentially variable DNA methylation signature, in the absence of differential methylation in rheumatoid arthritis. This finding supports the importance of epigenetic variability as an emerging component in autoimmune disorders.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study is to explore genetic factors determining difference of cleft side using whole-genome sequencing and evaluation of craniofacial morphology using cephalometric analysis between Japanese monozygotic (MZ) twins with mirror-image cleft lip and palate (CLP).\nWe selected a Japanese MZ twin pair (MZ-A and MZ-B) affected with unilateral CLP who are discordant for cleft side (left/right) and conducted whole-genome sequencing to identify genetic factors determining cleft side. Moreover, we compared their craniofacial morphologies using cephalograms.\nWhole-genome sequencing results suggested that no discordant DNA variants were found between MZ-A and MZ-B. The comparison of craniofacial morphology between the MZ twins revealed that MZ-B had maxillary deficiency and slightly more mandibular protrusion than MZ-A.\nIt is indicated that environmental factors might be a critical factor that influences the determination of difference of cleft side in orofacial clefts. In addition, we found some differences in craniofacial morphology between MZ-A and MZ-B. Our findings suggest that various environmental factors, such as epigenetics, might be a critical factor that influences the determination of difference of cleft side in CLP rather than inherited genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome typically occurs in the second trimester in 10-15% of monochorionic twin pregnancies. Vascular anastomoses of monochorionic placentae are the underlying cause of the development of the syndrome. If a blood flow imbalance occurs, one fetus becomes the so-called donor twin and the other the recipient. If untreated, perinatal mortality is 80-90%. Fetoscopic laser coagulation of the vascular anastomoses destroys the cause of the syndrome and leads to dual twin survival rates of around 70% and more than 90% of pregnancies with at least one survivor. However, unequal placental sharing, intrauterine death, and severe prematurity are still limiting factors for further improvement of survival rates and decreases in long-term morbidity. Prematurity and neurodevelopmental impairment affect the donor and recipient twins, whereas cardiovascular failure and obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract are typical complications of recipients, which can lead to long-term morbidity. In this Review, we summarise the literature on follow-up data for survivors of twin-to-twin-transfusion syndrome after laser therapy, including neurodevelopmental outcomes, cardiovascular outcomes, growth, renal function, and ischaemic events, as well as the potential effects of intrauterine programming on later life.",

    "abstract": "The number of multiple pregnancies has been significantly increased in the last decades due to assisted reproduction techniques development. Compared to singleton, twins and multiple pregnancies are associated to more complications and risks for both mother and children. The objective of this study was to examine the proportion of patients preferring a multiple birth over a singleton after an IVF/ICSI attempt, their reasons and the influence of socio-demographic and clinical parameters on their preference.\nA prospective study was conducted in two different Spanish centers in 2014; a public university hospital and a private clinic, with different populations and embryo transfer policies. In order to evaluate patients and partners attitudes towards twins and singletons, an anonymous 10-question survey was conducted and 399 were invited to participate.\n58.2% of participants preferred having twins to having one child at a time and 4.8% preferred triplets. Primary reasons for preferring twins were \"avoiding a new IVF/ICSI attempt\" (61.6%), \"I like the idea of having twins\" (27.3%), \"avoiding the waiting list\" (5.8%), and \"in my opinion with the latest technology, the rate and severity of complications in multiple pregnancies are low\" (5.2%). The multivariate analysis showed that the only significant parameter related to a preference for multiplets was the transfer of women's own fresh embryos (OR=3.31).\nTwin pregnancy risks are not perceived as important by the majority of IVF/ICSI couples, and many of them specifically prefer twins. In our opinion, much more information is needed highlighting the multiple pregnancy risks and that information should come from medical sources besides general media.",

    "abstract": "Advances in critical care and technology capabilities may lead to new ethical encounters in paediatrics, especially in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). As each patient has unique psychosocial and clinical condition interactions, paediatricians and healthcare providers must develop and adopt a suitable approach for ethical decision-making in the PICU. The healthcare provider needs to balance the four ethical domains of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice, and apply these principles to clinical decision-making. One chief factor for ethical decision-making is to have a patient-centered and family-oriented management that is respectful of cultural background. Healthcare providers also need to observe professional ethical conduct and the applicable national laws. Applying these ethical guidelines in paediatric care ensures a more holistic approach to care, whether in the paediatric wards or the highly technical environment of the PICU. We describe two situations in which the parents of twins with a confirmed lethal disease changed their attitude towards end-of-life from full support to \"do not resuscitate\" and palliative care, after experiencing the palliative care of the first twin, rather than the futile effect of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the other twin.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare occurrence that offer unique challenges and circumstances to therapists. The overall goal of physical and occupational therapy treatment is to provide care that promotes developmental progression to two conjoined individuals with distinct personalities and potentially different physical and medical needs. The unique presentation of conjoined twins must be considered in determining therapeutic goals, interventions and plans of care. Providing therapeutic interventions throughout the NICU stay is a dynamic, evolving process, which challenges the therapy team to work together to find solutions. This paper aims to highlight the considerations, challenges, and strategies used to address barriers in the therapeutic care of conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "The Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM) provides Disinhibition, Boldness, and Meanness scales for assessing the three trait domains of the triarchic model. Here we examined the genetic and environmental etiology of these three domains, including evaluation of potential sex differences.\nA total of 1016 men and women ages 19-20 years were drawn from the University of Southern California Risk Factors for Antisocial Behavior twin study.\nScores for the three TriPM scales were correlated to differing degrees, with the strongest phenotypic correlation between Disinhibition and Meanness. No sex differences were found in the genetic and environmental influences underlying these three domains, suggesting that the same genes and life experiences contribute to these traits in young men and women. For TriPM Disinhibition and Boldness, genetic factors explained about half or less of the variance, with the rest of the variance being explained by non-shared environmental factors. For TriPM Meanness, on the other hand, genetic, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental factors accounted for the variance. The phenotypic correlation between Disinhibition and Meanness was explained in part by common genes (26%), with the remainder attributable about equally to common shared (39%), and non-shared environmental influences (35%).\nThese findings contribute to our understanding of psychopathic personality traits by demonstrating the importance of heritable factors for disinhibition and boldness facets of psychopathy, and the importance of shared environmental influences for the meanness facet.",

    "abstract": "Moyamoya disease (MMD) is characterized by progressive stenosis of intracranial arteries in the circle of Willis with unknown etiology even after the identification of a Moyamoya susceptible gene, RNF213. Recently, differences in epigenetic regulations have been investigated by a case-control study in MMD. Here, we employed a disease discordant monozygotic twin-based study design to unmask potential confounders.\nCirculating genome-wide microRNA (miRNome) profiling was performed in MMD-discordant monozygotic twins, non-twin-MMD patients, and non-MMD healthy volunteers by microarray followed by qPCRvalidation, using blood samples. Differential plasma-microRNAs were further quantified in endothelial cells differentiated from iPS cell lines (iPSECs) derived from another independent non-twin cohort. Lastly, their target gene expression in the iPSECs was analyzed.\nMicroarray detected 309 plasma-microRNAs in MMD-discordant monozygotic twins that were also detected in the non-twin cohort. Principal component analysis of the plasma-microRNA expression level demonstrated distinct 2 groups separated by MMD and healthy control in the twin- and non-twin cohorts. Of these, differential upregulations of hsa-miR-6722-3p/-\u2009328-3p were validated in the plasma of MMD (absolute log2 expression fold change (logFC)\u2009>\u20090.26 for the twin cohort; absolute logFC >\u20090.26, p\u2009<\u20090.05, and q\u2009<\u20090.15 for the non-twin cohort). In MMD derived iPSECs, hsa-miR-6722-3p/-\u2009328-3p showed a trend of up-regulation with a 3.0- or higher expression fold change. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 41 target genes of miR-6722-3p/-\u2009328-3p were significantly down-regulated in MMD derived iPSECs and were involved in STAT3, IGF-1-, and PTEN-signaling, suggesting a potential microRNA-gene expression interaction between circulating plasma and endothelial cells.\nOur MMD-discordant monozygotic twin-based study confirmed a novel circulating microRNA signature in MMD as a potential diagnostic biomarker minimally confounded by genetic heterogeneity. The novel circulating microRNA signature can contribute for the future functional microRNA analysis to find new diagnostic and therapeutic target of MMD.",

Of these, differential upregulations of hsa-miR-6722-3p/-\u2009328-3p were validated in the plasma of MMD (absolute log2 expression fold change (logFC)\u2009>\u20090.26 for the twin cohort; absolute logFC >\u20090.26, p\u2009<\u20090.05, and q\u2009<\u20090.15 for the non-twin cohort). In MMD derived iPSECs, hsa-miR-6722-3p/-\u2009328-3p showed a trend of up-regulation with a 3.0- or higher expression fold change. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 41 target genes of miR-6722-3p/-\u2009328-3p were significantly down-regulated in MMD derived iPSECs and were involved in STAT3, IGF-1-, and PTEN-signaling, suggesting a potential microRNA-gene expression interaction between circulating plasma and endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "The management of conjoined twins is complex and requires careful preparation. Pre-birth management includes prenatal counseling, which is important due to the overall poor prognosis. In instances of trial of life, the delivery must be tailored to address the anticipated anatomy based on prenatal imaging and anticipated physiology. A multidisciplinary team is essential to anticipate and address the ergonomic challenges and medical issues related to organ fusion, cross-circulation and associated anomalies. There are several suggested modifications to the current Neonatal Resuscitation Program algorithm including modifications to initial assessment, airway management, administration of chest compressions, obtaining emergency access, and medication dosing. Simulation is essential to address challenges, practice Neonatal Resuscitation Program modifications, delineate clear roles during delivery and practice communication. This paper offers a discussion of unique issues associated with delivery of conjoined twins and recommendations on how to approach these challenges based on our experience and available literature.",

    "abstract": "We sought to assess the incidence of severe neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in monochorionic twins treated for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and compare it to the incidence in uncomplicated monochorionic twins.\nWe included TTTS pregnancies treated by fetoscopic selective laser coagulation (FSLC) or umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) in 2004-2015. Primary outcome was severe NDI defined as cerebral palsy, bilateral blindness or bilateral deafness (ICD-10 diagnoses), and severe cognitive and/or motor delay (assessed by the Ages and Stages Questionnaires [ASQ]).\nA total of 124 children after TTTS and 98 controls were followed up at 25 months of age (SD 11.4). Severe NDI was found in 8.9% of the TTTS children (10.5% [9/86] after FSLC; 5.3% [2/38] after UCO) compared to 3.1% in the control group (p = 0.10). The odds ratio for severe NDI was 1.8 in cases versus controls (p = 0.37). The total ASQ score was significantly lower in the TTTS group than in controls (p = 0.03) after FSLC (p = 0.03) and after UCO (p = 0.14).\nChildren after TTTS appear to have a higher risk of severe NDI and score significantly lower on the ASQ compared to monochorionic twins from uncomplicated pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cerclage treatment for cervical changes at mid trimester is a very controversial topic in twins. The aim of the study was to present our maternal and fetal outcomes of mid-trimester cervical cerclage in twin pregnancies.\nThis study was performed using data extracted from the medical files of the twin pregnancies whom performed emergency cervical cerclage between January 2012 and March 2018 at Trakya University, Facuty of Medicine, Department of Perinatology.\nMean (min.-max.) gestational age at delivery was [27.3 (21-34) weeks]. The median time between cervical cerclage and delivery was 6.4 weeks, while the maximum prolongation of the pregnancy was 11 weeks. The median prolongation period of pregnancy was 4.1 weeks in patients with bulging membranes, but 10 weeks in patients with cervical effacement and cervical shortening. Eight infants died at the neonatal period. Two patients (20%) developed late abortions at 21 and 22 weeks of gestation, and 2 women (20%) delivered extremely premature neonates at the 24th weeks. Overall neonatal mortality rate was 40% (8/20 neonates). Twelve out of twenty were born alive (60%).\nDespite the lack of randomized controlled trials, it seems reasonable to offer emergency cervical cerclage to twin pregnancies with cervical shortening (<15mm). For the twin pregnancies with advanced cervical dilatation and protruding membranes, emergency cervical cerclage should be an option only for carefully selected patients after informing about the complications and low success rate.",

The modality of simulation offers a safe practice environment for a multidisciplinary group consisting of neonatal providers, nurses, respiratory therapists, and surgeons in which to identify and address clinical decision making, procedural, and behavioral plans related to routine and emergency care of these patients. Simulation-based clinical rehearsals (SbCR) provide a unique opportunity to prepare for rare, complex, and patient specific clinical procedures and scenarios. This primer serves as a revisable tool that promotes the development of proper timing, technique, and confidence to allow for an optimal setting for delivery of safe care to conjoined twins.

    "abstract": "In this Letter, we establish and explore a new connection between quantum information theory and classical statistical mechanics by studying the problem of qubit losses in 2D topological color codes. We introduce a protocol to cope with qubit losses, which is based on the identification and removal of a twin qubit from the code, and which guarantees the recovery of a valid three-colorable and trivalent reconstructed color code. Moreover, we show that determining the corresponding qubit loss error threshold is equivalent to a new generalized classical percolation problem. We numerically compute the associated qubit loss thresholds for two families of 2D color code and find that with p=0.461\u00b10.005 these are close to satisfying the fundamental limit of 50% as imposed by the no-cloning theorem. Our findings reveal a new connection between topological color codes and percolation theory, show high robustness of color codes against qubit loss, and are directly relevant for implementations of topological quantum error correction in various physical platforms.",

    "abstract": "Variation in healthy aging and lifespan is ascribed more to various non-genetic factors than to inherited genetic determinants, and a major goal in aging research is to reveal the epigenetic basis of aging. One approach to this goal is to find genomic sites or regions where DNA methylation correlates with biological age. Using health data from 134 elderly twins, we calculated a frailty index as a quantitative indicator of biological age, and by applying the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip technology to their leukocyte DNA samples, we obtained quantitative DNA methylation data on genome-wide CpG sites. We analyzed the health and epigenome data by taking two independent associative approaches: the parametric regression-based approach and a non-parametric machine learning approach followed by GO ontology analysis. Our results indicate that DNA methylation at CpG sites in the promoter region of PCDHGA3 is associated with biological age. PCDHGA3 belongs to clustered protocadherin genes, which are all located in a single locus on chromosome 5 in human. Previous studies of the clustered protocadherin genes showed that (1) DNA methylation is associated with age or age-related phenotypes; (2) DNA methylation can modulate gene expression; (3) dysregulated gene expression is associated with various pathologies; and (4) DNA methylation patterns at this locus are associated with adverse lifetime experiences. All these observations suggest that DNA methylation at the clustered protocadherin genes, including PCDHGA3, is a key mediator of healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "High protein intake in young children is associated with excess gains in weight and body fat, but the specific role of different protein sources has yet to be described. The study aimed to investigate the role of different types of protein in the post-weaning stage on weight, BMI and overweight/obesity at 60 months. Intakes of animal, dairy and plant protein and a dietary pattern characterising variation in protein types at 21 months of age were estimated using a 3-d diet diary in a cohort of 2154 twins; weight and height were recorded every 3 months from birth to 60 months. Longitudinal mixed-effect models investigated the associations between sources of protein intake or dietary pattern scores and BMI, weight and overweight/obesity from 21 months up to 60 months. Adjusting for confounders, dairy protein intake at 21 months was positively associated with greater weight (46 (95 % CI 21, 71) g and BMI up to 60 months (0\u00b704 (95 % CI 0\u00b7004, 0\u00b7070) kg/m2) and the odds of overweight/obesity at 3 years (OR 1\u00b712; 95 % CI 1\u00b700, 1\u00b724). Milk showed associations of similar magnitude. A dietary pattern low in dairy protein and high in plant protein was associated with lower weight gain up to 60 months, but not overweight/obesity. Intake of dairy products in early childhood is most strongly associated with weight gain, compared with other protein sources. A dietary pattern characterised by lower protein intake and greater protein source diversity at 2 years may confer a lower risk of excess weight gain.",

    "abstract": "Sharing of the vascular system in conjoined twins creates pharmaceutical dilemmas that require individualization of protocols. One of the major goals for the medical team is to determine how medications should be administered, dosed, and monitored in each set of conjoined twins. In order to achieve these goals, the team must determine the extent of shared circulation, volume of distribution, effectiveness of enteral absorption, renal clearance, and develop processes to ensure medication safety. In this article, we discuss unique challenges in medication practices in conjoined twins and present general principles that can be applied to determine optimal pharmaceutical strategies.",

    "abstract": "In order to investigate the competitive interaction between nanoparticles and twin, the eutectic Si microstructures in Al\u207b10Si (wt. %) base alloys with exclusive and combined addition of Sr and Sb are characterized by combined TEM and atom probe tomography (APT). The chemical short range order in Sb\u207bSb and Sb\u207bSr pairs is revealed by ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, which promotes the formation of clusters and nanoparticles. The coexistence of nanoparticles and twins is observed in Sb containing alloys, with a negative correlation in the corresponding number density, owing to the competitive stacking of precursors and individual atoms at the solid\u207bliquid interface. Large size particles around 70 nm with a uniform distribution of Sr atoms are formed in Al\u207b10Si\u207b0.35Sb\u207b0.015Sr (wt. %) alloys, due to the precursor aggregation and homogeneous nucleation in the droplets that nucleation are depressed. A model for the formation of nanoparticles and their interaction with twins is proposed.",

After 11hours of cesarean surgery, the pediatric surgical team chose to separate the twins. They were monitored with cardioscopy, oximetry, capnography, nasopharyngeal thermometer, urinary output, and noninvasive blood pressure. We chose inhaled induction with oxygen and 4% Sevoflurane. T1 patient was intubated with a 3.5 uncuffed endotracheal tube, and, after three unsuccessful intubation attempts of patient T2, a number 1 laryngeal mask was used. After securing the twins' airway, the induction was supplemented with fentanyl, propofol, and rocuronium. Mechanical ventilation in controlled pressure mode (6mL.kg\nConjoined twin separation surgery is a challenge, which requires planning and coordination of a multidisciplinary team during all stages.",

    "abstract": "Variation in DNA methylation is being increasingly associated with health and disease outcomes. Although DNA methylation is hypothesized to be a mechanism by which both genetic and non-genetic factors can influence the regulation of gene expression, little is known about the extent to which DNA methylation at specific sites is influenced by heritable as well as environmental factors. We quantified DNA methylation in whole blood at age 18 in a birth cohort of 1,464 individuals comprising 426 monozygotic (MZ) and 306 same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. Site-specific levels of DNA methylation were more strongly correlated across the genome between MZ than DZ twins. Structural equation models revealed that although the average contribution of additive genetic influences on DNA methylation across the genome was relatively low, it was notably elevated at the highly variable sites characterized by intermediate levels of DNAm that are most relevant for epigenetic epidemiology. Sites at which variable DNA methylation was most influenced by genetic factors were significantly enriched for DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) effects, and overlapped with sites where inter-individual variation correlates across tissues. Finally, we show that DNA methylation at sites robustly associated with environmental exposures such as tobacco smoking and obesity is also influenced by additive genetic effects, highlighting the need to control for genetic background in analyses of exposure-associated DNA methylation differences. Estimates of the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to DNA methylation at all sites profiled in this study are available as a resource for the research community (http://www.epigenomicslab.com/online-data-resources).",

    "abstract": "We studied whether objectively measured physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) are associated with cognition in Finnish elderly twins.\nThis cross-sectional study comprised twins born in Finland from 1940 to 1944 in the Older Finnish Twin Cohort (mean age, 72.9\u00a0years; 726 persons). From 2014 to 2016, cognition was assessed with a validated telephonic interview, whereas PA was measured with a waist-worn accelerometer.\nIn between-family models, SB and light physical activity had significant linear associations with cognition after adjusting for age, sex, wearing time, education level, body mass index, and living condition (SB: \u03b2-estimate, -0.21 [95% confidence intervals, -0.42 to -0.003]; light physical activity: \u03b2-estimate, 0.30 [95% confidence intervals, 0.02-0.58]). In within-family models, there were no significant linear associations between objectively measured PA and cognition.\nObjectively measured light physical activity and SB are associated with cognition in Finnish twins in their seventies, but the associations were attributable to genetic and environmental selection.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have examined associations between peripheral DNA methylation patterns of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) promoter and symptoms of depression and anxiety. The SLC6A4 promoter methylation has also been associated with frontal-limbic brain responses to negative stimuli. However, it is unclear how much of this association is confounded by DNA sequence variations. We utilized a monozygotic-twin within-pair discordance design, to test whether DNA methylation at specific CpG sites in the SLC6A4 promoter of peripheral cells is associated with greater frontal-limbic brain responses to negative stimuli (sadness and fear), independently of DNA sequence effects. In total 48 pairs of healthy 15-year-old monozygotic twins from the Quebec Newborn Twin Study, followed regularly since birth, underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while conducting an emotion-processing task. The SLC6A4 promoter methylation level was assessed in saliva samples using pyrosequencing. Relative to the co-twins with lower SLC6A4 promoter methylation levels, twins with higher peripheral SLC6A4 methylation levels showed greater orbitofrontal cortical (OFC) activity and left amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left amygdala-right OFC connectivity in response to sadness as well as greater ACC-left amygdala and ACC-left insula connectivity in response to fearful stimuli. By utilising a monozygotic-twin design, we provided evidence that associations between peripheral SLC6A4 promoter methylation and frontal-limbic brain responses to negative stimuli are, in part, independent of DNA sequence variations. Although causality cannot be determined here, SLC6A4 promoter methylation may be one of the mechanisms underlying how environmental factors influence the serotonin system, potentially affecting emotional processing through frontal-limbic areas.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that fetal plasma erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations are significantly increased in growth-restricted fetuses with abnormal umbilical artery (UA) Doppler. During hypoxia in an ovine model, the primary site of fetal EPO synthesis was switched from the kidneys to the placenta. Therefore, we designed this study to evaluate human placental EPO gene expression and the correlation to fetal serum EPO concentration in growth-restricted fetuses in a monochorionic (MC) twin model.\nIn MC twin pairs, selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) was defined as the presence of (i) birth weight discordance of >\u200920% and (ii) a smaller twin with a birth weight less than the 10th percentile. Fetal UA and middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler were checked within 1\u00a0week before delivery. An abnormal UA Doppler was defined as persistently absent or reverse end-diastolic flow. Cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) was defined as MCA-pulsatility index (PI)/UA-PI. Fetal plasma EPO concentrations were measured in cord blood, and EPO gene expression was assayed in each twin's placental territory. The intertwin plasma EPO ratio was calculated as the cord plasma EPO level of the smaller (or sIUGR) twin divided by the EPO concentration of the larger (or appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA)) twin, and the intertwin placental EPO gene expression ratio was calculated similarly.\nTwenty-six MC twins were analyzed, including normal twins (Group 1, n\u2009=\u20099), twins with sIUGR without UA Doppler abnormalities (Group 2, n\u2009=\u20099), and twins with sIUGR and UA Doppler abnormalities (Group 3, n\u2009=\u20098). The CPRs of smaller (sIUGR) fetuses were significantly decreased in Group 3 MC twins (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but not significantly different between Group 1 and Group 2. The highest fetal plasma EPO ratio and placental EPO gene expression ratio were identified in Group 3 MC twins (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The placental EPO gene expression ratios were significantly correlated with the fetal plasma EPO ratios (Pearson's correlation test, p\u2009=\u20090.004).\nThis study provides evidence of increased placental EPO expression in MC twin fetuses with sIUGR and abnormal UA Doppler. Future studies are needed to confirm the similar role of placental EPO in severe IUGR singletons.",

    "abstract": "While their incidence is on the rise, twin pregnancies are associated with risks to the mothers and their babies. This study aims to investigate the likelihood of adverse neonatal outcomes of twins following assisted reproductive technology (ART) compared to non-ART twins.\nA retrospective population study using the Australian National Perinatal Data Collections (NPDC) which included 19,662 twins of \u226520\u00a0weeks gestational age or\u2009\u2265\u2009400\u00a0g birthweight in Australia. Maternal outcomes and neonatal outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight, resuscitation and neonatal death) were compared. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to assess the likelihood of any neonatal outcomes, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) presented. Weinberg's differential rule was used to estimate monozygotic twin rate.\nART mothers were 3.3\u00a0years older than non-ART mothers. The rates of pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes were significantly higher for ART mothers than non-ART mothers (12.2% vs. 8.4%, p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.01) and (9.7% vs. 7.5%, p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.01) respectively. The incidence of monozygotic twins was 2.0% for ART twins and 1.1% for non-ART twins. Compared with non-ART twins, ART twins had higher rates of preterm birth (AOR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.22), low birth weight (AOR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.22), and resuscitation (AOR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.17-1.36). Liveborn ART twins had 28% (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50) increased odds of having any adverse neonatal outcome compared to liveborn non-ART twins, especially for opposite-sex ART twins (AOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.11-1.82).\nAs ART twins had higher rates of adverse outcome, special prenatal care is recommended. Couples accessing ART should be fully informed of the risk of adverse outcome of twin pregnancies.",

The rates of pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes were significantly higher for ART mothers than non-ART mothers (12.2% vs. 8.4%, p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.01) and (9.7% vs. 7.5%, p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.01) respectively. The incidence of monozygotic twins was 2.0% for ART twins and 1.1% for non-ART twins. Compared with non-ART twins, ART twins had higher rates of preterm birth (AOR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.22), low birth weight (AOR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.22), and resuscitation (AOR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.17-1.36). Liveborn ART twins had 28% (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50) increased odds of having any adverse neonatal outcome compared to liveborn non-ART twins, especially for opposite-sex ART twins (AOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.11-1.82).",

    "abstract": "Clinical phenotype variability in MEN1 syndrome exists and evidence for an established genotype-phenotype is lacking. However, a higher aggressiveness of MEN1-associated gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) (neuro)endocrine tumours (NETs) tumours has been reported when MEN1 gene truncating mutations are detected. We found a novel germline truncating mutation of MEN1 gene at exon 10 in a subject with an aggressive clinical behavior of GEP-NETs. Successively, other two mutant-affected familial members have been identified.\nThe aim of this observational study was to investigate genotype-phenotype correlation in these three members, with attention to GPE-NETs behavior over the years.\nThe genetic and clinical data obtained and the follow-up screening program (2012-2016) were according to the International Guidelines in a multidisciplinary academic reference center. The familial history collected strongly suggested MEN1 GEP-NETs in at least other four members from different generations.\nThree MEN1 patients (aged 30-69\u00a0years at MEN1 diagnosis) were clinically screened for MEN1 GEP-NETs, both functioning and nonfunctioning.\nBiochemical, imaging, and nuclear medicine tests and fine-needle agobiopsy were performed, depending on found/emerging clinical symptoms/biochemical abnormalities, and made when necessary.\nOur clinical survey found strong genotype-phenotype correlation with aggressive MEN1 GEP-NETs (G1, G2-NETs, and multiple ZES/gastrinomas) over the years. The familial history strongly suggested ZES/gastrinoma in progenitors from previous generations.\nThis novel MEN1 truncating mutation correlates with an aggressive evolution and behavior of MEN1 GEP-NETs in studied affected subjects, confirming the need for MEN1 individuals to be evaluated by a skilled multidisciplinary team, as also stated by International Guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Renal transplantation between monozygous identical twins provides an opportunity to utilize minimal immunosuppression to maintain stable allograft function, thereby alleviating the toxicities of immunosuppressive therapy. Despite monozygosity, there is a possibility of discordant protein presentation in identical twins that could trigger alloimmune response and lead to graft injury. Therefore, the optimal immunosuppression regimen in this patient population is unknown, and the safety of immunosuppression withdrawal remains controversial. Herein, we describe two patients who underwent successful renal transplantation from monozygotic identical twin donors. Monozygosity was determined using short tandem repeat (STR) analysis. All immunosuppression was successfully discontinued at 2 days and 3 weeks, respectively, after transplantation. Both patients are alive with functioning renal grafts at 1 year and 5 years after transplant, respectively. These two cases suggest that immunosuppression can be withdrawn safely and rapidly in select monozygous identical twin renal transplant recipients.",

    "abstract": "We report on the case of two digestive malformations in dizygotic/dichorionic/diamniotic twins born at 31 weeks of gestation. The mother (gravida 1 para 0) was treated by hydroxychloroquine for systemic lupus erythematosus during pregnancy. Twin A presented an arch-like dilatation on antenatal ultrasounds, characteristic of segmental volvulus. After birth, twin B presented repeated vomiting on feeding, leading us to diagnose ileal atresia despite normal antenatal ultrasounds. Both twins underwent surgery and the postoperative period was uneventful. After 1\u2009year of follow-up, the twins are in excellent health without digestive sequelae. Genetic testing for cystic fibrosis was negative. The placenta showed diffuse signs of hypoxia and ischaemia, indicating that the root cause was vascular. The pathophysiology of intestinal atresia is hypothesised to derive from a vascular incident during fetal development. We are therefore led to believe that an intrauterine vascular event is the most likely cause of the dual malformation.",

    "abstract": "Familial monozygotic (MZ) twinning reports are rare around the world, and we report a four-generation pedigree with seven recorded pairs of female MZ twins. Whole-genome sequencing of seven family members was performed to explore the featured genetic factors in MZ twins. For variations specific to MZ twins, five novel variants were observed in the X chromosome. These candidates were used to explain the seemingly X-linked dominant inheritance pattern, and only one variant was exonic, located at the 5'UTR region of ZCCHC12 (chrX: 117958597, G > A). Besides, consistent mitochondrial DNA composition in the maternal linage precluded roles of mitochondria for this trait. In this pedigree, autosomes also contain diverse variations specific to MZ twins. Pathway analysis revealed a significant enrichment of genes carrying novel SNVs in the epithelial adherens junction-signaling pathway (p = .011), contributed by FGFR1, TUBB6, and MYH7B. Meanwhile, TBC1D22A, TRIOBP, and TUBB6, also carrying similar SNVs, were involved in the GTPase family-mediated signal pathway. Furthermore, gene-set enrichment analysis for 533 genes covered by copy number variations specific to MZ twins illustrated that the tight junction-signaling pathway was significantly enriched (p < .001). Therefore, the novel changes in the X chromosome and the provided candidate variants across autosomes may be responsible for MZ twinning, giving clues to increase our understanding about the underlying mechanism.",

Two designs stand out among others: twins reared apart from birth and the twin-family study.

Gottesman's involvement and contributions to reared-apart twin research are described, followed by selected findings from the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart (MISTRA), the Fullerton Study of Chinese Twins Reared Apart (CTA), a case report on separated monozygotic (MZ) female twins from South Korea, and doubly exchanged MZ male twin pairs from Colombia, South America. Recent findings from an ongoing twin-family study of social closeness, and future directions, are also presented.",

    "abstract": "Handedness effects with respect to regional corpus callosum (CC) anatomy remain open to question. Midsagittal CC tracings were obtained from structural MRIs in 21 female monozygotic twin pairs with discordant handedness (MZHd). The CC was divided into 99 percentile widths which were grouped into seven regions based on Denenberg's (1989, 1991b) factor analysis. Results showed that left handed (LH) twins had significantly larger regional widths in CC region W22-39 compared to right handed (RH) twins, an effect present in 19/21 MZHd pairs. Cross-study analyses revealed CC W22-39 to have the highest variation across female singletons (Cowell et al., 1992, 1993). In the adjacent genu region (W3-18), CC size did not differ between RH and LH twins. However, when twins were reclassified according to handedness direction and consistency to form consistent RH, non-consistent RH, consistent LH and non-consistent LH groups, patterns of CC size in W3-18 closely matched those of singleton women (Cowell et al., 1993). Namely, CC W3-18 was larger in consistent compared to non-consistent RHs. Results support a claim that CC region W22-39, interconnecting premotor cortex in females, provides for environmentally influenced components of handedness, given the difference within MZHd twin pairs. By contrast, CC W3-18, connecting prefrontal cortex, was sensitive to direction and consistency of handedness, both in twins and singletons, a result consistent with combined genetic and environmental effects. Findings highlight the significance of MZHd twin studies in elucidating the developmental mechanisms underpinning structure-function asymmetry, cortical interconnectivity and neurodevelopmental bases of left hand preference.",

Both twins presented with dysmorphic features and global developmental delay.

Whole-exome sequencing did not identify any pathogenic sequence variants but >5000\u2009homozygous exonic variants on chromosome 19, suggestive of UPD19.

    "abstract": "The change of twinning morphology plays an important role in the modification of Al-Si alloys, which are widely used in industrial applications. However, the interpretation of this change is still insufficient. In this work, the microstructure of twins was investigated in two kinds of Al-Si alloys with different additions of Ba using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Unlike the normal {111} twin that exists in Ba-free alloy, discontinuous twins and multiple twins were observed in the Ba-containing alloy. In addition, the 9R structure formed by the dissociation of twins was firstly observed at the turning of discontinuous twins and the intersection of multiple twins in Al-Si alloys.",

    "abstract": "To study, whether there are associations between chewing side preference and other lateralities, whether there is a genetic origin for preferred chewing side (PCS), relations to sex, birth order and orthodontic treatment.\nThe study included 113 twin pairs, 57 pairs monozygotic, 47 pairs same sex dizygotic and 9 pairs of opposite sex. The lateralities of preferred chewing side, footedness and eyedness were assessed by functional tests and handedness was checked by asking.\nRight-handed, -footed and -eyed as separated groups, and true-right sided (combined), were evenly distributed by preferred chewing side. By contrast, left-handed, -footed, -eyed and non-right sided used more left or both sides when chewing. Birth order affected preferred chewing side among monozygotic: the first-born twin was more likely to have the preferred chewing side on the non-right, whereas second-born twins used right side. Gender, zygosity and orthodontic treatment were not statistically significant factors.\nExamination of chewing sidedness could have been done in several different ways to provide a definite result. Sample size of opposite sex twins was very small.\nPreferred chewing side generally seemed to follow the side where other lateralities occur; however, monozygotic twins seemed to be more receptive to it. True-right sided were more evenly distributed than non-right sided by the preferred chewing side.",

    "abstract": "Postzygotic mutations are DNA changes acquired from the zygote stage onwards throughout the lifespan. These changes lead to differences in DNA sequence among cells of an individual, potentially contributing to the etiology of complex disorders. Here we compared whole genome DNA sequence data of two monozygotic twin pairs, 40 and 100 years old, to detect somatic mosaicism. DNA samples were sequenced twice on two Illumina platforms (13X and 40X read depth) for increased specificity. Using differences in allelic ratios resulted in sets of 1,720 and 1,739 putative postzygotic mutations in the 40-year-old twin pair and 100-year-old twin pair, respectively, for subsequent enrichment analysis. This set of putative mutations was strongly (p\u00a0<\u00a04.37e-91) enriched in both twin pairs for regulatory elements. The corresponding genes were significantly enriched for genes that are alternatively spliced, and for genes involved in GTPase activity. This research shows that somatic mosaicism can be detected in monozygotic twin pairs by using allelic ratios calculated from DNA sequence data and that the mutations which are found by this approach are not randomly distributed throughout the genome.",

    "abstract": "Plesiotwins and diperiodic twins have in common the fact of being characterized by a low degree of lattice restoration. Plesiotwins differ from twins by the fact that the relative orientation of the individuals is obtained by a non-crystallographic rotation about the normal to the composition plane, whereas for twins this rotation is crystallographic, apart from possible small deviations coming from metric pseudosymmetries. In the case of plesiotwins, the low degree of lattice restoration comes from a large coincidence site lattice (CSL) in the composition plane. Diperiodic twins, instead, have a small CSL in the composition plane but the second plane of the same family contributing to the overall lattice restoration is too far away from the composition plane to be considered significant. It is shown that plesiotwins can occur as reflection twins if the composition plane is not parallel to the twin plane, and as rotation twins in the case of parallel hemitropy. Diperiodic twins can in principle occur in any category, but either the metric conditions to obtain a diperiodic twin are actually in contrast with the metric pseudosymmetry required for twinning or the result is actually a hybrid twin. This justifies why no confirmed examples of diperiodic twins are known to date.",

    "abstract": "A proposed marker of prenatal androgen exposure is the ratio of the index finger to ring finger (2D:4D). Within each sex, this ratio may be lower for those who were exposed to higher levels of androgens and become attracted to women, as compared to those who were exposed to lower levels of androgens and become attracted to men. We examined these patterns in identical twins with discordant sexual orientations. Because these twins are genetically identical, differences in prenatal androgen exposure, as reflected in their different finger length ratios, might contribute to their discordance. For 18 female twin pairs, non-straight (bisexual or lesbian) twins had significantly lower, or more masculinized, 2D:4D ratios than their straight co-twins, but only in the left hand. For 14 male pairs, non-straight twins had, contrary to our prediction, more masculinized finger length ratios than straight co-twins, but this difference was not significant. A reanalysis of present and previous data (Hall & Love, 2003; Hiraishi, Sasaki, Shikishima, & Ando, 2012) suggested that these patterns were robust. Furthermore, males had more masculinized 2D:4D ratios than females. This sex difference did not vary by sexual orientation.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether Kangaroo care (KC) influences the salivary oxytocin (OT) concentration in preterm infants, and which correlates affect the OT response.\nEleven twin pairs participated in a study in which we collected saliva using cotton swabs twice a day, once during KC and once during baseline conditions (lying in bed or incubator). The total study duration was five days. The saliva of twin siblings were pooled to obtain vials with sufficient volumes of either saliva collected during KC or at baseline. OT levels were measured using a radio-immuno assay. The infants' state of comfort and parent-infant interaction were examined using previously developed Likert-scales, amongst other correlates such as the KC duration, gestational age and birth weight.\nDuring KC, OT was lower compared to baseline (mean 1.39\u202fpg/ml (SD 0.58\u202fpg/ml) versus 2.40\u202fpg/ml (SD 1.64\u202fpg/ml), p\u202f=\u202f 0.03). Comfort at baseline and parent-infant interaction seemed to influence OT responses.\nThe OT concentration in the pooled saliva of preterm infant twins decreased during KC. This response of the OT system might be explained by stress during baseline.",

    "abstract": "Datasets comprising twins and their children can be a useful tool for understanding the nature of intergenerational associations between parent and offspring phenotypes. In the present article we explore structural equation models previously used to analyse Children-of-Twins data, highlighting some limitations and considerations. We then present new variants of these models, showing that extending the models to include multiple offspring per parent addresses several of the limitations discussed. Accompanying the updated models, we provide power calculations and demonstrate with application to simulated data. We then apply to intergenerational analyses of height and weight, using a sub-study of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa); the Intergenerational Transmission of Risk (IToR) project, wherein all kinships in the MoBa data have been identified (a children-of-twins-and-siblings study). Finally, we consider how to interpret the findings of these models and discuss future directions.",

    "abstract": "The presence of a skin-brain connection whereby alterations in the skin can inform on mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases is increasingly recognized. In this study, we used a discovery (n\u00a0=\u00a0321) and replication (n\u00a0=\u00a0147) sample from the Twins UK population to test the association between naevus count and memory function, and its mediation by telomeres. Memory function was assessed in 1999 and 2009 using the paired associates learning test (PAL), while naevus count and leucocyte telomere length (LTL, assessed by the terminal restriction fragment assay) were measured once. Higher baseline naevus count was significantly associated with fewer errors at the baseline and follow-up PAL, as well as with change in PAL score over 10\u00a0years. This association was significantly attenuated after adjustment for LTL. The significant association between naevus count and PAL score was reproduced in the replication sample. These findings suggest that melanocytes might be used as model system to study the biological ageing pathways involved in neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Acne is a common skin disease in adolescence. It is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous units, which mainly occurs on the face and upper parts of the trunk. Based on severity of the lesions, acne can be mild, moderate or severe. Severe acne is usually featured with a protracted course and residual scars. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been demonstrated to be effective in severe acne recently. We report a case of monozygotic twins with severe acne who were successfully treated with PDT.",

    "abstract": "To explore the DNA methylation sites correlated with blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure) in adult twin population.\nA total of 476 twins from the Chinese National Twin Registry were selected as the research population. Questionnaires were used to collect demographic characteristics, lifestyle, disease status and other information, and blood pressure, height, weight and other anthropometric indicators were measured. The genome-wide DNA methylation of whole blood samples was detected by using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. The DNA methylation sites correlated with blood pressure were analyzed by constructing mixed effect model with adjusting potential confounding factors, and the significant level was false discovery rate <0.05.\nAfter data quality control, 465 twins (122 pairs of monozygotic twins, 104 pairs of dizygotic twins, 13 individuals from 13 pairs of twins) aged (44.8\u00b113.2) years were finally enrolled. There were more males and more monozygotic twins, and the current smokers and current regular drinkers both accounted for more than 30%. No significant CpG site was found after multiple testing in the correlation study between genome-wide DNA methylation and blood pressure by using the collected twins. However, the cg07761116 located on chromosome 10 had low P value in the correlation analysis of 3 blood pressure indices (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure), suggesting that this site might be correlated with blood pressure. The other 7 sites had low P value in the correlation analysis of the two blood pressure indices, respectively, which pointed to genes involved in neurological development, protein homeostasis, inflammatory reaction and other pathways.\nThere is no sufficient evidence to support any DNA methylation site correlated with blood pressure, which may be caused by insufficient sample size and other reasons. This study could provide a reference for subsequent similar twin studies, and subsequent studies can focus on the cg07761116 located on chromosome 10 and other sites with low P values.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to estimate heritability of Hwabyung (HB) symptoms in adolescent and young adult twins in South Korea. The sample included 1,601 twins consisting of 143 pairs of monozygotic male (MZM), 67 pairs of dizygotic male (DZM), 295 pairs of monozygotic female (MZF), 114 pairs of dizygotic female (DZF), and 117 pairs of opposite-sex dizygotic (OSDZ) twins and 129 twins with non-participating co-twins (mean age = 19.1 \u00b1 3.1 years; range: 12-29 years). An HB symptom questionnaire was given to twins via a telephone interview. Consistent with the literature of HB, the mean level of HB was significantly higher in females than in males. Maximum likelihood twin correlations for HB were 0.31 (95% CI [0.16, 0.45]) for MZM, 0.19 (95% CI [-0.05, 0.41]) for DZM, 0.50 (95% CI [0.41, 0.58]) for MZF, 0.28 (95% CI [0.11, 0.44]) for DZF, and 0.23 (95% CI [0.05, 0.40]) for OSDZ twins. These patterns of twin correlations suggested the presence of additive genetic influences on HB. Model-fitting analysis showed that additive genetic and individual-specific environmental influences on HB were 44% (95% CI [37, 51]) and 56% (95% CI [49, 63]), respectively. Shared environmental influences were not significant. These parameter estimates were not significantly different between two sexes, and did not change significantly with age in the present sample, suggesting that genetic and environmental influences on HB in both sexes are stable across adolescence and young adulthood.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the accuracy of the reporting of medication use by proxy- and self-respondents, and it compares the prognostic value of the number of medications from survey and registry data for predicting mortality across self- and proxy-respondents.\nThe study is based on the linkage of the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins and the Danish 1905-Cohort Study with the Danish National Prescription Registry. We investigated the concordance between survey and registry data, and the prognostic value of medication use when assessed using survey and registry data, to predict mortality for self- and proxy-respondents at intake surveys.\nAmong self-respondents, the agreement was moderate (\u03ba = 0.52-0.58) for most therapeutic groups, whereas among proxy-respondents, the agreement was low to moderate (\u03ba = 0.36-0.60). The magnitude of the relative differences was, generally, greater among proxies than among self-respondents. Each additional increase in the total number of medications was associated with 7%-8% mortality increase among self- and 4%-6% mortality increase among proxy-respondents in both the survey and registry data. The predictive value of the total number of medications estimated from either data source was lower among proxies (c-statistic = 0.56-0.58) than among self-respondents (c-statistic = 0.74).\nThe concordance between survey and registry data regarding medication use and the predictive value of the number of medications for mortality were lower among proxy- than among self-respondents.",

    "abstract": "Growing use of in\u00a0vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in an elevated twin birth rate, and a burgeoning population of IVF twins who are now aging into adolescence and beyond. This study tests a model examining whether parental conformity expectations have differential effects on twins' versus singletons' parent-adolescent relationship satisfaction, and if this effect is indirectly associated with relative changes in twins' and singletons' internalizing and externalizing behavior from middle childhood to adolescence. Using a sample of 278 IVF twins and singletons, path models demonstrate that twin status and conformity expectations interact to influence parent-adolescent relationships. Although there was an association between twin status and mother-adolescent relationship satisfaction among parents with high conformity expectations (r\u00a0=\u00a0.25, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01), this relationship was nonsignificant among parents with low conformity expectations (r\u00a0=\u00a0.05, p\u00a0=\u00a0.85). The differential effect of conformity expectations on parent-adolescent relationship satisfaction for twins and singletons was indirectly associated with relative changes in twins' and singletons' externalizing behavior from middle childhood to adolescence. Results demonstrate that higher levels of parental conformity expectations may not have the same effect on adolescent twins and singletons.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether there was an association between the systematic promotion of twin vaginal delivery and an increase in the rates of twin vaginal birth.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study. We implemented a quality improvement initiative promoting twin vaginal delivery at an academic tertiary care center in 2013. The program included a needs assessment, simulation of vaginal twin delivery, online educational material, and the expansion of a dedicated twin clinic. We analyzed rates of twin vaginal birth in pregnancies at or beyond 24 weeks of gestation without a contraindication to labor, prior uterine surgery, or a demise or lethal anomaly of either twin. Using linear regression, we calculated annual adjusted rates of twin vaginal birth from 2010 to 2015 and in the 3 years before and after our intervention. We performed an interrupted time-series analysis estimating rates of change before and after the intervention to account for the influence of secular trend.\nOf 1,574 patients delivering twins, 897 (57%) were included, with 479 in the 3 years before and 418 in the 3 years after the intervention. Adjusted rates of vaginal delivery increased from 32.1% (n=153) to 44.2% (n=185) before and after the intervention (P<.01), with a decrease in elective cesarean delivery from 54.6% (n=479) to 44.3% (n=185) (P<.01). Rates of breech extraction increased after the intervention (5.7% vs 9.3%, P=.04). However, there was no difference in the rate of change in twin vaginal birth in the time period before (1.35% annual increase, P=.76) or after (5.8% annual increase, P=.40) the intervention.\nAlthough we observed an increased rate of twin vaginal birth in the time period after our intervention, because the rates of increase before and after the intervention were not statistically different, the increase is not attributable to our intervention and is more properly attributed to secular trend.",

Two-month-old twins were referred to the paediatric surgery centre with trocar needles lodged in different organs. A radiograph undertaken in one of them because of acute respiratory distress demonstrated needles in the heart and diaphragm which were removed surgically. The second twin, referred one week after his brother, had a needle deep in his liver and it was decided not to operate owing to the possibility of haemorrhage but, sadly, he died unexpectedly and the autopsy concluded that it was owing to sudden infant death syndrome. Because of a number of admissions to different units in the same hospital, there was a delay in the eventual diagnosis. Recurrent admissions to different hospital units should raise the suspicion of fabricated and/or induced illness.",

    "abstract": "Orofacial clefts (OFCs) are common and etiologically complex birth defects. This study explored potential genetic differences in a pair of Japanese monozygotic (MZ) twins with different forms of OFC using whole-genome sequencing.\nOne co-twin (MZ-1) presented with nonsyndromic bilateral cleft lip and palate; the other co-twin (MZ-2) had nonsyndromic bilateral cleft lip and unilateral left-sided cleft alveolus. Neither parent had an OFC. Craniofacial morphologic features and potential genetic differences were compared using standard cephalometry and whole-genome sequencing, respectively.\nMorphologically, MZ-1 had a smaller vertical mandibular height, compared to MZ-2. However, no discordant genetic differences were detected. Moreover, both twins and their parents harbored rare candidate gene variants (GRHL3; TPM1) considered to be associated with OFCs.\nThe observed differences between MZ-1 and MZ-2 in craniofacial morphology assessed by cephalograms might be directly attributable to the effects of the OFC on growth and/or differences in surgical history, given the lack of any differences in genetic background. However, comparisons of discordant MZ twins should continue to identify novel candidates that might control OFC or that might partly explain the missing heritability for this common birth defect, in addition to understanding craniofacial growth and development.",

    "abstract": "Calling variants from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data or discovering discordant sequences between two NGS data sets is challenging. We developed a computer algorithm, ADIScan1, to call variants by comparing the fractions of allelic reads in a tester to the universal reference genome. We then created ADIScan2 by modifying the algorithm to directly compare two sets of NGS data and predict discordant sequences between two testers. ADIScan1 detected >99.7% of variants called by GATK with an additional 724 393 SNVs. ADIScan2 identified \u223c500 candidates of discordant sequences in each of two pairs of the monozygotic twins. About 200 of these candidates were included in the \u223c2800 predicted by VarScan2. We verified 66 true discordant sequences among the candidates that ADIScan2 and VarScan2 exclusively predicted. ADIScan2 detected many discordant sequences overlooked by VarScan2 and Mutect, which specialize in detecting low frequency mutations in genetically heterogeneous cancerous tissues. Numbers of verified sequences alone were >5 times more than expected based on recently estimated mutation rates from whole genome sequences. Estimated post-zygotic mutation rates were 1.68 \u00d7 10-7 in this study. ADIScan1 and 2 would complement existing tools in screening causative mutations of diverse genetic diseases and comparing two sets of genome sequences, respectively.",

    "abstract": "There is a complex interaction between female and male sex hormones and the risk of epilepsy. Whether prenatal exposure to higher levels of sex hormones affects the development of epilepsy in childhood or later in life is not well known. The sex hormone environment of fetuses may be affected by the sex of the co-twin. We estimated the risk of epilepsy for twins with an opposite-sex (OS) co-twin compared with twins with a same-sex (SS) co-twin.\nFrom the Danish Twin Registry, we identified OS female twins (n\u2009=\u200911,078), SS female twins (n\u2009=\u200919,186), OS male twins (n\u2009=\u200911,080), and SS male twins (n\u2009=\u200920,207) born between 1977 and 2009. The SS twins include monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, and twins with unknown zygosity. These children were followed up from day 29 after birth until diagnosis of epilepsy, death, emigration, or end of follow-up (31 December 2011) whichever came first. Information on diagnosis of epilepsy was obtained from the Danish National Patient Registry. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for epilepsy in the OS twins using a Cox proportional hazards regression model compared with the SS twins. To account for the correlation of twins from the same mother when estimating standard errors, we used the cluster option in Stata.\nWe identified 152 OS female twins, 282 SS female twins, 162 OS male twins, and 335 SS male twins diagnosed with epilepsy corresponding to an incidence rate of 9.9 and 9.7 per 10,000 person years for the OS and SS female twins, and 10.6 and 10.9 per 10,000 person years for the OS and SS male twins, respectively. We found a similar risk of epilepsy among the OS and SS female twins [HR\u2009=\u20091.01; 95% CI 0.83-1.24] as well as among the OS and SS male twins [HR\u2009=\u20090.94; 95% CI 0.78-1.14] CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study of Danish twins, we did not find difference in the risk of epilepsy between twins with an OS co-twin and twins with a SS co-twin. This applied to both female and male twins. The study therefore does not support the hypothesis that subtle hormone difference in fetal life due to co-twin may play a role in the development of epilepsy later in life.",

    "results": "We identified 152 OS female twins, 282 SS female twins, 162 OS male twins, and 335 SS male twins diagnosed with epilepsy corresponding to an incidence rate of 9.9 and 9.7 per 10,000 person years for the OS and SS female twins, and 10.6 and 10.9 per 10,000 person years for the OS and SS male twins, respectively. We found a similar risk of epilepsy among the OS and SS female twins [HR\u2009=\u20091.01; 95% CI 0.83-1.24] as well as among the OS and SS male twins [HR\u2009=\u20090.94; 95% CI 0.78-1.14] CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study of Danish twins, we did not find difference in the risk of epilepsy between twins with an OS co-twin and twins with a SS co-twin. This applied to both female and male twins. The study therefore does not support the hypothesis that subtle hormone difference in fetal life due to co-twin may play a role in the development of epilepsy later in life.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading non-infectious cause of death in infants. Monozygotic (MZ) twins share nearly all of their genetic variants before and after birth. Nevertheless, MZ twins are sometimes discordant for common complex diseases. The goal of this study is to identify genomic and epigenomic differences between a pair of twins discordant for a form of congenital heart disease, double outlet right ventricle (DORV).\nA monoamniotic monozygotic (MZ) twin pair discordant for DORV were subjected to genome-wide sequencing and methylation analysis. We identified few genomic differences but 1566 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the MZ twins. Twenty percent (312/1566) of the DMRs are located within 2\u00a0kb upstream of transcription start sites (TSS), containing 121 binding sites of transcription factors. Particularly, ZIC3 and NR2F2 are found to have hypermethylated promoters in both the diseased twin and additional patients suffering from DORV.\nThe results showed a high correlation between hypermethylated promoters at ZIC3 and NR2F2 and down-regulated gene expression levels of these two genes in patients with DORV compared to normal controls, providing new insight into the potential mechanism of this rare form of CHD.",

    "abstract": "Depressive symptoms are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic dysregulation, but the direction of the association remains unclear.\nTo investigate the temporal association between depression and HRV.\nA longitudinal, cross-lagged twin difference study, with baseline assessments from March 2002 to March 2006 (visit 1) and a 7-year follow-up (visit 2) at an academic research center with participants recruited from a national twin registry. Twins (n\u2009=\u2009166) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, who served in the US military during the Vietnam War, and were discordant for depression at baseline were recruited.\nAt both visits, depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and HRV was measured through 24-hour electrocardiogram monitoring. To assess the direction of the association, within-pair differences in multivariable mixed-effects regression models were examined, and standardized \u03b2 coefficients for both pathways were calculated. The associations were evaluated separately in monozygotic and dizygotic twins.\nIn the final analytic sample (N\u2009=\u2009146), all participants were men, 138 (95%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 54 (3) years at baseline. Results showed consistent associations between visit 1 HRV and visit 2 BDI score across all HRV domains and models (\u03b2 coefficients ranging from -0.14 to -0.29), which were not explained by antidepressants or other participant characteristics. The magnitude of the association was similar in the opposite pathway linking visit 1 BDI score to visit 2 HRV, with \u03b2 coefficients ranging from 0.05 to -0.30, but it was largely explained by antidepressant use. In stratified analysis by zygosity, significant associations were observed in monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the path linking visit 1 HRV to visit 2 BDI score, although the associations were slightly stronger in dizygotic twins.\nThe association between depression and autonomic dysregulation, indexed by HRV, is bidirectional, with stronger evidence suggesting that autonomic function affects depression risk rather than vice versa. The opposite causal pathway from depression to lower HRV is mostly driven by antidepressant use. These findings highlight an important role of autonomic nervous system in the risk of depression and contribute new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease.",
