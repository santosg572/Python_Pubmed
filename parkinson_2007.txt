    "abstract": "Malignant syndrome is a rare complication occurring during the course of drug treatment for Parkinson's disease. It resembles neuroleptic malignant syndrome and is characterized by fever, marked rigidity, altered consciousness, leucocytosis and elevated creatine kinase. Malignant syndrome is a potentially fatal condition and awareness of this condition is imperative for prevention and treatment. The commonest precipitating factor is dopaminergic drug withdrawal or dose reduction. We report malignant syndrome (precipitated by hyponatremia) in a case of Parkinson's disease, in the absence of dopaminergic drug withdrawal. A 60-year-old man presented with fever, severe rigidity and altered sensorium following repeated vomiting. On investigation, he was found to have hyponatremia precipitated malignant syndrome. Treatment with hydration, cooling, correction of hyponatremia and dopaminergic drugs reversed his condition. The triad of fever, severe rigidity and altered sensorium should prompt evaluation for malignant syndrome in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The ability to interpret vocal (prosodic) cues during social interactions can be disrupted by Parkinson's disease, with notable effects on how emotions are understood from speech. This study investigated whether PD patients who have emotional prosody deficits exhibit further difficulties decoding the attitude of a speaker from prosody. Vocally inflected but semantically nonsensical 'pseudo-utterances' were presented to listener groups with and without PD in two separate rating tasks. Task I required participants to rate how confident a speaker sounded from their voice and Task 2 required listeners to rate how polite the speaker sounded for a comparable set of pseudo-utterances. The results showed that PD patients were significantly less able than HC participants to use prosodic cues to differentiate intended levels of speaker confidence in speech, although the patients could accurately detect the politelimpolite attitude of the speaker from prosody in most cases. Our data suggest that many PD patients fail to use vocal cues to effectively infer a speaker's emotions as well as certain attitudes in speech such as confidence, consistent with the idea that the basal ganglia play a role in the meaningful processing of prosodic sequences in spoken language (Pell & Leonard, 2003).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by the progressive impairment of motor skills in patients. Growing evidence suggests that abnormal redox-active metal accumulation, caused by dysregulation, plays a central role in the neuropathology of PD. Redox-active metals (e.g. Fe and Cu) catalyze essential reactions for brain function. However, these metals can also participate in the generation of highly toxic free radicals that can cause oxidative damage to cells and ultimately lead to the death of dopamine-containing neurons. The emergence of redox-active metals as key players in the pathogenesis of PD strongly suggests that metal-chelators could be beneficial in the treatment of this condition. This mini-review summarizes major recent developments on natural, synthetic iron chelating compounds and hydrogen peroxide-triggered prochelators as potential candidates for PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of the subthalamo-pallidal complex in Parkinson's disease during deep brain stimulation (DBS) were studied using two models, a simple firing-rate model and a population-based model. We extended the simple firing-rate model of the complex formed by the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the external segment of the Globus Pallidus (GPe) to explore its dynamical regime during DBS. More specifically, the modulation of neuronal activity (i.e., pattern and amplitude) during DBS was studied. A similar approach was used with the population-based model. Simulation results revealed a gradual decrease in bursting activity in STN cells when the DBS frequency increased. In addition, the contribution of the stimulation current type (mono- or biphasic) to the results was also examined. A comparison of the two models indicated that the population-based model was more biologically realistic and more appropriate for exploring DBS mechanisms. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of DBS is a prerequisite for developing new stimulation protocols.",

    "abstract": "Management of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) should benefit from improved integration between in-hospital services and home care. In Italy the number of PD hospital admissions is large but there are no guidelines of appropriateness to address queries of health authorities on resource allocation. Reasons for hospitalisation are often linked primarily to the occurrence of falls or infections leading to admission in internal medicine wards rather than neurology. This could be reduced if severe patients were provided with regular nursing and rehabilitation services at their homes and neurologists were actively involved in this process. Moreover, the application of infusion therapies (apomorphine or duodenal levodopa infusion) or deep brain stimulation would require integration with home care services after patient discharge. Here we propose a management algorithm that we believe would facilitate care and eventually lead to an optimisation of resource allocations for advanced PD patients. This would reduce unnecessary internal medicine hospitalisations and further highlight the role of neurologists as a key health care figure.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective surgical treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), with significant advantages in morbidity-mortality and quality of life when compared to lesion techniques such as thalamotomy and/or pallidotomy. The procedure is indicated in patients with severe resting tremor, unresponsive to conventional medical treatment or with motor complications. The most commonly reported complications in the intra- and post-surgical period are aborted procedure, misplaced leads, intracranial haemorrhage, seizures and hardware complications, whereas in the long-term period, cognitive and psychiatric complications can be observed. The most important eligibility criteria for DBS are: a correct diagnosis of idiopathic PD, severity of illness, a consistent levodopa response and absence of cognitive impairment. Chronological age and mood disorders may be relative contraindications to be individually evaluated. Tremor, rigidity dystonias and dyskinesias improve dramatically after DBS; freezing, postural instability and falls remain unchanged, whereas verbal fluency and dysarthria are known to worsen.",

    "abstract": "In the parkinsonian patient, the striatal levels of dopamine strictly depend on peripheral levodopa levels; short half-life of levodopa is responsible for plasmatic level fluctuations, which are consistent with a pulsatile receptor stimulation of the striatal system. This sort of non-physiologic stimulation induces a change of the condition of post-synaptic neurons, which is considered responsible for the fluctuations of clinical response. In this respect, apomorphine administration, via infusion pump, may be a good therapeutic option, aimed at obtaining continuous receptor stimulation, assisting in the management of motor fluctuations in the advanced phase of the disease.",

    "abstract": "We are reporting our clinical experience in 66 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) who were switched to tolcapone because of persisting off periods despite treatment with entacapone (according to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal products: EMEA). We used UPDRS II-III-IV in \"on\" state to monitor tolcapone effectiveness at 6 and 12 months. We found significant reductions in mean off-time duration (UPDRS item 39) and levodopa dose at follow up. Eleven patients dropped out (17%) during the first month of treatment, 2 (3%) because liver enzymes exceeded normal limit. Amongst patients who continued tolcapone, 30/55 (54%) reported \"off-time\" reduction > or =25% (UPDRS-39 decrement > or =1 point). Our findings indicate that tolcapone widens the levodopa therapeutic window, even in patients who have not benefited from entacapone. We suggest that tolcapone is indicated before patients are referred for more invasive procedures.",

    "abstract": "More therapeutic options have become available for Parkinson's disease (PD) in recent years, leading to significant improvements in motor control both at early and advanced disease stages. More importantly, the need to expand disease management beyond motor symptom control has been recently highlighted and contribution of non-motor features to quality of life is now relevant. Dopamine agonists represent a valid therapeutic option in PD and their effect on non-motor domains like mood or cognition is now acknowledged as a key factor in fully addressing patients' needs. Pramipexole is a well established dopamine agonist that is currently being investigated for its potential disease-modifying effect and action on mood in PD. In this review we will examine factors contributing to treatment decision-making and discuss how a proper balance between motor and non-motor features should be aimed for in approaching PD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies on inhibitory mechanisms assessed by negative priming (NP) paradigms in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) have yielded highly ambiguous results. The present study examined two possible reasons for this heterogeneity: general slowing and anti-Parkinsonian medication. Their effects on identity and location NP and positive priming (PP) were investigated. Twenty medicated PD patients and 20 PD patients after drug withdrawal were compared to 20 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. The influence of PD patients' general slowing on priming effects was statistically controlled. Location NP was found not to be affected by PD, whereas identity NP was reduced in medicated PD patients compared to non-medicated PD patients and healthy controls. At first, identity and location PP appeared to be enhanced in both PD groups. After controlling for general slowing, however, differences between PD patients and healthy controls disappeared. These findings endorse the notion that uncontrolled effects of both, PD-related general slowing and anti-Parkinsonian medication may have contributed to previously conflicting results on priming effects in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Speech variability in groups of speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD) and with Friedreich's ataxia was compared with healthy controls. Speakers repeated the same phrase 20 times at one of two rates (fast or habitual). A non-linear analysis of variability was performed which used some of the principles behind the spatio-temporal index (STI). The STI usually employs variation in lip displacement over repetitions of the same utterance and a linear analysis of such signals is conducted to represent the combined variation in spatial and temporal control. When working with patients, audio measures (here we used speech energy) are preferred over kinematics ones as they are minimally disruptive to speech. Non-linear methods allow spatial variability to be estimated separately from temporal variability. The results are tentatively interpreted as showing that PD speakers were distinguished from healthy control speakers in spatial variability and ataxic speakers were distinguished from controls in temporal variability. These findings are consistent with the speech symptoms reported for these disorders. We conclude that the non-linear analysis using the speech energy measure is worth investigating further as it is potentially revealing of the differences underlying these two pathologies.",

Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related disorder and vascular risk factors potentially might be the main co-morbidity responsible for motor and cognitive impairment. However, only a few studies focused on this problem have been published. The aim of the study was to assess the contribution of vascular risk factors and white matter abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on cognitive impairment in PD patients.\nSixty consecutive patients (M: 35, F: 25), mean age 68.36 years (SD: 7.25, range: 51-81) with diagnosis of idiopathic PD underwent a semi-structured questionnaire on demographics and vascular risks factors, neurological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging (MRI) examinations with quantitative assessment according to the scale by Wahlund et al. According to cognitive status they were divided into 3 groups: without cognitive disability (I, n=17), with mild cognitive impairment (II, n=25) and with dementia (III, n=18).\nThere were no significant differences between groups in terms of the number of vascular risk factors (except for the ischaemic heart disease difference between group I and III) and severity of white matter hyperintensities in MRI studies.\nVascular risk factors along with white matter vascular abnormalities probably do not contribute to cognitive impairment in patients with PD.

    "abstract": "Vertical gaze palsy is a highly relevant clinical sign in parkinsonian syndromes. As the eponymous sign of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), it is one of the core features in the diagnosis of this disease. Recent studies have suggested a further differentiation of PSP in Richardson's syndrome (RS) and PSP-parkinsonism (PSPP). The aim of this study was to search for oculomotor abnormalities in the PSP-P subset of a sample of PSP patients and to compare these findings with those of (i) RS patients, (ii) patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), and (iii) a control group. Twelve cases of RS, 5 cases of PSP-P, and 27 cases of IPD were examined by use of video-oculography (VOG) and compared to 23 healthy normal controls. Both groups of PSP patients (RS, PSP-P) had significantly slower saccades than either IPD patients or controls, whereas no differences in saccadic eye peak velocity were found between the two PSP groups or in the comparison of IPD with controls. RS and PSP-P were also similar to each other with regard to smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), with both groups having significantly lower gain than controls (except for downward pursuit); however, SPEM gain exhibited no consistent difference between PSP and IPD. A correlation between eye movement data and clinical data (Hoehn & Yahr scale or disease duration) could not be observed. As PSP-P patients were still in an early stage of the disease when a differentiation from IPD is difficult on clinical grounds, the clear-cut separation between PSP-P and IPD obtained by measuring saccade velocity suggests that VOG could contribute to the early differentiation between these patient groups.",

    "abstract": "The prognosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been improved with developing anti-parkinsonian agents. Recently the re-evaluation of L-dopa and dopamine agonists is the topic in the world based on focusing non motor side effects of dopamine agonists such as sudden uncontrollable somnolence and valvulopathy in place of motor complication. The development of anti-parkinsonian drugs based on the new mechanism has been progressed such as CEP-1347, AAV-neuturin, AAV-GAD, and AAV-DDC. The most reliable new drug is zonisamide which is originally synthesized in Japan for epilepsy. A nation-wide randomized double blind study showed that Zonisamide improves motor function of advanced PD patients. Long-term efficacy was also shown. The mechanism of zonisamide for PD is the increase of dopamine synthesis and moderate inhibition of monoamine oxydase B activity. Inhibitatory effects of sodium channel and T-type calcium channel may also affects. Zonisamide has neuroprotective effects though inhibition of quinoprotein and increasing the levels of GSH and Mn SOD. Up to now we have no agents with clinically evidenced neuroprotective effects for PD. Base on the results of ELLDOPA study and \"delayed start\" clinical trials the most important concept for neuroprotection may be the early dopaminergic support for the degenerating dopaminergic system.",

    "abstract": "To explore pathogenesis of synucleinopathy including Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, we developed cellular model for synucleinopathy. In this experimental model, alpha-synuclein was overexpressed in SH-SY5Y cells, which were then exposed to mitochondrial toxins. The data thus obtained suggested the followings. (1) By the treatment with rotenone, wild type alpha-synuclein overexpressing cells demonstrated intracellular aggregations, which shared a number of features with Lewy bodies. (2) The aggregate formation of alpha-synuclein may be cytoprotective. (3) The catechol-derived quinones are candidate molecules to facilitate the oligomer formation of a-synuclein. (4) The cells overexpressing S129A mutant showed few aggregations. It is suggested that phosphorylation at serine 129 is essential for aggregate formation. (5) In wild-type alpha-synuclein cells treated with rotenone, unfolded protein response (UPR) markers were induced prior to the induction of mitochondrial disruption and caspase-3 activation. (6) On the other hand, the S129A mutant failed to activate these UPRs. Thus it seems plausible that alpha-synuclein toxicity is dependent on the phosphorylation at S129.",

    "abstract": "The histological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the presence of fibrillar aggregates called Lewy bodies (LBs). LB formation has been considered to be a marker for neuronal degeneration, because neuronal loss is found in the predilection sites for LBs. To date, more than 70 molecules have been identified in LBs, in which alpha-synuclein is a major constituent of LB fibrils. Alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry reveals that diffuse cytoplasmic staining develops into pale bodies via compaction, and that LBs arise from the peripheral portion of pale bodies. Abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein (diffuse cytoplasmic staining, pale bodies and LBs) is found in 10% of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra and more than 50% of those in the locus ceruleus in PD. Recent studies have suggested that oligomers and protofibrils of alpha-synuclein are cytotoxic, and that pale bodies and LBs may represent a cytoprotective mechanism in PD.",

    "abstract": "The year of 2007 was a turning point of the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in Japan. Severe adverse effects of dopamine agonists including valvular heart disease induced by ergots and sudden onset of sleep attacks induced by non-ergots, were disclosed, and treatments with agonists were reassessed. Good news were marketing of ropinirole, a new non-ergot agonist, in December 2006 and entacapone, the first catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor in Japan in April 2007. Having faced these new situations, Japanese Neurological Association has started revising \"the Guideline 2002 for the treatment of Parkinson's disease\". Clinical trials of translational gene therapy for Parkinson's disease with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector are now going on in four approaches: restoring dopamine synthetic capacity, protecting against cell death with trophic factors, interfering with the aberrant protein aggregation, and converting the subthalamic nucleus into an inhibitory, rather than an excitatory, structure. In Japan, gene delivery of the dopamine synthesizing enzyme aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) to the striatum of PD patients is going on in Jichi Medical University. New findings of the causative genes, environmental factors and molecular mechanism of PD have provided with new tools for developing new treatments. The big success of induction of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from fibroblast has given an impact on cell therapy research of PD.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac uptake of meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is specifically reduced in Lewy body disease (LBD). To see pathological basis of the reduced cardiac uptake of MIBG in LBD, we immunohistichemically examined cardiac tissues from patients with LBD, related movement disorders and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In LBD, cardiac sympathetic denervation occurs, which accounts for the reduced cardiac uptake of MIBG. Patients with LBD have Lewy bodies (LBs) in the nervous system, whereas patients with the other neurodegenerative parkinsonism, parkin-associated Parkinson's disease (PD) and AD and have no LBs. Therefore, cardiac sympathetic denervation is closely related to the presence of LBs in a wide range of neurodegenerative processes. We further investigate how a-synuclein aggregates are involved in degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD. Accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system precedes that of neuronal somata or neurites in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and that it heralds centripetal degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD. This chronological and dynamic relationship between alpha-synuclein aggregates and degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system may represent the pathological mechanism underlying a common degenerative process in PD.",

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is caused by compression of median nerve and can occur as a result of repetitive trauma. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of CTS in PD and evaluate the median nerve sonographically.\nFifty-three wrist of 29 patients with PD were included in the study according to Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) clinical stage and divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 29 wrists of patients with mild PD (H&Y stage I-II). The second group consisted of 24 wrists of patients with severe PD (H&Y stage III-IV). Thirty-six wrists of 20 age-matched patients were used as control group. Both of the patients with PD and control group underwent sonography and electromyography (EMG). Axial sonograms of the median nerve were obtained at the level of distal radioulnar joint (level 1) and at the level of pisiform bone in the carpal tunnel (level 2). At each level, the cross-sectional area of the median nerve and flattening ratio were calculated.\nThere was no significant difference for all parameters, except one parameter, between the patients with PD and control group, and also among mild and severe groups of PD and control group (p > 0.05). Interestingly, amplitude of median nerve in the second finger was significantly lower in PD patients than control group within normal limits (p=0.010). Of all wrists of PD patients, 13 (24.4%) have been diagnosed as CTS and 7 (19.4%) control wrists had CTS. Median nerve cross-sectional area of CTS patients were more than 10 mm2 in 6 (46%) wrists of PD patients but in only 1 (14%) control wrist at each level. Although it was not statistically significant, there was higher cross-sectional area at each level in patients with severe PD (level 1: 10.43+/-2.30 mm2, level 2: 10.35+/-3.19 mm2) than patients with mild PD (level 1: 9.93+/-2.61 mm2, level 2: 9.51+/-2.83 mm2) and control group (level 1: 9.69+/-3.19 mm2, level 2: 9.07+/-3.61 mm2).\nPD may pose a risk for the development of CTS due to the repetitive movement of tremor. Although sonography is not an ideal method of diagnosis for CTS, it may take our attention for indicating CTS in patients with PD especially in severe ones.",

Providing a continuous supply of dopamine to the striatum in an attempt to improve the treatment of motor symptoms using enzymes in the dopamine synthesis and machinery is one approach. Alternatively, there are tools which may serve to both protect and encourage outgrowth of surviving neurons using growth factors or to directly replace lost innervation by transplantation of primary tissue or stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons.

    "abstract": "To examine Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) performance in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with \"normal\" global cognition according to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.\nA cross-sectional comparison of the MoCA and the MMSE.\nTwo movement disorders centers at the University of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\nA convenience sample of 131 patients with idiopathic PD who were screened for cognitive and psychiatric complications.\nSubjects were administered the MoCA and MMSE, and only subjects defined as having a normal age- and education-adjusted MMSE score were included in the analyses (N=100). As previously recommended in patients without PD, a MoCA score less than 26 was used to indicate the presence of at least mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nMean MMSE and MoCA scores+/-standard deviation were 28.8+/-1.1 and 24.9+/-3.1, respectively. More than half (52.0%) of subjects with normal MMSE scores had cognitive impairment according to their MoCA score. Impairments were seen in numerous cognitive domains, including memory, visuospatial and executive abilities, attention, and language. Predictors of cognitive impairment on the MoCA using univariate analyses were male sex, older age, lower educational level, and greater disease severity; older age was the only predictor in a multivariate model.\nApproximately half of patients with PD with a normal MMSE score have cognitive impairment based on the recommended MoCA cutoff score. These results suggest that MCI is common in PD and that the MoCA is a more sensitive instrument than the MMSE for its detection.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and its association with intellectual decline in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) remain unclear. To identify the role of CAA in iPD dementia the prevalence and severity of CAA were investigated, with particular respect to changes in vessel wall structure. Twenty-eight autopsy Parkinsonian brains and fourteen age-matched controls, post-mortem revised histopathologically for the presence of alpha-synuclein and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type pathology, using standardized clinico-neuropathological criteria, underwent further investigation. Histological, immunohistochemical staining methods with antibodies to amyloid beta-peptide, alpha-actin, collagen III, collagen IV and CD34 as well as ultrastructural methods were used. The findings showed that the prevalence of CAA in the iPD cohort was higher (53%) than in controls (28%). CAA occurred more frequently in the iPD+AD (70%) sub-set than in the iPD-AD (44%) one. The progression of CAA was differentiated, with predominance of mild stage. Diminished smooth muscle actin and collagen IV expression in the vascular media with concomitant collagen III positive immunoreactivity in the intima were observed only in very severe CAA. Ultrastructural assay revealed degenerative changes in vessel smooth muscle cells and thickening of their basement membrane with the focal accumulation of amyloid fibres and fibrillar collagen in both iPD -AD and iPD+AD cases, but the most severe CAA-type changes were visible in the iPD+AD sub-set. The same type of immunoreactivity (Abeta42 positive and Abeta40 positive) of arterial CAA and parenchymal neuritic plaques, as well as capillary CAA and diffuse plaques (Abeta42 positive and Abeta40 negative), may indicate pathogenic similarities and differences between both types of degenerative changes on the one hand and time-different changes or local different processing of amyloid precursor protein on the other.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. People with PD, their families, scientists, health care providers, and the general public are increasingly interested in identifying environmental contributors to PD risk.\nIn June 2007, a multidisciplinary group of experts gathered in Sunnyvale, California, USA, to assess what is known about the contribution of environmental factors to PD.\nWe describe the conclusions around which they came to consensus with respect to environmental contributors to PD risk. We conclude with a brief summary of research needs.\nPD is a complex disorder, and multiple different pathogenic pathways and mechanisms can ultimately lead to PD. Within the individual there are many determinants of PD risk, and within populations, the causes of PD are heterogeneous. Although rare recognized genetic mutations are sufficient to cause PD, these account for < 10% of PD in the U.S. population, and incomplete penetrance suggests that environmental factors may be involved. Indeed, interplay among environmental factors and genetic makeup likely influences the risk of developing PD. There is a need for further understanding of how risk factors interact, and studying PD is likely to increase understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we bring out modern methods that are potential in analysing differences in the dynamic surface electromyographic (EMG) and acceleration measurements between patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy persons. These methods are the correlation dimension of EMG, the recurrence rate of EMG, the power of acceleration and the sample entropy of acceleration. In this study, these methods were used to extract features from surface EMG and acceleration recordings measured during elbow flexion and extension movements. The extracted features were used to form high-dimensional feature vectors and the dimensionality of these vectors was then reduced by using the principal component approach. Finally, the feature vectors were discriminated between subjects by using the principal components. The discrimination power of the presented approach was tested with EMG and acceleration data measured from 46 patients with PD (on-medication) and 59 healthy controls. Discrimination results showed that the present method was able to discriminate dynamic EMG and acceleration recordings between patients with PD and healthy controls. Therefore, dynamic surface EMG and acceleration measurements may have potential in the objective and quantitative assessment and diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "The cortical sources of both the basic and first 'harmonic' frequency of Parkinsonian tremor are addressed in this paper. The power and coherence was estimated using the multitaper method for EEG and EMG data from 6 Parkinsonian patients with a classical rest tremor. The Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS) was used to find the coherent sources in the brain. Before hand this method was validated for the application to the EEG by showing in 3 normal subjects that rhythmic stimuli (1-5Hz) to the median nerve leads to almost identical coherent sources for the basic and first harmonic frequency in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex which is the biologically plausible result. In all the Parkinson patients the corticomuscular coherence was also present in the basic and the first harmonic frequency of the tremor. However, the source for the basic frequency was close to the frontal midline and the first harmonic frequency was in the region of premotor and sensory motor cortex on the contralateral side for all the patients. Thus the generation of these two oscillations involves different cortical areas and possibly follows different pathways to the periphery.",

    "abstract": "This study aims at applying an artificial neural network for the evaluation of the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on Parkinson disease (PD) patients with and without medication. A sample of 15 PD patients who have undergone STN DBS were evaluated under four test conditions: medication off and stimulation off (mof-sof), medication off and stimulation on (mof-son), medication on and stimulation off (mon-sof) and medication on and stimulation on (mon-son). A control group with 30 subjects was also evaluated. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and the first six principal component scores (PC score) were obtained in both groups. Those PCs scores were used as input in a probabilistic neural network (PNN). PNN presented satisfactory classification performance in the separation of controls and PD with 90.1% accuracy, 69.2% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The stimulation mof-son and mon-son conditions presented better results compared to mon-sof. In the mof-son condition, 41.7% were classified as normal, while further enhancement (63.3%) was given by the mon-son condition. These results indicated the potentiality of PNN to quantitatively evaluate treatment effects. Furthermore, STN DBS shows improvement on vGRF pattern in PD patients, most substantially when used with medication.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is the classification of Spatial-Temporal Image of Plantar pressure (STIP) among normal step and the patients step of Parkinson disease. For this, we created a new image data, STIP, that have information of the change of plantar pressure during heel to toe motion (i.e., contain spatial and temporal information for plantar pressure). To get STIP, the walking of 21 patients with Parkinson disease and 17 age-matched healthy subjects were recorded and analyzed using in-shoe dynamic pressure measuring system with comfort walking. For feature extraction of gait, we applied Principal component analysis (PCA) to STIP and calculated weights of STIP on each principal components. Then, we build hard margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for gait recognition and test of generalization performance using normalized weights on PCs of STIP. SVM result indicated an overall accuracy of 91.73% by the RBF(Radial Basis Function) kernel function. These results demonstrate considerable potential in applying SVMs in gait classification for many applications.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a video based method to quantify drug induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Dyskinetic movement in standard clinical videos of patients is analyzed by tracking landmark points on the video frames using non-rigid image registration. The novel application of Point Distribution Models (PDM) allows geometric variations and covariations of the landmark points to be captured from each video sequence. The PDM parameters represent quantifiable information that can be used to rate dyskinesia effectively, analogously to a neurologist's strategy of assessing the movement of multiple body parts simultaneously to effectively rate dyskinesia. A heuristic decision function is then developed using the PDM parameters to quantify the severity of the dyskinesia. The severity score using our decision function showed a high correlation to the dyskinesia rating of a neurologist on the corresponding patient videos.",

    "abstract": "Spatial temporal plantar pressure patterns measured with sheet-shaped pressure sensor were investigated to extract features of gait in Parkinson's disease. Both six subjects of Parkinson's disease (PD) and elderly fourteen normal control subjects were asked to execute usual walking on the pressure sensor sheets. Candidate features were step length, step time, gait velocity and transition of center of pressure to foot axis direction. The step length and gait velocity were smaller in PD subjects than those in normal subjects. Time of step cycle in three PD subjects were longer than that in normal subjects while the times of other PD subjects were similar to those of control subjects. The length from heel contact to toe off within one footprint was small in the subjects with short step length. Such possibility was indicated that Parkinson's disease in gait could be separated from normal subjects by these features.",

    "abstract": "Movements in people with Parkinson's disease are often hypometric, although we have found that this was not the case in an experimental visually-guided reaching task. We wished to explore our hypotheses that (1) people with Parkinson's disease produce hypometric primary submovements but(2) are able to use visual feedback to accurately reach the target in a single overall movement, and (3) this effect may be greater in memory-guided tasks in which an internal representation of the target location is used instead of a fixation-centered representation of the target.Visually- and memory-guided reaching movements were examined in 22 people with mild to moderate severity Parkinson's disease on medication, along with age-matched and sex-matched controls. Primary submovements were extracted from 5149 movements using a method based upon zero crossings of jerk(3rd derivative of position), with several additional criteria to minimize the detection of submovements due to noise or tremor.There was no difference in the end position of the overall reaching movement between the two groups, although the movement was smaller in the memory-guided task. In contrast,the gain of the primary submovement was smaller in the Parkinson's disease group than the control group, with this difference being greater on the memory-guided task. There was no task effect on the primary submovement gain in the control group.Our results show that the underlying primary submovement in visually-guided movements in people with Parkinson's disease is hypometric, and that the degree of hypometria is even greater in memory-guided movements.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is classified as a progressively degenerative movement disorder, affecting approximately 0.2% of the population and resulting in decreased performance in a wide variety of activities of daily living. Motivated by needs associated with the conduct of multi-center clinical trials, early detection, and the optimization of routine management of individuals with PD, we have developed a three-tiered approach to evaluation of PD and other neurologic diseases/disorders. One tier is characterized as 'web-based evaluation', consisting of objective performance capacity tests and subjective questionnaires that target history and symptom evaluation. Here, we present the initial evaluation of three representative, self-administered, objective, web-based performance capacity tests (simple visual-hand response speed, rapid alternating movement quality, and upper extremity neuromotor channel capacity). Twenty-one subjects (13 with PD, 8 without neurologic disease) were evaluated. Generally good agreement was obtained with lab-based tests executed with an experienced test administrator. We conclude that objective performance capacity testing is a feasible component of a web-based evaluation for PD, providing a sufficient level of fidelity to be useful.",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBNs) have recently been applied to infer functional connectivity between brain regions of interested (ROIs), and to identify the existence of connectivity abnormality in Parkinson's Disease (PD). In addition to PBNs' promising application in inferring significant brain connections, PBN modeling for brain ROIs also enables researchers to study dynamic activities of the system under stochastic condition, gaining essential information regarding asymptotic behaviors of ROIs for potential therapeutic intervention in PD. In this paper, we will present a PBN model for fMRI analysis and study its asymptotic behavior. The PBN results indicate significant differences in asymptotic behaviors between PD patients and normal subjects. Hypothesizing the observed feature states for normal subject as the desired functional states, we further explore possible methods to manipulate the dynamical network behavior of PD patients in the favor of the desired states from the view of random perturbation as well as intervention.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder marked by movement impairment caused by a selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The mechanism for dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in PD is not completely clear, but it is believed that oxidative and nitrosative stress plays an important role during the pathogenesis of PD. This notion is supported by various studies that several indices of oxidative and nitrosative stress are increased in PD patients. In recent years, different pathways that are known to be important for neuronal survival have been shown to be affected by oxidative and nitrosative stress. Apart from the well-known oxidative free radicals induced protein nitration, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, increasing evidence also suggests that some neuroprotective pathways can be affected by nitric oxide through S-nitrosylation. In addition, the selective dopaminergic neurodegeneration suggests that generation of oxidative stress associated with the metabolism of dopamine is an important contributor. Thorough understanding of how oxidative stress can contribute to the pathogenesis of PD will help formulate potential therapy for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disorder in the future.",

    "abstract": "Ceruloplasmin functions as a ferroxidase in iron metabolism. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by an increase in brain iron. We postulated that lower circulating ceruloplasmin levels in PD would result in rapid brain iron accumulation and an earlier age of onset. Consecutive PD patients were separated into subgroups with younger (< or = 60 years, n = 62) and older ages of onset (> 60, n = 29), and compared to non-PD controls (n = 40). A one-way ANOVA comparing ceruloplasmin levels showed a very robust effect [F(2,128) = 46.4, p < 1e-99]. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that the younger-onset PD subgroup [22.0 mg/dl +/- 6.5 SD] had a lower mean ceruloplasmin level compared to the older-onset PD subgroup [35.7 +/- 10.4] and controls [35.6 +/- 8.4], whose levels did not differ from each other. Ceruloplasmin levels showed robust correlation with age of onset in all 91 PD patients [r = 0.56, r(2) = 0.31, p < 0.0001] but not in the non-PD controls [r = 0.16, r(2) = 0.03, not significant]. Mode of onset and duration of PD showed no relationship to ceruloplasmin. Serum copper and ferritin, available in most patients, did not differ between the PD subgroups. Younger-onset PD patients have significantly lower levels of serum ceruloplasmin compared to those with older-onset PD. Ceruloplasmin may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of younger-onset PD patients and merits further study.",

    "abstract": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has shown promise in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders of basal ganglia origin such us Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we investigated the neurorestorative effect of controlled GDNF delivery using biodegradable microspheres in an animal model with partial dopaminergic lesion. Microspheres were loaded with N-glycosylated recombinant GDNF and prepared using the Total Recirculation One-Machine System (TROMS). GDNF-loaded microparticles were unilaterally injected into the rat striatum by stereotaxic surgery two weeks after a unilateral partial 6-OHDA nigrostriatal lesion. Animals were tested for amphetamine-induced rotational asymmetry at different times and were sacrificed two months after microsphere implantation for immunohistochemical analysis. The putative presence of serum IgG antibodies against rat glycosylated GDNF was analyzed for addressing safety issues. The results demonstrated that GDNF-loaded microspheres, improved the rotational behavior induced by amphetamine of the GDNF-treated animals together with an increase in the density of TH positive fibers at the striatal level. The developed GDNF-loaded microparticles proved to be suitable to release biologically active GDNF over up to 5 weeks in vivo. Furthermore, none of the animals developed antibodies against GDNF demonstrating the safety of glycosylated GDNF use.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become an effective treatment option for managing severe Parkinson's disease (PD). However, evidence is accumulating that DBS of target sites like the subthalamic nucleus (STN) can result in unintended cognitive effects that lie beyond motor control. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether changes in executive task performance after chronic DBS might be predominantly associated with the stimulation of only one hemisphere. Eight patients with PD who had undergone DBS treatment of the STN were selected to participate in the study. Using a repeated measurements design, they underwent a neuropsychological examination under unilateral left- and right-sided stimulation in order to investigate laterality effects in their performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. All patients showed a significant improvement in motor symptoms postoperatively. Selected aspects of executive task performance were compromised under left- when compared to right-sided stimulation. Performance measures were unrelated to demographic, neurological, and behavioral characteristics of the patients. Findings are consistent with the emerging evidence that the STN is not only involved in motor control, but also participates in functions of the cognitive domain. Moreover, results raise the possibility that the left and right hemisphere might differ in their vulnerability to tolerate side effects on executive functions of DBS treatment. Potential consequences for future research questions and the management of cognitive side effects are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Treatment aims in IPD include the provision of symptomatic relief reduction of functional disability, halting or slowing of the neurodegenerative process, and the prevention of long-term complications by proper initiation of therapy. At present, pharmacotherapeutic strategies allow the amelioration of motor symptoms of IPD only, whereas non-motor manifestations are not helped by dopamine replacement strategies. In addition, levodopa-induced fluctuation and dyskinesia are still challenging, particularly in long-term treatment. Despite advances in pharmacotherapy that have improved quality of life for these patients, the mortality rate remains largely unchanged. Sustained interest in IPD will hopefully allow increased funding of research to develop new and better treatments.",

Agents that selectively disrupt or destroy catecholaminergic systems, such as reserpine, methamphetamine, 6-hydroxydopamine and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine, have been used to develop PD models and to study the animal behavior like catalepsy, akinesia, swim-test, etc. The major apprehension while working with these chemicals is their irreversible neuro-toxic effect. Haloperidol is a classical antipsychotic drug, which produces extra-pyrimidal Parkinson's symptoms (EPS). Measuring catalepsy and akinesia in the treated mice monitored the haloperidol-induced EPS. Alternatively, swimming disability was tested as a new parameter to monitor haloperidol-induced EPS. The results showed that the restoration of swimming disability in haloperidol-induced L-dopa and caffeine pre-treated mice could be used as pre-clinical model to study PD.",

    "abstract": "The presence of high frequency discharge neurons with long periods of silence or \"pauses\" in the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) is a unique identifying feature of this nucleus. Prior studies have demonstrated that pause characteristics reflect synaptic inputs into GPe. We hypothesized that GPe pause characteristics should distinguish movement disorders whose basal ganglia network abnormalities are different. We examined pause characteristics in 224 GPe units in patients with primary generalized dystonia, Parkinson's disease (PD), and secondary dystonia, undergoing single unit microelectrode recording for DBS placement in the awake state. Pauses in neuronal discharge were identified using the Poisson surprise method. Mean pause length in primary dystonia (606.8373.3) was higher than in PD (557.4366.6) (p<0.05). Interpause interval (IPI) was lower in primary dystonia (2331.63874.1) than PD (3646.45894.5) (p<0.01), and mean pause frequency was higher in primary dystonia (0.140.10) than PD (0.070.12) (p<0.01). Comparison of pause characteristics in primary versus secondary generalized dystonia revealed a significantly longer mean pause length in primary (606.8373.3) than in secondary dystonia (495.6236.5) (p<0.01). IPI was shorter in primary (2331.6+/-3874.1) than in secondary dystonia (3484.5+/-3981.6) (p<0.01). The results show that pause characteristics recorded in the awake human GPe distinguish primary dystonia from Parkinson's disease and secondary dystonia. The differences may reflect increased phasic input from striatal D2 receptor positive cells in primary dystonia, and are consistent with a recent model proposing that GPe provides capacity scaling for cortical input.",

    "abstract": "For more than 50 years, Parkinson's disease (PD) has been conceptualized as a product of nigro-striatal dopamine (NSD) system degeneration. In spite of a growing body of evidence depicting the mammalian brain as an interrelated complexity of circuitous systems, dopamine (DA) deficiency of the NSD is still regarded as the main problem, with DA replacement being the purpose of therapeutic intervention. For at least 191 years circadian involvement in various aspects of PD, including depression and insomnia, has been recognized as an integral part of the symptom matrix of PD and yet attempts to elucidate the involvement of this system is uncharted territory. The present review attempts a major reorganization of mammalian brain into a coordinated complex involving the NSD and the retinal hypothalamic tract (RHT) as the primary systems involved in the retino-diencephalic/mesencephalic-pineal (RDMP) axis. Secondary systems including the lateral hypothalamus (LH), the area postraema (AP) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) also form an integral part of this system as they have been shown to be either intimately related to the primary systems of the RDMP axis or have been shown to be significantly involved in the expression and treatment of PD. A large volume of evidence suggests that the RDMP axis is activated during the course of PD and during therapeutic intervention. Four types of neurotoxicity associated with melatonin are identified and the susceptibility of various parts of the RDMP axis to undergo neuropathological change, the tendency for melatonin to induce PD-like behavioural toxicity, and the relationship of this to PD symptomotology are described. This includes adverse effects of melatonin on motor function, hypotension, the adjuvant use of benzodiazepines, depression, insomnia, body weight regulation and various biochemical effects of melatonin administration: all problems currently facing the proposal to introduce melatonin as an adjuvant. It is suggested further that traditional DA replacement may well work by exerting its effect upon the circadian system, rather than simply replacing deficient DA. Activation of the circadian function by antagonizing melatonin with bright light not only has therapeutic value in treating the primary symptoms of PD but it shares a common mechanism with L-dopa in reducing the occurrence of seborrheic dermatitis. Concepts at the centre of understanding pineal function in PD, including pineal calcification, melatonin deficiency, symptomatic versus protective features of melatonin and antioxidative effects, are explained in a counterintuitive context. Intriguing propositions including the role of the retina in the aetiology of PD and that the nigra functions as a retina in this disorder are presented with the intention to provide a new understanding of the underlying compromised function in PD and to provide new treatment strategies. For the first time, abundant evidence is presented describing PD as an endocrine disorder of melatonin hyperplasia. The role of circadian interventive therapies and internal desynchrony in the aetiology and progression of PD provides a new direction for understanding the underlying physiology of a disease which is currently in a state of impasse and provides new hope for those who suffer from its debilitating effects.",

    "abstract": "It has been over forty years since dopamine neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra and Lewy body formation within surviving cells were described as the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although research in the intervening decades particularly in the last twenty-five years has yielded a variety of robust animal models and invaluable mechanistic insights into PD-associated neuronal dysfunction and cell death, therapeutic agents have not been forthcoming to alter the course of PD. Recently, the screening of experimental therapeutics for PD has been pursued through the use of genetically tractable models, such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This simple worm remarkably recapitulates the basic cellular and molecular pathways associated with PD, is amenable to facile genetic methods, and through the use of high-throughput screening technologies, provides powerful new opportunities for the in vivo identification of therapeutic targets. In this review we briefly describe the utility that the C. elegans model system may have for PD drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Evidence exists that action observation activates the same cortical motor areas that are involved in the performance of the observed actions. An untested idea is whether subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia play a role in the coding of other people's actions. This study used kinematics to examine how Parkinson's disease patients react to the observation of an action which they were subsequently requested to perform. In each trial a model and an observer, which could be either a Parkinsonian patient or a neurologically healthy participant, were seated facing each other. The model was requested to grasp a stimulus (action condition), to perform a kicking action towards the stimulus (control-action condition), and to not perform any action (control condition). The task for the observer was always to grasp the stimulus after having watched the model performing her task. Results show that Parkinson's disease patients did show facilitation effects only when the model was a Parkinsonian patient. Whereas, neurologically healthy participants' movements were facilitated following the observation of either the Parkinsonian and the healthy model grasping the object. No facilitation effects were found for both the control and the control-action conditions. The fact that normal visuomotor priming takes place in PD patients when the observed action matches with what they can perform suggests that basal ganglia might not be necessary for it. However, damage to the basal ganglia might become relevant when such a match does not occur. In such circumstances, a damage to these structures might prevent the deployment of additional activity which might be necessary to influence cortical functions related to the representations of observed actions.",

    "abstract": "Although previous studies have shown pointing errors and abnormal multijoint coordination in seated subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) who cannot view their arm, the extent to which subjects with PD have problems using proprioception to coordinate equilibrium maintenance and goal-oriented task execution has not been adequately investigated. If a common motor program controls voluntary arm pointing movements and the accompanying postural adjustments, then impairments of proprioceptive integration in subjects with PD should have similar effects on pointing and body center of mass (CoM) control with eyes closed. Ten standing subjects with PD (OFF-medication) and 10 age-matched control (CTR) subjects pointed to a target with their eyes closed and open. Although pointing accuracy was not significantly different between groups, body CoM displacements were reduced in subjects with PD, but not in CTR, when eyes were closed. In addition, with eyes closed, PD subjects showed reduced temporal coupling between pointing and CoM velocity profiles and reduced spatial coupling between pointing and CoM endpoints. This poor coupling with eyes closed could be related to the PD subjects' increased jerkiness of CoM displacements. The different effects of eye closure between CTR and PD subjects on the CoM displacements, but not pointing accuracy, are consistent with separate motor programs for the pointing and postural components of this task. Furthermore, the decoupling between the two movement components in subjects with PD when they could not use vision, suggests that the basal ganglia are involved in the integration of proprioceptive information for posture-movement coordination.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed systems model of Parkinson's disease (PD), developed utilizing a pragmatic application of biochemical systems theory (BST) intended to assist experimentalists in the study of system behavior. This approach utilizes relative values as a reasonable initial estimate for BST and provides a theoretical means of applying numerical solutions to qualitative and semi-quantitative understandings of cellular pathways and mechanisms. The approach allows for the simulation of human disease through its ability to organize and integrate existing information about metabolic pathways without having a full quantitative description of those pathways, so that hypotheses about individual processes may be tested in a systems environment. Incorporating this method, the PD model describes alpha-synuclein aggregation as mediated by dopamine metabolism, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and lysosomal degradation, allowing for the examination of dynamic pathway interactions and the evaluation of possible toxic mechanisms in the aggregation process. Four system perturbations: elevated alpha-synuclein aggregation, impaired dopamine packaging, increased neurotoxins, and alpha-synuclein overexpression, were analyzed for correlation to qualitative PD system hypotheses present in the literature, with the model demonstrating a high level of agreement with these hypotheses. Additionally, various PD treatment methods, including levadopa and monoamine oxidase inhibition (MAOI) therapy, were applied to the disease models to examine their effects on the system. Future additions and refinements to the model may further the understanding of the emergent behaviors of the disease, helping in the identification of system sensitivities and possible therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Age-related loss of melanized nigral neurons reported in the British Caucasians is not observed in Asian Indian, American and French adults. In the Americans, loss of dopaminergic phenotype occurs from midlife, without frank neurodegeneration. Here, we investigated whether nigral dopaminergic neurons in Asian Indians are lost with age or undergo morphological or biochemical dysfunction. Using unbiased stereology we estimated volume, number of melanized, borderline/non-melanized (n=34, 28 gestational weeks to 80 years) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-Nurr1 co-labeled neurons (n=32, 28 gestational weeks to 80 years) in substantia nigra pars compacta. We quantified Nurr1 and TH proteins by immunoblotting (n=18, 28 gestational weeks to 69 years) and apoptotic neurons by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Nuclear and soma size was estimated by morphometry. There was no age-related decline in volume, neuronal density, neuronal numbers and TH-Nurr1 co-labeled neurons. TH and Nurr1 protein expression remained stable. Lack of TUNEL-TH co-labeled cells confirmed absence of neuronal apoptosis. The neuronal size remained unaltered. Our findings of preserved nigral dopaminergic neurons suggest no age-related loss of nigral function in Asian Indians, unlike the Americans. This may explain the lower incidence of Parkinson's disease in Asian Indians.",

    "abstract": "The pre-synaptic protein alpha-synuclein is a key player in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Misfolded alpha-synuclein protofibrils accumulate and serve as seed structures that cause numerous proteins in the cytoplasm of neuronal cells to aggregate into so-called Lewy bodies. Furthermore, both missense mutations and multiplications of the SNCA gene lead to autosomal dominant forms of familial PD. However, the exact biological role of alpha-synuclein in normal brains remains elusive. To gain more insight into the normal function of this protein, we evaluated changes in whole genome expression in dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) caused by reductions of 90% in alpha-synuclein RNA levels and of 59% in alpha-synuclein protein levels as a result of RNA interference. The expression of 361 genes was altered at least+/-1.5-fold by the RNA interference, with 82 up-regulated and 279 down-regulated. The differentially expressed gene products are involved in the regulation of transcription, cell cycle, protein degradation, apoptosis, neurogenesis, and lipid metabolism. To examine the influence of SNCA down-regulation by RNAi on apoptosis, we performed cell death assays using different stress triggers. The changes observed in the expression profile of dopaminergic neuronal cells following reduction of SNCA expression warrant studies to investigate the role of signaling cascades in familial and idiopathic PD.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces ER stress, activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). Recent evidence has suggested the relationship between UPR and dopaminergic neuronal cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, it remains unclear whether it makes sense to modulate UPR, to mitigate the progression of PD. In this study, we investigated a role of the IRE1 alpha-XBP1 pathway in the survival of dopaminergic cells, under stress induced by PD-related insults. The exogenous expression of the active-form XBP1 (XBP1s) protein had protective effects against cell death induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) and proteasome inhibitors. Moreover, adenoviral XBP1s expression significantly suppressed the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the mouse model of PD, as induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). These results demonstrate that the enhancement of XBP1 could be a novel PD therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence has shown that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) may play important roles in controlling neuronal survival or cell apoptosis within the central nervous system in development, and in pathological or neural injury. Recent studies have further revealed that p75NTR acts as a \"molecular signal switch\" that determines cell death or survival by three processes. First, pro-nerve growth factor (proNGF) triggers cell apoptosis by its high affinity binding to p75NTR, while NGF induces neuronal survival with low-affinity binding. Second, p75NTR mediates cell death by combining with co-receptor sortilin, whereas it promotes neuronal survival through combination with proNGF. Third, release of the intracellular domain chopper or cleavaged \"short p75NTR\" can independently initiate neuronal apoptosis. We have identified the cell self-destructive proNGF-p75NTR-sortilin signalling apparatus assembled in ventral tier dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, suggesting that p75NTR signalling might be involved in selective cell death mechanisms of substantia nigra neurons or disease progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, experimental manipulation of p75NTR benefited cell survival of cholinergic or motor neurons and improved disease progression of the neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The proNGF-p75NTR-sortilin signalling complex may thus provide new target for neuroprotection of substantia nigra neurons and the therapeutic treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Reliable and well-validated biomarkers for PD to identify individuals \"at risk\" before motor symptoms, accurately diagnose individuals at the threshold of clinical PD, and monitor PD progression throughout its course would dramatically accelerate research into both PD cause and therapeutics. Biomarkers offer the potential to provide a window onto disease mechanism, potentially generating therapeutic targets for disease. In particular, biomarkers enable investigation of the premotor period of PD before typical symptoms are manifest, but while degeneration has already begun. Given the multiple genetic causes for PD already identified, the marked variability in the loss of dopaminergic markers measured by imaging at motor symptom onset and the clear heterogeneity of clinical symptoms in PD onset and clinical progression, it is likely many biomarkers with a focus ranging from clinical symptoms to PD pathobiology to molecular genetic mechanisms will be necessary to fully map PD risk and progression. Biomarkers are also critical in new drug development for PD, both in early validation studies to assess drug dosing and to determine drug penetrance into the brain, and in later efficacy studies to complement PD clinical outcomes. During the past two decades, much progress has been made in identifying and assessing PD biomarkers, but as yet, no fully validated biomarker for PD is currently available. Nonetheless, there is increasing evidence that molecular genetics, focused -omic (proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic) assessment of blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and advanced in vivo brain imaging will provide critical clues to assist in the diagnosis and medical management of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Functional models of Parkinson's disease (PD) have led to effective treatment for the motor symptoms. Toxin-based models, such as the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated primate, have resulted in novel dopaminergic therapies and new therapeutic strategies. They have also been used to study processes underlying motor complications, particularly dyskinesia, and for developing pharmacological approaches to dyskinesia avoidance and suppression. Symptomatic models of PD based on nigrostriatal degeneration have a high degree of predictability of clinical effect of dopaminergic drugs on motor symptoms in humans. However, the effects of nondopaminergic drugs in these models do not translate effectively into clinical efficacy. Newer experimental models of PD have attempted to reproduce the pathogenic process and to involve all areas of the brain pathologically affected in humans. In addition, models showing progressive neuronal death have been sought but so far unsuccessfully. Pathogenic modeling has been attempted using a range of toxins, as well as through the use of transgenic models of gene defects in familial PD and mutant rodent strains. However, there are still no accepted progressive models of PD that mimic the processes known to occur during cell death and that result in the motor deficits, pathology, biochemistry, and drug responsiveness as seen in humans. Nevertheless, functional models of PD have led to many advances in treating the motor symptoms of the disorder, and we have been fortunate to have them available. They are an important reason the treatment of PD is so much better compared with treatments for related illnesses.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease is reviewed in light of recent advances in the understanding of the functional organization of the basal ganglia (BG). Current emphasis is placed on the parallel interactions between corticostriatal and corticosubthalamic afferents on the one hand, and internal feedback circuits modulating BG output through the globus pallidus pars interna and substantia nigra pars reticulata on the other. In the normal BG network, the globus pallidus pars externa emerges as a main regulatory station of output activity. In the parkinsonian state, dopamine depletion shifts the BG toward inhibiting cortically generated movements by increasing the gain in the globus pallidus pars externa-subthalamic nucleus-globus pallidus pars interna network and reducing activity in \"direct\" cortico-putaminal-globus pallidus pars interna projections. Standard pharmacological treatments do not mimic the normal physiology of the dopaminergic system and, therefore, fail to restore a functional balance between corticostriatal afferents in the so-called direct and indirect pathways, leading to the development of motor complications. This review emphasizes the concept that the BG can no longer be understood as a \"go-through\" station in the control of movement, behavior, and emotions. The growing understanding of the complexity of the normal BG and the changes induced by DA depletion should guide the development of more efficacious therapies for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The experimental field of restorative neurology continues to advance with implantation of cells or transfer of genes to treat patients with neurological disease. Both strategies have generated a consensus that demonstrates their capacity for structural and molecular brain modification in the adult brain. However, both approaches have yet to successfully address the complexities to make such novel therapeutic modalities work in the clinic. Prior experimental cell transplantation to patients with PD utilized dissected pieces of fetal midbrain tissue, containing mixtures of cells and neuronal types, as donor cells. Stem cell and progenitor cell biology provide new opportunities for selection and development of large batches of specific therapeutic cells. This may allow for cell composition analysis and dosing to optimize the benefit to an individual patient. The biotechnology used for cell and gene therapy for treatment of neurological disease may eventually be as advanced as today's pharmaceutical drug-related design processes. Current gene therapy phase 1 safety trials for PD include the delivery of a growth factor (neurturin via the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor) and a transmitter enzyme (glutamic acid decarboxylase and aromatic acid decarboxylase). Many new insights from cell biological and molecular studies provide opportunities to selectively express or suppress factors relevant to neuroprotection and improved function of neurons involved in PD. Future gene and cell therapies are likely to coexist with classic pharmacological therapies because their use can be tailored to individual patients' underlying disease process and need for neuroprotective or restorative interventions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Traditionally, attention has focused on the motor symptomatology of PD, but it is now appreciated that the nonmotor symptoms affecting neuropsychiatric, sleep, autonomic, and sensory domains occur in up to 88% of PD patients and can be an important source of disability. Nonmotor manifestations of PD play a significant role in the impairment of disease-related quality of life. The cause of nonmotor manifestations of PD is multifactorial, but to a large extent, these manifestations are related to the nature of the neurodegenerative process and the widespread nondopaminergic neuropathological changes associated with the disease. Recognition of nonmotor disability is essential not only for ascertaining the functional status of patients but also for better appreciating the nature of the neurodegenerative process in PD. In addition, a number of nonmotor manifestations can precede the onset of motor symptoms in PD and can be used as screening tools allowing for early disease identification and for trials of possible disease-modifying interventions. This article reviews depression, sleep, and autonomic dysfunction in PD.",

    "abstract": "The period immediately before the onset of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) often has a recognizable phenotype with features including autonomic dysfunction and impaired olfaction. Subclinical dopaminergic cell loss can also be detected at this time using molecular imaging techniques. A greater recognition of the features of premotor PD and improvements in screening technologies have opened the possibility of predictive testing for PD. In addition to molecular imaging of the dopamine system, screening tests that can potentially be used to identify the physiological abnormalities in premotor PD include olfactory testing, imaging of the sympathetic innervation of the heart, transcranial ultrasound, and genetic testing for mutations known to cause hereditary PD. All of these technologies have trade-offs as screening tests for accuracy, availability, and costs. Using these tests in combination may produce a more favorable combination of reasonable cost and accuracy than using any single test alone. Ultimately, the value of screening for PD depends on development of neuroprotective treatments for PD that would create an imperative for early identification and treatment.",

    "abstract": "The development of a neuroprotective therapy that slows, stops, or reverses neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) is the single most important unresolved issue in the management of this disorder. Current therapies provide effective control of symptoms, particularly in the early stages of the disease, but disease progression is associated with the development of \"nondopaminergic\" features such as postural instability, falling, and dementia that are not adequately controlled with existing medications. There are many promising candidate neuroprotective agents based on pathological and laboratory studies, but to date, it has not been possible to determine that any drug has a disease-modifying effect in PD. Obstacles to the development of a neuroprotective therapy in PD include: (1) uncertainty as to the precise cause of cell death in PD and what to target; (2) the lack of an animal model of PD that precisely reflects the etiopathogenesis of the disease, the pattern of dopaminergic and nondopaminergic pathology, and its chronic, progressive nature; (3) determination of the correct dose to use in clinical trials; and (4) delineation of a clinical end point that is an accurate measure of the underlying disease and is not confounded by potential symptomatic effects of a study intervention. New developments in understanding the cause of the disease, in the development of animal models of PD, and in clinical trial methodology will hopefully hasten the resolution of these problems.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence to challenge the traditional view that the initiation of drug treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) should be delayed until the patient has significant disability such as to affect work or social function. Firstly, to delay treatment sentences the patient to protracted impairment of quality of life that could be improved by therapy. Secondly, there is evidence to support the notion that earlier rather than later initiation of treatment leads to better long term motor benefit. The selection of which drug to begin must be tailored to the patient's individual characteristics and circumstances. Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors result in a mild improvement in motor function compared to dopamine agonists or levodopa. They are well tolerated, easy to use once a day drugs and there is evidence that early use of Rasagiline improves motor outcome. Dopamine agonists lead to a substantial improvement in motor function and are, or will shortly be, available as once a day drugs. They are generally well tolerated but can be associated with exacerbating confusion or hallucinations and with behavioral changes. Levodopa is the most potent of the dopaminergic drugs. It is routinely combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and can also be used with a catecholo-o-methyl transferase inhibitor for enhanced absorption. The most important limiting factor for the use of levodopa is the emergence of motor complications. These are related to a number of factors including the dose of levodopa and the duration of its use.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and involves attentional, executive, visuospatial, and memory dysfunctions. Dementia is more frequently encountered in PD than in age-matched control populations, and whereas operational definitions of Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies have been developed, Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D) has remained undefined. The Movement Disorder Society developed a task force to define and develop diagnostic guidelines for PD-D. This effort was based on existing descriptive studies with special emphasis on drawing distinction among Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and PD-related cognitive impairment without dementia whenever possible. The second goal was to provide practical diagnostic procedures to diagnose PD-D. This effort emphasized available bedside tools that do not require neuropsychological expertise to administer or interpret. This work recently has been completed, and two primary articles have been published. The suggested clinical diagnostic criteria for PD-D involve four domains and are anchored in core features, associated clinical features, features that make the diagnosis uncertain, and features that are not compatible with the diagnosis of PD-D. When all four criteria are satisfactorily met, probable PD-D is designated; when the first and last criteria are met, but clinical characteristics are atypical or uncertainty factors exist, possible PD-D is designated. Whereas these definitions are operative and subject to change based on future data, they are based on widely available tests. The inclusion criteria can be applied internationally and in multicenter research on treatment interventions, clinicopathological correlations, and studies of cognitive and other nonmotor elements of PD.",

    "abstract": "The motor complications associated with levodopa therapy, namely, fluctuations in motor response and dyskinesias, occur in the majority of Parkinson's disease patients. These complications can impair a patient's quality of life and even cause pronounced disability. \"Off\" states that result in freezing of gait and falling are disabling for many patients. Dyskinesias most commonly occur at peak dose and typically alternate with the wearing-off state. Once these problems appear, they usually persist, and the physician needs to make continual adjustments in medications to minimize these problems. Medical treatments should be attempted before treatments such as deep brain stimulation are considered because of the potential adverse effects that are associated with surgery. The timing of surgery, however, is also important because younger patients and less advanced patients tend to have a better outcome. There is thus a need for experienced and knowledgeable physicians and surgeons who are able to handle these motor complications. This review discusses available medications and surgical approaches, and their outcomes.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness that impulse control disorders (ICDs), including compulsive gambling, buying, sexual behavior, and eating, can occur as a complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, other impulsive or compulsive disorders have been reported to occur, including dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) and punding. Case reporting and prospective studies have reported an association between ICDs and the use of dopamine agonists (DAs), particularly at greater dosages, whereas dopamine dysregulation syndrome has been associated with greater dosages of levodopa or short-acting DAs. Data suggest that risk factors for an ICD may include male sex, younger age or younger age at PD onset, a pre-PD history of ICD symptoms, personal or family history of substance abuse or bipolar disorder, and a personality style characterized by impulsiveness. Although psychiatric medications are used clinically in the treatment of ICDs, there is no empiric evidence supporting their use in PD. Therefore, management for clinically significant ICD symptoms should consist of modifications to dopamine replacement therapy, particularly DAs, and there is emerging evidence that such management is associated with an overall improvement in ICD symptomatology. It is important that PD patients be aware that DA use may lead to the development of an ICD, and that clinicians monitor patients as part of routine clinical care. As empirically validated treatments for ICDs are emerging, it will be important to examine their efficacy and tolerability in individuals with cooccurring PD and ICDs.",

The inability to effectively communicate impairs their ability to function in society and quality of life. A successful program developed to improve speech in these individuals is the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT). A critical component of this treatment is intense daily therapy for 4 weeks, a regimen that is difficult for many elderly patients to complete. Treatment delivered through videophones placed in the homes of individuals with IPD offers an alternative and could improve accessibility of treatment if the results were the same. This study compared the outcomes of LSVT delivered via videophones to the outcomes of traditional treatment delivered face-to-face.",

    "abstract": "Development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) remains a major problem in the long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Sensitization to L-DOPA correlates with ectopic expression of D3 dopamine receptors in the striatum, implicating D3 receptors in development of LID. We demonstrate that the selective D3 antagonist S33084 abolishes development of LID over 30 days in MPTP-lesioned marmosets without effecting the anti-parkinsonian actions of L-DOPA. Furthermore, following a 14 day washout, when challenged with L-DOPA in the absence of S33084, these animals continued to exhibit reduced LID. In the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat, S33084 similarly attenuated development of behavioural sensitization to L-DOPA. Additionally, L-DOPA-induced elevations in striatal pre-proenkephalin-A (PPE-A) (but not PPE-B, phospho[Thr(34)]DARPP-32, D1, and D2 receptor mRNA or D3 receptor levels) were reduced in S33084 treated animals. Our data suggest a role for D3 receptors in the development of LID and suggest that initiating L-DOPA treatment with a D3 antagonist may reduce the development of LID in PD.",

    "abstract": "Glutathione depletion is one of the earliest detectable events in the Parkinsonian substantia nigra (SN), but whether it is causative for ensuing molecular events associated with the disease is unknown. Here we report that reduction in levels of glutathione in immortalized midbrain-derived dopaminergic neurons results in increases in the cellular labile iron pool (LIP). This increase is independent of either iron regulatory protein/iron regulatory element (IRP/IRE) or hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) induction but is both H(2)0(2) and protein synthesis-dependent. Our findings suggest a novel mechanistic link between dopaminergic glutathione depletion and increased iron levels based on translational activation of TfR1. This may have important implications for neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease in which both glutathione reduction and iron elevation have been implicated.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we reported that RTP801, a stress regulated protein, is induced in multiple cellular models of Parkinson's disease (PD), in an animal model of PD and in dopaminergic neurons of PD patients. In cellular PD models, RTP801 is both sufficient and necessary for death. We further showed that RTP801 and PD mimetics such as 6-OHDA trigger neuron death by suppressing activation of the key kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Here, we report that as a consequence of mTOR signaling blockade, 6-OHDA suppresses the phosphorylation and activation of Akt, a major supporter of neuron survival. This effect is mediated by RTP801 and appears to underlie neuron death induced by 6-OHDA. Examination of postmortem dopaminergic neurons reveals a consistent depletion of phospho-Akt, but not of total Akt in PD patients. These observations support a sequential mechanism in which PD-associated stresses induce RTP801, suppress mTOR signaling, deplete phosphorylated/activated Akt and permit neuron degeneration and death.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease, the most common adult neurodegenerative movement disorder, demonstrates a brain-wide pathology that begins pre-clinically with alpha-synuclein aggregates (\"Lewy neurites\") in processes of gut enteric and vagal motor neurons. Rostral progression into substantia nigra with death of dopamine neurons produces the motor impairment phenotype that yields a clinical diagnosis. The vast majority of Parkinson's disease occurs sporadically, and current models of sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) can utilize directly infused or systemic neurotoxins.\nWe developed a differentiation protocol for human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma that yielded non-dividing dopaminergic neural cells with long processes that we then exposed to 50 nM rotenone, a complex I inhibitor used in Parkinson's disease models. After 21 days of rotenone, ~60% of cells died. Their processes retracted and accumulated ASYN-(+) and UB-(+) aggregates that blocked organelle transport. Mitochondrial movement velocities were reduced by 8 days of rotenone and continued to decline over time. No cytoplasmic inclusions resembling Lewy bodies were observed. Gene microarray analyses showed that the majority of genes were under-expressed. qPCR analyses of 11 mtDNA-encoded and 10 nDNA-encoded mitochondrial electron transport chain RNAs' relative expressions revealed small increases in mtDNA-encoded genes and lesser regulation of nDNA-encoded ETC genes.\nSubacute rotenone treatment of differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells causes process retraction and partial death over several weeks, slowed mitochondrial movement in processes and appears to reproduce the Lewy neuritic changes of early Parkinson's disease pathology but does not cause Lewy body inclusions. The overall pattern of transcriptional regulation is gene under-expression with minimal regulation of ETC genes in spite of rotenone's being a complex I toxin. This rotenone-SH-SY5Y model in a differentiated human neural cell mimics changes of early Parkinson's disease and may be useful for screening therapeutics for neuroprotection in that disease stage.",

    "abstract": "Neural stem cell transplantation therapy was developed for replacing lost or damaged neural cells for the neurodegenerative disease, including Parkinson's disease (PD), in which dopaminergic neuron cells are lost. The growth factor, neurotrophin-3(NT-3), has been shown to promote neuroregeneration, differentiation and migration during brain development. In this report, we construct rat neural stem cells that express neurotrophin-3 endogenously (rNSC-NT3) and transplant them into 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated Parkinsonian rats. Molecular approaches including quantitative real time PCR, Western blot and immunocytochemistry were used to identify the expression of NT-3 and the differentiation of planted cells. Behavioral recover was also tested. The result indicated that combined treatment of neurotrophin-3 gene and neural stem cells had a functional impact on reversing the main symptoms of the Parkinson's disease that significantly reduced apomorphine-induced rotational asymmetry and improved spatial learning ability. The rNSCs-NT3 is able to differentiate into dompaminergic neuron in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), and migrated around the lesion site. Endogenous expressed NT-3 exerts induction and trophic effects on neural stem cells. The rNSCs-NT3 showed higher activity than the rNSCs in regenerating tyrosine hydroxylase positive cell numbers and migrating distance, behavior improving in this dopa-deficit rat model. These findings suggest that the neural stem cells expressed NT-3 endogenously would be a better graft candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Increased oxidative stress contributes to neuronal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated whether the pathological changes in PD brains may also be present in peripheral tissues. Leukocyte 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and plasma vitamin E (Vit E) were measured for 211 PD patients and 135 healthy controls. Leukocyte 8-OHdG and plasma MDA were elevated, whereas erythrocyte GPx and plasma Vit E were reduced in PD patients when compared to the controls. After adjusting for environmental factors, logistic regression analysis showed that PD severity was independently correlated with 8-OHdG and MDA level, and inversely correlated with GPx activity and Vit E level. Leucocyte 8-OHdG level was continuously increased with advanced PD Hoehn-Yahr stages, while plasma MDA level peaked at early disease stages, among PD patients. These results suggest increased oxidative damage and decreased anti-oxidant capacity in peripheral blood, and a significant correlation between leucocyte 8-OHdG level and disease severity in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a loss of dopamine-containing neurons. Mounting evidence suggests that dopaminergic cell death is influenced by the innate immune system. However, the pathogenic role of the adaptive immune system in PD remains enigmatic. Here we showed that CD8+ and CD4+ T cells but not B cells had invaded the brain in both postmortem human PD specimens and in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD during the course of neuronal degeneration. We further demonstrated that MPTP-induced dopaminergic cell death was markedly attenuated in the absence of mature T lymphocytes in 2 different immunodeficient mouse strains (Rag1-/- and Tcrb-/- mice). Importantly, similar attenuation of MPTP-induced dopaminergic cell death was seen in mice lacking CD4 as well as in Rag1-/- mice reconstituted with FasL-deficient splenocytes. However, mice lacking CD8 and Rag1-/- mice reconstituted with IFN-gamma-deficient splenocytes were not protected. These data indicate that T cell-mediated dopaminergic toxicity is almost exclusively arbitrated by CD4+ T cells and requires the expression of FasL but not IFNgamma. Further, our data may provide a rationale for targeting the adaptive arm of the immune system as a therapeutic strategy in PD.",

    "abstract": "A new system consisting of an accelerometer and touch sensor was developed to find objective parameters for the finger tapping (FT) test in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nWe recruited sixteen patients with PD and thirty-two age-matched healthy volunteers (HVs). By using this new system, various parameters related to velocity, amplitude, rhythm and number in the FT test were measured in patients with PD and examined in comparison with those of HVs on the basis of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) FT score.\nThe new system allowed us to measure fourteen parameters of FT movement very easily, and a radar chart showed obvious differences in most of these parameters between HVs and patients with PD. Principal component analysis showed that fourteen parameters were classified into three components: (1) both mean and standard deviation (SD) of both amplitude and velocity, (2) number of FT for 60s and mean FT interval, and (3) SD of FT interval. The first (velocity- and amplitude-related parameters) and third (rhythm-related parameters) components contributed to discrimination of PD from HVs. Maximum opening velocity (MoV) was the best of these parameters because of its sensitivity and association with the UPDRS FT score.\nA novel system for the FT test, which is compact, simple and efficient, has been developed. Velocity- and amplitude-related parameters were indicated to be valuable for evaluation of the FT test in patients with PD. In particular, we first propose that MoV is a novel marker for the FT test.",

    "results": "The new system allowed us to measure fourteen parameters of FT movement very easily, and a radar chart showed obvious differences in most of these parameters between HVs and patients with PD. Principal component analysis showed that fourteen parameters were classified into three components: (1) both mean and standard deviation (SD) of both amplitude and velocity, (2) number of FT for 60s and mean FT interval, and (3) SD of FT interval. The first (velocity- and amplitude-related parameters) and third (rhythm-related parameters) components contributed to discrimination of PD from HVs. Maximum opening velocity (MoV) was the best of these parameters because of its sensitivity and association with the UPDRS FT score.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal systems. Several therapeutic tools for PD include medication using L-DOPA and surgeries such as deep brain stimulation are established. However, the therapies are considered as symptomatic therapy, but not basic remedy for PD and a new regenerative therapy would be desired to explore. In this study, the neuroprotective/rescue effects of erythropoietin (EPO), a well known hematopoietic hormone, on dopaminergic neurons were explored with neurogeneic potencies of EPO. EPO (100 IU/day) was continuously administered with micro-osmotic pump for a week to PD model of rats induced by intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection with subsequent behavioral and immunohistochemical investigations. The number of amphetamine-induced rotations of EPO-treated rats significantly decreased, compared to the control rats. The preservation of dopaminergic neurons of EPO-treated rats were confirmed by tyrosine hydroxylase staining and Fluoro-Gold staining. The number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)/polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) double positive cells in the subventricular zone of EPO treated rats significantly increased with migratory potencies to the damaged striatum,compared to the control rats. Furthermore, TUNEL staining and phosphorylated Akt staining revealed that the neuroprotective/rescue effects of EPO might be mediated by anti-apoptotic effects through the increase of phosphorylated Akt. These results suggest that continuous low dose infusion of EPO exerts neuroprotective/rescue effects with neurogeneic potentials. EPO might be a strong tool for PD therapy, although the further experiments should be added.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence that the tremor frequency in essential tremor (ET) decreases with time. Longitudinal studies on the evolution of tremor frequencies in Parkinson's disease (PD) have so far not been published. Here, we present a longitudinal analysis of tremor frequencies in PD and ET.\nWe analyzed the standardized accelerometric and electromyographic tremor recordings of 53 patients with PD and 38 patients with ET who underwent repeated routine tremor recordings between 1991 and 2002.\nIn an average follow-up period of 44.9 months in PD and 50.6 months in ET, the average number of tremor recordings was 3.3 in PD and 3.7 in ET. In both disorders, tremor frequencies tended to decrease with time. The average annual decrease of the tremor frequency was 0.09 Hz/year in Parkinsonian rest tremor, 0.08 Hz/year in Parkinsonian postural tremor and 0.12 Hz/year in ET.\nThe tremor frequency decreases with time in both PD and ET. The similarity of this decrease in PD and ET may point to a common underlying pathophysiological mechanism.\nDecreasing tremor frequencies with time may be functionally important by inducing larger tremor amplitudes due to the low-pass filtering properties of muscles and limbs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive, incurable neurodegenerative disease. As the disease progresses, motor disturbances and non-motor symptoms represent considerable illness burdens. Symptom relief is the goal for the treatment. Pain is frequently observed in patients with Parkinson's disease, but its prevalence, characteristics and associations with Parkinson's disease are poorly documented. These were investigated in 176 home-living PD patients. They underwent a neurological examination and a structured interview for registration of pain characteristics in addition to responding to standardised questionnaires. Pain was reported by 146 (83%) patients. Compared to the general population, the Parkinson's disease patients experienced significantly more pain as measured by SF-36 Bodily Pain Scale. The average pain during the last 24h measured by the Brief Pain Inventory was 2.85. Fifty-three percent of the patients reported one, 24% reported two and 5% reported three pain types. Musculoskeletal pain was reported by 70%, dystonic pain by 40%, radicular-neuropathic pain by 20% and central neuropathic pain by 10%. Thirty-four percent were on analgesic medication. Pain was not associated with age, disease duration or severity of the disease; female gender was the only significant predictor of pain. Pain is frequent and disabling, independent of demographic and clinical variables except for female gender, and is significantly more common in Parkinson's patients compared to the general population. A minority of the Parkinson's disease patients with pain received analgesic medication. The findings call for improved attention to assessment and treatment of pain in the follow-up of Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the lived health-care experiences of persons living with palliative stage Parkinson's disease and the family members who care for them. An exploratory phenomenological investigation was adopted to understand participant's lived health-care experiences and the needs flowing from them. Three family groupings participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews. Interpretative phenomenological analysis revealed three main themes: missing information, being on your own, wanting and not wanting to know. Findings support previous research that indicate palliative care needs are not being met in our current health-care model and that palliative care services should be multi-disciplinary team-based in order to provide comprehensive support to patients and families. Based on this current work, we are currently undertaking a comprehensive quantitative-based multi-disciplinary health-care service needs assessment of palliative stage PD patients with the goal to implement expanded services.",

    "abstract": "Sleep attacks (SAs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are rare, but clinically important because they significantly impair the daily lives of patients. Causes of SAs include long-term activation of dopaminergic (especially D3) receptors. Recent studies suggest that SAs in PD may be related to impairment of hypothalamic orexin neurons, similar to narcolepsy. Whether orexin is associated with long-term activation of dopaminergic receptors remains uncertain.\nWe measured levels of orexin in samples of spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 25 patients with PD, including 9 with excessive daytime sleepiness and 4 with SAs. Furthermore, in the four patients with SAs, the selective dopamine D1/D2 agonist pergolide was substituted for the causative drugs with D3 stimulatory activity, and CSF-orexin levels were measured before and after switching treatment.\nIn the 25 patients with PD, including the 4 patients with SAs, lower CSF-orexin levels were associated with a longer disease duration, which has been linked to a higher incidence of SAs. Switching treatment to pergolide significantly increased CSF-orexin levels and completely resolved SAs in the four patients with PD.\nDespite the small number of patients studied, our results suggest that orexin transmission is most likely involved in SAs in PD and that abrogation of D3 receptor stimulation may increase orexin and thereby inhibit SAs.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of finger movement on ankle control for gait initiation in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD patients). The subjects were 13 PD patients and 6 age-matched healthy adults. The subjects moved fingers before or after gait initiation, or initiated gait without finger movement. Ankle joint movement in the stance leg was recorded to estimate the duration of ankle dorsiflexion (DIF duration), which reflects the degree of disturbance in ankle control for gait initiation in PD patients. In the PD patients with prolonged D/F duration, finger movement that preceded gait initiation shortened the D/F duration, but in the PD patients without prolonged D/F duration and in healthy subjects, the effect was not found. Accordingly, finger movement that precedes gait initiation improves ankle control for gait initiation in PD patients who suffer disturbance in ankle control for gait initiation.",

    "abstract": "Large animal neuroscience enables the use of conventional clinical brain imagers and the direct use and testing of surgical procedures and equipment from the human clinic. The greater complexity of the large animal brain additionally enables a more direct translation to human brain function in health and disease. Economical, ethical, scientific and practical issues may on the other hand hamper large animal neuroscience. Large animal neuroscience should therefore either be performed in order to examine large animal species dependent problems or to complement promising small animal basic studies by constituting an intermediate research system, bridging small animal CNS research to the human CNS. We have, accordingly, during the last ten years used the Gottingen minipig to examine neuromodulatory treatment modalities such as stem cell transplantation and deep brain stimulation directed towards Parkinson disease. This has been accomplished by the development of a MPTP-based large animal model of Parkinson disease in the Gottingen minipig and the development of stereotaxic and surgical approaches needed to manipulate the Gottingen minipig CNS. The instituted changes in the CNS can be evaluated in the live animal by brain imaging (PET and MR), cystometry, gait analysis, neurological evaluation and by post mortem examination based on histology and stereological analysis.",

    "abstract": "Gait freezing and poor balance are two of the most disabling symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), and also of other untreatable progressive neurological disorders, such as multi-system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In PD, these symptoms are currently inadequately managed by drugs and also the present surgical treatment of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus internus (GPi). The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) has been implicated in these symptoms. The PPN is in the upper brain stem. The major inhibitory input is from the GPi and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr), and bilateral output is to the substantia nigra compacta (SNc), thalamus and spinal cord. Stimulation of the PPN in the decerebrate rat, cat and dog induced gait-like movements. In autopsy studies in PD, MSA, PSP and the DYT-1 dystonic brain, the PPN is degenerate. Autoradiography of the MPTP-Parkinsonian primate shows excessive inhibition in the PPN. Lesions of the PPN in the normal primate induced PD-type bradykinesia, which was persistent with bilateral lesions. In the MPTP-primate model, microinjections of the gamma aminobutyric acid A (GABA) antagonist bicuculine into the PPN reversed Parkinsonian akinesia implying that stimulation of this region might have a therapeutic role in drug resistant PD. Low frequency (5-10Hz) stimulation of the PPN in the same model reversed akinesia independently of L-dopa; moreover, l-dopa and stimulation effects were additive, implying the involvement of non-dopaminergic pathways.",

    "abstract": "In the evaluation of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), most neurologists only see their patients during a limited period of their fluctuating 24-hour-a-day lives. This study aimed to assess the short-term outcome of STN stimulation for patients with advanced PD evaluated in a 24-hour monitoring unit for movement disorder (MUMD) using a prospective protocol.\nForty-two patients with advanced PD consecutively treated with bilateral STN stimulation using multi-channel microelectrode recording were included in this study. All patients were evaluated using a 24-hour MUMD with a video recording/editing system and were evaluated with a prospective protocol of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr Staging, Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living, levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), Short Form-36 Health Survey, and neuropsychological tests. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain were performed prior to and six months after surgery.\nAll patients were evaluated at three and six months after surgery. There was a rapid and significant improvement of the motor symptoms, especially in tremor and rigidity, after STN stimulation with low morbidity. Dyskinesia was markedly decreased with much lowered LEDD values by 50% after STN stimulation. 1.5T MR images were safely taken according to the manufacturer's guidelines at six months after surgery without any adverse effects in 41 patients treated with STN stimulations.\nEvaluations in a 24-hour monitoring unit could reduce the dose of medication efficiently to an optimal level with patients'comfort and improve the clinical symptoms in harmony with STN stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by a slowly expanding degeneration of neurons particularly in the mesencephalon. The causes are unknown although risk factors in the genetic and toxic domain are being discovered. An important pathophysiological feature in PD is the loss of part of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) resulting in a specific dysorganisation of the complicated basal ganglia (BG) circuits. The relay functions at the level of the striatum e.g., are out of balance leading to disturbed subcortico-cortical interactions. At a functional level this is shown by timing and scaling problems when performing movements and clinically this translates into initiation problems, bradykinesia and others. Dysarthria can of course be an important problem. However, how these basic disturbances of motor organisation can be copied into the cognitive domain (in terms of disturbed \"mental movements\") is a topic under discussion. It remains to be seen whether the basic pathophysiology of PD has consequences for the specific language organisation by the brain or whether language problems are merely secondary to the overall \"mental motor slowing\". Here an overview of the pathogenesis, basic pathophysiology and clinical problems of PD will be given.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease affecting up to 1 million individuals in the United States. Depression affects up to 50% of these patients and is associated with a variety of poor outcomes for patients and their families. Despite this, there are few evidence-based data to guide clinical care.\nAn NIH-funded, randomized, controlled trial of paroxetine CR, nortriptyline, and placebo in 52 patients with PD and depression. The primary outcomes were the change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the percentage of depression responders at 8 weeks.\nNortriptyline was superior to placebo for the change in HAM-D (p < 0.002); paroxetine CR was not. There was a trend for superiority of nortriptyline over paroxetine CR at 8 weeks (p < 0.079). Response rates favored nortriptyline (p = 0.024): nortriptyline 53%, paroxetine CR 11%, placebo 24%. In planned contrasts of response rates, nortriptyline was superior to paroxetine CR (p = 0.034). Nortriptyline was also superior to placebo in many of the secondary outcomes, including sleep, anxiety, and social functioning, while paroxetine CR was not. Both active drug treatments were well tolerated.\nThough relatively modest in size, this is the largest placebo-controlled trial done to date in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and depression. Nortriptyline was efficacious in the treatment of depression and paroxetine CR was not. When compared directly, nortriptyline produced significantly more responders than did paroxetine CR. The trial suggests that depression in patients with PD is responsive to treatment and raises questions about the relative efficacy of dual reuptake inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Extending the 2002 stress-appraisal model of Chappell and Reid, we examined the relationships between caregiver stressors (e.g., cognitive impairment and functional dependency of the recipient), appraisal (informal hours of caregiving), and protective factors (e.g., social support, self-esteem, and quality of the caregiver-recipient relationship) associated with the burden and quality of life of Parkinson's disease caregivers. There were 136 caregivers (M = 64.59 years) who completed an online survey. Using structural equation modeling, we found that the extended stress-appraisal model of Chappell and Reid provided a good fit to the data (chi2 = 67.87, df = 55, p >.05; chi2/df = 1.23, Comparative Fit Index = 0.98, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.04). This study provides an important contribution to a growing field of research that applies theoretical models to investigate the stressors, appraisals, and protective factors that impact caregiver well-being.",

    "abstract": "EGb761 is a well-defined mixture of active compounds extracted from Ginkgo biloba leaves with neuroprotective effects in an animal model of Parkinson's disease induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)). Because copper has been implicated in Parkinson's disease, we investigated whether the protective effect of EGb761 in MPP(+) neurotoxicity is related to the regulation of copper in the brain.\nC-57BL/6 mice were pretreated with EGb761 (10 mg/kg) daily for 17 d followed by administration of MPP(+) (0.72 mg/kg); the mice were sacrificed 24 h later. The copper content of the striatum, midbrain, hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum was analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Copper content is expressed as mug of copper per gram of wet tissue.\nCopper content was reduced in the corpus striatum (45%; P < 0.05), and increased in the midbrain (65%; P < 0.05) and hippocampus (116%; P < 0.001) after MPP(+) administration. EGb761 pretreatment of the MPP(+) group prevented changes in the copper content of the striatum, midbrain, and hippocampus. No significant changes were found in the copper content of the cerebellum and frontal cortex in all treatment groups.\nWe showed that the protective effect of EGb761 against MPP(+) neurotoxicity may be due in part to the regulation of copper homeostasis in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative neurodopaminergic disease in nigrostriatum pathway of human and is responsible for most of the movement disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that an inflammatory reaction accompanies the pathological processes caused by Cyclooxygenase (COX) seen in many neurodegenerative disorders, including PD and according to the recent researches chronic use of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) decreases the risk of PD in human. In the study the rat left Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta (SNc) have been destroyed using electrical lesion (1 mA; DC; 8 Sec) to induce PD model. Then aspirin (30, 60 mg kg(-1)) and celecoxib (4, 8 mg kg(-1)) have been administrated orally to parkinsonian rats. When the animals were suffered to PD Murprogo's Method evaluated the rigidity ofparkinsonian rats. Both selective COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) and non-selective COX-2 inhibitor (aspirin) decreased the rigidity of parkinsonian rats p<0.05 but rigidity recovery after administration the selective COX-2 inhibitor was more than non-selective COX-2 inhibitor. These findings are additional pharmacological information which has suggested the use of NSAIDs as alternative way to treat the rigidity of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent human neurodegenerative movement disorder and is characterized by a selective and progressive loss of the dopaminergic neurons. Mutations in the genes parkin and PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) result in autosomal recessive forms of PD. It has been suggested that parkin and Pink1 function in the same pathway in Drosophila, with Pink1 acting upstream of parkin. Previous work in our laboratory has shown the ability of parkin to rescue an alpha-synuclein-induced PD-like phenotype in Drosophila. To investigate the ability of Pink1 to protect against alpha-synuclein-induced toxicity, we have performed longevity, mobility, and histological studies to determine whether Drosophila Pink1 can rescue the alpha-synuclein phenotypes. We have found that overexpression of Pink1 results in the rescue of the alpha-synuclein-induced phenotype of premature loss of climbing ability, suppression of degeneration of the ommatidial array, and the suppression of alpha-synuclein-induced developmental defects in the Drosophila eye. These results mark the first demonstration of Pink1 counteracting PD phenotypes in a protein toxicity animal model, and they show that Pink1 is able to impart protection against potentially harmful proteins such as alpha-synuclein that would otherwise result in cellular stress.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are neurodegenerative diseases that have a tremendous impact on the lives of affected individuals. There is a great probability of developing concurrent parkinsonism in AD and vice versa than would be predicted by independent prevalence of each disease. Both diseases have genetic familial forms with a prevalence of less than 5-10%, but the majority of the cases are sporadic. Several hypotheses exist regarding the etiology of these diseases, such as oxidative stress, inflammatory processes, ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction, energy deficits, cell cycle deficiencies and glutamate exitotoxicities. Since diagnosis occurs in late-stage disease after neuronal loss, it decreases the opportunity for neuroprotective/neurorestorative therapies. Therefore, early and specific diagnosis is required as well as new therapy approaches for the growing burden of AD and PD.",

By contrast, initial manifestations of PD may involve several nonmotor domains, such as cognition, mood, smell or sleep, and their recognition is critical if one is aiming for early diagnosis to provide neuroprotection. In this context, imaging tracers are gaining relevance as they are increasingly recognized as biological markers of disease progression. In this review, we will discuss the role of single photon-emission computed tomography imaging in the early phases of PD and in the differential diagnosis of essential tremor and atypical parkinsonism. We will also discuss the role of imaging of monoaminergic nondopamine systems to assess nonmotor features.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily presents with features of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, and has, as part of its core pathology, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. There is a great need for the development of a reliable diagnostic tool to improve promptness of diagnosis, definition of disease subtypes, and to monitor disease progression and demonstrate treatment efficacy in the case of disease modifying therapies. Current biomarkers range from objective clinical tools, to neuroimaging, to 'wet' markers involving blood and cerebrospinal fluid. To date, all candidate biomarkers for PD have failed to be developed into a clinically useful tool. Ideally, a combination of sensitive markers will be needed, not only to predict the onset of PD, but also to help in subtype classification and to follow progression. Here, we critically review various PD biomarker studies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that creates a significant burden for patients, family members and society at large. Major unmet needs include effective therapies that could favorably modify the underlying pathogenetic processes in PD, and better control of motor and nonmotor symptoms in advanced-stage disease. This review examines the current state of development of potential PD therapies, including dopaminergic therapies, modulators of adenosine and glutamate receptors, cell-based therapies, genetic therapies and device-based therapies. In addition, research into potential neuroprotective agents and pipeline therapies for nonmotor symptoms of PD are summarized.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated whether changes in the electromygraphic (EMG) pattern during rapid point-to-point movements in individuals diagnosed with PD can: (1) distinguish PD subjects from healthy subjects and (2) determine if differences in the EMG pattern reflect disease severity in PD.\nThree groups of 10 PD subjects and 10 age/sex-matched healthy subjects performed rapid 72 degree point-to-point elbow flexion movements. PD subjects were divided, a priori, into three groups based upon off medication motor UPDRS score.\nMeasures related to the EMG pattern distinguished all PD subjects and 9 out of 10 healthy subjects, resulting in 100% sensitivity. Further, significant correlations were shown between EMG measures and the motor UPDRS score. After 30 months, the one healthy subject whose EMG pattern was abnormal was reexamined. The EMG measures remained abnormal and the motor UPDRS score went from 0 to 10. Parkinson's disease was diagnosed.\nMeasures related to the variability of the EMG pattern during rapid point-to-point movements provide neurophysiological measures that objectively distinguish PD subjects from healthy subjects. These measures also correlate with disease severity.\nEMG measures may provide a non-invasive measure that is sensitive and specific for identifying individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "The food supplement creatine (Cr) is widely used by athletes as a natural ergogenic compound. It has also been increasingly tested in neurodegenerative diseases as a potential neuroprotective agent. Weight gain is the most common side effect of Cr, but sporadic reports about the impairment of renal function cause the most concerns with regard to its long-term use. Data from randomized controlled trials on renal function in Cr-supplemented patients are scarce and apply mainly to healthy young athletes. We systematically evaluated potential side effects of Cr with a special focus on renal function in aged patients with Parkinson disease as well as its current use in clinical medical research. Sixty patients with Parkinson disease received either oral Cr (n = 40) or placebo (n = 20) with a dose of 4 g/d for a period of 2 years. Possible side effects as indicated by a broad range of laboratory blood and urine tests were evaluated during 6 follow-up study visits. Overall, Cr was well tolerated. Main side effects were gastrointestinal complaints. Although serum creatinine levels increased in Cr patients because of the degradation of Cr, all other markers of tubular or glomerular renal function, especially cystatin C, remained normal, indicating unaltered kidney function. The data in this trial provide a thorough analysis and give a detailed overview about the safety profile of Cr in older age patients.",

    "abstract": "An association between ergot-derived dopamine agonists and asymptomatic valvular heart disease in Parkinson's disease has been established. For safe use of these agonists, it is important to specify those at high risk for valvular heart disease among patients with Parkinson's disease. We performed a nested case-control study of 223 patients with Parkinson's disease. In results of multivariable logistic analyses, use of pergolide, use of cabergoline, age, male sex, and hypertension were independent significant risk factors for left-sided valvular regurgitation. In patients receiving cabergoline or pergolide, elderly (>or=70 years) hypertensive patients had a markedly high risk for valvular regurgitation (odds ratio 94.5) as compared to non-elderly (<70 years) patients without hypertension. The risk of valvular regurgitation caused by pergolide or cabergoline was found to be highly enhanced by comorbid hypertension or aging, suggesting that special attention should be paid when prescribing cabergoline or pergolide for those patients.",

    "abstract": "The impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on the outcomes of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether early medical management of PD affects TKA outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 34 patients (39 knees) who had PD and underwent TKA. Patients received a preoperative/immediate-postoperative neurologic consultation (n = 13) or a delayed consultation (n = 21). Clinical outcomes and functional recovery were assessed with the Knee Society scoring system and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). There were no significant preoperative differences between the 2 cohorts. Mean follow-up was 36 months. Compared with the delayed-consultation group, the preoperative/immediate-postoperative consultation group had a 2.5-day shorter length of stay after surgery and 19 points more improvement in Knee Society Pain and Function scores. In addition, there was statistically significant improvement in UPDRS Severity scores in the preoperative/immediate consultation group but not in the delayed-consultation group. Early neurologic consultation in patients with PD can significantly decrease length of stay and improve early outcomes after TKA.",

    "abstract": "To assess the regional cerebral glucose utilization and the imaging characteristic of Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET).\nQuestionnaire survey, mini-mental state examination (MMSE), physical examination, and FDG PET on brain at rest state were performed on 20 patients with PDD, 13 males and 7 females, aged (70 +/- 6), and sex- and age-matched 8 patients with non-demented PD, and 30 healthy parsons. Visual inspection and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) were used to investigate the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglc) and the distribution of the tracer.\nThe MMSE score of the PDD group was (27.5 +/- 2.4), (10 - 24), significantly lower than those of the non-PDD group [(27.5 +/- 2.4) (22 - 30)] and control group [(27.9 +/- 2.2) (21 - 30)] (F = 60.31, P = 0.000). There were no significant differences in Hoehn-Yahr staging and disease courses between the two PD groups (P > 0.05). Visual inspection showed that there were no significant focal hypometabolic areas in the imaging of the non-demented PD patients, while compared to the controls, the rCMRglc levels of the PDD patients decreased in bilateral superior parietal lobules (BA 7), inferior parietal lobules (BA 40, 39), superior frontal gyri (BA 6), middle frontal gyri (BA 6, 8, 9), middle temporal gyri (BA 21), cuneate lobes (BA 17, 18, 19), cingulate cortices (BA 31), lingual gyri (BA 19) basal ganglia, and thalamus. According to the severity of memory impairment and the onset of hallucination, the subtype of PDD was classified into memory impairment dominant group (MD) and hallucination dominant group (HD). The rCMRglc of MD subgroup decreased significantly in the parietotemporal association cortex, especially in the precuneus lobe. The rCMRglc of the HD subgroup decreased significantly in the occipital cortex. There were no significant differences in MMSE score and Hoehn-Yahr staging between the MD and HD groups (both P > 0.05), while the age of the HD subgroup was significantly lower, and the disease duration of the HD subgroup was significantly longer than those toe MD group (both P < 0.05).\n(18)F-FDG/PET imaging is helpful to the diagnosis of PDD and may help investigate the potential pathophysiology of PDD.",

    "abstract": "Free radical formation and oxidative stress might play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). In vitro data indicate that neuromelanin (NM) pigment is formed the excess cytosolic catecholamine that is not accumulated into synaptic vesicles via the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). We designed this study to investigate the neuroprotective effects of vitamin E in the early model of PD.\nMale rats (n = 40) with unbiased rotational behavior were randomly divided into five groups: sham operated group (SH, n = 8), vehicle-treated SH group (SH + V, n = 8), vitamin E-treated SH group (SH + E, n = 8), vehicle-treated lesion group (L + V, n = 8) and vitamin E-treated lesion group (L + E, n = 8). Unilateral intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (12.5 microl) lesioned rats were treated intramuscularly with alpha-tocopherol acid succinate (24 I.U/kg, intramuscular [i.m.]) 1 h before surgery and three times per week for 2 month post-surgery. To evaluate the vitamin E pretreatment efficacy, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity and immunostaining intensity (ISI) for monoamine transporter 2 were used.\nTH immunohistochemical analyses showed a reduction of 20 percent in locus coeruleus (LC) cell number of vitamin E pretreated lesioned group but the cell number dropped to 60 percent in the lesioned group. The ISI of the cells was measured for VMAT2 in LC. Lesioned groups: 1) had the lowest VMAT2 ISI of all neurons; 2) There was an inverse relationship between VMAT2 ISI and NM pigment in the locus and 3) Neurons with the highest VMAT2 ISI also had high TH ISI.\nThe data support the hypothesis that repeated i.m. administration of vitamin E exerts a protective effect on the LC neurons in the early model of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder resulting from a degeneration of dopamine producing cells in the substantia nigra. Clinical symptoms typically affect gait pattern and motor performance. Evidence suggests that the use of individual auditory cueing devices may be used effectively for the management of gait and freezing in people with Parkinson's disease. The primary aim of the randomised controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of an individual auditory cueing device on freezing and gait speed in people with Parkinson's disease.\nA prospective multi-centre randomised cross over design trial will be conducted. Forty-seven subjects will be randomised into either Group A or Group B, each with a control and intervention phase. Baseline measurements will be recorded using the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire as the primary outcome measure and 3 secondary outcome measures, the 10 m Walk Test, Timed \"Up & Go\" Test and the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale. Assessments are taken 3-times over a 3-week period. A follow-up assessment will be completed after three months. A secondary aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of such a device on the quality of life of people with Parkinson's disease using a qualitative methodology.\nThe Apple iPod-Shuffle and similar devices provide a cost effective and an innovative platform for integration of individual auditory cueing devices into clinical, social and home environments and are shown to have immediate effect on gait, with improvements in walking speed, stride length and freezing. It is evident that individual auditory cueing devices are of benefit to people with Parkinson's disease and the aim of this randomised controlled trial is to maximise the benefits by allowing the individual to use devices in both a clinical and social setting, with minimal disruption to their daily routine.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and often devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting up to one million individuals in the United States alone. Multiple lines of evidence support mitochondrial dysfunction as a primary or secondary event in PD pathogenesis; a better understanding, therefore, of how mitochondrial function is altered in vivo in brain tissue in PD is a critical step toward developing potential PD biomarkers. In vivo study of mitochondrial metabolism in human subjects has previously been technically challenging. However, proton and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H and (31)P MRS) are powerful noninvasive techniques that allow evaluation in vivo of lactate, a marker of anaerobic glycolysis, and high energy phosphates, such as adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine, directly reflecting mitochondrial function. This article reviews previous (1)H and (31)P MRS studies in PD, which demonstrate metabolic abnormalities consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction, and then presents recent (1)H MRS data revealing abnormally elevated lactate levels in PD subjects.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. Typically PD is a sporadic neurological disorder, and over time affected patients see their disability growing and their quality of life declining. Oxidative stress has been hypothesized to be linked to both the initiation and the progression of PD. Preclinical findings from both in vitro and in vivo experimental models of PD suggest that the neurodegenerative process starts with otherwise healthy neurons being hit by some etiological factors, which sets into motion a cascade of deleterious events. In these models initial molecular alterations in degenerating dopaminergic neurons include increased formation of reactive oxygen species, presumably originating from both inside and outside the mitochondria. In the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD, time-course experiments suggest that oxidative stress is an early event that may directly kill some of the dopaminergic neurons. In this model it seems that oxidative stress may play a greater role in the demise of dopaminergic neurons indirectly by activating intracellular, cell death-related, molecular pathways. As the neurodegenerative process evolves in the MPTP mouse model, indices of neuroinflammation develop, such as microglial activation. The latter increases the level of oxidative stress to which the neighboring compromised neurons are subjected to, thereby promoting their demise. However, these experimental studies have also shown that oxidative stress is not the sole deleterious factor implicated in the death of dopaminergic neurons. Should a similar multifactorial cascade underlie dopaminergic neuron degeneration in PD, then the optimal therapy for this disease may have to rely on a cocktail of agents, each targeting a different critical component of this hypothesized pathogenic cascade. If correct, this may be a reason why neuroprotective trials using a single agent, such as an antioxidant, have thus far generated disappointing results.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, disabling, neurodegenerative disease. Our knowledge of the molecular events leading to PD is being greatly enhanced by the study of relatively rare familial form of the disease. Nevertheless, the pathways leading from the genetic mutations to nigral cell degeneration and the other features in PD remain poorly understood. The identification of PINK1, a mitochondrial putative protein kinase, has helped understand the pathophysiology of mitochondria and their potential role in PD. Mutations in PINK1 are associated with the PARK6 autosomal recessive, early-onset, PD-susceptibility locus. Point mutations in another mitochondrial protein, HtrA2, are a susceptibility factor for PD (PARK13 locus). We report here the results of investigations into the interactors and pathways of these two mitochondrial molecules (PINK1 and HtrA2) in a range of models and human PD tissue.",

    "abstract": "Evidence continues to accrue implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in the etiology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, Parkinson's disease (PD) can be induced by mitochondrial toxins, and nuclear DNA (nDNA) loci linked to PD have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Although conclusions about the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants in PD vary, we argue here that this is attributable to the novel genetics of the mtDNA and the fact that clinically relevant mtDNA variation encompasses ancient adaptive polymorphisms, recent deleterious mutations, and somatic mutations. An mtDNA association with PD is supported by an analysis of the Russian Tatar population which revealed that polymorphisms associated with haplogroup H mtDNAs increased PD risk (odds ratio [OR]= 2.58, P= 0.0001), whereas those associated with haplogroup UK cluster mtDNAs were protective (OR = 0.38, P= 0.003). Moreover, mtDNA sequencing revealed that PD patients with either haplogroup H or UK cluster mtDNAs can harbor additional recent variants that might further modulate PD risk. Therefore, the complexity of PD genetics may reflect the complex mitochondrial genetics.",

The present hypothesis suggests that progression of Parkinson's disease may be reduced by enhancing the regional levels of neuroprotective factors derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC). One practical means to accomplish this goal may be administration of ketoconazole or other inhibitors of corticosteroid synthesis at doses sufficient to stimulate hypophyseal secretion of POMC. The POMC constituents adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and melanocycle-stimulating hormone (MSH), which mobilize neuromelanin generation and lipotropins, those motivating lipid components of neuromelanin and endorphin, which then together stimulate and protect neural components of the substantia nigra.",

    "abstract": "Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) in the brain constitute the main histopathological features of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and are comprised of amyloid-like fibrils composed of a small protein ( approximately 14 kDa) named alpha-synuclein (alphaS). As the aggregation of (alphaS in the brain has been implicated as a critical step in the development of the diseases, the current search for disease-modifying drugs is focused on modification of the process of (alpha S deposition in the brain. In this article, the recent developments on the molecules that inhibit the formation of alpha-synuclein fibrils (falphaS) as well as the oligomerization of alphaS are reviewed. Recently, various compounds such as curcumin, nicotine and wine-related polyphenols have been reported to inhibit the formation of falphaS, and to destabilize preformed falphaS at pH 7.5 at 37 degrees C in vitro. Although the mechanisms by which these compounds inhibit falphaS formation from falphaS, and destabilize preformed falphaS are still unclear, they could be key molecules for the development of preventives and therapeutics for PD and other alpha-synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability while standing, walking, and interacting with objects or the environment places individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) at risk for falls, injuries, and self-imposed restrictions in activity. Recent research with motor skills, including those demanding postural stability, has demonstrated performance and learning advantages when performers are instructed to adopt an external rather than an internal focus of attention. Despite the potential benefits in stability-related risk reduction and enhanced movement effectiveness, attentional focus research in individuals challenged with postural instability is limited.\nThe present translational research study examined the generalizability of the attentional focus effect to balance in older adults with PD.\nA within-participant design was used to account for potentially substantial individual variations in balancing capabilities.\nFourteen participants diagnosed with idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages II and III) participated in the experiment. They were asked to balance on an unstable surface (inflated rubber disk). In counterbalanced orders, they were instructed to focus on reducing movements of their feet (internal focus) or the disk (external focus), or they were not given attentional focus instructions (control).\nThe adoption of an external focus resulted in less postural sway relative to both internal focus and control conditions. There was no difference between the internal focus and control conditions.\nMental functioning was not formally assessed, and comprehensive clinical profiles of participants were not obtained.\nThe results are consistent with previous findings on attentional focus in samples of patients and people without disabilities. Subtle wording distinctions that direct attention to movement effects external to the mover reduce postural instability during standing for individuals with PD relative to an internal focus. The findings have potentially important implications for instructions given by clinicians and the reduction of fall risk.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation is involved in numerous neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, alpha-synuclein is extensively phosphorylated in aggregates in patients suffering from synucleinopathies. However, the share of this modification in the events that lead to the conversion of alpha-synuclein to aggregated toxic species needed to be clarified. The rat model that we developed through rAAV2/6-mediated expression of alpha-synuclein demonstrates a correlation between neurodegeneration and formation of small filamentous alpha-synuclein aggregates. A mutation preventing phosphorylation (S129A) significantly increases alpha-synuclein toxicity and leads to enhanced formation of beta-sheet-rich, proteinase K-resistant aggregates, increased affinity for intracellular membranes, a disarrayed network of neurofilaments and enhanced alpha-synuclein nuclear localization. The expression of a mutation mimicking phosphorylation (S129D) does not lead to dopaminergic cell loss. Nevertheless, fewer but larger aggregates are formed, and signals of apoptosis are also activated in rats expressing the phosphorylation-mimicking form of alpha-synuclein. These observations strongly suggest that phosphorylation does not play an active role in the accumulation of cytotoxic pre-inclusion aggregates. Unexpectedly, the study also demonstrates that constitutive expression of phosphorylation-mimicking forms of alpha-synuclein does not protect from neurodegeneration. The role of phosphorylation at Serine 129 in the early phase of Parkinson's disease is examined, which brings new perspective to therapeutic approaches focusing on the modulation of kinases/phosphatases activity to control alpha-synuclein toxicity.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in the electrophysiological features of atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) in patients with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) associated with or without atrial fibrillation (AF). We included 119 patients with WPW and orthodromic AVRT during electrophysiological study. The patients were divided into two groups; group I with documented episodes of AF (n=39, mean age 33.3+/-11.5 years), and group II without AF (n=80, mean age 35.3+/-13.8). We compared parameters of accessory pathway (AP), atrium and ventricle between two groups and found no significant difference. We next assessed the electrophysiological parameters of AVRT in both groups in terms of conduction times and atrioventricular (AV) activation relations. A significant negative correlation was found in group II between anterograde and retrograde conduction times measured as AV and VA intervals at the site of the earliest atrial activation (r=-0.43, P<0.0001), whereas no significant correlation was seen in group I (r=-0.29, P=0.1). Comparative analysis between two groups revealed significant difference in A-V/V-V index (P=0.05). These data suggest the presence of different electrophysiological properties of AP during AVRT in only few respects in patients with AF compared to those without it.",

    "abstract": "Swallowing disturbances (SDs), anxiety and depression are commonly present in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We hypothesized that there is an association between the presence of SDs and the PD affective state. Sixty-nine PD patients were assessed for the presence of SDs by undergoing cognitive screening with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), completing three inventories: a swallowing disturbance questionnaire (SDQ), the Spielberger manual for the trait anxiety and Beck depression inventories. All patients underwent clinical swallowing evaluations by a speech and language pathologist (SLP). Patients diagnosed with SDs were also assessed by fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) performed by an ENT and SLP. Thirty-eight patients experienced SDs, the other 31 did not. The clinical characteristics of the two groups were matched. Patients with SDs experienced increased anxiety and depression compared to patients without SDs. Comparisons between patients who scored in the two opposite ends of the anxiety and depression ranges demonstrated that the most anxious and depressed patients reported more swallowing difficulties (SDQ scores) compared with the least anxious and depressed ones. In addition, the most anxious patients had significantly increased disease severity and decreased MMSE scores compared with the least anxious patients. Disease severity was also increased in the most depressed patients compared with the least depressed ones. Advanced disease emerged as being associated with high anxiety levels and greater numbers of SDs. The contribution of anxiety or depression to the development or worsening of SDs and their role in treatment strategy warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with exaggerated oscillatory synchrony in the basal ganglia at frequencies over 8-35 Hz. Studies have demonstrated a suppression of local field potential (LFP) activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) upon treatment with the dopamine prodrug, levodopa, with the degree of suppression of power in the 8-35 Hz band correlating with the improvement in combined measures of bradykinesia and rigidity. However, these studies do not explicitly address the question of what is more important in predicting clinical change - synchronisation of neuronal activity or the specific frequency within the 8-35 Hz band over which the latter occurs. In addition, they have not demonstrated a relationship between treatment-induced changes in synchronisation and changes in bradykinesia or rigidity on their own. To this end, we collected and analysed LFP and clinical data in 30 patients with PD. We found significant correlations between levodopa-induced power suppression and rigidity and bradykinesia, when these clinical features were considered separately, but only when power suppression profiles were re-aligned to the frequency of peak synchronisation. Under these circumstances correlations with rigidity persisted despite partialising out the effect of bradykinesia and vice versa. These data suggest that levodopa-induced improvements in both rigidity and bradykinesia scale with the degree of suppression of oscillatory power in the STN LFP, and that this is true irrespective of the frequency at which synchronisation occurs across a broad band from 8-35 Hz.",

    "abstract": "Braak and colleagues have proposed that, within the central nervous system, Parkinson's disease (PD) begins as a synucleinopathy in nondopaminergic structures of the lower brainstem or in the olfactory bulb. The brainstem synucleinopathy is postulated to progress rostrally to affect the substantia nigra and cause parkinsonism at a later stage of the disease. In the context of a diagnosis of PD, made from current clinical criteria, the pattern of lower brainstem involvement accompanying mesencephalic synucleinopathy is often observed. However, outside of that context, the patterns of synucleinopathy that Braak described are often not observed, particularly in dementia with Lewy bodies and when synucleinopathy occurs in the absence of neurological manifestations. The concept that lower brainstem synucleinopathy represents \"early PD\" rests on the supposition that it has a substantial likelihood of progressing within the human lifetime to involve the mesencephalon, and thereby cause the substantia nigra pathology and clinical parkinsonism that have heretofore defined the disease. However, the predictive validity of this concept is doubtful, based on numerous observations made in populations of aged individuals who, despite the absence of neurological signs, have brain synucleinopathy ranging up to Braak stages 4 to 6 at postmortem. Furthermore, there is no relation between Braak stage and the clinical severity of PD. We conclude that the relation between patterns of abnormal synuclein immunostaining in the human brain and the disease entity now recognized as PD remains to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Improvements to the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) are dependent upon knowledge about susceptibility factors that render populations at risk. In the process of attempting to identify novel genetic factors associated with PD, scientists have generated many lists of candidate genes, polymorphisms, and proteins that represent important advances, but these leads remain mechanistically undefined. Our work is aimed toward significantly narrowing such lists by exploiting the advantages of a simple animal model system. While humans have billions of neurons, the microscopic roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has precisely 302, of which only eight produce dopamine (DA) in hemaphrodites. Expression of a human gene encoding the PD-associated protein, alpha-synuclein, in C. elegans DA neurons results in dosage and age-dependent neurodegeneration. Worms expressing human alpha-synuclein in DA neurons are isogenic and express both GFP and human alpha-synuclein under the DA transporter promoter (Pdat-1). The presence of GFP serves as a readily visualized marker for following DA neurodegeneration in these animals. We initially demonstrated that alpha-synuclein-induced DA neurodegeneration could be rescued in these animals by torsinA, a protein with molecular chaperone activity. Further, candidate PD-related genes identified in our lab via large-scale RNAi screening efforts using an alpha-synuclein misfolding assay were then over-expressed in C. elegans DA neurons. We determined that five of seven genes tested represented significant candidate modulators of PD as they rescued alpha-synuclein-induced DA neurodegeneration. Additionally, the Lindquist Lab (this issue of JoVE) has performed yeast screens whereby alpha-synuclein-dependent toxicity is used as a readout for genes that can enhance or suppress cytotoxicity. We subsequently examined the yeast candidate genes in our C. elegans alpha-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration assay and successfully validated many of these targets. Our methodology involves generation of a C. elegans DA neuron-specific expression vector using recombinational cloning of candidate gene cDNAs under control of the Pdat-1 promoter. These plasmids are then microinjected in wild-type (N2) worms, along with a selectable marker for successful transformation. Multiple stable transgenic lines producing the candidate protein in DA neurons are obtained and then independently crossed into the alpha-synuclein degenerative strain and assessed for neurodegeneration, at both the animal and individual neuron level, over the course of aging.",

The clinical features of this type of PD are similar to those of idiopathic PD, but the pathological changes are diverse. The mutation types and frequencies of the LRRK2 distribute unevenly in different populations. LRRK2 is a large complex protein with multiple functions and expresses widely in human body. Sequence alignment shows that LRRK2 might be a multiple function kinase for substrate phosphorylation and might also act as a scaffolding protein. Further study on the physiological function and pathogenic mechanism of LRRK2 will help to find out the possible pathogenesis and new treatment for PD.",

    "abstract": "A recent study has concluded that the use of (123)I-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography ((123)I-FP-CIT SPECT) is cost-effective or cost-saving in patients in whom the diagnosis of Parkinson disease versus essential tremor is uncertain. This conclusion is based on numerous assumptions, not all of which are likely to be universally applicable. The economic advantages associated with the use of (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT will vary depending on the prevalence of Parkinson disease in the group of patients with uncertain diagnosis, the cost of usual clinical evaluation including other diagnostic tests, and the consequences of either delaying or inappropriately instituting dopaminergic therapy. The cost-effectiveness of radionuclide scanning is likely to increase in the future if a therapy is developed with a convincing impact on disease progression, the early institution of which confers a better outcome.",

It is also hoped that such an understanding will allow identification of individuals at risk for disease prior to the onset of motor symptoms. A large amount of work has already been performed in the identification of genetic risk factors for PD and some of this work, particularly those efforts that focus on genes implicated in monogenic forms of PD, have been successful, although hard won. A new era of gene discovery has begun, with the application of genome wide association studies; these promise to facilitate the identification of common genetic risk loci for complex genetic diseases. This is the first of several high throughput technologies that promise to shed light on the (likely) myriad genetic factors involved in this complex, late-onset neurodegenerative disorder.",

We compare pain prevalence using analgesic prescription in PD patients, in the general population and in two samples of painful patients: diabetics and osteoarthritis patients in France. Data were obtained from the French System of Health Insurance for the year 2005. Medications (antiparkinsonian, antidiabetics drugs and osteoarthritis drugs) were used for identification of PD, diabetic and osteoarthritis patients. We estimated the prevalence of analgesic drugs prescription (at least one analgesic drug) and the prevalence of chronic analgesic drugs prescription (more than 90 DDD of analgesic drug). The study included 11,466 PD patients. PD patients significantly received more prescription of analgesics than the general population (82% versus 77%,) and fewer than patients with osteoarthritis (82% versus 90%). No significant difference was found between PD and diabetic patients. The chronic prescription of analgesic drugs was more prevalent in PD patients (33%) than in the general population (20%) and in diabetic patients (26%) and similar to that in osteoarthritis patients. PD patients were more exposed than the general population and diabetics to opiates, acetaminophen, and adjuvant analgesics chronic use.",

Thirty-eight controls matched for sex, age, and hip fracture type were found among the 1002 non-PD fallers.\nNot applicable.\nBMD was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at a mean+/-SD of 21.9+/-7.5 days after fracture occurrence in the 38 PD patients and 21.6+/-5.9 days after fracture occurrence in the 38 controls.\nBMD assessed at total femur, trochanter, and intertrochanteric region was significantly lower in the 15 PD patients with trochanteric fractures than in the 23 with cervical fractures; the mean T score differences were 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-1.08; P=.028), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.04-1.28; P=.037), and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.11-1.15; P=.019), respectively. A significant association between femoral BMD and hip fracture type was found at logistic regression after adjustment for several confounders. Results in the 38 controls were similar to those obtained in the 38 PD fallers.\nIn a sample of PD fallers as in a control group of non-PD fallers, BMD levels assessed at 3 femoral sites were significantly lower in the patients who sustained trochanteric fractures than in those with cervical fractures of the hip.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports showed the reduction of dopamine transporter immunoreactivity in peripheral blood lymphocytes in Parkinson's disease. In this work, we sought to investigate the possible correlation between central and peripheral dopamine transporter immunoreactivity values in a group of 11 drug-naive patients with Parkinson's disease.\nDensitometric measurements of dopamine transporter immunoreactivity in peripheral blood lymphocytes was accomplished as described recently, using a monoclonal antidopamine transporter antibody. Dopamine transporter binding in the caudate and putamen nuclei was measured by means of (123)I-fluopane single-photon emission computed tomography in the same patients.\nThe results failed to show any significant correlation between dopamine transporter immunoreactivity in peripheral blood lymphocytes and the caudate or putamen dopamine transporter binding. Moreover, dopamine transporter immunoreactivity in peripheral blood lymphocytes was reduced also in the single patient with normal striatal dopamine transporter binding.\nThese results indicate the lack of correlation between central and peripheral dopamine transporter reduction in Parkinson's disease, using the methodologies applied herein. They therefore suggest that the two phenomena are unlikely to share a common pathogenetic mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The non-volitional sudden discontinuation of motor activity, called motor block (MB) or freezing is most commonly associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). MB extends beyond the classical manifestations of PD: akinezia, bradykinezia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. MB has been observed and quantified in internally cued repetitive movements such as gait, speech, handwriting, and manual tapping tasks as a distinct feature of PD. We present a simple measurement system for objective evaluation of MB during point-to-point hand movements in patients with PD. Hand trajectories were evaluated in eight PD patients based on values obtained from a digitizing tablet (DT) score. 50 trials per day were recorded in seven consecutive working days. Subjects were instructed to consciously prepare and self-initiate movements between arbitrarily fixed starting and target points without lifting a wireless magnetic mouse. MB was identified as the time interval during movement with no change in coordinates. We analyzed three kinematic parameters: duration, start and number of MBs. If MBs were documented, the DT score was 1, if not, 0. Results were then compared with the ratings of the question in motor section related to freezing of hands from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). For all patients, DT score was in agreement with the UPDRS. Present results indicate that DT is useful for assessing MBs during volitional planar hand movement. This low-cost instrument may be included in a clinical test battery because of short testing time and trouble-free preparation of patient.",

    "abstract": "To assess the occurrence of weight gain in patients with Parkinson's disease, with an average 16 months of follow-up after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation.\nWe used dual x ray absorptiometry to evaluate changes in body weight and body composition in 22 patients with Parkinson's disease (15 men and seven women) before surgery, 3 months after surgery and on average 16 months after surgery.\nNo patient was underweight before surgery and 50% were overweight. By contrast, 68% were overweight or obese 3 months after surgery and 82% after 16 months (p<0.001).

For women, the mean increases in BMI at the same evaluation times were 1.04 (0.30) kg/m(2) and 2.11 (0.49) kg/m(2). This weight gain was mainly secondary to an increase in fat mass in both men and women.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder with unknown etiology. It is marked by widespread neurodegeneration in the brain with profound loss of A9 midbrain dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. Several theories of biochemical abnormalities have been linked to pathogenesis of PD of which mitochondrial dysfunction due to an impairment of mitochondrial complex I and subsequent oxidative stress seems to take the center stage in experimental models of PD and in postmortem tissues of sporadic forms of illness. Recent identification of specific gene mutations and their influence on mitochondrial functions has further reinforced the relevance of mitochondrial abnormalities in disease pathogenesis. In both sporadic and familial forms of PD abnormal mitochondrial paradigms associated with disease include impaired functioning of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, aging associated damage to mitochondrial DNA, impaired calcium buffering, and anomalies in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics. Here we provide an overview of specific mitochondrial functions affected in sporadic and familial PD that play a role in disease pathogenesis. We propose to utilize these gained insights to further streamline and focus the research to better understand mitochondria's role in disease development and exploit potential mitochondrial targets for therapeutic interventions in PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Apomorphine hydrochloride infusion therapy is used by approximately 1000 people with advanced Parkinson's disease in the UK (Britannia Pharmaceuticals Ltd, 2008). Subcutaneous nodules that develop as a result of these infusions can cause discomfort and may impact on the effectiveness of the drug therapy. Community nursing teams have a key role in supporting patients on apomorphine; they may be responsible for administering the drug, or supporting and empowering the patient or their carer to administer the infusion. A recent randomized controlled pilot study by a research group at the University of Hertfordshire investigated the use of therapeutic ultrasound for the treatment of apomorphine nodules. A number of observations about apomorphine nodules and the technique used to site infusions were made which may help to promote safe and effective management of apomorphine therapy. This article is a collaboration between one of the researchers and a Parkinson's disease nurse specialist from the University College of London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. It draws on best practice observations from both research and clinical experience and puts them in context of published research. It summarizes best practice considerations for administering infusions, identifies the current treatment and management options that participants from the trial reported using on their nodules, emphasizes the need for standardized documentation and suggests a rating system that may be useful to document nodule severity.",

However, approximately 5% of patients might develop apraxia of eyelid opening after DBS of the subthalamic nucleus. We provide data on a new noninvasive treatment approach to this adverse event.\nWe report 2 patients who acquired apraxia of eyelid opening after DBS.

    "abstract": "Mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) G13513A, encoding the ND5 subunit of respiratory chain complex I, can cause mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and Leigh syndrome. Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and optic atrophy were reported in a high proportion of patients with this mutation. We report an 18-month-old girl, with an 11-month history of psychomotor regression who was diagnosed with WPW syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in association with Leigh syndrome. Supplementation with coenzyme Q10, thiamine and carnitine prevented further regression in gross motor function but the patient's heart function deteriorated and dilated cardiomyopathy developed 11 months later. She was found to have a mutation of mtDNA G13513A. We suggest that mtDNA G13513A mutation is an important factor in patients with Leigh syndrome associated with WPW syndrome and/or optic atrophy, and serial heart function monitoring by echocardiography is recommended in this group of patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is caused by a progressive loss of the midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the main cause of Parkinson's disease remains unknown, there is increasing evidence that it is a complex disorder caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, which affect key signalling pathways in substantia nigra DA neurons. Insights into pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease stem from in vitro and in vivo models and from postmortem analyses. Recent technological developments have added a new dimension to this research by determining gene expression profiles using high throughput microarray assays. However, many of the studies reported to date were based on whole midbrain dissections, which included cells other than DA neurons. Here, we have used laser microdissection to isolate single DA neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta of controls and subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease matched for age and postmortem interval followed by microarrays to analyse gene expression profiling. Our data confirm a dysregulation of several functional groups of genes involved in the Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. In particular, we found prominent down-regulation of members of the PARK gene family and dysregulation of multiple genes associated with programmed cell death and survival. In addition, genes for neurotransmitter and ion channel receptors were also deregulated, supporting the view that alterations in electrical activity might influence DA neuron function. Our data provide a 'molecular fingerprint identity' of late-stage Parkinson's disease DA neurons that will advance our understanding of the molecular pathology of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which is often reduced to a mere dysfunction of motor performance. Non-motor symptoms, however, are frequent impairments in PD and result in a major impact on the patients and their caregivers. The major neuropsychiatric comorbidities depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms are briefly discussed. Additionally, a brief outlook on deep brain stimulation and its effect on psychiatric symptoms is provided. Several studies did show that neuropsychiatric symptoms are underdiagnosed and consecutively treated inadequately. All in all more attention should be directed to the detection and treatment of psychiatric symptoms in PD patients in routine clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease, caused by the loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal projections, is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability. The dopamine precursor levodopa (L-dopa) is the most effective treatment for the amelioration of Parkinson's disease signs and symptoms, but long-term administration can lead to disabling motor fluctuations and L-dopa -induced dyskinesias (LIDs). Studies in rat striatal slices have shown dopamine to be an essential component of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at the input to the basal ganglia, but dopamine is also released from ventrally projecting dendrites of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) on the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a major output structure of the basal ganglia. We characterized synaptic plasticity in the SNr using field potentials evoked with a nearby microelectrode (fEPs), in 18 Parkinson's disease patients undergoing implantation of deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). High frequency stimulation (HFS--four trains of 2 s at 100 Hz) in the SNr failed to induce a lasting change in test fEPs (1 Hz) amplitudes in patients OFF medication (decayed to baseline by 160 s). Following oral L-dopa administration, HFS induced a potentiation of the fEP amplitudes (+29.3% of baseline at 160 s following a plateau). Our findings suggest that extrastriatal dopamine modulates activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at basal ganglia output neurons. Dopamine medication state clearly impacts fEP amplitude, and the lasting nature of the increase is reminiscent of LTP-like changes, indicating that aberrant synaptic plasticity may play a role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Velocity irregularities frequently observed during deceleration of arm movements have usually been interpreted as corrective submovements that improve motion accuracy. This hypothesis is re-examined here in application to movements of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients in which submovements are specifically frequent. Pointing movements in patients and age-matched controls to large and small targets in three movement modes were studied. The modes were discrete (stop on the target), continuous (reverse on the target), and passing (stop after crossing the target). Two types of submovements were distinguished, gross and fine. In both groups, gross submovements were more frequent during the discrete and passing than continuous mode, specifically for large targets. This suggested that gross submovements were fluctuations accompanying motion termination (stabilization at the target) that was included in discrete and passing but not continuous movements. Gross submovements were specifically frequent in patients, suggesting that PD causes deficiency in smooth motion termination. Although in both groups fine submovements were more frequent for small than large targets, this relation was also observed in passing movements after crossing the target, i.e., when no corrections were needed. This result, together with higher jerk of the entire trajectory found for smaller targets, indicates that fine submovements may also be not corrective adjustments but rather velocity fluctuations emerging due to low speed of movements to small targets. This interpretation is consistent with the recognized inability of PD patients to promptly change generated force as well as to quickly re-plan current motion. The results suggest a need to re-examine the traditional interpretation of submovements in PD and the related theory that the production of iterative submovements is a strategy used by patients to compensate for a decreased initial force pulse.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, the pathogenetic mechanisms of which remain unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunction, which has long been implicated in sporadic PD, has recently been highlighted as a key pathological cause, particularly with the identification of mutations in the PTEN-induced putative kinase (pink1), parkin and htrA2 (also known as omi) genes that are linked to PD. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have shown that pink1 and parkin act in a common genetic pathway that maintains mitochondrial integrity, but other upstream or downstream components of this pathway are currently unknown. Using ectopic expression in the Drosophila eye as an assay, we have investigated the involvement of the mitochondrial protease encoded by omi in the Pink1/Parkin pathway and found that it acts genetically downstream of pink1 but functions independently of Parkin. Using the same approach, we also found that Rhomboid-7, a mitochondrial protease not previously implicated in PD, acts as an upstream component of this pathway, and showed that it is required to cleave the precursor forms of both Pink1 and Omi. These data further elucidate the composition of the Pink1 pathway and suggest that regulated intramembrane proteolysis is involved in its regulation.",

    "abstract": "Human movement disorders represent a significant and unresolved societal burden. Among these, the most prevalent is Parkinson's disease (PD), a disorder afflicting millions worldwide. Despite major advances, stemming primarily from human genetics, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of what factors underlie disease susceptibility, onset, and progression. Innovative strategies to discern specific intracellular targets for subsequent drug development are needed to more rapidly translate basic findings to the clinic. Here we briefly review the recent contributions of research using the nematode roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system for identifying and characterizing gene products associated with PD. As a microscopic but multicellular and genetically tractable animal with a well-defined nervous system and an experimentally tenable lifespan, C. elegans affords significant advantages to researchers attempting to determine causative and therapeutic factors that influence neuronal dysfunction and age-associated neurodegeneration. The rapidity with which traditional genetic, large-scale genomic, and pharmacological screening can be applied to C. elegans epitomizes the utility of this animal for disease research. Moreover, with mature bioinformatic and functional genomic data readily available, the nematode is well positioned to play an increasingly important role in PD-associated discoveries.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the relation between olfactory impairment (OI) and other impairment domains in Parkinson disease (PD) and the characteristics of OI in patients with certain genotypic characteristics.\nIn 295 nondemented patients with PD and 150 controls with a similar overall age and sex distribution, olfactory function was evaluated with the identification (ID) and discrimination (DIS) tests of the Sniffin' Sticks. In patients, demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated, and genetic analyses were performed.\nOf all patients, 61% had an impaired ID and 43% had an impaired DIS. No significant correlations >0.4 were found between olfactory scores and other demographic or clinical variables. Age and sex accounted for the 22% explained variance of the ID score regression model, whereas age, sex, and disease duration accounted for the 15% explained variance of the DIS score regression model. Parkin and DJ-1 mutation carriers (homozygous or heterozygous compound, n = 6) had normal ID scores. APOE epsilon2 or APOE epsilon4 carriers had no significantly different olfactory scores than noncarriers. The allele distribution of the alpha-synuclein (SNCA)-REP1 polymorphism in groups with an impaired or normal ID or DIS was comparable.\nOlfactory impairment (OI) in Parkinson disease (PD) may be unrelated to other impairment domains of the disease, which may indicate that olfaction is an independent feature of PD. Parkin and DJ-1 mutation carriers had normal identification scores but the number of mutation carriers is too small to draw conclusions. The APOE genotype (APOE epsilon2 or APOE epsilon4 alleles) and SNCA-REP1 polymorphism do not seem to influence olfaction in PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the changes of the pupil's light reflex (PLR) and mobility in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with and without cognitive disorder. Twenty two (22) patients (ten males, twelve females, mean age: 72.7+/-7.3 years) with identified PD entered the study. The patients were examined with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Wechsler II Memory Scale (WMS II) and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17). Eleven (11) patients (five males, six females, mean age: 72.09+/-7.06 years) were free of any cognitive deficits and eleven (11) patients (five males, six females, mean age: 73.36+/-7.55 years) had cognitive disorder according to the aforementioned scales. None of the patients satisfied the DSM-IV-TR criteria for depression or anxiety disorder. The patients underwent a pupillometric study in both eyes with single flash stimuli of 24.6 candelas/m(2) intensity and 20 ms duration. The pupillometric parameters that were studied were: Latency for the onset of Constriction (T1), Baseline Pupil Radius (R1), Minimum Pupil Radius after the pupil reaction to light (R2), Amplitude (AMP, R1-R2), Time for maximum Miosis (T2), Maximum Constriction Velocity (VCmax) and Maximum Constriction Acceleration (ACmax). The pupillometric findings of each group were compared to those of an age and sex matched group of eleven healthy subjects. Furthermore, a comparison between the findings of the two groups was conducted. ACmax and VCmax were significantly lower in patients without (PD) and with coexisting cognitive impairment (PDC) compared to normal subjects (NC) (p<0.001). Patients with cognitive impairment (PDC) had significantly lower levels of ACmax, VCmax and AMP than patients without cognitive deficits (PD). Cognitive impairment in PD, which mainly reflects a central cholinergic deficit, may be a crucial pathogenetic factor for the decrease in the aforementioned pupillometric parameters. VCmax and ACmax can be considered as the most sensitive indicators of this central cholinergic deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The prevalence is increasing with age and averages approximately 0.3% in the entire population. The clinical picture is dominated by the cardinal motor symptoms such as tremor at rest, bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, stooped posture and postural instability. Psychiatric comorbidity is common, comprising dementia, depression, anxiety and psychosis. Although many drugs have been developed and introduced into the market to provide symptomatic treatment, there is still no cure for PD and not even solid evidence for disease-modifying strategies. In addition, motor complications in advanced stages of the disease, side effects of the dopaminergic therapy, and non-motor symptoms remain huge challenges during long-term therapy. Thus, new therapeutic agents are desperately needed. Here, we describe current therapies and possible future developments that we hope will contribute to sustaining quality of life in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease for many years.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson Disease (PD) several aspects of saccades are affected. The saccade-generating brainstem neurons are spared, however, the signals they receive may be flawed. In particular voluntary saccades suffer, but the functional anatomy of the impairment of saccade-related cortical control is unknown. We measured blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activation with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while healthy participants and patients with PD performed horizontal voluntary saccades between peripheral visual targets or fixated centrally. We compared saccade-related BOLD-activity vs. fixation in patients with PD and in healthy controls and correlated perisaccadic BOLD-activity in PD patients with saccade kinetics (multistep saccades). Saccade related BOLD-activation was found in both PD and healthy participants in the superior parietal cortex (PEF) and the occipital cortex. Our results suggest remarkable hypoactivity of the frontal and supplementary eye fields (FEF and SEF) in PD patients. On the other hand, PD patients showed a statistically more reliable BOLD modulation than healthy participants in the posterior cingulate gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, precuneus and in the middle temporal gyrus. Given abnormal frontal and normal PEF responses, our results suggest that in PD a frontal cortical circuitry, known to be associated with saccade planning, selection, and predicting a metric error of the saccade, is deficient.",

    "abstract": "Enormous progress has been made in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). As a result of advances in experimental therapeutics, many promising therapies for PD are emerging. Levodopa remains the most potent drug for controlling PD symptoms, yet is associated with significant complications such as the \"wearing off\" effect, levodopa-induced dyskinesias and other motor complications. Catechol-o-methyl-transferase inhibitors, dopamine agonists and nondopaminergic therapy are alternative modalities in the management of PD and may be used concomitantly with levodopa or one another. The neurosurgical treatment, focusing on deep brain stimulation, is reviewed briefly. Although this review has attempted to highlight the most recent advances in the treatment of PD, it is important to note that new treatments are not necessarily better than the established conventional therapy and that the treatment options must be individualized and tailored to the needs of each individual patient.",

    "abstract": "Available data suggest that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have a significant socioeconomic impact owing partly to increased hospital and drug utilization. The aims of this study were to provide a profile of patients with PD who required admission to hospital and to determine the reasons for emergency admission.\nBetween September 1st, 2004 and August 31st, 2006, patients with PD who were admitted to our emergency department (ED) were included in the study. Patients with PD who were diagnosed by a neurologist formerly, and admitted to the ED with any reason constituted the study population. Demographical data, reasons for admission, years exposed to PD, number of admissions to the emergency department in the past 12 months, prior Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scores were recorded. H&Y was performed again for all patients 4 weeks after discharge.\nSeventy-six patients with PD were included in the study. Reasons for admission to hospital were infectious diseases (31.6%), trauma (27.6%), cardiovascular emergencies (14.5%), cerebrovascular emergencies (11.8%), gastrointestinal emergencies (7.9%), and electrolyte disturbances (6.6%), respectively. There was no dependence between the time of exposure to PD and H&Y score. Number of emergency admittance in the last 12 months was independent from the last H&Y score (p = 0.297). However, there was a dependency between the reasons for emergency admittance and the H&Y scores (p = 0.023).\nH&Y score is not dependent on the emergency admittance or on the outcome after discharge from the emergency department. The motor disability by itself cannot predict the whole picture of PD and the systemic complications leading to emergency admittance.",

    "abstract": "We examined whether pramipexole (PPX) can influence depressive scale in normal and mild depressive parkinsonian patients. In an open study of PPX as an add-on to L-dopa therapy or single administration, 36 nondemented outpatients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were entered first. All were in the stage II or III of Hoehn and Yahr scale (H&Y). PPX were started at 0.125 mg/day and daily doses were increased to 1.5 mg/day. At 3 months after PPX treatment, patients were re-evaluated. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III, H&Y stage, and freezing of gait questionnaire were compared in patients before and after PPX treatment. These scores were significantly improved after PPX administration. There were no correlations between HAM-D and those motor functions. We suggest that PPX treatment has antidepressant effects in depressive PD patients and also ameliorates HAM-D score in nondepressive PD patients in addition to motor function.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence suggests that pesticides and other environmental exposures may have a role in the etiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is little human data on risk associated with specific pesticide products, including organic pesticides such as rotenone with PD. Using a case-control design, this study examined self-reports of exposure to pesticide products, organic pesticides such as rotenone, and other occupational and environmental exposures on the risk of PD in an East Texas population. The findings demonstrated significantly increased risk of PD with use of organic pesticides such as rotenone in the past year in gardening (OR = 10.9; 95% CI = 2.5-48.0) and any rotenone use in the past (OR = 10.0; 95% CI = 2.9-34.3). Use of chlorpyrifos products (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.02-3.8), past work in an electronics plant (OR = 5.1; 95% CI = 1.1-23.6), and exposure to fluorides (OR = 3.3; 95% CI = 1.03-10.3) were also associated with significantly increased risk. A trend of increased PD risk was observed with work history in paper/lumber mill (OR = 6.35; 95% CI = 0.7-51.8), exposure to cadmium (OR = 5.3; 95% CI = 0.6-44.9), exposure to paraquat (OR = 3.5; 95% CI = 0.4-31.6), and insecticide applications to farm animals/animal areas and agricultural processes (OR = 4.4; 95% CI = 0.5-38.1). Cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and fish intake were associated with reduced risk. In summary, this study demonstrates an increased risk of PD associated with organic pesticides such as rotenone and certain other pesticides and environmental exposures in this population.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease and is an important cause of chronic disability. Numerous important advances have been made in our understanding of the aetiopathogenesis, pathology and clinical phenomenology of this disease, and these have underpinned advances in symptomatic treatment and the prospect that these might be extended into interventions that will slow progression. It is notable that the continuing characterisation of the downstream biochemical consequences of the genetic causes of PD serves only to reinforce this notion. Progress in the management of PD has continued, particularly in timing of drug initiation and the sequence and combinations in which drugs are used to improve long-term outcome and reduce drug-induced complications. Particular progress has been made in the field of neuroprotection, where novel therapies and clinical trial designs are being tested. This review will focus particularly upon this area.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) linked Parkinson's disease (PD) clinically present with typical idiopathic PD. However, LRRK2-linked PD displays a pleomorphic neuropathology and high variability in age at disease onset (AAO) which suggests that environmental and/or genetic factors other than the mutation itself influence the course of the disease. We investigated the modulation of AAO by genetic factors including the mutation-containing domain and PD associated polymorphisms in the gene coding alpha-synuclein (SNCA) and tau (MAPT) in 44 patients from 19 affected families. Using this limited number of available LRRK2 mutation carriers, we provide evidence that mutations in the kinase domain of Lrrk2 significantly decrease AAO compared to mutations in the ROC (Ras/GTPase of complex proteins) domain. Furthermore, polymorphic variations in MAPT show a significant association with AAO in individuals with LRRK2 mutations. Our results await replication in future studies with a larger number of LRRK2 mutation carriers, but indicate an association of mutation-affected protein domain and mutation-extrinsic genetic factors with AAO and suggest that these factors could contribute to explain the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in LRRK2-linked PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is associated with pathological oscillatory activity in a wide-range cerebral network of sensory and motor areas. A number of studies identified 5 Hz, 10 Hz and 20 Hz as predominant frequencies of oscillatory activity in this cerebral oscillatory network. Clinical evidence for the importance of the pathological oscillatory activity derives from studies showing modulation of motor deficits and cognitive performance during external stimulation of patients with Parkinson's disease at 5 Hz, 10 Hz and 20 Hz. Furthermore, high-frequency stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus successfully alleviates all cardinal motor deficits in Parkinson's disease probably by suppression of 5 Hz, 10 Hz and 20 Hz activity. However, the specific role of each of these frequencies so far remains unclear. The present commentary summarizes the current pathophysiological concepts of pathological oscillatory activity in Parkinson's disease and highlights the new ideas of modulatory intervention.",

    "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is a frequent but neglected problem in Parkinson's disease (PD). Decreased sexual desire in PD correlates with reduced general satisfaction from life. Many variables might be related to the loss of libido in PD and they have not been carefully investigated yet.\nTo assess the frequency of loss of libido in PD and its relation to neurological symptoms, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and cognitive performance.\nThe response of 90 PD patients of both genders to item \"loss of libido\" from the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was analyzed. A structured psychiatric interview (MINI-Plus) evaluated the presence of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Clinical assessment also comprised neurological examination, which included all sections of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn-Yahr and Schwab-England Scale (SES). The Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the PD Fatigue Scale (PDFS) were also performed.\nFrequency of loss of libido and its main predictors.\nThe frequency of loss of libido was 65.6%, and 42.6% of men also complained of erectile dysfunction. Ageing (P = 0.012), female gender (P < 0.001), lower education (P < 0.001), and depression (P = 0.006) associated with decreased sexual desire. Higher BDI scores (P < 0.001) correlated with a greater loss of libido. Decreased interest in sex was not associated with antidepressants. Neurological features associated with higher loss of libido were predominance of motor symptoms on the left side of the body (P = 0.026), autonomic dysfunction (P = 0.012), higher UPDRS scores (P = 0.006), and lower scores on SES (P = 0.003). In men, erectile dysfunction associated with decreased interest in sex (P < 0.001). Patients with lower performance on FAB (P < 0.001) and MMSE (P = 0.002), and with higher scores on PDFS (P < 0.001) also had less interest in sex. A multiple regression analysis indicated age, gender and BDI score as the main predictors of loss of libido.\nLoss of libido is frequent in PD and depression may be its main predictor. However, decreased interest in sex was not associated with antidepressant therapy. Thus, loss of libido resulting from depression may be effectively treated, and physicians should be encouraged to assess these symptoms in their patients.",

    "abstract": "Current therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer and Parkinson disease (AD and PD, respectively) are merely symptomatic, intended for the treatment of symptoms, but offer only partial benefit, without any disease-modifying activity. Novel promising strategies suggest the use of antiinflammatory drugs, antioxidants, iron-complexing molecules, neurotrophic factor delivery, inhibitors of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)-processing secretases, gamma and beta (that generate the amyloid-beta peptides, Abeta), anti-Abeta aggregation molecules, the interference with lipid cholesterol metabolism and naturally occurring plant flavonoids to potentially reverse the course of the diseases. Human epidemiological and new animal data suggest that tea drinking may decrease the incidence of dementia, AD, and PD. In particular, its main catechin polyphenol constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been shown to exert neuroprotective/neurorescue activities in a wide array of cellular and animal models of neurological disorders. In the current article, we review the literature on the impact of the multimodal activities of green tea polyphenols and their neuroprotective effect on AD and PD.",

    "abstract": "Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) is an essential enzyme for the formation of catecholamines, indolamines, and trace amines. Moreover, it is a required enzyme for converting L-DOPA to dopamine when treating patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). There is now substantial evidence that the activity of AAAD in striatum is regulated by activation and induction, and second messengers play a role. Enzyme activity can be modulated by drugs acting on a number of neurotransmitter receptors including dopamine (D1-4), glutamate (NMDA), serotonin (5-HT(1A), 5-HT(2A)) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Generally, antagonists enhance AAAD activity; while, agonists may diminish it. Enhancement of AAAD activity is functional, as the formation of dopamine from exogenous L-DOPA mirrors activity. Following a lesion of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, AAAD in striatum responds more robustly to pharmacological manipulations, and this is true for the decarboxylation of exogenous L-DOPA as well. We review the evidence for parallel modulation of AAAD activity and L-DOPA decarboxylation and propose that this knowledge can be exploited to optimize the formation of dopamine from exogenous L-DOPA. This information can be used as a blue print for the design of novel L-DOPA treatment adjuvants to benefit patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "We report 5 of 75 (6.6%) patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) submitted to subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) who developed transient disabling dyskinesias immediately after surgery. Dyskinesias persisted despite levodopa withdrawal, cessation or reduction of stimulation, and resolved spontaneously in a maximum period of 12 weeks without the need to change stimulation active contact. Compared to the rest of our PD patients submitted to STN-DBS, the dyskinesia group needed a lower levodopa-equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) over the time of follow-up. A microlesion in the STN, probably concealed in cerebral MRI by the electrode-related artifact, could have been involved in the etiopathology of our patients' symptoms. The presence of transient disabling dyskinesia in PD patients immediately after STN-DBS might be a predictor of good outcome as measured by a decrease in the LEDD needed.",

    "abstract": "Two strategies to manage symptom re-emergence due to wearing-off with conventional levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) therapy were compared in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in this randomized, open-label trial. PD patients receiving 3 daily doses of levodopa/DDCI were randomized to either levodopa/DDCI and entacapone or an increased dose frequency of levodopa/DDCI with or without an increased total daily dose (dose fractionation). After 1 month of treatment, patients were followed up for 1 year. A greater proportion of levodopa/DDCI and entacapone-treated patients had treatment success compared with dose-fractionated patients, according to investigator Clinical Global Impression of Change scores at 1 month (68 vs. 59%, respectively) and 1 year (60 vs. 51%, respectively). Mean 'off' time (time with symptoms) was improved in both groups at 1 month and 1 year, despite a reduction in the mean daily levodopa dose in the levodopa/DDCI and entacapone group at 1 month. The mean daily levodopa dose was increased in the dose fractionation group. At 1 month, there was a 4% reduction in patients experiencing dyskinesia with levodopa/DDCI and entacapone and a 3% increase with dose fractionation. These data suggest that levodopa/DDCI and entacapone reduces time with symptoms, the rate of motor complications and the daily levodopa dose compared with dose fractionation. However, as the observed differences were not statistically significant, further studies are required to confirm these results.",

    "abstract": "Torsion dystonia is an autosomal dominant movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive muscle contractions and twisted postures. The most severe early onset form of dystonia has been linked to mutations in the human DYT1 (TOR1A) gene encoding a protein termed torsinA. Moreover, dystonia and Parkinson disease share the common feature of reduced dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum, so we assumed that mutations in the DYT1 gene might have the same role in cases of early onset primary torsion dystonia (EOPTD) and early onset Parkinson disease (EOPD) that present dystonia. In this present study, 17 patients with EOPTD, 221 patients with EOPD and 164 control subjects were screened for mutations of the DYT1 gene by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis and DNA sequencing. Our results showed that the GAG deletion was identified in 7 EOPTD patients, which results in Glu302del of DYT1 gene. No mutations were found in EOPD patients and control subjects. By carefully reviewing the available literature on studies of sporadic, non-Ashkenazi Jewish populations, the results showed that the prevalence rate of DYT1 mutation was not significantly different (p=0.267) between European (27.3%) and Asian (22.2%) patients with early onset primary torsion dystonia.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a common symptom in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) and markedly reduces their quality of life. As post-mortem studies have shown, its presence may reflect extensive cell loss in the midbrain and brainstem with imbalances in monoaminergic neurotransmitters. However, in vivo evidence of specific monoaminergic deficits in depressed PD patients is still sparse. Therefore, we studied PD patients with depression (PD+D) and without depression (PD-D) using high-resolution single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and the monoamine transporter marker [(123)I]FP-CIT.\nA magnetic resonance imaging-based region-of-interest analysis was applied to quantify the specific-to-nondisplaceable [(123)I]FP-CIT binding coefficient V(3)'' in the striatum, thalamus and midbrain/brainstem regions.\nPD+D patients had significantly lower V(3)'' compared with PD-D patients in the striatum (p<0.001), thalamus (p=0.002), and midbrain/brainstem (p=0.025). Only PD+D patients without selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment showed lower thalamic and midbrain V(3)'' than controls (p<0.001, p=0.029). In a small sub-group of SSRI-treated PD+D patients neither thalamic V(3)'' nor midbrain/brainstem V(3)'' differed from those in PD-D patients (p=0.168, p=0.201) or controls (p=0.384, p=0.318).\nOur data indicate that depression in PD is associated with a more pronounced loss of striatal dopamine transporter availability that is most likely secondary to increased dopaminergic degeneration. In addition, depressed PD patients have a lower availability of midbrain/brainstem monoamine transporters than nondepressed PD patients. These findings provide in vivo evidence in support of the known post-mortem data demonstrating more extensive nerve cell loss in PD with depression and indicate that SPECT imaging can help to identify pathophysiological changes underlying nonmotor symptoms in this common movement disorder.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) on clinical grounds may be difficult, especially in the early stages of the disease. F-DOPA PET and FP-CIT SPECT scans are able to determine presynaptic dopaminergic activity in different ways. The aim of this study was to determine and compare the sensitivity and specificity of the two methods in the detection of striatal dopaminergic deficits in the same cohort of PD patients and healthy controls.\nMovement disorder specialists recruited 11 patients with early-stage PD and 17 patients with advanced PD. The patients underwent both an FP-CIT SPECT scan and an F-DOPA PET scan. In addition, 10 FP-CIT SPECT scans or 10 F-DOPA PET scans were performed in 20 healthy controls. A template with regions of interest was used to sample tracer activity of the caudate, putamen and a reference region in the brain. The outcome parameter was the striatooccipital ratio (SOR). Normal SOR values were determined in the controls. The sensitivity and specificity of both scanning methods were calculated.\nFP-CIT SPECT and F-DOPA PET scans were both able to discriminate PD patients from healthy controls. For the early phases of the disease, sensitivity and specificity of the contralateral striatal and putaminal uptake of FP-CIT and F-DOPA was 100%. When only caudate uptake was considered, the specificities were 100% and 90% for FP-CIT and F-DOPA, respectively, while the sensitivity was 91% for both scanning techniques.\nFP-CIT SPECT and F-DOPA PET scans are both able to diagnose presynaptic dopaminergic deficits in early phases of PD with excellent sensitivity and specificity.",

    "abstract": "Using hybrid-blocked/event-related fMRI and the 2-back task we aimed to decompose tonic and phasic temporal dynamics of basal ganglia response abnormalities in working memory associated with early untreated Parkinson's disease. In view of the tonic/phasic dopamine hypothesis, which posits a functional division between phasic D(2)-dependent striatal updating processes and tonic D(1)-dependent prefrontal context-maintenance processes, we predicted that newly diagnosed, drug-na\u00efve Parkinson's disease patients, with selective striatal dopamine deprivation, would demonstrate transient rather than sustained activation changes in the basal ganglia during 2-back performance. Task-related activation patterns within discrete basal ganglia structures were directly compared between patients and healthy elderly controls. The obtained results yielded uniquely transient underactivation foci in caudate nuclei, putamen and globus pallidus in Parkinson's disease patients, which indicates suboptimal phasic implementation of striatal D(2)-dependent gating mechanisms during updating. Sustained underactivation was only seen in the anterior putamen, which may reflect initial signs of tonic control impairment. No significant changes were exhibited in prefrontal cortex. The present findings resonate well with the tonic/phasic dopamine account and suggest that basal ganglia under-recruitment associated with executive dysfunction in early Parkinson's disease might predominantly stem from deficiencies in phasic executive components subserved by striatum.",

    "abstract": "The effect of deep brain stimulation on the two speech-production subsystems, articulation and phonation, of nine Parkinsonian patients is examined. Production parameters (stop closure voicing; stop closure, VOT, vowel) in fast syllable-repetitions were defined and measured and quantitative, objective metrics of vocal fold function were obtained during vowel production. Speech material was recorded for patients (with and without stimulation) and for a reference group of healthy control speakers. With stimulation, precision of the glottal and supraglottal articulation as well as the phonatory function is reduced for some individuals, whereas for other individuals an improvement is observed. Importantly, the improvement or deterioration is determined not only on the basis of the direction of parameter change but also on the individuals' position relative to the healthy control data. This study also notes differences within an individual in the effects of stimulation on the two speech subsystems. These findings qualify the value of global statements about the effect of neurostimulatory operations on Parkinsonian patients. They also underline the importance of careful consideration of individual differences in the effect of deep brain stimulation on different speech subsystems.",

    "abstract": "To explore the use of noninvasive functional imaging and \"virtual\" lesion techniques to study the neural mechanisms underlying motor speech disorders in Parkinson's disease. Here, we report the use of positron emission tomography (PET) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to explain exacerbated speech impairment following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in a patient with Parkinson's disease.\nPerceptual and acoustic speech measures, as well as cerebral blood flow during speech as measured by PET, were obtained with STN-DBS on and off. TMS was applied to a region in the speech motor network found to be abnormally active during DBS. Speech disruption by TMS was compared both perceptually and acoustically with speech produced with DBS on.\nSpeech production was perceptually inferior and acoustically less contrastive during left STN stimulation compared to no stimulation. Increased neural activity in left dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) was observed during DBS on. \"Virtual\" lesioning of this region resulted in speech characterized by decreased speech segment duration, increased pause duration, and decreased intelligibility.\nThis case report provides evidence that impaired speech production accompanying STN-DBS may result from unintended activation of PMd. Clinical application of functional imaging and TMS may lead to optimizing the delivery of STN-DBS to improve outcomes for speech production as well as general motor abilities.",

    "abstract": "Cough provides high expiratory airflows to aerosolize and remove material that cannot be adequately removed by ciliary action. Cough is particularly important for clearing foreign particles from the airway in those with dysphagia who may be at risk for penetration/aspiration (P/A). Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) was tested to improve cough and swallow function.\nTen male participants, diagnosed with Parkinson disease (PD), with videofluorographic evidence of penetration or with evidence for aspiration of material during swallow of a thin 30-mL bolus, completed 4 weeks of an EMST program to test the hypothesis that EMST would improve cough and/or swallow function. Measured parameters from an airflow waveform produced during voluntary cough, pre-EMST and post-EMST, included inspiration phase duration, compression phase duration (CPD), expiratory phase peak flow (EPPF), expiratory phase rise time (EPRT), and cough volume acceleration (VA) [ie, the EPPF/EPRT ratio]. The swallow outcome measure was the degree of P/A during the swallow task.\nThere was a significant decrease in the duration of the CPD and EPRT; the decrease in EPRT resulted in a significant increase in cough VA. Significant decreases in the P/A scores were found posttraining.\nThe results demonstrate that EMST is a viable treatment modality for a population of participants with PD at risk of aspiration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson plus diseases, comprising mainly progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are rare neurodegenerative conditions. We designed a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of riluzole as a potential disease-modifying agent in Parkinson plus disorders (NNIPPS: Neuroprotection and Natural History in Parkinson Plus Syndromes). We analysed the accuracy of our clinical diagnostic criteria, and studied prognostic factors for survival. Patients with an akinetic-rigid syndrome diagnosed as having PSP or MSA according to modified consensus diagnostic criteria were considered for inclusion. The psychometric validity (convergent and predictive) of the NNIPPS diagnostic criteria were tested prospectively by clinical and pathological assessments. The study was powered to detect a 40% decrease in relative risk of death within PSP or MSA strata. Patients were randomized to riluzole or matched placebo daily and followed up to 36 months. The primary endpoint was survival. Secondary efficacy outcomes were rates of disease progression assessed by functional measures. A total of 767 patients were randomized and 760 qualified for the Intent to Treat (ITT) analysis, stratified at entry as PSP (362 patients) or MSA (398 patients). Median follow-up was 1095 days (range 249-1095). During the study, 342 patients died and 112 brains were examined for pathology. NNIPPS diagnostic criteria showed for both PSP and MSA excellent convergent validity with the investigators' assessment of diagnostic probability (point-biserial correlation: MSA r(pb) = 0.93, P < 0.0001; PSP, r(pb) = 0.95, P < 0.0001), and excellent predictive validity against histopathology [sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) for PSP 0.95 (0.88-0.98) and 0.84 (0.77-0.87); and for MSA 0.96 (0.88-0.99) and 0.91 (0.86-0.93)]. There was no evidence of a drug effect on survival in the PSP or MSA strata (3 year Kaplan-Meier estimates PSP-riluzole: 0.51, PSP-placebo: 0.50; MSA-riluzole: 0.53, MSA-placebo: 0.58; P = 0.66 and P = 0.48 by the log-rank test, respectively), or in the population as a whole (P = 0.42, by the stratified-log-rank test). Likewise, rate of progression was similar in both treatment groups. There were no unexpected adverse effects of riluzole, and no significant safety concerns. Riluzole did not have a significant effect on survival or rate of functional deterioration in PSP or MSA, although the study reached over 80% power to detect the hypothesized drug effect within strata. The NNIPPS diagnostic criteria were consistent and valid. They can be used to distinguish between PSP and MSA with high accuracy, and should facilitate research into these conditions relatively early in their evolution.",

    "abstract": "Changes to the efficiency and integrity of swallowing mechanisms are inevitable in Parkinson disease (PD); however, it remains unclear how many people with PD are at risk of dysphagia. The aim of this study was to establish the frequency of impaired swallowing in people with PD and the relationship between swallowing performance and indicators of disease progression.\nA community-based and hospital-based cohort of 137 individuals with PD were asked to drink 150 ml of water as quickly as possible while in an 'off drug' state.\nThirty-one (23%) patients could not completely drink the full 150 ml. Swallowing rate (ml/sec) fell to more than 1 SD below published norms for 115 (84%) patients and to more than 2SD below for 44 (32%) individuals. There were moderate correlations between rate of swallowing and disease severity, depression and cognition, but not between swallowing speed and disease duration. There was poor correlation between subjective reports of dysphagia and performance on the water swallow test.\nSwallowing problems are frequent in PD. Self-report of 'no difficulty' is not a reliable indicator of swallowing ability. Studies employing more-objective assessment of aspiration risk to compare with water swallow test performance are advocated.",

    "abstract": "Humans often synchronize movements to the beat, indicating that motor areas may be involved in detecting or generating a beat. The basal ganglia have been shown to be preferentially activated by perception of rhythms with a regular beat (Grahn and Brett, 2007), but their necessity for beat-based rhythm processing has not been proven. Previous research has shown that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are impaired in timing of isochronous intervals (Harrington et al., 1998a; O'Boyle et al., 1996), but little work has tested more complex rhythms. In healthy volunteers, behavioural performance is better for rhythms with a beat than without a beat (Essens, 1986). We tested PD patients and controls on a rhythm discrimination task to determine if basal ganglia dysfunction results in an impairment of processing rhythms that have a beat. Unlike rhythm reproduction, discrimination has no motor requirements that are problematic for patients. Half the rhythms had a beat-based structure, and half did not. Subjects heard a rhythm twice and then indicated if a third presentation of the rhythm was the same or different. We predicted that PD patients would benefit less from beat structure than controls, resulting in a group by rhythm-type interaction, with reduced relative performance for the beat-based sequences in the PD group. Indeed this was the pattern of the results. In the control group, a significant advantage was observed for discrimination of rhythms with a beat compared to those without a beat. This advantage was greatly reduced in the PD group. Discrimination of beat-based rhythms was significantly impaired in PD patients compared to controls, whereas discrimination of non-beat-based rhythms did not differ significantly. This suggests that the basal ganglia are part of a system involved in detecting or generating an internal beat, and that this system is compromised in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Melanomas occur more frequently among subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) and a biological explanation for this epidemiological observation is lacking. It is also well-known that pigmentation genes play an important role in the development of melanomas. It is therefore suggested that the link between both diseases resides in genes that regulate pigmentation. Among these, those involved in the synthesis of dopamine and related compounds as melanin appear to be the most plausible candidates. Whilst it is known that individuals with fair phototypes have an increased risk for melanoma, this hypothesis suggests that the same applies to Parkinson's disease. It is therefore postulated that the accurate analysis of the phototype could be used to identify subjects at higher risk for both diseases, possibly allowing preventative interventions (photoprotective, nutritional, occupational) and prediction of risk in childhood. Another possible implication of this hypothesis is that therapeutic strategies targeting melanogenesis could maintain or perhaps restore the physiological concentrations of neuromelanin in the substantia nigra and achieve protection against neuronal loss in subjects at risk of developing PD.",

    "abstract": "Posture is often affected in Parkinson's disease. Postural abnormalities belong to the motor axial involvement. Generally, postural dysfunction induces clinical impairment at the latest stages of the disease, except in late-onset idiopathic Parkinson's disease and in atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Posture may be affected in its orientation component (stooped posture, camptocormia, Pisa syndrome) or in its balance component (loss of postural reflexes). Overall, postural impairment is poorly improved by levodopa, which implies that it is unlikely due to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation. Several methods of investigation have been proposed but are generally not available in clinical practice. Medical treatment and deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus pars interna are less efficient on axial than on distal motor signs. The pedonculopontine nucleus seems promising as a new target for DBS in combination with the subthalamic nucleus. Physical therapy is, in most cases, the best way to improve postural dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the nigrostriatal pathway is a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). The footfault test is a behavioural task in which rodents have their motor functions assessed. Here, we observed that unilaterally 6-OHDA-lesioned animals show a context-induced ipsilateral rotational behaviour when placed on the footfault apparatus for 3 min and this may be used as index to detect lesioned animals. Our results showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for lesions higher than 94% and 64%, respectively (ROC curve: AUC=0.988). A binary logistic regression model showed an expB=1.116 (95% CI, 1.007-1.236) and C=-9.081+/-4.554 (p=0.046) using the nigral tyrosine hidroxylase immunocontent as standard (each unit represents a 10%-lesion extension). Additionally, the footfault test was more sensitive than apomorphine challenging at 1mg/kg when these tests were carried out days apart and it was less sensitive than methylphenidate at 40 mg/kg (sign test, p<0.05). Therefore, the footfault test may be very useful in the PD animal model for screening animals since it is fast and simple and it does not require a drug to induce rotational activity.",

    "abstract": "We have recently observed that the corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) related peptide urocortin reverses key features of nigrostriatal damage in two paradigms of Parkinson's disease. Here we have studied whether these effects are supported by a retention of striatal basal and evoked extracellular dopamine and the receptor(s) that may mediate this effect. Fourteen days following stereotaxic injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and urocortin, extracellular dopamine levels in striata ipsilateral to injection sites of 6-OHDA/LPS and urocortin treated rats were comparable with sham injected rats, whilst rats given 6-OHDA/LPS and vehicle had considerably lower dopamine levels. Striatal dopamine levels in animals where urocortin injection was delayed by seven days were only modestly decreased compared to animals receiving 6-OHDA/LPS and urocortin concomitantly. Additionally, the dopamine metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were also preserved in dialysates from urocortin treated rats. The effects of urocortin were entirely blocked by the non-selective CRF receptor antagonist alpha-helical CRF as well as the selective CRF(1) antagonist NBI 27914 and were not replicated by the selective CRF(2) ligand urocortin III. In the substantia nigra tissue dopamine changes mirrored those seen in striatal extracellular dopamine. Our data strongly suggest that urocortin is capable of maintaining adequate nigrostriatal function in vivo via CRF(1) receptors following. neurotoxic challenge.",

    "abstract": "We present a clinimetric assessment of the Movement Disorder Society (MDS)-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). The MDS-UDPRS Task Force revised and expanded the UPDRS using recommendations from a published critique. The MDS-UPDRS has four parts, namely, I: Non-motor Experiences of Daily Living; II: Motor Experiences of Daily Living; III: Motor Examination; IV: Motor Complications. Twenty questions are completed by the patient/caregiver. Item-specific instructions and an appendix of complementary additional scales are provided. Movement disorder specialists and study coordinators administered the UPDRS (55 items) and MDS-UPDRS (65 items) to 877 English speaking (78% non-Latino Caucasian) patients with Parkinson's disease from 39 sites. We compared the two scales using correlative techniques and factor analysis. The MDS-UPDRS showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.79-0.93 across parts) and correlated with the original UPDRS (rho = 0.96). MDS-UPDRS across-part correlations ranged from 0.22 to 0.66. Reliable factor structures for each part were obtained (comparative fit index > 0.90 for each part), which support the use of sum scores for each part in preference to a total score of all parts. The combined clinimetric results of this study support the validity of the MDS-UPDRS for rating PD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in PARK7 DJ-1 have been associated with autosomal-recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). This gene encodes for an atypical peroxiredoxin-like peroxidase that may act as a regulator of transcription and a redox-dependent chaperone. Although large gene deletions have been associated with a loss-of-function phenotype, the pathogenic mechanism of several missense mutations is less clear. By performing a yeast two-hybrid screening from a human fetal brain library, we identified TRAF and TNF receptor-associated protein (TTRAP), an ubiquitin-binding domain-containing protein, as a novel DJ-1 interactor, which was able to bind the PD-associated mutations M26I and L166P more strongly than wild type. TTRAP protected neuroblastoma cells from apoptosis induced by proteasome impairment. In these conditions, endogenous TTRAP relocalized to a detergent-insoluble fraction and formed cytoplasmic aggresome-like structures. Interestingly, both DJ-1 mutants blocked the TTRAP protective activity unmasking a c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)- and p38-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest an active role of DJ-1 missense mutants in the control of cell death and position TTRAP as a new player in the arena of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The antiakinetic effect of internal Globus pallidus deep brain stimulation (Gpi-DBS) in Parkinson's disease is not clear and not either how this effect is modulated by L-dopa. METHODS Left Gpi-DBS and/or L-dopa effect was studied with auditory paced right-handed sequential movements on (15)O-butanol positron emission tomography (PET) in five patients. Rest and for conditions during movements (DBS off/L-dopa off; DBS on/L-dopa off; DBS off/L-dopa on; DBS on/L-dopa on) were compared with statistical parametric mapping. RESULTS Gpi-DBS activated the right supplementary motor area/premotor (SMA/PMC), and right insular cortex (IC), and as L-dopa decreased the left sensorimotor cortex (M1/S1) activity. L-dopa increased the left ventrolateral thalamus (VLTH), and decreased the left superior parietal cortex (PC) activity. Gpi-DBS and L-dopa interaction showed right SMA/PMC, IC, and left PC activation, decrease of left VLTH, PMC, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. CONCLUSIONS The improvement of bradykinesia with Gpi-DBS is secondary and contributed to the regress of M1/S1-related rigidity and compensatory SMA/PMC, and IC activation. L-dopa and Gpi-DBS alone each reduces M1/S1 overactivity. Interaction ignores this effect, moreover has akinetic effect in the left VLTH, PMC, and PFC. Motor improvement possibly related to left PC and compensatory right SMA/PMC, and IC activation.",

    "abstract": "Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations at the glucosecerebrosidase locus have recently been shown to be a potent risk factor for Lewy body disease. Based on this observation, we have re-evaluated the likelihood that the different PARK loci (defined using clinical criteria for disease) may be misleading attempts to find common pathways to pathogenesis. Rather, we suggest, grouping the different loci which lead to different Lewy body disease may be more revealing. Doing this, we suggest that several of the genes involved in disparate Lewy body diseases impinge on ceramide metabolism and we suggest that this may be a common theme for pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Rare, inherited mutations causing familial forms of Parkinson's disease have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the genetic and sporadic forms of this disease. Loss of protein function resulting from autosomal-recessive mutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), Parkin and DJ-1 has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, accumulation of abnormal and misfolded proteins, impaired protein clearance and oxidative stress. Accumulating evidence suggests that wild-type PINK1, Parkin and DJ-1 may be key components of neuroprotective signalling cascades that run in parallel, interact via cross talk or converge in a common pathway.",

    "abstract": "The last decade has seen clear links emerge between the genetic determinants and neuropathological hallmarks of parkinsonism and dementia, notably with the discovery of mutations in alpha-synuclein and tau. Following the description of mutations in LRRK2 linked to Parkinson's disease, characterized by variable pathology including either alpha-synuclein or tau deposition, it has been suggested that LRRK2 functions as an upstream regulator of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. This minireview explores this model, in the context of our current understanding of the biochemistry of LRRK2, alpha-synuclein and tau.",

    "abstract": "Although often less recognized than motor symptoms, non-motor effects represent an important source of disability for many parkinsonian patients. Of these non-motor symptoms, sialorrhoea, defined as the inability to control oral secretions resulting in excessive saliva accumulation in the oropharynx, constitutes perhaps one of the most bothersome and troubling problems, often causing social embarrassment and isolation. In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), this symptom is thought to be due to restricted swallowing and dysfunction, rather than to hypersecretion of saliva. Only a few well designed studies have been conducted to determine the optimal treatment for sialorrhoea in PD. A combination of approaches appears to be necessary to obtain successful results.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in LRRK2 gene are the most frequent cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) described, but their prevalence varies between populations. Patients, 418, with PD and 138 unrelated controls from the Basque Country were screened for LRRK2 G2019S and R1441G mutations. Of the patients, 3.82% were heterozygous carriers of G2019S and 13.15% of R1441G. G2019S frequency was higher in non-Basque population (6.0%), while R1441G was more common in Basque origin population (22.4%). Our conclusion is that both G2019S and R1441G mutations' frequency varies markedly between Basque and non-Basque origin population reinforcing the importance of ethnicity consideration when establishing mutation prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Little is known regarding the cognitive impairment in subjects with early, drug-na\u00efve Parkinson disease (PD). The aim of this study was to explore the proportion with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subtypes in an incidence cohort of untreated PD in Southern and Western Norway.\nA total of 196 non-demented, drug-naive patients who were recruited after an extensive search of all new cases of PD in the area and 201 healthy control subjects completed a battery of neuropsychological tests of verbal memory, visuospatial, and attentional-executive functioning. Subjects were classified as MCI if the age- and education-corrected z-score was falling 1.5 standard deviations below the mean for at least one of the cognitive domains.\nThe PD group was more impaired on all neuropsychological tests than controls, but the effect sizes were small. The largest effect size was found for verbal memory. A total of 18.9% of the patients with PD were classified as MCI, with a relative risk of 2.1 (1.2-3.6) in PD compared to the control group. Patients with PD with and without MCI did not differ significantly regarding demographic and motor features. Among PD-MCI patients, nearly two-thirds had a non-amnestic MCI subtype, and one third had an amnestic MCI subtype.\nThe findings demonstrate a twofold increase in the proportion with cognitive impairment in subjects with early, untreated Parkinson disease (PD) compared to controls. This has implications for diagnosis and management of PD.

It is unclear, whether cerebral and extracranial Lewy body type-degeneration in PD are coupled or not. To address this question, cerebral [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT - to quantify cerebral nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration - and myocardial [(123)I]MIBG scintigraphy - to quantify extracranial myocardial sympathetic degeneration - were performed in 95 PD patients and 20 healthy controls. At each Hoehn and Yahr stage separately, myocardial MIBG uptake correlated significantly with striatal FP-CIT uptake. No such correlation was found in the controls. Cerebral and extracranial Lewy body type-degeneration in PD do not develop independently from each other but develop in a strongly coupled manner. Obviously cerebral and extracranial changes are driven by at least similar pathomechanisms. Our findings in controls contradict a physiological correlation between nigrostriatal dopaminergic and myocardial sympathetic function.",

    "abstract": "Microglial activation and adaptive immunity have been implicated in the neurodegenerative processes in Parkinson disease. It has been proposed that these responses may be triggered by modified forms of alpha-synuclein (alpha-SYN), particularly nitrated species, which are released as a consequence of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. To examine the relationship between alpha-SYN, microglial activation, and adaptive immunity, we used a mouse model of Parkinson disease in which human alpha-SYN is overexpressed by a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector, serotype 2 (AAV2-SYN); this overexpression leads to slow degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Microglial activation and components of the adaptive immune response were assessed using immunohistochemistry; quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to examine cytokine expression. Four weeks after injection, there was a marked increase in CD68-positive microglia and greater infiltration of B and T lymphocytes in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the AAV2-SYN group than in controls. At 12 weeks, CD68 staining declined, but B- and T-cell infiltration persisted. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines was enhanced, whereas markers of alternative activation (i.e. arginase I and interleukins 4 and 13) were not altered. Increased immunoreactivity for mouse immunoglobulin was detected at all time points in the AAV2-SYN animals. These data show that overexpression of alpha-SYN alone, in the absence of overt neurodegeneration, is sufficient to trigger neuroinflammation with both microglial activation and stimulation of adaptive immunity.",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is widely expressed in the mammalian brain. BDNF has been shown to promote differentiation and survival of all major neuronal types affected in Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized pathologically by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains factors that are important to the survival of dopaminergic neurons. In this study CSF BDNF concentrations were measured in patients with PD and in normal controls. A total of 48 CSF samples from patients with PD (n=24) and controls (n=24) were studied. We used Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study BDNF expression and concentration. The amount of BDNF was clearly increased in CSF samples from patients with PD when compared with normal CSF. BDNF could be involved in the pathophysiology of PD.",

Dementia was diagnosed at phase 2 as per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. Possible Alzheimer's disease (AD) and possible vascular dementia (VD) were diagnosed along the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neuroscienes criteria, respectively.\nThe overall age- and race-standardized dementia prevalence was 1.26% (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.10-1.45). Prevalence (in 5-year age bands) was 0.08% (50-54), 0.08% (55-59), 0.44% (60-64), 1.16% (65-69), 1.84% (70-74), 3.26% (75-79), 8.35% (80-84), and 16.42% (>/=85). From age 50 to 69, 65% of dementia cases were VD; at older ages, 60% were AD. Logistic regression (adjusted for age, sex, education) showed that Malays had twice the risk for AD as Chinese, and Indians had more than twice the risk for AD and VD than Chinese.\nSingapore's dementia prevalence, primarily influenced by its Chinese majority, is lower than seen in the West. The striking interethnic differences suggest a need for a dementia incidence study and further investigation of underlying genetic and cultural differences between the three ethnic groups in relation to dementia risk.",

    "abstract": "LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease is common enough to raise clinical questions such as which patients should be tested and what advice should be given. We discuss practical issues in the light of our experiences with real life Parkinson's disease patients. Neurologists should consider testing LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease patients with affected first degree relatives where the onset is over the age of 40 years. A common G2019S mutation makes genetic testing straightforward and cost-effective. Age-related or reduced genetic penetrance means that LRRK2 mutations are also found in sporadic Parkinson's disease patients; however, at present, there is little to support the widespread testing of these patients except in high-risk ethnic groups such as North African Arabs and Ashkenazi Jews. Incomplete penetrance also complicates presymptomatic testing, which is best undertaken in the context of appropriate genetic counselling.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac valvulopathy has been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with pergolide. The aim of this study was to clarify the frequency and severity of valvular heart disease (VHD) in patients treated with pergolide, levodopa or both. We evaluated VHD by transthoracic echocardiography in 25 patients who were taking pergolide, 29 patients taking levodopa and 20 patients taking both levodopa and pergolide. All groups were compared with two separate age-matched control groups. There was no increase in the frequency of any type of echocardiographically-significant valvulopathy in the pergolide groups. Echocardiographically significant aortic regurgitation was found in 8% of the patients in the pergolide group and in 37.9% of the patients in the levodopa group. There was no correlation between VHD and pergolide dose, cumulative dose or duration of therapy. The mean pergolide dose was 2.6+/-1.4 mg/day in the pergolide monotherapy group. We did not find any unequivocal evidence that pergolide causes significant valvular regurgitation. However, the mean pergolide dosage in our study was lower than in previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to significant improvement in Parkinsonian features; however, the treatment response is hampered by the appearance of motor complications, including dyskinesias and motor fluctuations. These motor complications have a significant negative impact on quality-of-life. Therapeutic strategies using different types and timing of dopaminergic therapy may influence the emergence of motor complications. While sustained release preparations of levodopa have not shown benefit over immediate release preparations, the early combination of a dopamine agonist with levodopa appears to reduce the onset of motor fluctuations. An even larger body of evidence has found that initiating treatment with a dopamine receptor agonist (as compared to immediate release levodopa) is associated with a reduction in motor fluctuations, particularly dyskinesias. These data have led to evidence-based medicine evaluations indicating that the use of dopamine agonists is efficacious and clinically useful for the prevention of motor complications.",

    "abstract": "The management of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), although imperfect, has already been standardized. However, patients often spend their time idly despite improvement in the elemental motor symptoms. The main cause of this may be anhedonia. Dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) is a troublesome condition that can occur as a complication of dopamine replacement therapy in PD. As anhedonia and DDS may be converse syndromes in PD patients, it is very important to overcome anhedonia to improve patients' quality of life. In this article, the author proposes the possibility of stimulating patients' desire to participate in physical activity via the incentive of a reward system. Understanding the mechanism of DDS may help in the development of this type of approach.",

    "abstract": "A systematic review of the literature found 23 randomized clinical trials reflecting specific core areas of physical therapy (PT), that is, transfer, posture, balance, reaching and grasping, gait, and physical condition. All studies were of moderate methodological quality. Important limitations of the studies were: (1) insufficient statistical power (type II error); (2) poor methodological quality due to inadequate randomization and blinding procedures; (3) insufficient contrast in dosage and treatment between experimental and control groups; and (4) lack of appropriate measurement instruments able to identify clinically meaningful changes according to the International Classification of Functioning (ICF). In the last 5 years, the methodological quality of RCTs has shown substantial improvement. Most high-quality studies investigated the effects of exercise therapy, including the use of external rhythms to improve gait and gait-related activities. The results of these trials suggest that the effects of PT are task- and context-specific. This indicates that the tasks that are trained tend not to generalize to related activities that are not directly trained in the rehabilitation programme itself, and suggests that future programmes should train meaningful tasks preferably in patients' home environment. In addition, the decline in treatment effects after an intervention has ended suggests the need for permanent treatment of patients with PD, i.e. chronic treatment for this chronic disease. Future studies should aim to develop responsive measurement instruments able to monitor meaningful changes in activities, as well as better understanding of insufficiently understood symptoms such as freezing, rigidity and bradykinesia and greater insight into neurophysiological mechanisms underlying training-induced changes in activities such as improved gait performance by rhythmic cueing.",

    "abstract": "Synchronization of neuronal activity within and across distributed brain regions is a fundamental property of cortical and subcortical networks and serves a variety of functions including motor and cognitive processes. Data will be reviewed here from cross-sectional EEG and MEG studies to suggest that Parkinson's disease is characterized by changing patterns of disturbed neural synchrony that appear to be dependent on the stage of disease. Some of these alterations in neural synchrony may directly account for a number of disease-related impairments in motor and cognitive functions. Future longitudinal studies are required to fully understand the disturbances of functional brain networks in Parkinson's disease and how they evolve throughout the course of the disease.",

    "abstract": "A number of independent studies provide evidence that transcranial sonography (TCS) is helpful in the diagnosis of idiopathic and monogenetic Parkinson's disease (PD). In the clinical setting, it may exclude a number of secondary or atypical parkinsonian syndromes at very early stages. TCS may additionally depict morphological alterations of symptoms associated with PD motor features like midline alterations in PD-associated depression. Importantly, substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity, the typical ultrasound marker of PD, can also be found in approximately 9% of healthy subjects. PET studies and conditions challenging the dopaminergic system indicate that this stable ultrasound feature has a functional relevance. Ongoing longitudinal studies test the hypothesis that SN hyperechogenicity is a risk marker for nigrostriatal vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "Functional imaging can be used to detect preclinical evidence of dopamine deficiency in people deemed to be at increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) based on genetic or environmental risk, or because they have clinical features such as REM sleep behaviour disorder that may be a harbinger of PD. Positron emission tomography (PET) using [11C]dihydrotetrabenazine to label the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2), a variety of 11C- or 18F-labeled ligands for the membrane dopamine transporter (DAT), or 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa (FD), which assesses uptake and decarboxylation of levodopa as well as vesicular storage of radiolabeled dopamine, can all be used, and all provide comparable, but somewhat different information. DAT binding using either PET or SPECT appears to be the most sensitive marker of dopamine denervation, while FD uptake is subject to compensatory upregulation and its reduction may more closely herald the onset of clinical disease. Alterations in glucose metabolism and in dopamine release also occur in the asymptomatic hemisphere of subjects with unilateral PD. An interesting potential application of PET is the determination of non-dopaminergic abnormalities that correlate with the presence of clinically apparent pre-motor symptoms of PD.",

This article illustrates how changes in the plasticity of these circuits is linked to the expression of dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease, and may even underlie the tendency of some individuals to develop focal dystonia. Indeed, gradual normalisation of this excessive plasticity occurs after initiating deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus in patients with generalised dystonia. It may therefore relate to the slow onset of clinical improvement that occurs over the first 6 weeks or so of treatment.",

Thus, multiple cellular hits are likely to contribute to neurodegeneration in PD. If such a mechanism happens to occur, our therapeutic intervention may perhaps require a cocktail of molecules acting on various pathways simultaneously. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that PD may progress even when the initial cause of neurodegeneration has disappeared, suggesting that toxic substances released by the glial cells may be involved in the perpetuation of neuronal degeneration. This may thus represent a therapeutic target for PD.",

Pathologically, there is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that project to the striatum. Current available therapies for PD are targeted to the restoration of striatal dopamine. These approaches may alleviate symptoms transiently, but fail to slow the progression of disease. One emergent therapeutic approach is the use of neurotrophic factors to halt or reverse the loss of dopaminergic neurons. There have been intensive research efforts both preclinically and clinically testing the efficacy and safety of neurotrophic factors for the treatment of PD. In this review, we discuss the neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties of various trophic factors, both old and recent, and their status as therapeutic molecules for PD.",

    "abstract": "The excitatory corticostriatal pathway, which plays a critical role in the building up and storage of adaptive motor behaviours, can undergo long-lasting, activity-dependent changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission, named long-term potentiation (LTP) and long- term depression (LTD). Both forms of plasticity are thought to underlie motor learning and depend upon the concomitant activation of glutamatergic corticostriatal and dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathways. Accordingly, corticostriatal LTP and LTD are altered in Parkinson's Disease (PD) models. The dopamine (DA)/acetylcholine(Ach) synaptic unbalance could be responsible of some of the cognitive deficits described in PD patients. The impairment of DA/ACh-dependent cellular learning could lead to the storage of unessential memory traces, as it has been postulated for the induction of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Other non-motor symptoms involve not only the central dopaminergic system, but also in the noradrenergic, serotoninergic and cholinergic transmitter systems.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput gene-based platform studies in human post-mortem substantia nigra from sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) cases have revealed significant dysregulation of genes involved in biological processes linked to previously established neurodegenerative mechanisms both in sporadic and hereditary PD. These include protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, cell cycle, vesicle trafficking, synaptic transmission, dopamine metabolism and cell adhesion/cytoskeleton maintenance. These observations have extended our current view on the molecular pathways underlying the etio-pathology of the disease and provided a basis for the development of a novel genetic model of sporadic PD, centered on gradual silencing/over-expression of the candidate genes. The uncovered signatures may serve as future predictive biomarkers for early PD diagnosis, disease progression and drug development.",

    "abstract": "Our knowledge regarding the genetics of Parkinson's disease (PD) and parkinsonism has evolved dramatically during the past decade, with the discovery of numerous loci and genes. The LRRK2 gene has emerged as the most commonly involved in both familial and sporadic PD. Several variants in LRRK2 and SNCA have been associated with an increased risk of sporadic PD. PRKN, PINK1 and DJ1 mutations cause early-onset recessively inherited PD. Autosomal dominant dementia and parkinsonism is caused by mutations in the MAPT gene, and in the most recently discovered PGRN gene.",

    "abstract": "It has become increasingly apparent that Parkinson's disease (PD) can no longer be considered purely a motor disease, as numerous sensory alterations accompany this disorder either before or early in its clinical progression. Most notable among such disturbances are decrements in smell function. Such anomalies have been documented in approximately 90% of patients with early-stage sporadic PD and appear to progress little, if at all, with the development of the more classic PD-related motor symptoms. In this paper, I briefly review the nature of the olfactory dysfunction observed in PD and current theories as to its pathological basis.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is relatively common in Parkinson's Disease (PD). When dementia occurs in the setting of PD, it is referred to as Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), which is distinguished from the clinical syndrome in which dementia precedes extrapyramidal features, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In this report, the neuropathology of PDD and DLB is reviewed and preliminary findings are reported on striatal pathology in 28 brains, including 7 PD, 7 PDD and 14 DLB. Sections of putamen immunostained for a-synuclein and investigated with image analysis show that striatal pathology is common and that both cortical and striatal a-synuclein pathology is greater in PDD and DLB than PD. Most cases of PDD and DLB have Alzheimer-type pathology, particularly amyloid plaques, which may act in an additive or synergistic manner with a-synuclein pathology. There are few pathologic differences between PDD and DLB, despite differences in their clinical course.",

    "abstract": "Several members of the tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) family of monoamine alkaloids can be formed from dopamine or its oxidized metabolites and may be involved in the pathogenesis of monoaminergic cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD). Using enantiomeric-selective high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy, the regional concentrations of several TIQ derivatives, including salsolinols, were determined in mouse, rat, normal human, and PD brain. TIQ derivatives were detected in all regions subjected to analysis. In general, salsolinols were present at higher concentrations than TIQ and its benzyl and methyl derivatives, especially in human brain. Moreover, salsolinols were concentrated in areas with increased dopamine synthesis and turnover such as the ventral midbrain and striatum, respectively. A possible consequence of nigrostriatal dopaminergic cell death, significantly lower levels of (R)salsolinol, (S)salsolinol, N-methyl-(R)salsolinol and N-methyl-(S)salsolinol were found in the caudate nuclei of PD in comparison with normal human brain. Our data support the hypothesis of endogenous synthesis of salsolinols and provide evidence for their accumulation in catecholaminergic neurons.",

    "abstract": "alpha-synuclein is a small presynaptic protein (14,460 D) that is abundantly distributed in the brain. Although, its function is unknown, the aggregated form of alpha-synuclein is a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Epidemiological studies have shown that smoking can lessen the incidence of Parkinson's disease, indicating that smoke may contain chemicals that are neuro-protective. The fibrillation of alpha-synuclein was studied in relation to five different compounds found in cigarette smoke: anabasine, cotinine, hydroquinone, nicotine and nornicotine. Thioflavin T assays, gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography-high performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were utilized to monitor the rate of alpha-synuclein fibrillation and the inhibitory effects of the cigarette smoke components. We show that nicotine and hydroquinone inhibit alpha-synuclein fibril formation in a concentration-dependent manner, with nicotine being more effective. The SEC-HPLC data show that nicotine and hydroquinone stabilize soluble oligomers. The morphology of the oligomers stabilized by nicotine was evaluated by AFM, which showed the presence of three stable oligomers with an average height of 16 nm, 10 nm and 4 nm. Comparable results were obtained for the effect of the cigarette smoke components on the A53T mutant fibrillation. These results show that nicotine and hydroquinone inhibit alpha-synuclein fibrillation and stabilize soluble oligomeric forms. This information can be used to understand the molecular mechanism of the nicotine and hydroquinone action to develop therapeutic solutions for PD.",

    "abstract": "Tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) derivatives are putative neurotoxins that may contribute to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. One TIQ, norsalsolinol (NorSAL), is present in dopamine-rich areas of human brain, including the substantia nigra. Here, we demonstrate that NorSAL reduces cell viability and induces apoptosis via cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activation, and apoptosis induction were all inhibited by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Thus, reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to apoptosis induced by NorSAL. Treatment with NorSAL also increased levels of oxidative damage to DNA, a stimulus for apoptosis, in SH-SY5Y. To clarify the mechanism of intracellular DNA damage, we examined the DNA damage caused by NorSAL using (32)P-5'-end-labeled isolated DNA fragments. NorSAL induced DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II). Catalase and bathocuproine, a Cu(I) chelator, inhibited this DNA damage, suggesting that ROS such as the Cu(I)-hydroperoxo complex derived from the reaction of H(2)O(2) with Cu(I), promote DNA damage by NorSAL. In summary, NorSAL-generated ROS induced oxidative DNA damage, which led to caspase-dependent apoptosis in neuronal cells.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms, such as psychiatric symptoms and autonomic dysfunction, are common co-morbid conditions in Parkinson's disease (PD) and major contributors to poor quality of life and disability. Within the group of neuropsychiatric conditions, depressive symptoms are the most common condition. Despite their frequency and importance, depressive symptoms can be difficult to assess and diagnose and thus depression in PD is frequently unrealized. Diagnostic challenges include the overlap of depressive symptoms with motor and non-motor symptoms of PD, such as dementia and apathy. Furthermore, there are no definite standards to assess and diagnose depression in PD leading also to the lack of exact data on the epidemiology of this non-motor symptom in PD. Depending on the diagnostic test and the study design the prevalence of depression in PD is reported between 7 and 72% of PD patients with approximately 40% in most cross-sectional studies. In contrast, the pathogenesis and long-term course of depression in PD remain elusive. Current hypothesis, however, includes that depressive symptoms are part of the core condition of PD when regarded as an entity. The present review summarizes the current knowledge on epidemiology, pathogenesis and diagnosis of depression in PD and proposes on this data base a standard procedure for screening and diagnosis of depressive symptoms in PD.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) occasionally show food cravings and/or compulsive eating that result in significant, undesired weight gain. Dopamine replacement therapy may be the cause of this type of eating disorder. We evaluated 60 consecutive patients to see if they had any alteration of eating patterns after starting levodopa. Among them, five (8.3%) patients exhibited characteristic alterations of food preference following the start of dopamine replacement therapy. One patient showed an undesirable weight gain. Of the five patients exhibiting food preference alterations, all showed increased preference to consume sweet snacks, although this alteration was not always associated with hyperphagia (eating too much). This type of dietary alteration was not related to a specific antiparkinsonian drug, and could be observed in patients undergoing dopamine agonist monotherapy. Alteration of eating behavior may not be uncommon in PD patients, and is possibly overlooked. Since dopamine is closely involved in acquisition of food preferences, dietary changes with/without compulsive eating may be a manifestation of an alteration of appetitive behaviors due to excessive dopaminergic neurotransmission.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic cell death in the substantia nigra (SN) is central to Parkinson's disease (PD), but the neurodegenerative mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. Iron accumulation in dopaminergic and glial cells in the SN of PD patients may contribute to the generation of oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and neuronal death. The mechanisms involved in iron accumulation also remain unclear. Here, we describe an increase in the expression of an isoform of the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1/Nramp2/Slc11a2) in the SN of PD patients. Using the PD animal model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxication in mice, we showed that DMT1 expression increases in the ventral mesencephalon of intoxicated animals, concomitant with iron accumulation, oxidative stress, and dopaminergic cell loss. In addition, we report that a mutation in DMT1 that impairs iron transport protects rodents against parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxins MPTP and 6-hydroxydopamine. This study supports a critical role for DMT1 in iron-mediated neurodegeneration in PD.",

    "abstract": "To assess possible differences in dopamine metabolism that could parallel disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD), we measured dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in PD patients at different stages of disease: de novo (DEN), advanced not showing dyskinesias (ADV), and advanced with dyskinesias (DYS). DA, homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were significantly higher in DEN patients compared with other groups. A negative exponential correlation related DA level and disease duration. The HVA/DA ratio was significantly higher in the ADV and DYS group than that found in DEN group. Our data show that disease progression produces an early large decay of DA levels, followed by a stabilization. On the contrary, a late change in DA turnover (increased HVA/DA ratio) is documented in patients with longer disease duration. Our results suggest that the appearance of dyskinesia may not be related to a further loss of DA terminals but to a different, abnormal, DA turnover.",

    "abstract": "The study has investigated the effect of NMDA-glutamate receptor antagonist memantine in the 52-weeks therapy of 32 PD patients with dementia (PDD) compared with the control group (30 cases). Patients of the active group received memantine (20 mg per day) additionally to dopaminergic therapy. Patients from the control group continued the treatment with antiparkinsonian drugs. Cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms have been assessed before and after 12, 24 and 52 weeks of the study using clinical assessment as well as rating scales including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), ADAS-cog, clock drawing test, D-KEFS Verbal Fluency test, the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-12) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale (DAD). The plasma total Hcy level was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Patients treated with memantine had better MMSE (p<0,05), ADAS-cog (p<0,05), clock drawing test (p<0,05) and FAB (p<0,01) scores compared to patients in the control group at week 24. Patients with elevated Hcy demonstrated a significantly better response to memantine therapy versus the controls with elevated Hcy at week 24, 52 with respect to all efficacy measures (UPDRS, MMSE, ADAS-cog, D-KEFS, Verbal Fluency test, FAB, NPI, DAD, p<0,05). The NPI individual item scores changes from baseline to week 52 have shown benefits to memantine treatment compared with the controls with significant treatment differences for disinhibition (p<0,006), irritability (p<0,04), anxiety (p<0,04) and hallucinations (p<0,048). Hyperhomocysteinemia may indicate the more rapid cognitive and motor decline in PD. The prolonged therapy with memantine in PDD led to improvements in cognitive functions and preservation of motor functional abilities as well as the amelioration of neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment (CD) have been studied in 88 patients with progressive Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been shown that CD in PD have a progressive character mostly due the increase of intensity of dysregulation and neurodynamic disorders, disturbances of visual-spatial functions and, in some cases, insufficiency of nominative speech function. A 2-5 years follow-up revealed the high frequency of transformation of moderate cognitive dysfunction into dementia. The old age of patients at baseline, late-onset and severity of disease were identified as predictors of CD progression in PD. The highest rate of CD progression was observed in patients with more pronounced premorbid disturbances of regulative and visual-spatial functions.",

    "abstract": "An aim of a study was to establish the relationship between pain, motor complications and depression in Parkinson's disease and evaluate an effect of the 3 months therapy with the dopamine receptor agonist pramipexole (mirapex). Seventy-eight patients with idiopathic parkinsonism, aged 56-73 years, including 18 patients in stage 1-1,5 of the disease; 31 patients - in stage 2; 20 patients - in stage 3 and 9 patients - in stage 4, were studied. A stable response to the therapy was observed in 28 patients, motor complications in 50. A patient's state was assessed with widely-used scales. Thirty patients were assigned to pramipexole as an add-on therapy to L-DOPA and amantadin. Patients with dementia did not receive pramipexole. Thirty-five patients (44,8%) had pain complaints. This percentage was significantly higher (62%) in patients with motor complications. Multiple regression analysis revealed that pain scores were significantly correlated with motor complication and motor fluctuation scores. Back pain scores were correlated with an extent of posture disturbances. Mild depression and depressed mood were found in 37 patients (47,4%). VAS scores in these patients were significantly higher compared to patients without mood disturbances. The intensity of pain was correlated with depression severity. Patients treated with mirapex reported the reduction of pain by 48,2% (p<0,0001) during the \"on-period\". During the \"off-period\", the reduction of pain intensity was less (23,7%) but still significant. Depression scores were decreased to the end of the 12th week of treatment from 15,2+/-2,3 to 10,4+/-3,5 (p<0,0001).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) probably represents a syndrome of different disorders and origins converging into a relatively uniform neurodegenerative process. Although clinical-pathological studies have suggested that the presymptomatic phase of PD may be relatively short, perhaps less than a decade, the authors postulate that the pathogenic mechanisms may begin much earlier, possibly even in the prenatal period. Thus, some patients with PD may be born with a fewer than normal number of dopaminergic (and nondopaminergic) neurons as a result of genetic or other abnormalities sustained during the prenatal or perinatal period; as a result of normal age-related neuronal attrition, they eventually reach the critical threshold (60% or more) of neuronal loss needed for onset of PD to become clinically manifest. The authors review the emerging evidence that genetic disruption of normal development, coupled with subsequent environmental factors (the so called multiple-hit hypothesis), plays an important role in the etiopathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons projecting from the substantia nigra to the striatum is a key pathological feature of the disease. Although pharmacological dopamine replacement is generally very effective in early disease, it is only a symptomatic therapy and can have significant side effects with long term use. One of the key strategies in a more restorative approach to PD therapy involves replacement of this degenerating nigro-striatal dopaminergic network with cells and several possible cell sources are being explored. While much experience and some success have been gained with fetal ventral mesencephalic (FVM) tissue transplants, the rapidly advancing stem cell field is providing attractive alternative options which circumvent many of the ethical and practical problems inherent in trials with FVM tissue. Of these embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells seem the most promising. However further development and optimisation of the safety and efficacy of the techniques involved in generating and manipulating these, as well as other, cell sources will be essential before any further clinical trials are carried out.",

The core of LBs was negative for GSK-3beta, while pGSK-3beta (Ser9) was present in only a small number of LB cores. Cortical LBs were positive for pGSK-3beta (Ser9) but not for GSK-3beta. Neither GSK-3beta nor pGSK-3beta (Ser9) was present in glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in the brains of multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients.

The EF of the older people was evaluated by neuropsychological testing, and for confounding variables such as attention, depressive symptoms and anxiety, before and after intervention. The 20 participants were assigned into Control (CG) and Trained (TG) Groups. The TG participated in generalized physical training for 6 months. The ANOVA showed a significant interaction (p<.05) that indicated a beneficial contribution of training on EF. No significant interactions were found in the results for confounding variables between groups and pre- and post-intervention, which supports the beneficial findings of physical exercise training on EF.",

    "abstract": "Rest tremor is one of the main symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), although in contrast to rigidity and akinesia, the severity of the tremor does not correlate well with the degree of dopamine deficiency or the progression of the disease. Studies suggest that akinesia in PD patients is related to abnormal increased beta (15-30 Hz) and decreased gamma (35-80 Hz) synchronous oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia. Here we investigated the dynamics of oscillatory activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during tremor. We used two adjacent microelectrodes to simultaneously record neuronal firing and local field potential (LFP) activity in nine PD patients who exhibited resting tremor during functional neurosurgery. We found that neurons exhibiting oscillatory activity at tremor frequency are located in the dorsal region of STN, where neurons with beta oscillatory activity are observed, and that their activity is coherent with LFP oscillations in the beta frequency range. Interestingly, in 85% of the 58 sites examined, the LFP exhibited increased oscillatory activity in the low gamma frequency range (35-55 Hz) during periods with stronger tremor. Furthermore, in 17 of 26 cases where two LFPs were recorded simultaneously, their coherence in the gamma range increased with increased tremor. When averaged across subjects, the ratio of the beta to gamma coherence was significantly lower in periods with stronger tremor compared with periods of no or weak tremor. These results suggest that resting tremor in PD is associated with an altered balance between beta and gamma oscillations in the motor circuits of STN.",

    "abstract": "We studied 54 idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with depressive disorders (DD) to compare the efficacy and the effect of treatment with sertraline in the usual formulation and in the liquid oral concentrate (LOC) formulation. After 6 months of sertraline treatment, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a decrement (p<0.001, for both formulations). Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire scores improved (p<0.005 for usual formulation and p<0.001 for LOC formulation), as did Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness scale and Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement scale scores (p=0.1, for both formulations). Mini Mental State Examination and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor subscores did not change. These results suggest that sertraline LOC may also be a useful treatment for DD in PD patients, especially for those with swallowing problems, and have significant benefit for quality of life, without worsening of parkinsonian features.",

    "abstract": "The physiopathology of gait and balance disorders in Parkinson's disease patients is still poorly understood. Levodopa treatment and subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation improve step length and walking speed, with less effect on postural instability. These disorders have been linked to dysfunction of the descending basal ganglia outputs to brainstem structures. In this study, we evaluated the effects of stimulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), on locomotion and balance in Parkinson's disease patients. Biomechanical parameters and leg muscle activity were recorded during gait initiation in seven selected patients operated for bilateral STN stimulation, out of 204 stimulated patients, with one contact of each electrode located within the SNr. Step length, anteroposterior and vertical velocities of the centre of gravity were studied, with special reference to the subjects' ability to brake the centre of gravity fall before foot-contact, and compared to seven controls. In Parkinson's disease patients, five treatment conditions were tested: (i) no treatment, (ii) levodopa treatment, (iii) STN stimulation, (iv) SNr stimulation and (v) combined levodopa treatment and STN stimulation. The effects of these treatments on motor parkinsonian disability were assessed with the UPDRS III scale, separated into 'axial' (rising from chair, posture, postural stability and gait) and 'distal' scores. Whereas levodopa and/or STN stimulation improved 'axial' and 'distal' motor symptoms, SNr stimulation improved only the 'axial' symptoms. Compared to controls, untreated Parkinson's disease patients showed reduced step length and velocity, and poor braking just prior to foot-contact, with a decrease in both soleus (S) and anterior tibialis (AT) muscle activity. Step length and velocity significantly increased with levodopa treatment alone or in combination with STN stimulation in both natural and fast gait conditions, and with STN stimulation alone in the fast gait condition. Conversely, SNr stimulation had no significant effect on these measures in either condition. In the natural gait condition, no fall in the centre of gravity occurred as step length was low and active braking was unnecessary. In the fast gait condition, braking was improved with STN or SNr stimulation but not with levodopa treatment, with an increase in the stance leg S muscle activity. These results suggest that anteroposterior (length and velocity) and vertical (braking capacity) gait parameters are controlled by two distinct systems within the basal ganglia circuitry, representing respectively locomotion and balance. The SNr, a major basal ganglia output known to project to pontomesencephalic structures, is postulated as being particularly involved in balance control during gait.",

    "abstract": "To date, a truly representative animal model of Parkinson disease (PD) remains a critical unmet need. Although toxin-induced PD models have served many useful purposes, they have generally failed to recapitulate accurately the progressive process as well as the nature and distribution of the human pathology. During the last decade or so, the identification of several genes whose mutations are causative of rare familial forms of PD has heralded in a new dawn for PD modelling. Numerous mammalian as well as non mammalian models of genetically-linked PD have since been created. However, despite initial optimism, none of these models turned out to be a perfect replica of PD. Meanwhile, genetic and toxin-induced models alike continue to evolve towards mimicking the disease more faithfully. Notwithstanding this, current genetic models have collectively illuminated several important pathways relevant to PD pathogenesis. Here, we have attempted to provide a comprehensive discussion on existing genetic models of PD.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative EEG (qEEG) findings in Parkinson disease (PD) have been reported in only five previous studies. In these studies, the sample size was small and the distribution of qEEG changes was not estimated. This is the first qEEG evaluation not only employing multiple logistic regression analysis but also estimating the distribution of qEEG changes. The subjects comprised 45 PD patients without remarkable dementia and 40 age-adjusted normal controls. The lack of ischemic lesions in all subjects was confirmed by MRI. Absolute power values were measured for four frequency bands from delta to beta. The electrodes were divided into six, viz. frontal pole, frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital locations. We calculated the spectral ratio, i.e., the sum of the power values in the alpha and beta waves divided by the sum of the values in the slow waves. The dependent variable was either PD or normal control; the independent variables were the spectral ratios, age, sex, and Mini-Mental State Examination score. The significant predictive variables in PD were the spectral ratios at all electrode locations except for the frontal pole (frontal location: P = 0.025, other locations: P < 0.01). PD presented diffuse slowing in the qEEG when compared with age-adjusted normal controls.",

Additionally, covariance analysis was performed to extract regions in which increased change in regional cerebral metabolism correlated significantly with increased Mini-Mental State Examination scores.\nThe statistical parametric mapping analysis indicated that significantly increased cerebral metabolism after ChEI therapy, compared with at baseline, was most evident in the left angular gyrus extending to the supramarginal area and left superior and middle frontal gyri.

However, the exact nature of these deficits and the ability of dopamine medication to correct them have not been thoroughly examined in previous studies. For instance, it remains unclear whether PD patients have globally impaired sensorimotor integration functions or selective deficiencies in processing proprioception. We evaluated the specific deficits of PD patients in sensorimotor integration and proprioceptive processing by testing their ability to perform three-dimensional (3D) reaching movements in four conditions in which the sensory signals defining target and hand positions (visual and/or proprioceptive) varied. Ten healthy subjects and 11 PD patients, ON dopamine medication and in the OFF state, were tested. PD patients in the OFF state showed a greater mean level of 3D errors relative to controls when the only available sensory information about target and hand position came from proprioception, but this difference did not reach significance. This indicates that deficient proprioception is not an early key feature of PD. Interestingly, the inaccuracies of a number of PD subjects further increased in the ON medicated state relative to healthy controls when reaching to proprioceptively-defined targets, and this between group difference was statistically significant. However, dopamine medication did not consistently degrade the reaching accuracy of PD patients, with both negative and positive effects on accuracy of reaching to proprioceptive-defined targets. Together, these findings indicate that dopamine replacement therapy not only did not normalize sensorimotor performance to the level of controls, but also induced deficits in the processing of proprioceptive information in some of the PD patients tested. Furthermore, the diversity of effects of medication on accuracy of reaching to proprioceptively-defined targets supports the idea that dysfunction of dopaminergic circuits within the basal ganglia is not primarily responsible for the proprioceptive processing deficits of PD patients.",

The Nissen serial reaction time task (SRTT) software version II (as a task of procedural learning), the Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese version (WMS-CR), and two tasks of implicit memory were applied to 20 PD patients with a Hoehn-Yahr score at I-II degrees and 20 matched healthy controls were enrolled for the Nissen Version test. In the explicit WMS-CR and the implicit (word stem completion and degraded picture naming) tasks, the patients' scores fell within normal limits. In the SRTT, healthy controls displayed significantly reduced response times and error rates across the blocks of repeated sequence trials. In contrast, PD patients only showed a reduction in error rates but no change in response times. Impairment of nigrostriatal pathways selectively affects the performance in visuo-motor learning tasks such as the SRTT, but not in both the explicit tasks of WMS-CR and the implicit tasks.",

Functional imaging evidenced pathological overactivity in motor cortical areas in advanced PD that can be normalized by effective therapies.\nWe studied resting state cerebral blood flow pre-operatively and 12 months after surgery in 40 patients with advanced PD using ECD-SPECT. SPECT scans were also acquired 1 year apart in 21 matched PD controls who did not undergo surgery. Statistical analysis was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM2) software. In addition, we correlated brain perfusion changes after surgery with clinical improvement, assessed using the unified PD rating scale motor score (UPDRS-III).\nPatients showed marked motor improvement and medication reduction after surgery. Stimulated PD patients revealed bilateral rCBF decrements in motor cortical areas and prefrontal cortex bilaterally compared to pre-surgical condition as well as versus PD controls (p<.01 FDR corrected). Perfusion increases were found in cerebellum, temporal and occipital lobes. Clinical improvement was associated with perfusion decrements in primary motor and premotor cortices.\nEffective STN-DBS is associated with neuronal activity changes in brain regions implicated in movement programming and performance. We hypothesize that clinical benefit might be associated with stimulation-induced normalization of the abnormal overactivity within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor loop in advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "Normalization of regional measurements by the global mean is commonly employed to minimize inter-subject variability in functional imaging studies. This practice is based on the assumption that global values do not substantially differ between patient and control groups. In this issue of NeuroImage, Borghammer and colleagues challenge the validity of this assumption. They focus on Parkinson's disease (PD) and use computer simulations to show that lower global values can produce spurious increases in subcortical brain regions. The authors speculate that the increased signal observed in these areas in PD is artefactual and unrelated to localized changes in brain function. In this commentary, we summarize what is currently known of the relationship between regional and global metabolic activity in PD and experimental parkinsonism. We found that early stage PD patients exhibit global values that are virtually identical to those of age-matched healthy subjects. SPM analysis revealed increased normalized metabolic activity in a discrete set of biologically relevant subcortical brain regions. Because of their higher variability, the corresponding absolute regional measures did not differ across the two groups. Longitudinal imaging studies in this population showed that the subcortical elevations in normalized metabolism appeared earlier and progressed faster than did focal cortical or global metabolic reductions. The observed increases in subcortical activity, but not the global changes, correlated with independent clinical measures of disease progression. Multivariate analysis with SSM/PCA further confirmed that the abnormal spatial covariance structure of early PD is dominated by these subcortical increases as opposed to network-related reductions in cortical metabolic activity or global changes. Thus, increased subcortical activity in PD cannot be regarded as a simple artefact of global normalization. Moreover, stability of the normalized measurements, particularly at the network level, makes these metabolic indices suitable as imaging biomarkers of PD progression and the treatment response.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging techniques have evolved over the past several years giving us unprecedented information about the degenerative process in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders. Functional imaging approaches such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) have been successfully employed to detect dopaminergic dysfunction in PD, even while at a preclinical stage, and to demonstrate the effects of therapies on function of intact dopaminergic neurons within the affected striatum. PET and SPECT can also monitor PD progression as reflected by changes in brain levodopa and glucose metabolism and dopamine transporter binding. Structural imaging approaches include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial sonography (TCS). Recent advances in voxel-based morphometry and diffusion-weighted MRI have provided exciting potential applications for the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, detected with TCS, may provide a marker of susceptibility to PD, probably reflecting disturbances of iron metabolism, but does not appear to correlate well with disease severity or change with disease progression. In the future novel radiotracers may help us assess the involvement of non-dopaminergic brain pathways in the pathology of both motor and non-motor complications in PD.",

    "abstract": "It is widely known that the pathophysiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses in the midbrain substantia nigra. However, the possibility of neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses in other areas of the central nervous system (CNS) in course of the pathogenesis of PD remains to be explored. In this investigation, we provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that spinal cord, the final coordinator of movement, is also involved during parkinsonian degeneration using two distinct experimental parkinsonism models induced by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and the environmental toxin rotenone. A key focus of our study is the role that calpain, a Ca(2+)-activated neutral protease, plays in disrupting the structural-functional integrity of the spinal cord in the context of spinal cord degeneration in experimental parkinsonism. We examined the mechanisms of calpain-mediated neuronal death in differentiated spinal cord motoneuron cultures following exposure to the active parkinsonian toxins 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium ion (MPP(+)) and rotenone and also tested the neuroprotective efficacy of calpeptin, a calpain inhibitor, in these cell culture models of experimental parkinsonism. Our results implied that spinal cord motoneurons could be a potential extranigral target of neurodegeneration during pathogenesis of PD in the CNS and that calpain inhibition could provide neuroprotection.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, after Alzheimer's disease. In PD, motor symptoms result from the degeneration and loss of pigmented dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta of the basal ganglia. Other neuronal fields and neurotransmitter systems are also involved, including non-adrenergic, serotonergic and cholinergic neurons. Since the early 1960s the treatment of PD has been based on the pharmacologic replacement of dopamine accomplished with the precursor of dopamine, 3, 4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-dopa). The addition of carbidopa, an inhibitor of the decarboxylase represented a tremendous improvement in therapy and is still a mainstay of the treatment of PD. Dopamine agonists may also be used, as well as inhibitors of monoamine oxidase-B or catechol-O-methyltransferase. Other medications include anticholinergics and amantadine. These therapies are only symptomatic and none halt or lessen dopaminergic neuron degeneration and the progression of the disease. This has prompted the search for novel and alternative pharmacological targets and neuroprotective therapies. In this context, there are data to suggest a benefit from glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, neuroimmumophilin ligands, minocycline, Coenzyme Q10, creatine, reduced glutathione, adenosine A2A receptor antagonists as well as glutamate release inhibitors. Restorative techniques to compensate for cell loss include tissue transplantation and gene transfer therapy. Due to the paucity of data regarding non-pharmacological approaches such as diet therapy or antioxidant therapy, these await more studies. There are also few studies on medicinal plants. Other areas of increasing importance would thus include the investigation of active constituents of plants and phytomedicines with a view to the discovery of new compounds. Finally, stem cell therapy may offer the promise of restoring functionality.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has been related to mutations associated with spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA); the frequency of the diagnosis of these mutations is low in general late-onset PD cases. Our aim was to investigate a selected high-risk group of PD patients.\nPD patients with autosomal dominant inheritance or atypical neurological manifestations were enrolled, underwent a full neurological examination and had the CAG tracts of their SCA1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 genes analyzed.\nOf the 23 studied families, two SCA3 and one SCA2 cases were identified. All had autosomal dominant inheritance. In the SCA2 pedigree, four affected sibs had a homogeneous PD phenotype. CAG repeats varied between 35 and 44 with CAA interruptions. Intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity was identified in the SCA3 pedigrees; parkinsonian and ataxic phenotypes coexisted in both kindreds. CAGn varied between 69 and 71 repeats. Age of onset was lower in the SCA3 patients than in the remaining 24 cases (38 versus 46.7+/-12 years of age, p=0.003).\nSCA2 and SCA3 mutations were detected in 13% of the present sample: the strategy of selecting a high-risk group increased the rate of making these diagnoses. The SCA2 cases confirmed an association between PD and interrupted expansions, as well as PD intrafamilial phenotypic homogeneity. Clinical heterogeneity of SCA3 pedigrees suggests that disease-modifying agents outside the MJD1 gene may play a role in determining PD symptoms in this disorder.",

In the SCA2 pedigree, four affected sibs had a homogeneous PD phenotype. CAG repeats varied between 35 and 44 with CAA interruptions. Intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity was identified in the SCA3 pedigrees; parkinsonian and ataxic phenotypes coexisted in both kindreds. CAGn varied between 69 and 71 repeats. Age of onset was lower in the SCA3 patients than in the remaining 24 cases (38 versus 46.7+/-12 years of age, p=0.003).",

    "abstract": "Personality traits appear as determinants of quality of life (QoL) in most chronic diseases. The aim of this study is to explore whether neuroticism and extraversion contribute to the variance in QoL in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) when controlled for age, functional status and disease duration.\nThe Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39) was used to assess QoL and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) for disease severity. Neuroticism and extraversion were measured with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-A). Multiple linear regression analysis was then used to assess the contribution of neuroticism and extraversion to QoL.\nThe sample consisted of 153 PD patients (48.4% women; 67.9 +/- 9.3 years; mean disease duration 7.5 +/- 5.8 years). Neuroticism was, after disease severity, the second most important variable associated with QoL in PD patients, in particular for domains associated with psychological processes: emotional well-being, social support, stigma and communication. A higher score in extraversion was significantly associated with better emotional well-being in males, but surprisingly, with worse emotional well-being in females.\nAfter functional status, personality traits were clearly associated with QoL in PD patients. Therefore, they should be taken into account by health-care professionals in their appraisal of patient complaints.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment and dementia are among the most common nonmotor changes in Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this review is to present recent findings of clinical and neurobiological aspects of dementia in Parkinson's disease.\nNew consensus criteria for a clinical diagnosis of dementia in Parkinson's disease have been proposed. A very high cumulative prevalence of dementia in Parkinson's disease has been shown in two independent long-term cohorts. Mild cognitive impairment occurs even in early Parkinson's disease and is associated with a shorter time to dementia. Emerging evidence from pathology, as well as in-vivo studies using novel techniques within genetics, imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid research, indicates that alpha-synuclein aggregation and disturbances of other candidate proteins are associated with dementia in Parkinson's disease. Clinical, pathological, and electrophysiological studies support the hypothesis of different subtypes of dementia in Parkinson's disease, potentially related to different underlying brain changes.\nIncreased understanding of underlying mechanisms of cognitive decline and dementia in Parkinson's disease has been achieved. This will hopefully lead to novel treatment with the potential of preventing or delaying the onset of dementia by influencing these mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "OFF-L-dopa dyskinesias have been a surprising side-effect of intrastriatal foetal ventral mesencephalic transplantation in patients with Parkinson's disease. It has been proposed that excessive and unregulated dopaminergic stimulation of host post-synaptic striatal neurons by the grafts could be responsible for these dyskinesias. To address this issue we transplanted foetal dopaminergic neurons from mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DATKO) or from wild-type mice, into a rat model of Parkinson's disease and L-dopa-induced dyskinesias. Both wild-type and DATKO grafts reinnervated the host striatum to a similar extent, but DATKO grafts produced a greater and more diffuse increase in extra-cellular striatal dopamine levels. Interestingly, grafts containing wild-type dopaminergic neurons improved parkinsonian signs to a similar extent as DATKO grafts, but provided a more complete reduction of L-dopa induced dyskinesias. Neither DATKO nor wild-type grafts induced OFF-L-dopa dyskinesias. Behavioural and receptor autoradiography analyses demonstrated that DATKO grafts induced a greater normalization of striatal dopaminergic receptor supersensitivity than wild-type grafts. Both graft types induced a similar downregulation and normalization of PEnk and fosb/Deltafosb in striatal neurons. In summary, DATKO grafts causing high and diffuse extra-cellular dompamine levels do not per se alter graft-induced recovery or produce OFF-L-dopa dyskinesias. Wild-type dopaminergic neurons appear to be the most effective neuronal type to restore function and reduce L-dopa-induced dyskinesias.",

    "abstract": "Visuo-motor coordination (VMC) requires normal cognitive executive functionality, an ability to transform visual inputs into movement plans and motor-execution skills, all of which are known to be impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD). Not surprisingly, a VMC deficit in PD is well documented. Still, it is not known how this deficit relates to motor symptoms that are assessed routinely in the neurological clinic. Such relationship should reveal how particular motor dysfunctions combine with cognitive and sensory-motor impairments to produce a complex behavioral disability.\nThirty nine early/moderate PD patients were routinely evaluated, including motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) based assessment, A VMC testing battery in which the subjects had to track a target moving on screen along 3 different paths, and to freely trace these paths followed. Detailed kinematic analysis of tracking/tracing performance was done. Statistical analysis of the correlations between measures depicting various aspects of VMC control and UPDRS items was performed. The VMC measures which correlated most strongly with clinical symptoms represent the ability to organize tracking movements and program their direction, rather than measures representing motor-execution skills of the hand. The strong correlations of these VMC measures with total UPDRS score were weakened when the UPDRS hand-motor part was considered specifically, and were insignificant in relation to tremor of the hand. In contrast, all correlations of VMC measures with the gait/posture part of the UPDRS were found to be strongest.\nOur apparently counterintuitive findings suggest that the VMC deficit pertains more strongly to a PD related change in cognitive-executive control, than to a reduction in motor capabilities. The recently demonstrated relationship between gait/posture impairment and a cognitive decline, as found in PD, concords with this suggestion and may explain the strong correlation between VMC dysfunction and gait/posture impairment. Accordingly, we propose that what appears to reflect a motor deficit in fact represents a multisystem failure, dominated by a cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "To characterize sequence variation within the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene in a select subset of our sample of patients with familial Parkinson disease (PD) and then to test in our full sample whether these sequence variants increased the risk for PD and were associated with an earlier onset of disease.\nWe performed a comprehensive study of all GBA exons in one patient with PD from each of 96 PD families, selected based on the family-specific lod scores at the GBA locus. Identified GBA variants were subsequently screened in all 1325 PD cases from 566 multiplex PD families and in 359 controls.\nNine different GBA variants, five previously reported, were identified in 21 of the 96 PD cases sequenced. Screening for these variants in the full sample identified 161 variant carriers (12.2%) in 99 different PD families. An unbiased estimate of the frequency of the five previously reported GBA variants in the familial PD sample was 12.6% and in the control sample was 5.3% (odds ratio 2.6; 95% confidence interval 1.5-4.4). Presence of a GBA variant was associated with an earlier age at onset (p = 0.0001). On average, those patients carrying a GBA variant had onset with PD 6.04 years earlier than those without a GBA variant.\nThis study suggests that GBA is a susceptibility gene for familial Parkinson disease (PD) and patients with GBA variants have an earlier age at onset than patients with PD without GBA variants.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and affects about 2% of the population over the age of 60 years. In 2004, mutations in the LRRK2 gene were first described and turned out to be the most frequent genetic cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease and may account for up to 40% of patients in distinct populations. Based on these findings, Latourelle and colleagues show that the penetrance of the most common LRRK2 mutation is higher in patients with familial compared with sporadic Parkinson's disease and identified a substantial number of affected relatives of mutation carriers not presenting with a LRRK2 mutation themselves. This commentary discusses the role of genetic and/or environmental susceptibility factors modulating the expressivity of the disease trait, how these factors may contribute to the phenomenon of phenocopies in genetically defined Parkinson's disease pedigrees, and how the findings of Latourelle and colleagues, published this month in BMC Medicine, relate to current concepts of genetic counselling.",

    "abstract": "We report age-dependent penetrance estimates for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)-related Parkinson's disease (PD) in a large sample of familial PD. The most frequently seen LRRK2 mutation, Gly2019Ser (G2019S), is associated with approximately 5 to 6% of familial PD cases and 1 to 2% of idiopathic cases, making it the most common known genetic cause of PD. Studies of the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations have produced a wide range of estimates, possibly due to differences in study design and recruitment, including in particular differences between samples of familial PD versus sporadic PD.\nA sample, including 903 affected and 58 unaffected members from 509 families ascertained for having two or more PD-affected members, 126 randomly ascertained PD patients and 197 controls, was screened for five different LRRK2 mutations. Penetrance was estimated in families of LRRK2 carriers with consideration of the inherent bias towards increased penetrance in a familial sample.\nThirty-one out of 509 families with multiple cases of PD (6.1%) were found to have 58 LRRK2 mutation carriers (6.4%). Twenty-nine of the 31 families had G2019S mutations while two had R1441C mutations. No mutations were identified among controls or unaffected relatives of PD cases. Nine PD-affected relatives of G2019S carriers did not carry the LRRK2 mutation themselves. At the maximum observed age range of 90 to 94 years, the unbiased estimated penetrance was 67% for G2019S families, compared with a baseline PD risk of 17% seen in the non-LRRK2-related PD families.\nLifetime penetrance of LRRK2 estimated in the unascertained relatives of multiplex PD families is greater than that reported in studies of sporadically ascertained LRRK2 cases, suggesting that inherited susceptibility factors may modify the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. In addition, the presence of nine PD phenocopies in the LRRK2 families suggests that these susceptibility factors may also increase the risk of non-LRRK2-related PD. No differences in penetrance were found between men and women, suggesting that the factors that influence penetrance for LRRK2 carriers are independent of the factors which increase PD prevalence in men.",

    "conclusions": "Lifetime penetrance of LRRK2 estimated in the unascertained relatives of multiplex PD families is greater than that reported in studies of sporadically ascertained LRRK2 cases, suggesting that inherited susceptibility factors may modify the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. In addition, the presence of nine PD phenocopies in the LRRK2 families suggests that these susceptibility factors may also increase the risk of non-LRRK2-related PD. No differences in penetrance were found between men and women, suggesting that the factors that influence penetrance for LRRK2 carriers are independent of the factors which increase PD prevalence in men.",

Twenty-nine of the 31 families had G2019S mutations while two had R1441C mutations. No mutations were identified among controls or unaffected relatives of PD cases. Nine PD-affected relatives of G2019S carriers did not carry the LRRK2 mutation themselves. At the maximum observed age range of 90 to 94 years, the unbiased estimated penetrance was 67% for G2019S families, compared with a baseline PD risk of 17% seen in the non-LRRK2-related PD families.",

    "abstract": "Five genes have been identified that contribute to Mendelian forms of Parkinson disease (PD); however, mutations have been found in fewer than 5% of patients, suggesting that additional genes contribute to disease risk. Unlike previous studies that focused primarily on sporadic PD, we have performed the first genomewide association study (GWAS) in familial PD. Genotyping was performed with the Illumina HumanCNV370Duo array in 857 familial PD cases and 867 controls. A logistic model was employed to test for association under additive and recessive modes of inheritance after adjusting for gender and age. No result met genomewide significance based on a conservative Bonferroni correction. The strongest association result was with SNPs in the GAK/DGKQ region on chromosome 4 (additive model: p = 3.4 x 10(-6); OR = 1.69). Consistent evidence of association was also observed to the chromosomal regions containing SNCA (additive model: p = 5.5 x 10(-5); OR = 1.35) and MAPT (recessive model: p = 2.0 x 10(-5); OR = 0.56). Both of these genes have been implicated previously in PD susceptibility; however, neither was identified in previous GWAS studies of PD. Meta-analysis was performed using data from a previous case-control GWAS, and yielded improved p values for several regions, including GAK/DGKQ (additive model: p = 2.5 x 10(-7)) and the MAPT region (recessive model: p = 9.8 x 10(-6); additive model: p = 4.8 x 10(-5)). These data suggest the identification of new susceptibility alleles for PD in the GAK/DGKQ region, and also provide further support for the role of SNCA and MAPT in PD susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "We compared Doppler echocardiographic features before and after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) performed for Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in patients with and without atrial fibrillation (AF).\nForty patients with WPW syndrome were evaluated in two groups depending on the presence of AF (6 females, 14 males; mean age 33+/-15 years) and atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) (8 females, 12 males; mean age 32+/-18 years). Echocardiographic examination was performed in all the patients 24 hours before and after RFCA. Doppler parameters were recorded including E and A transmitral filling velocities and their velocity-time integrals (VTI), mitral diastolic filling time (mDFT), deceleration time, isovolumic contraction and relaxation times, aortic ejection time (ET) and aortic VTI.\nThe most common localization of the accessory pathway was the left lateral wall (n=9) in patients with AF, compared to one patient in the AVRT group. During programmed electrical stimulation, orthodromic AVRT was induced in all the patients with AVRT; of the AF group, six patients had AF and 14 patients exhibited AVRT that degenerated into AF. The two groups did not differ significantly before and after RFCA with regard to two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic parameters (p>0.05). Significant changes observed in both groups after RFCA were as follows: increases in A velocity and A wave VTI (p<0.05), decrease in the E/A ratio (p<0.05), prolongation of mDFT (p<0.001), and shortening of aortic ET (p<0.01). Following the procedure, preexcitation disappeared in all the patients and none had tachyarrhythmia.\nThere were no echocardiographic parameters associated with AF in patients with WPW syndrome.",

First, those brain areas were identified where ADL performance and glucose metabolism were significantly correlated. Second, brain regions were detected where the association between metabolic changes and ADL performance differed significantly between patients with a low and a high educational background.\nThere was a significant association between glucose hypometabolism and impaired ADL performance in the prefrontal, temporoparietal, and occipital association cortices and the precuneus. However, there was a significantly stronger association between hypometabolism and impaired ADL in the low education group compared with the high education group in the right middle occipital gyrus.\nThe study suggests (1) that brain metabolic alterations are significantly associated with the loss of everyday functioning in Lewy body-associated disorders and (2) that education modifies this association.",

MPTP-lesioned rats showed poor cognitive performance in both passive avoidance task and cued version of the Morris water maze test. This deficit in learning and memory was found to be associated with oxidative stress. Chronic administration of pioglitazone (10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o., starting 5 days prior to MPTP administration and then for next 30 days) in MPTP-lesioned rats improved cognitive performance in passive avoidance task and cued version of the Morris water maze test. Furthermore, pioglitazone treatment also reduced oxidative stress (as evident by reduced malondialdehyde and increased glutathione levels). These results demonstrate the beneficial effects of pioglitazone on cognitive impairment in MPTP induced Parkinson's disease in rats.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) related dementia (PDD) develops in up to 60% of patients, but the pathophysiology is far from being elucidated. Abnormalities of resting state functional connectivity have been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study was performed to determine whether PDD is likewise characterized by changes in resting state functional connectivity. MEG recordings were obtained in 13 demented and 13 non-demented PD patients. The synchronization likelihood (SL) was calculated within and between cortical areas in six frequency bands. Compared to non-demented PD, PDD was characterized by lower fronto-temporal SL in the alpha range, lower intertemporal SL in delta, theta and alpha1 bands as well as decreased centro-parietal gamma band synchronization. In addition, higher parieto-occipital synchronization in the alpha2 and beta bands was found in PDD. The observed changes in functional connectivity are reminiscent of changes in AD, and may reflect reduced cholinergic activity and/or loss of cortico-cortical anatomical connections in PDD.",

    "abstract": "This report reviews recent investigations of the effects of treadmill training (TT) on the gait of patients with Parkinson's disease. A literature search identified 14 relevant studies. Three studies reported on the immediate effects of TT; over-ground walking improved (e.g., increased speed and stride length) after one treadmill session. Effects persisted even 15 min later. Eleven longer-term trials demonstrated feasibility, safety and efficacy, reporting positive benefits in gait speed, stride length and other measures such as disease severity (e.g., Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) and health-related quality of life, even several weeks after cessation of the TT. Long-term carryover effects also raise the possibility that TT may elicit positive neural plastic changes. While encouraging, the work to date is preliminary; none of the identified studies received a quality rating of Gold or level Ia. Additional high quality randomized controlled studies are needed before TT can be recommended with evidence-based support.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to clarify the olfactory functions of Japanese patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) using the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J).\nFifty-four non-demented IPD patients (33 men and 21 women), ranging in age from 43 to 81 years (69.7+/-8.1 years) and 50 age- and gender-matched healthy controls who reported having no olfactory complaints were enrolled. OSIT-J consisted of 12 odorants familiar to Japanese subjects. Each subject sniffed each odor that was applied to paraffin paper. Next the subject chose 1 of 6 answers: 4 pictures associated with the odors labeled with their names, one of which was correct, and 2 other ones (\"unknown\" and \"not detected\").\nThe number of correct answers was significantly lower in the IPD group (4.4+/-2.7) than in the normal group (8.3+/-2.2) (p<0.0001). Even in IPD patients who could smell normal strength odors in subjective symptom, the number of correct answers decreased. The number of correct answers was not correlated with motor function, disease duration, or medication.\nThe present study demonstrated that the smell identification ability of Japanese IPD patients was impaired based on the OSIT-J.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease frequently causes difficulty turning that can lead to falls, loss of independence, and diminished quality of life. Turning in tight spaces, which may be particularly impaired in Parkinson disease, is an essential part of our daily lives, yet a comprehensive analysis of in-place turning has not been published.\nThis study was conducted to determine whether there are objective differences in turning between people with Parkinson disease and unimpaired people.\nIn-place turning with kinematics and electromyographic measures was characterized in 11 participants with Parkinson disease and 12 healthy people. Kinematic data were recorded using a 3-dimensional motion capture system in synchrony with electromyographic data from lower extremity muscles as participants turned 180 degrees . Those with Parkinson disease were tested after overnight withdrawal of medication.\nBoth groups used 2 distinct turning strategies. In one, the foot ipsilateral to the turning direction initiated the turn; in the other, the foot contralateral to the turning direction initiated the turn. Kinematic analysis demonstrated a craniocaudal sequence of turning in the unimpaired group, whereas those with Parkinson disease had a simultaneous onset of yaw rotation of the head, trunk, and pelvis. They also took a longer time and more steps to complete turns. Overall, lower extremity muscle activation patterns appeared similar between groups.\nDifferences between the groups were noted for axial control, but lower extremity muscle patterns were similar. This work may provide the foundation for development of new treatments for turning difficulty in Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal death is known to trigger reactive microgliosis. However, little is known regarding the manner by which microglia are activated by injured neurons and how microgliosis participates in neurodegeneration. In this study we delineate the critical role of macrophage Ag complex-1 (MAC1), a member of the beta(2) integrin family, in mediating reactive microgliosis and promoting dopaminergic (DAergic) neurodegeneration in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of Parkinson's disease. MAC1 deficiency greatly attenuated the DAergic neurodegeneration induced by MPTP or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridium iodide (MPP(+)) exposure both in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Reconstituted experiments created by adding microglia from MAC1(-/-) or MAC1(+/+) mice back to MAC1(+/+) neuron-enriched cultures showed that microglia with functional MAC1 expression was mandatory for microglia-enhanced neurotoxicity. Both in vivo and in vitro morphological and Western blot studies demonstrated that MPTP/MPP(+) produced less microglia activation in MAC1(-/-) mice than MAC1(+/+) mice. Further mechanistic studies revealed that a MPP(+)-mediated increase in superoxide production was reduced in MAC1(-/-) neuron-glia cultures compared with MAC1(+/+) cultures. The stunted production of superoxide in MAC1(-/-) microglia is likely linked to the lack of translocation of the cytosolic NADPH oxidase (PHOX) subunit (p47(phox)) to the membrane. In addition, the production of PGE(2) markedly decreased in neuron plus MAC1(-/-) microglia cocultures vs neuron plus MAC1(+/+) microglia cocultures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MAC1 plays a critical role in MPTP/MPP(+)-induced reactive microgliosis and further support the hypothesis that reactive microgliosis is an essential step in the self-perpetuating cycle leading to progressive DAergic neurodegeneration observed in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Computerized treadmill gait analysis in models of toxicant exposure and neurodegenerative disorders holds much potential for detection and therapeutic intervention in these models, and researchers must validate the technology that assists in that data collection and analysis. The present authors used a commercially available computerized gait analysis system that used (a) a motorized treadmill on retired breeder male C57BL/6J mice, (b) the toxicant-induced (1-methyl-1-, 2-, 3-, 6-tetrahydropyridine) MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD), and (c) the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) G93A transgenic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The authors compared the detection of deficits by computerized treadmill gait analysis in MPTP-treated mice with inked-paw stride length and correlated these measures to dopamine (DA) loss. The authors found that the computerized treadmill gait analysis system did not distinguish MPTP-treated mice from vehicle controls, despite a nearly 90% deficit of striatal DA. In contrast, decreases in inked-paw stride length correlated strongly with DA losses in these same animals. Computerized treadmill gait analysis could neither reliably distinguish SOD1 G93A mutant mice from controls from 6 to 12 weeks of age nor detect any consistent early motor deficits in these mice. On the basis of the authors' findings, they inferred that computerized gait analysis on a motorized treadmill is not suited to measuring motor deficits in either the MPTP mouse model of PD or the SOD1 G93A mouse model of ALS.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). The nuclear encoded transcription factors A, B1 and B2 are essential for mitochondrial DNA replication. Sequence variants at the genes encoding TFAM, TFB1M and TFB2M could contribute to the risk of developing PD. Here, we searched for TFB1M and TFB2M nucleotide variants in a cohort of PD-patients (n=300) and healthy controls (n=200) from Spain. Single strand conformation analysis and direct sequencing were used to determine the variation at all the coding exons of the two genes. In addition to previously reported polymorphisms, we found several rare variants in patients and controls. Allele frequencies for all the nucleotide changes did not differ between patients and controls. Our work suggests that DNA variants in TFB1M and TFB2M did not contribute to the risk for PD in our population.",

    "abstract": "Variation in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene represents the most common genetic determinant of Parkinson's disease (PD) identified to date. While the frequency and distribution of LRRK2 mutations have been well-studied in Europe and North America, few data are available from South America. To address this gap in knowledge, we screened two cohorts of patients with PD from Peru (n=240) and Uruguay (n=125) for the three most common LRRK2 mutations (R1441C, R1441G, G2019S). We identified at total of seven patients with mutations, one with R1441G, and six with G2019S. The carrier frequency was significantly greater in the Uruguayan cohort (4.8%) than in the Peruvian cohort (0.4%; p=0.007). This likely resulted from a greater admixture proportion in the Peruvian sample. Haplotype analyses suggested that G2019S was probably brought to Peru and Uruguay by European settlers. In contrast, the origin of R1441G in our cohort was not clear, as the patient with this mutation had a background haplotype that was clearly distinct from that reported in carriers from Europe and North America. Our data add to a growing body of evidence indicating that LRRK2 mutations are widely distributed across South America but might differ by region in prevalence.",

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were used to detect the ER gene polymorphisms in 158 PD patients and 146 healthy controls. In the PD and control groups, \"x\" accounted for 83.5% and 80.8%, respectively (P>0.05). \"xx\" was found in 77.2% of the PD group and in 69.9% of the control group (P>0.05). The frequency of \"p\" in the PD and control group was 67.7% and 64.0%, respectively (P>0.05). \"pp\" was 51.9% in the PD group and 43.8% in the control group (P>0.05). \"ppxx\" was found in 49.4% of the PD and 43.0% of the control subjects (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in the \"x\", \"xx\", \"p\", \"pp\" or \"ppxx\" between males and females within the PD or control groups. In conclusion, we found no significant differences in the genotype or allele frequencies between patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy subjects. These findings suggest that the estrogen receptor gene polymorphism may not play a key role in the pathogenesis PD in Chinese patients.",

    "abstract": "The protective effect of estrogen on the neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of estrogen on the apoptosis and dopaminergic function on a cultured cell model of PD.\nThe PD model was established by addition of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) to PC12 cell culture. Estrogen was added to cell groups with MPP+ (Estrogen+MPP+), and without MPP+ (Estrogen only group). Cell viability, content of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), apoptosis ratio, expression of apoptosis-suppression protein Bcl-x and apoptosis-acceleration protein IL-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) were measured.\nCell viability in the Estrogen+MPP+ group was similar to the control group but was higher than in the MPP+ group (P < 0.05). The apoptosis ratios in the Estrogen+MPP+ group (33.6%), and the control group (31.3%), were also similar, but it was lower than in the MPP+ group (63.5%, P < 0.05). Concentrations of Bcl-x were higher in the Estrogen+MPP+ group, whereas ICE concentrations were lower than in the MPP+ group (P < 0.05).\nEstrogen suppresses apoptosis and improves cell viability in MPP+ induced injuries in the PC12 cells. The beneficial effects of estrogen on the PD model are due to the suppression of pro-apoptotic protein ICE, and stimulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x.",

    "abstract": "Using Parkinson's disease as a prototype of neurodegenerative diseases, we propose applications of human stem cells in the development of therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. First, in vitro differentiation of human stem cells offers a versatile model for dissecting molecular interactions underlying human dopamine (DA) neuron specification, which may form a foundation for instigating regeneration of DA neurons from progenitors that reside in the brain. Second, stem cells derived from diseased cells or through genetic modification can serve as a platform for unraveling biochemical processes that lead to the cellular pathogenesis of degeneration. This may in turn serve as a template for identifying or developing therapeutics for slowing, stopping, or reversing the disease process. And finally, stem cells, particularly those induced from patients' own cells, provide a reliable source of DA neurons for cell-based therapy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is associated with progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, as well as with more-widespread neuronal changes that cause complex and variable motor and nonmotor symptoms. Recent rapid advances in PD genetics have revealed a prominent role for mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of the disease, and the products of several PD-associated genes, including SNCA, Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, LRRK2 and HTR2A, show a degree of localization to the mitochondria under certain conditions. Impaired mitochondrial function is likely to increase oxidative stress and might render cells more vulnerable to this and other related processes, including excitotoxicity. The mitochondria, therefore, represent a highly promising target for the development of disease biomarkers by use of genetic, biochemical and bioimaging approaches. Novel therapeutic interventions that modify mitochondrial function are currently under development, and a large phase III clinical trial is underway to examine whether high-dose oral coenzyme Q10 will slow disease progression. In this Review, we examine evidence for the roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress in the neuronal loss that leads to PD and discuss how this knowledge might further improve patient management and aid in the development of 'mitochondrial therapy' for PD.",

    "abstract": "In the two experiments in this study, the author examined the effects of increased vocal effort (loud speech) and amplification on sentence and word intelligibility in speakers with Parkinson disease (PD). Methods Five talkers with PD produced sentences and words at habitual levels of effort and using loud speech techniques. Amplified sets of sentences and words were created by increasing the intensity of habitual stimuli to the level of loud stimuli. Listeners rated the intelligibility of the 3 sets of sentences on a 1-7 scale and transcribed the 3 sets of words.\nBoth loud speech and amplification significantly improved intelligibility for sentences and words. Loud speech resulted in greater intelligibility improvement than amplification.\nBy comparing loud and amplified scores, about one third to one half of intelligibility improvement with loud speech could be attributed to increases in audibility or signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, factors other than increased intensity must be partly responsible for the loud speech benefit. Changes in articulation appear to play a relatively small role: Initial/h/was the only consonant to consistently show improvement with loud speech. Phonatory changes such as improvements in F(0) and spectral tilt may account for improved speech intelligibility using loud speech techniques.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa induced dyskinesias (LID) are a common problem which ultimately limit the effective treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). There is accumulating evidence that LID develop due to abnormal synaptic plasticity, which is in turn influenced by the release of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).\nThe influence of a common functional polymorphism of the BDNF gene on the risk of developing dyskinesias in a large cohort of patients with PD (n = 315), who were independently and variably treated with levodopa and/or other dopaminergic treatments, was investigated.\nPatients with the met allele of BDNF, associated with lower activity dependent secretion of BDNF, were at significantly higher risk of developing dyskinesias earlier in the course of treatment with dopaminergic agents (hazard ratio for each additional met allele 2.12, p = 0.001), which persisted following adjustment for potential confounding variables.\nThis functional polymorphism may help predict which individuals are most at risk of LID and is consistent with the known actions of BDNF on synaptic plasticity in the striatum.",

    "abstract": "Clinical proteomics has been widely used to identify differentially displayed proteins in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to understand the molecular and cellular events leading to Parkinson's disease (PD). The close connection between CSF and the brain offers reliable and reproducible way to assess the majority of changes in the brain proteome profile directly into CSF throughout the course of neurodegeneration.\nWe identified the differentially displayed proteins in CSF of PD patients as compared with controls using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) and mass spectrometry.\nComparative 2-D PAGE electrophoretograms of CSF of PD patients with case controls and/or neurological controls revealed significant differential display of six protein spots. The differentially displayed proteins were identified as serum albumin precursor, serum albumin chain-A, hemoglobin beta fragment, mutant globin, proline rich repeat 14 (PRR 14) and serum transferrin N-terminal lobe. Although the level of hemoglobin beta fragment and mutant globin was attenuated, serum albumin precursor, serum albumin chain-A, PRR 14 and serum transferrin N-terminal lobe were augmented in PD patients as compared with case controls. The level of serum albumin chain-A, PRR 14 and serum transferrin N-terminal lobe was not significantly altered when compared with neurological controls.\nThe results obtained thus suggest that differential display of CSF serum albumin precursor, serum albumin chain-A, PRR 14 and serum transferrin N-terminal lobe could be associated with neuronal dysfunction and hemoglobin/globin with the onset/progression of PD in humans.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD) it has been suggested that various motor subtypes are also characterized by a different prevalence and severity of specific non-motor symptoms such as cognitive deterioration, depression, apathy and hallucinations. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between motor subtypes and psychopathology in PD.\nAn exploratory and confirmatory cluster analysis of motor and psychopathological symptoms was performed with a randomized sample of 173 patients each, stemming from two research databases: one from Stavanger University Hospital and one from Maastricht University Hospital. These databases contained data of standardized assessments of patients with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Mini-Mental State Examination.\nPD patients can be accurately and reliably classified into four different subtypes: rapid disease progression subtype, young-onset subtype, non-tremor-dominant subtype with psychopathology and a tremor-dominant subtype. Cognitive deterioration, depressive and apathetic symptoms, and hallucinations all cluster within the non-tremor-dominant motor subtype, that is characterized by hypokinesia, rigidity, postural instability and gait disorder.\nThis study shows that non-tremor-dominant PD is associated with cognitive deterioration, depression, apathy, and hallucinations, which has implications for future research into the pathophysiology of psychopathology in PD.",

    "abstract": "The impact of leukoaraiosis on Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been completely explained. We evaluated 141 patients with PD to assess the role of leukoaraiosis and determined its influence on the clinical phenotype of PD. Clinical assessments during off medication and leukoaraiosis grading were performed according to the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study. Patients were grouped into two phenotypes, tremor or postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD)-dominant groups. Associations between the age at onset, gender, disease duration, cardiovascular risk factors, leukoaraiosis grade and the disease phenotype were analyzed. In addition, the role of the leukoaraiosis grade in relationship to the parkinsonian motor handicaps was evaluated. The leukoaraiosis correlated with the severity of the clinical symptoms of PD as measured by the United Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) scores and the Hoehn and Yahr (H + Y) stage. There were significant correlations observed between the leukoaraiosis grade and specific motor handicaps especially those with axial symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the leukoaraiosis grade was independently associated with the PIGD motor phenotype of PD. The leukoaraiosis grade was independently associated with the PIGD motor phenotype of PD; this might be explained by the affects on nondopaminergic subcortical pathways. These results have implications for clinical management of PD with regard to the control of vascular risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimers. The main pathological hallmark of Parkinson's is the deterioration and death of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. Much of the neuronal damage takes place in the substantia nigra, a small region of the midbrain that contains the cell bodies of neurons that produce dopamine. The deterioration and death of dopaminergic neurons are directly associated with misfolding and aggregation of proteins, principally alpha-synuclein, that are natively unfolded. Present also in the substantia nigra is an unusually high concentration of vestigial iron. Protein misfolding in non-genetic (sporadic) cases of PD has been associated with reactive oxygen species formed as products of O(2) reduction by the combination of dopamine and iron. Combinations of Fe(3+), dopamine hydrochloride (DA(H+)Cl), and various ancillary ligands have been studied as a function of pH in aqueous solution to determine the optimum pH for complex formation. With ancillary ligands (L(4)) derived from nitrilotriacetic acid and ethylenediamine diacetic acid spectral changes are consistent with the formation of L(4)Fe(DA(H+)) species that reach a maximum concentration at pH 7.2. With edta as the ancillary ligand, spectral features at pH 7 resemble those of Fe(3+)-catecholate complexes that contain catecholate ligands bonded through a single oxygen. This demonstrates the ability of the dopamine catechol functionality to penetrate the coordination sphere of even exceptionally stable iron chelates.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by activated blood monocytes, macrophages and glial cells. It enhances differentiation and proliferation of T cells and increases production of proinflammatory cytokines. IL-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by both lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes including microglia. Recent studies demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of IL-10. There is little information about the involvement of IL-12 or IL-10 in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe objective of our study was to assess the role of IL-12 as a potential marker of immune reactions in patients with PD and to investigate whether IL-10, an immunosuppressive cytokine, may have a neuroprotective effect in the pathogenesis of PD.\nWe measured using immunoassay serum IL-12 and IL-10 levels in 41 patients with PD in comparison with serum levels in 19 healthy subjects (controls) age and sex matched. IL-12 and IL-10 levels were tested for correlation with sex, age, disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr stage and the UPDRS III score.\nThe PD group presented with significantly increased IL-10 levels when compared with the control group (P = 0.02). The increase observed was not affected by the treatment status. A strong and significant correlation between IL-10 and IL-12 levels was observed in patients with PD (R(S) = 0.7, P < 0.000001).\nOur findings suggest that IL-10 may be involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms of PD. The elevation of IL-10 and the significant correlation between IL-10 and IL-12, a proinflammatory cytokine, may suggest that immunological disturbances and neuroprotective mechanisms are involved in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Increasing attention has been focused on the pain and health-related quality of life (HrQOL) in patients with PD. Objective - To evaluate the relationship between pain and the HrQOL in patients with PD.\nEighty-two patients with PD were included and classified into two groups according to the presence of pain. The Hoehn and Yahr scale, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire (MSPQ), the Zung Depression Inventory--Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Visual Analogue Scale and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were administered. The factors influencing the pain, HrQOL and parkinsonian manifestations were evaluated.\nThe PD with pain group had higher UPDRS part III scores, lower SF-36 scores, higher SDS scores and higher MSPQ scores than the PD without pain group. The presence of pain, high Hoehn and Yahr stage, advanced age and somatic perception were the factors that had a negative effect on the physical component of the HrQOL. Depression and somatic perception were the most important predictive factors for the mental component of the HrQOL. Depression and poor parkinsonian motor abilities were the leading factors contributing to pain.\nPain and depression were major detrimental factors affecting the physical and mental aspects of the HrQOL respectively. Therefore, the treatment of pain and depression can be important to improve the HrQOL.",

The presence of pain, high Hoehn and Yahr stage, advanced age and somatic perception were the factors that had a negative effect on the physical component of the HrQOL. Depression and somatic perception were the most important predictive factors for the mental component of the HrQOL. Depression and poor parkinsonian motor abilities were the leading factors contributing to pain.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have suggested that higher serum uric acid levels lead to a lower risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) because uric acid exerts antioxidant effects on neurons. Our objective was to examine the relationship between gout and the risk of PD in persons age > or = 65 years.\nWe conducted a population-based cohort study using the British Columbia Linked Health Database and PharmaCare data (i.e., prescription drug data for those age > or = 65 years). We compared incidence rates of PD between 11,258 gout patients and 56,199 controls matched on age, sex, date of gout diagnosis, and length of medical record. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of PD, adjusting for age, sex, prior comorbid conditions, and use of diuretics and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.\nOver an 8-year median followup, we identified 1,182 new cases of PD. Compared with individuals without gout, the multivariate RR of PD among those with gout was 0.70 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.59-0.83). In subgroup analyses, the inverse association was similarly present in both sexes and was evident among those who did not use diuretics (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54-0.81), but not among diuretic users (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.58-1.10, P for interaction 0.35).\nOur population-based data provide evidence for a protective effect of gout on the risk of PD and support the purported protective role of uric acid.",

    "abstract": "An open controlled trial of the use of galantamine at a maximum dose of 16 mg/day included 41 patients with Parkinson's disease with dementia randomized to a galantamine treatment group (21 patients) and a control group (20 patients). Cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and motor symptoms were assessed clinically before the trial and at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the cognitive Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), the clock drawing test, the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) with assessment of distress in relatives. Patients treated with galantamine had better scores on the MMSE (p < 0.05),ADAS-cog (p < 0.05), the clock drawing test (p < 0.05), and the FAB (p < 0.01) at the end of the study period as compared with the control group. Changes in total point scores on the NPI-12 at the ends of weeks 12 and 24, as compared with the beginning of the trial, were in favor of the group treated with galantamine, with significant changes in the hallucinations (p = 0.0002), anxiety (p = 0.04), sleep disturbance (p = 0.04), and apathy (p = 0.006) sections. Galantamine treatment was accompanied by decreases in the level of distress in patients' relatives (p = 0.007) and improvements in daily activity (p = 0.003). Improvements in gait and decreases in freezing and falls were seen in the galantamine treatment group. However, two patients of this group showed minor increases in tremor. Side effects (drooling, postural hypotension, nausea, dysuria) occurred in seven patients (30%).",

    "abstract": "Despite the significant symptomatic effects of levodopa, stable 24-h treatment responses are in the vast majority of patients replaced 2-3 years from the start of treatment by oscillations in motor symptoms (fluctuation, dyskinesia), amelioration of which requires addition of constant (physiological) stimulation of postsynaptic dopamine receptors. To some extent this is provided by Stalevo, which contains levodopa and two enzyme inhibitors: the DDC inhibitor carbidopa and the COMT inhibitor entacapone. The results obtained in the present study demonstrated the advantages of Stalevo over traditional agents in patients with the \"wearing off\" and \"on-off\" phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM), the most common muscle disease of older persons, is of unknown cause and lacks successful treatment. Here we summarize diagnostic criteria and discuss our current understanding of the steps in the pathogenic cascade. While it is agreed that both degeneration and mononuclear-cell inflammation are components of the s-IBM pathology, how each relates to the pathogenesis remains unsettled. We suggest that the intra-muscle-fiber degenerative component plays the primary role, leading to muscle-fiber destruction and clinical weakness, since anti-inflammatory treatments are not of sustained benefit. We discuss possible treatment strategies aimed toward ameliorating a degenerative component, for example, lithium and resveratrol. Also discussed are the intriguing phenotypic similarities between s-IBM muscle fibers and the brains of Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases, the most common neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. Similarities include, in the respective tissues, cellular aging, mitochondrial abnormalities, oxidative and endoplasmic-reticulum stresses, proteasome inhibition and multiprotein aggregates.",

    "abstract": "We have studied sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) from expression of patient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in neural cells devoid of their own mtDNA, the \"cybrid\" model. In spite of reproducing several properties of sPD brain, it remains unclear whether sPD cybrid cells reflect more complex sPD brain bioenergetic pathophysiology. We characterized and correlated respiration of intact sPD cybrid cells with electron transport chain (ETC) protein assembly, complex I ETC gene expression and ETC protein levels in sPD brain. We also assayed expression for multiple ETC genes coded by mtDNA and nuclear DNA (nDNA) in sPD cybrid cells and brain. sPD cybrid cells have reduced levels of mtDNA genes, variable compensatory normalization of mitochondrial gene expression and show robust correlations with mitochondrial ETC gene expression in sPD brains. Relationships among ETC protein levels predict impaired complex I-mediated respiration in sPD brain. That sPD cybrid cells and sPD brain samples show very correlated regulation of nDNA and mtDNA ETC transcriptomes suggests similar bioenergetic physiologies. We propose that further insights into sPD pathogenesis will follow elucidation of mechanisms leading to reduced mtDNA gene levels in sPD cybrids. This will require characterization of the abnormalities and dynamics of mtDNA changes propagated through sPD cybrids over time.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether tasks involving effortful attention would cause augmentation of rigidity in patients with mild Parkinson disease.\nIn 17 subjects with mild Parkinson disease, rigidity in a single arm was assessed during various experimental conditions by a blinded movement disorders neurologist. Rigidity was scored separately at the wrist and the elbow using an ordinal scale. In three of the conditions, sustained attention was directed toward visual, auditory or movement-related stimuli. Two varieties of Froment maneuver served as positive controls: contralateral hand opening-closing or ipsilateral foot tapping. In addition, rigidity was assessed twice with subjects resting. The examiner was unaware of the sequence of experimental conditions and this was changed for each subject. Mean rigidity scores for the various experimental conditions were compared against the baseline state (an average of both trials with the patient resting) using a repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test.\nRigidity was significantly increased from baseline with each of the attentional tasks (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001) and also with the two Froment maneuvers (p < 0.001). Rigidity augmentation with contralateral hand opening-closing was significantly greater than with any of the attentional tasks (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001).\nTasks of effortful attention did appear to augment rigidity in patients with mild Parkinson disease. We speculate that the greater augmentation seen with the Froment maneuver could have an anatomic basis.",

Mean R2' relaxation rates were recorded in the substantia nigra, frontal white matter and in the rostral, mid, and caudal putamen.\nR2' relaxation rates were significantly higher in patients with PD than in healthy controls. R2' in the most affected substantia nigra correlated with PD patients' motor symptom severity, but not with disease duration.

This was substantiated by the finding that the mid and caudal putamen showed significantly higher R2' relaxation rates, consistent with higher iron levels in PD relative to the healthy controls.\nMRI at 3.0 Tesla suggests that substantia nigra iron levels are increased and linked to the severity of motor symptoms experienced in PD. Findings consistent with increased iron levels in the PD putamen are shown, in a region-specific rostral to caudal gradient.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease patients may have difficulty decoding prosodic emotion cues. These data suggest that the basal ganglia are involved, but may reflect dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction. An auditory emotional n-back task and cognitive n-back task were administered to 33 patients and 33 older adult controls, as were an auditory emotional Stroop task and cognitive Stroop task. No deficit was observed on the emotion decoding tasks; this did not alter with increased frontal lobe load. However, on the cognitive tasks, patients performed worse than older adult controls, suggesting that cognitive deficits may be more prominent. The impact of frontal lobe dysfunction on prosodic emotion cue decoding may only become apparent once frontal lobe pathology rises above a threshold.",

    "abstract": "Aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of dental pulp cells (DPCs) in in vitro models of Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. Primary cultures of hippocampal and ventral mesencephalic neurons were treated for 24 h with amyloid beta (Abeta(1-42)) peptide 1-42 and 6-OHDA, respectively. DPCs isolated from adult rat incisors were previously cultured in tissue culture inserts and added to the neuron cultures 2 days prior to neurotoxin treatment. Cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay. The co-culture with DPCs significantly attenuated 6-OHDA and Abeta(1-42)-induced toxicity in primary cultures of mesencephalic and hippocampal neurons, and lead to an increase in neuronal viability in untreated cultures, suggesting a neurotrophic effect in both models. Furthermore, human dental pulp cells expressed a neuronal phenotype and produced the neurotrophic factors NGF, GDNF, BDNF, and BMP2 shown by microarray screening and antibody staining for the representative proteins. DPCs protected primary neurons in in vitro models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and can be viewed as possible candidates for studies on cell-based therapy.",

    "abstract": "It is not known if aging induces changes in nigral vascularization and nigral vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels similar to those previously reported for Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study nonexercised rats displayed age-dependent decreases in the density of nigral microvessels and VEGF mRNA expression, which were reversed by physical exercise. Such changes may enhance the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons and the risk of developing PD, and may be reduced by exercise. Furthermore, the observed pattern is the opposite of that previously observed in PD, suggesting that the process underlying PD is not an accelerated age-dependent decline in the dopaminergic system.",

    "abstract": "Spatial navigation is a complex process requiring integration of visuoperceptual information. The present study examined how visuospatial function relates to navigational veering in Parkinson's disease, a movement disorder in which visuospatial cognition is affected by the degeneration of the basal ganglia and resulting dysfunction of the parietal lobes. We hypothesized that patients whose initial motor symptoms start on the left versus right side of the body (LPD, predominant right-hemisphere dysfunction; RPD, predominant left-hemisphere dysfunction) would display distinct patterns of navigational veering associated with the groups' dissimilar visuospatial profiles. Of particular interest was to examine the association of navigational veering (lateral deviation along the medio-lateral axis) with perception of egocentric coordinates and of radial optic flow patterns, both of which are mediated by the parietal lobes. Thirty-one non-demented Parkinson's disease patients (16 LPD, 15 RPD) and 18 healthy control (HC) adults received visuospatial tests, of whom 23 Parkinson's disease patients and 17 HC also underwent veering assessment. The participants were examined on three visual-feedback navigation conditions: none (eyes closed), natural, and optic flow supplied by a virtual-reality headset. All groups veered to the left when walking with eyes closed, women with Parkinson's disease more so than the other participants. On the navigation assessments with visual feedback, only LPD patients deviated right of centre. On tests of visuospatial function, the perceived midline was shifted rightward in LPD (men and women), increasingly so with the addition of visual input. In contrast, men with RPD showed leftward deviation. RPD patients and HC perceived optic flow in the left hemifield as faster than in the right hemifield, with a trend for the opposite pattern for LPD. Navigational veering in LPD was associated with deviation of the perceived egocentric midline and not with perception of optic flow speed asymmetries, and in RPD it was also associated with visual dependence, though in fact LPD subjects were more visually dependent than those with RPD. Our results indicate that (i) parietal-mediated perception of visual space is affected in Parkinson's disease, with both side of motor symptom onset and gender affecting spatial performance, and (ii) visual input affects veering.",

    "abstract": "Clinical evidence of impaired arm swing while walking in patients with Parkinson's disease suggests that basal ganglia and related systems play an important part in the control of upper limb locomotor automatism. To gain more information on this supraspinal influence, we measured arm and thigh kinematics during walking in 10 Parkinson's disease patients, under four conditions: (i) baseline (no treatment), (ii) therapeutic stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), (iii)L-DOPA medication and (iv) combined STN stimulation and L-DOPA. Ten age-matched controls provided reference data. Under baseline conditions the range of patients' arm motion was severely restricted, with no correlation with the excursion of the thigh. In addition, the arm swing was abnormally coupled in time with oscillation of the ipsilateral thigh. STN stimulation significantly increased the gait speed and improved the spatio-temporal parameters of arm and thigh motion. The kinematic changes as a function of gait speed changes, however, were significantly smaller for the upper than the lower limb, in contrast to healthy controls. Arm motion was also less responsive after L-DOPA. Simultaneous deep brain stimulation and L-DOPA had additive effects on thigh motion, but not on arm motion and arm-thigh coupling. The evidence that locomotor automatisms of the upper and lower limbs display uncorrelated impairment upon dysfunction of the basal ganglia, as well as different susceptibility to electrophysiological and pharmacological interventions, points to the presence of heterogeneously distributed, possibly partially independent, supraspinal control channels, whereby STN and dopaminergic systems have relatively weaker influence on the executive structures involved in the arm swing and preferential action on those for lower limb movements. These findings might be considered in the light of phylogenetic changes in supraspinal control of limb motion related to primate bipedalism.",

    "abstract": "Creativity is heavily dependent on divergent thinking and divergent thinking appears to be strongly dependent on fontal lobe function. Since patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often have evidence of frontal lobe dysfunction we wanted to learn if these patients have a reduction of creativity, as well as learning if the side of onset (right versus left) influences the type (verbal versus visuospatial) of decrement in creativity.\nParticipants of this study were patients with right (RHO) or left (LHO) onset PD as well as matched controls. All subjects were given the Abbreviated Torrance Test of Creative Thinking for Adults (ATTA), a widely used test to assess creativity that examines Fluency, Originality, Flexibility and Elaboration. Subjects were also assessed with the Controlled Word Association Test (COWAT).\nWhen compared to controls the patients with RHO, but not LHO, had a decrease of verbal creative fluency. Patients with PD often have a decrease on the COWAT, but performance on the COWAT did not differ between the RHO and the LHO patients. This suggests that patients with PD who have RHO have a decrease in verbal creativity and this decrement does not appear to be related to decreased fluency.",

    "abstract": "Stereotactic surgical interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) can considerably improve appendicular motor signs, but their effect on axial motor signs--especially balance control under optimal drug therapy--remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation on levodopa-resistant axial and appendicular postural impairment in PD. Fourteen patients (11 with young-onset PD) and 18 age-matched controls were included. Patients were tested after intake of a suprathreshold levodopa dose, ensuring optimal response to drug therapy, and with stimulators both turned on and off. Balance control was assessed using multidirectional dynamic posturography. Outcome measures included full body kinematics and surface electromyography of paraspinal and deltoid muscles. Patients with stimulators turned off showed early decreased trunk roll with a loss of directional dependency, followed by increased and abnormally directed--i.e. destabilizing--trunk roll. Pelvis pitch motion showed decreased directional dependency in these patients. The abnormal trunk motion was not corrected by STN stimulation, but directional dependency of both trunk and pelvis motion partially improved, along with a general decrease in muscle activity. Even with stimulators off, protective arm movements were similar in the optimally treated patients and controls, indicating that these appendicular signs respond better to dopaminergic treatment than axial motor control. Our findings indicate that instability in PD results from a reduced flexibility of the trunk and pelvis that is largely resistant to STN stimulation combined with optimal drug treatment. These postural abnormalities are therefore likely associated with non-dopaminergic pathology. In contrast, protective arm movements did appear to be levodopa-responsive. Future studies should focus on identifying subgroups of optimal responders, particularly patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesias.",

    "abstract": "We sought to investigate the effects of dopamine on motor cortical plasticity in Parkinson's disease (PD) using a novel interventional transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol that targets spike-timing-dependent plasticity (iTMS). Six patients (3F, mean age 62 years) with mild-moderate PD (mean disease duration 6 years, UPDRS-off 13, UPDRS-on 3, H&Y stage 2, daily levodopa dosage 450 mg) were studied off and on levodopa on separate days. Paired TMS pulses at resting motor threshold with an inter-stimulus interval of 1.5 ms were given over the hand area of the motor cortex for 20 min at 0.2 Hz. Single-pulse motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and visually cued simple reaction time (SRT) were measured before and after iTMS. When on levodopa, MEP amplitude increased to 278+/-36% of baseline (p<0.01), and when off levodopa to 157+/-13% of baseline (p=0.02). All patients showed a significantly greater increase in MEP amplitude when on levodopa than off levodopa (p=0.01). SRT was reduced to 95% baseline after iTMS off levodopa (p=0.02), but did not change on levodopa. These findings indicate that motor cortex plasticity to iTMS is preserved in mild-moderate PD. The effects of this spike-timing-related TMS protocol on cortical excitability were consistent and were enhanced by levodopa. The results support the important role of dopamine in regulating synaptic plasticity and justify a larger crossover study to assess the therapeutic effects of iTMS in PD.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nuclei (STN) is a good therapeutic option to reduce dyskinesias and improve appendicular motor signs in well-selected patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Concerns about long-term adverse effects play an increasingly role in the decision whether or not to refer patients for this treatment. Worsening of gait as a consequence of STN stimulation for PD has been described, but may be under-recognized in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of STN stimulation on gait relative to global outcome in a group of consecutively operated patients. For this purpose, we used a standardized patient questionnaire that asked about global outcome and specific effects on gait, as experienced both 6 months postoperatively and currently (at the time of completing the questionnaire; mean: 2.7 +/- 1.1 years). A delayed worsening of gait after bilateral STN stimulation was experienced by a considerable proportion of patients (42% of subjects, for gait in the OFF phase), and this was apparently relatively \"selective\" because their global outcome scores continued to be improved. These findings highlight the presence of a hitherto poorly recognized long-term complication of bilateral STN stimulation. Further systematic studies are required to pinpoint the clinical and surgical determinants of this late gait deterioration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with genetic risk factors. Semaphorin 5A (SEMA5A) was recognized as a risk factor for PD through high resolution whole genome association study by Maraganore et al. We used polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay to check two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within SEMA5A in 340 PD patients and 222 PD free cases of Chinese Han ancestry and tested by gene sequencing. We found that the SEMA5A variant genotype (allele) of rs7702187 and rs3798097 had no association with the risk of PD in our sample. The AC haplotype was associated with a significant increased risk of PD and the AT haplotype showed an associated decreased risk of PD compared with the most common haplotype TC. Our findings suggested that haplotypes of SEMA5A may be involved in PD risk in the Chinese Han population.",

However, with the long term, the efficacity of the drug is slowing down and secondary effects are frequent. The pros and cons of various therapy are discussed. If the patient is younger than 65 years, we would usually start therapy with a dopamine agonist because of the lower risk of motor complications. Levodopa is a potent alternative and can be given if there is an inadequate response to the agonist. When motor complications are present, some options are usefull like the administration of dopaminergic agonists or apomorphine, the utilisation of inhibitors of the dopamine catabolism, the deep brain stimulation and the jejunal administration of dopa.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people. Both environmental and genetic factors play important roles in its causation and development. Genetic analysis has shown that over 100 genes are correlated with the etiology and pathology of PD. However, accessing genetic information in a consistent and fruitful way is not an easy task. The Mutation Database for Parkinson's Disease (MDPD) is designed to fulfill the need for information integration so that users can easily retrieve, inspect and enhance their knowledge on PD. The database contains 2391 entries on 202 genes extracted from 576 publications and manually examined by biomedical researchers. Each genetic substitution and the resulting impact are clearly labelled and linked to its primary reference. Every reported gene has a summary page that provides information on the variation impact, mutation type, the studied population, mutation position and reference collection. In addition, MDPD provides a unique functionality for users to compare the differences on the type of mutations among ethnic groups. As such, we hope that MDPD will serve as a valuable tool to bridge the gap between genetic analysis and clinical practice. MDPD is publicly accessible at http://datam.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/mdpd/.",

Thirty patients (13 women and 17 men) from two French hospitals were interviewed at different stages of their medical history. Despite the excellent overall outcome of neurosurgery in patients with Parkinson's disease, there is often a contrast between the improvement in motor disability and the patient's difficulty in returning to normal life.

Follow-on compound 16a (hA2A Ki 0.83 nM, hA1 Ki 130 nM), bearing a 6-(morpholin-4-yl)-2-pyridyl substituent at C-6, had improved solubility and was orally efficacious (3 mg/kg, HIC) but showed time-dependent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition, possibly related to morpholine ring metabolism. Compound 16j (hA2A Ki 0.44 nM, hA1 Ki 80 nM), bearing a 6-(4-methoxypiperidin-1-yl)-2-pyridyl substituent at C-6, was sparingly soluble but had good oral exposure in rodent and nonrodent species, had no cytochrome P450 or human ether-a-go-go related gene channel issues, and was orally efficacious at 1 mg/kg in HIC and at 3 mg/kg for potentiation of l-dopa-induced contralateral rotations in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats.",

    "abstract": "Dietary iron is the most important source of iron stores. Several case-control studies have described the association of high dietary iron and Parkinson's disease, but prospective data are lacking. The authors prospectively followed 47,406 men and 76,947 women from the United States who provided information through a mailed questionnaire on their diet, medical history, and lifestyle practices between 1984 and 2000. The authors documented 422 new cases of Parkinson's disease. Total iron intake was not associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (relative risk (RR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74, 1.65; P(trend) = 0.84), but dietary nonheme iron intake from food was associated with a 30% increased risk of Parkinson's disease (RR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.92, 1.76; P(trend) = 0.02). A secondary analysis revealed that Parkinson's disease risk was significantly increased among individuals with high nonheme iron and low vitamin C intakes (RR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.32; P(trend) = 0.002). Supplemental iron intake was associated with a borderline increase in Parkinson's disease risk among men. Although the authors' prospective data did not support an association between total iron intake (dietary and supplemental) and risk of Parkinson's disease, a 30% increased risk was associated with a diet rich in nonheme iron. This increase in risk was present in those who had low vitamin C intake.",

    "abstract": "In this research, we evaluated the inter-relation of tremor and rigidity in Parkinson's disease. We included the agonist and antagonist skeletal muscle models as well as the peripheral (spinal and long-loop reflexes) and central (basal ganglia and cortex) mechanisms and present a complete model. All of our simulation is developed in SIMULINK, MATLAB 7. Our results showed that (1) increased supplementary motor area output increases the rigidity and (2) rigidity and the tremor are correlated. Therefore, from our model it can be suggested that the simultaneous treatment of these two abnormal motor behaviors could be more beneficial. Experimental studies are needed to validate this computational model.",

    "abstract": "In previous work, we investigated dieldrin cytotoxicity and signaling cell death mechanisms in dopaminergic PC12 cells. Dieldrin has been reported to be one of the environmental factors correlated with Parkinson's disease and may selectively destroy dopaminergic neurons.\nHere we further investigated dieldrin toxicity in a dopaminergic neuronal cell model of Parkinson's disease, namely N27 cells, using biochemical, immunochemical, and flow cytometric analyses.\nIn this study, dieldrin-treated N27 cells underwent a rapid and significant increase in reactive oxygen species followed by cytochrome c release into cytosol. The cytosolic cytochrome c activated caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway and the increased caspase-3 activity was observed following a 3 hr dieldrin exposure in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, dieldrin caused the caspase-dependent proteolytic cleavage of protein kinase C delta (PKC\u03b4) into 41 kDa catalytic and 38 kDa regulatory subunits in N27 cells as well as in brain slices. PKC\u03b4 plays a critical role in executing the apoptotic process in dieldrin-treated dopaminergic neuronal cells because pretreatment with the PKC\u03b4 inhibitor rottlerin, or transfection and over-expression of catalytically inactive PKC\u03b4(K)\u00b3\u2077\u2076(R), significantly attenuates dieldrin-induced DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation.\nTogether, we conclude that caspase-3-dependent proteolytic activation of PKC\u03b4 is a critical event in dieldrin-induced apoptotic cell death in dopaminergic neuronal cells.",

PKC\u03b4 plays a critical role in executing the apoptotic process in dieldrin-treated dopaminergic neuronal cells because pretreatment with the PKC\u03b4 inhibitor rottlerin, or transfection and over-expression of catalytically inactive PKC\u03b4(K)\u00b3\u2077\u2076(R), significantly attenuates dieldrin-induced DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is frequently used as an alternative therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), and it attenuates dopaminergic (DA) neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra (SN) in PD animal models. Using proteomic analysis, we investigated whether acupuncture alters protein expression in the SN to favor attenuation of neuronal degeneration. In C57BL/6 mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, 30 mg/kg/day), intraperitoneal (i.p.) for 5 days, 2 or 100 Hz electroacupuncture (EA) was applied at the effective and specific acupoint, GB34, once a day for 12 consecutive days from the first MPTP treatment. Both treatments in MPTP mice led to restoration of behavioral impairment and rescued tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive DA neurodegeneration. Using peptide fingerprinting MS, we identified changes in 22 proteins in the SN following MPTP treatment, and nine of these proteins were normalized by EA. They were involved in cell death regulation, inflammation, or restoration from damage. The levels of cyclophilin A (CypA), which is a neuroprotective agent, were unchanged by MPTP treatment but were increased in MPTP-EA mice. These results suggest that acupoint GB34-specific EA changes protein expression profiles in the SN in favor of DA neuronal survival in MPTP-treated mice, and that EA treatment may be an effective therapy for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work is to determine risk factors for falling in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using home-based assessments and develop a prediction model. Data on falls, balance, gait-related activities, and nonmotor symptoms were obtained from 153 PD patients (Hoehn-Yahr 2-4) in their home. Fifty-one candidate determinants for falling were independently tested using bivariate logistic regression analysis. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to identify patients susceptible to falls. Sixty-six subjects (43%) were classified as fallers. Eighteen determinants for falling were selected. The final multivariate model showed an accuracy of 74% and included: (1) Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, (2) Timed Get Up and Go (TGUG) score, (3) disease duration, (4) item 15 of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Based on disease duration, freezing symptoms, walking problems, and a prolonged TGUG duration, assessed in the home situation, it was possible to accurately identify 74% of PD patients as fallers.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. The main clinical features of PD include tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. The primary pathology of PD is degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, resulting in loss of the nigrostriatal pathway and a reduction of dopamine contents in the striatum. The biochemical and cellular changes that occur following the administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) are remarkably similar to that seen in idiopathic PD. Recent evidence shows that oxidative stress contributes to the cascade leading to dopaminergic cell degeneration in PD. However, oxidative stress is intimately linked to other components of neurodegenerative process, such as nitric oxide stress and inflammation. Recently, there is convincing evidence for the involvement of nitric oxide that reacts with superoxide to produce peroxynitrite and ultimately hydroxyl radical production. In view of these new insights, however, the role of reactive nitrogen species, reactive oxygen species and inflammation against MPTP neurotoxicity is not fully understood. In this review, we discuss the possible role of reactive nitrogen species, reactive oxygen species and inflammation in the dopaminergic neurons against MPTP neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation improves motor symptoms and quality of life in advanced Parkinson's disease. As after other life-altering surgeries, suicides have been reported following deep brain stimulation for movement disorders. We sought to determine the suicide rate following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease by conducting an international multicentre retrospective survey of movement disorder and surgical centres. We further sought to determine factors associated with suicide attempts through a nested case-control study. In the survey of suicide rate, 55/75 centres participated. The completed suicide percentage was 0.45% (24/5311) and attempted suicide percentage was 0.90% (48/5311). Observed suicide rates in the first postoperative year (263/100,000/year) (0.26%) were higher than the lowest and the highest expected age-, gender- and country-adjusted World Health Organization suicide rates (Standardized Mortality Ratio for suicide: SMR 12.63-15.64; P < 0.001) and remained elevated at the fourth postoperative year (38/100,000/year) (0.04%) (SMR 1.81-2.31; P < 0.05). The excess number of deaths was 13 for the first postoperative year and one for the fourth postoperative year. In the case-control study of associated factors, 10 centres participated. Twenty-seven attempted suicides and nine completed suicides were compared with 70 controls. Postoperative depression (P < 0.001), being single (P = 0.007) and a previous history of impulse control disorders or compulsive medication use (P = 0.005) were independent associated factors accounting for 51% of the variance for attempted suicide risk. Attempted suicides were also associated (P < 0.05) with being younger, younger Parkinson's disease onset and a previous suicide attempt. Completed suicides were associated with postoperative depression (P < 0.001). Postoperative depression remained a significant factor associated with attempted and completed suicides after correction for multiple comparisons using the stringent Bonferroni correction. Mortality in the first year following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation has been reported at 0.4%. Suicide is thus one of the most important potentially preventable risks for mortality following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. Postoperative depression should be carefully assessed and treated. A multidisciplinary assessment and follow-up is recommended.",

    "abstract": "When performing activity associated with walking, the amount of walking a person does often will depend on their plans. This study was designed to evaluate the relationship between motor planning and ambulatory persistence in participants with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to see if ambulatory persistence was related to the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL).\n20 individuals with idiopathic PD were recruited to perform the Trail making Test (a test of motor planning) and to wear a step activity monitor for 48h. The measurement of persistence of an ambulatory event consisted of the number of steps taken during an event and an ambulatory event was defined as continuous ambulation (taking step) without pausing for 3 or more seconds. The resumption of taking step (ambulation) after 3 or more seconds counted as a new ambulatory event. UPDRS-motor and ADL scale were also obtained.\nThe cumulative percentage of the total ambulatory events at each number of steps was plotted for each subject which when plotted could be described as a sigmoid curve. We found that this sigmoidal curve defined by the equation y=x(n)/(k(n)+x(n)), fit the data well, where k represents a constant specific to each subject, x represents the number of steps during each ambulatory event, and y represents the projected percentage of movement events containing x number of steps or less. (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)=0.02, R(2)=0.98). Trail making test part A was highly associated with the constant k (R=-0.74, p<0.001). The constant k was also highly associated with the UPDRS ADL subscale (R=-0.81, p=0.0001). A forward bivariate regression model including Part A of the Trail making test, and the UPDRS-ADL subscale predicted 66% of the variability of the constant k. The overall number of steps taken per day, and the UPDRS motor subscale did not contribute to the model.\nDefective motor planning in Parkinson's disease as measured by poor performance on a Trail making test is associated with a measurable alteration in ambulatory persistence, and altered ambulatory persistence, quantified by our proposed model parameter, correlates highly with the UPDRS ADL score. Thus, cognitive-motor planning defects might be a major source of disability in PD. We suggest that in future clinical practice gait tests can be used in order to quantify short-term planning ability in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson's disease in rats. 6-OHDA-induced Parkinson's disease rat model involves chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, and the loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is the predominant lesion. Resveratrol has been shown to have anti-inflammatory actions, and thus was tested for its beneficial effects using 6-OHDA-induced Parkinson's disease rat model. Adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were unilaterally injected with 6-OHDA (5 microg/2 microl) into the right striatum, and the striatum damage was assessed by rotational test, ultrahistopathology, and molecular alterations. Resveratrol (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) was then given orally to Parkinson's disease rats, daily for 10 weeks to examine the protective effects. Rotational test (turns of rats) showed that resveratrol significantly attenuated apomorphine-induced turns of rats in 6-OHDA-injuried Parkinson's disease rat model as early as two weeks of administration. Ultrastructural analysis showed that resveratrol alleviated 6-OHDA-induced chromatin condensation, mitochondrial tumefaction and vacuolization of dopaminergic neurons in rat substantia nigra. Furthermore, resveratrol treatment also significantly decreased the levels of COX-2 and TNF-alpha mRNA in the substantia nigra as detected by real-time RT-PCR. COX-2 protein expression in the substantia nigra was also decreased as evidenced by Western blotting. These results demonstrate that resveratrol exerts a neuroprotective effect on 6-OHDA-induced Parkinson's disease rat model, and this protection is related to the reduced inflammatory reaction.",

    "abstract": "Involuntary movements, or dyskinesia, represent a debilitating complication of levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease ultimately experienced by the vast majority of patients. This article does not review the increased understanding of dyskinesia pathophysiology we have seen during the past few years but, instead, specifically focuses upon the very first molecular events thought to be responsible for the establishment of dyskinesia and generally grouped under the term of \"priming\". Priming is classically defined as the process by which the brain becomes sensitized such that administration of a dopaminergic therapy modifies the response to subsequent dopaminergic treatments. In this way, over time, with repeated treatment, the chance of dopaminergic stimulation eliciting dyskinesia is increased and once dyskinesia has been established, the severity of dyskinesia increases. In this opinion review, however, we aim at strongly opposing the common view of priming. We propose, and hopefully will demonstrate, that priming does not exist per se but is the direct and intrinsic consequence of the loss of dopamine innervation of the striatum (and other target structures), meaning that the first injections of dopaminergic drugs only exacerbate those mechanisms (sensitization) but do not induce them. Chronicity and pulsatility of subsequent dopaminergic treatment only exacerbates the likelihood of developing dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "The electrophysiological evaluation of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is recommended in children aged more than five years to detect a risk of life-threatening arrhythmia. The purposes of the study were to determine the feasibility of transesophageal EPS in a child between six and 10 years in out-patient clinic.\nElectrophysiological study (EPS) was indicated in 22 children, aged six to 10 years, with a manifest WPW either for no documented tachycardia (n=7), unexplained dizziness (n=2) or for a sportive authorization in 10 asymptomatic children. Two of the last children had a history of permanent tachycardia after the birth but were asymptomatic since the age of one year without drugs.\nEPS was performed in all children. The main difficulty lied in passing the catheter through the mouth. Programmed stimulation at cycle length of 380 ms was performed in all children to avoid high rates of pacing when the conduction through the accessory pathway (AP) and normal AV system was evaluated. Isoproterenol was not required in five children, because they developed a catecholaminergic sinus tachycardia. The AP refractory period was determined in all children between 200 and 270 ms. Orthodromic reentrant tachycardia (RT) was induced in 11 children, three asymptomatic children (27%), seven complaining of tachycardia and one with syncope. Rapid antidromic tachycardia was induced in this last child with dizziness. Atrial fibrillation was never induced.\nEsophageal EPS can be performed without sedation in a young child six to 10-year-old with a shortened protocol of stimulation, which was capable to clearly evaluate the WPW-related risks.",

    "abstract": "The selective monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor selegiline is commonly administered as medical treatment to patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. The clinical value of conventional selegiline is, however, compromised by extensive first-pass metabolism, which reduces its bioavailability and leads to the production of possibly harmful methamfetamine metabolites. This review aims to evaluate a novel, orally disintegrating formulation of selegiline by examining scientific evidence from previous pharmacological and clinical studies. As a result of improved bioavailability, orally disintegrating selegiline can be administered at lower doses than conventional selegiline with similar clinical effect. It also leads to less variable selegiline blood concentrations and produces significantly less methamfetamine metabolites. We conclude that this novel formulation offers an interesting treatment option, especially for patients who report adverse events after initial treatment with conventional selegiline or who suffer from swallowing difficulties.",

In more advanced disease requiring levodopa, adjunctive monoamine oxidase B inhibitors reduce 'off' time and may improve gait and freezing.\nRasagiline and selegiline oral disintegrating tablets may reduce the safety risks associated with the amfetamine and methamfetamine metabolites of conventional oral selegiline while retaining or improving therapeutic efficacy.\nArticles were identified by searches of PubMed and searches on the Internet and reviewed. All articles and other referenced materials were retrieved using the keywords 'Parkinson's disease', 'treatment' and 'monoamine oxidase B inhibitor' and were published between 1960 and 2007, with older references selected for historical significance. Only papers published in English were reviewed.\nAccumulating data support the use of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors as monotherapy for early and mild Parkinson's disease and as adjunctive therapy for more advanced Parkinson's disease with levodopa-associated motor fluctuations. The recently released monoamine oxidase B inhibitor rasagiline and a new formulation, selegiline oral disintegrating tablets, have potential advantages over conventional oral selegiline.",

    "abstract": "This review analyzes current evidence regarding possible mechanisms of nigral damage in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD). In normal brain, a specific interplay among the blood-brain barrier (BBB), substantia nigra (SN), and locus coeruleus (LC) creates the condition for a self-accelerating damage to the SN. Three vicious circles involving SN-BBB, LC-SN-BBB, and histamine-BBB-SN interactions are described. In iPD, a self-accelerating loss of nigral cells can be triggered by brain hypoperfusion and by an increased blood histamine level. iPD-associated factors such as decreased CSF levels of substance P, somatostatin, and glutamate can aggravate the vicious-circle-induced damage to the SN.",

    "abstract": "A neuroprotective therapy is the single most important unmet medical need in Parkinson's disease. Several promising agents in the laboratory have been tested in the clinic, but none has been established in clinical trials to have a disease modifying effect despite positive results because of potential confounding symptomatic or pharmacologic effects. The delayed start design was developed to try to avoid a symptomatic confound when testing a putative neuroprotective therapy. In this study design, patients are randomly assigned to study drug or placebo in the first phase of the study, and both groups receive the active drug in the second phase. If benefits seen at the end of phase I persist through the end of phase II, they cannot be readily explained by a symptomatic effect (as patients in both groups are receiving the same medication) and benefits in the early start group must relate to the early initiation of the treatment. Although the precise mechanism responsible for such an effect can be debated, positive results in a delayed start study indicate that patients who receive early treatment have a better outcome than those where the treatment is delayed. We are using the delayed start design to assess the potential disease modifying effects of rasagiline in a prospective double blind controlled trial (the ADAGIO study). We here describe the rationale for the study and baseline characteristics of the 1,176 patients who have been enrolled into the trial.",

    "abstract": "The development of novel immune-based therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases is an area of intense focus. Neurodegenerative diseases represent a particular challenge since in many cases the onset of symptoms occurs after considerable degeneration has ensued. Based on human genetic and histopathological evidence from patients with neurodegenerative diseases, animal models that recapitulate specific pathologic features have been developed. Utilizing these animal models in combination with viral vector-based gene therapeutics, specific epochs of disease can be targeted. One common feature of several neurodegenerative diseases is misfolded proteins. The mechanism by which these altered protein conformers lead to neurodegeneration is not completely understood but much effort has been put forward to either degrade aberrant protein or prevent the formation of misfolded conformers. In this review, we will summarize work that employs viral vector gene therapeutics to modulate the brain's response to misfolded proteins with a specific focus on neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review explores the effects of dysphagia treatment for Parkinson's disease. The review includes rehabilitative, surgical, pharmacologic, and other treatments. Only oropharyngeal dysphagia is selected for this literature search, excluding dysphagia due to esophageal or gastric disorders. The effects of deep brain stimulation on dysphagia are not included. In general, the literature concerning dysphagia treatment in Parkinson's disease is rather limited. Most effect studies show diverse methodologic problems. Multiple case studies and trials are identified by searching biomedical literature databases PubMed and Embase, and by hand-searching reference lists. The conclusions of most studies cannot be compared with one another because of heterogeneous therapy methods and outcome measures. Further research based on randomized controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of different therapies for dysphagia in Parkinson's disease is required.",

    "abstract": "Camptocormia is an abnormal flexion of the thoracolumbar spine during standing and walking that abates in the recumbent position.\nIn a single-centre epidemiological and clinical study, the prevalence of camptocormia in Parkinson disease (PD) and its relationship with the clinical features of PD were investigated. A total of 275 consecutive outpatients were systematically screened for camptocormia with a clinical evaluation. Patients who screened positive for camptocormia were subsequently reassessed by formal goniometric analysis. The demographic and clinical features of the patients with and without camptocormia were then compared.\nA 6.9% (19/275, 95% CI, 4.2 to 10.6) prevalence of camptocormia was found. Camptocormia was found in patients with more severe PD, as clinically assessed by the Hoehn-Yahr (HY) staging and the motor Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III, longer l-dopa treatment duration and greater l-dopa daily dose and presence of DSM-IV dementia. Camptocormia was reported to develop after the clinical onset of PD. No correlation was found between the degree of trunk flexion and age, duration of PD, UPDRS motor score, HY staging, and l-dopa treatment duration and dose. As a risk factor, the study identified previous vertebral surgery.\nCamptocormia, a relatively common sign in PD seems to be related to the clinical severity of PD.",

Galantamine was administered over 16 weeks (8 mg/day for 4 weeks, a therapeutic dose of 16 mg/day for 6 weeks and a maximum dose of 24 mg/day for 6 weeks). Outcome measures were neuropsychological (attention, verbal fluency, executive, memory, visuospatial), behavioural (Frontal Systems Behavior Scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire, PDQ-39) and motor (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scale).\n26 individuals on active medication and 28 individuals on placebo were included in the outcome analyses. No significant differences were found between the active and placebo groups on cognitive, behavioural or motor outcome measures. Most common adverse events were gastrointestinal and self-reported worsening of PD symptoms.\nContrary to our hypotheses, galantamine treatment did not improve attention/executive, memory or visuospatial performance in non-demented PD patients. Further, there was a high, statistically significant drop-out rate in the treatment group due to gastrointestinal side effects and self-reported worsening of PD symptoms. Treatment with galantamine did not enhance self-perception of mental sharpness or quality of life. No negative behavioural change such as hallucinations or apathy was found with treatment.",

    "abstract": "Quadrupedal limb coordination during human walking was recently shown to be upregulated during obstacle stepping. An anticipatory activity of coupled cervico-thoraco-lumbar interneuronal circuits is followed by an appropriate executory activation of leg and arm muscles during task performance. This mechanism was studied in subjects with Parkinson's disease and age-matched controls walking on a treadmill with a randomly approaching obstacle. Spinal reflex (SR) responses, evoked by tibial nerve stimulation during mid-stance, were present in all arm and leg muscles investigated. They were larger before execution of obstacle avoidance compared with normal steps in both subject groups. The performance of obstacle stepping was slightly worse in Parkinson's disease than in control subjects. The anticipatory SR in the arm muscles prior to normal and obstacle steps was larger in Parkinson's disease compared with age-matched subjects, but smaller in the tibialis anterior. The arm and leg muscle activation was stronger during obstacle compared with normal swing but did not differ between Parkinson's disease and age-matched subjects. These observations indicate that quadrupedal limb coordination is basically preserved in Parkinson's disease subjects. Our data are consistent with the proposal that in Parkinson's disease subjects the enhanced anticipatory spinal neuronal activity (reflected in the SR) in the arm muscles is required to achieve an appropriate muscle activation for the automatic control of body equilibrium during the performance of the task. In the tibialis anterior the SR is attenuated presumably because of a stronger voluntary (i.e. cortical) control of leg movements.",

    "abstract": "Current therapies for Parkinson's disease significantly improve the quality of life for patients suffering from this neurodegenerative disease, yet none of the current therapies has been convincingly shown to slow or prevent the progression of disease. Much has been learned about the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease in recent years, and these discoveries offer a variety of potential targets for protective therapy. Mechanisms implicated in the disease process include oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation and misfolding, inflammation, excitotoxicity, and apoptosis. At the same time, the involvement of these diverse processes makes modeling the disease and evaluation of potential treatments difficult. In addition, available clinical tools are limited in their ability to monitor the progression of the disease. In this review, we summarize the different pathogenic mechanisms implicated in Parkinson's disease and neuroprotective strategies targeting these mechanisms currently under clinical study or under preclinical development, with a view towards strategies that seem most promising.",

    "abstract": "Excessive methylation may be a precipitating factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) since S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the endogenous methyl donor, induces PD-like changes when injected into the rat brain. The hydrolysis of the methyl ester bond of the methylated proteins produces methanol. Since methanol is oxidized into formaldehyde, and formaldehyde into formic acid in the body, we investigated the effects of SAM on the production of methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid in rat brain striatal homogenates and the toxicity of these products in PC12 cells.\nRadio-enzymatic and colorimetric assays, cell viability, Western blot.\nSAM increased the formation of methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Concentrations of [3H-methyl]-SAM at 0.17, 0.33, 0.67 and 1.34 nM produced 3.8, 8.0, 18.3 and 34.4 fmol/mg protein/h of [3H] methanol in rat striatal homogenates, respectively. SAM also significantly generated formaldehyde and formic acid in striatal homogenates. Formaldehyde was the most toxic metabolite to differentiated PC12 pheochromocytoma cells in cell culture studies, indicating that formaldehyde formed endogenously may contribute to neuronal damage in excessive methylation conditions. Subtoxic concentration of formaldehyde decreased the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, the limiting factor in dopamine synthesis. Formaldehyde was more toxic to catecholaminergic PC12 cells than C6 glioma cells, indicating that neurons are more vulnerable to formaldehyde than glia cells.\nWe suggest that excessive carboxylmethylation of proteins might be involved in the SAM-induced PD-like changes and in the aging process via the toxic effects of formaldehyde.",

Co-ordinated neural activities are dependent on a series of parallel neuronal networks passing through the basal ganglia connecting and integrating functions. In healthy subjects, these competing, yet complementary, networks permit tight regulation in the broad domains of motor, cognitive, and limbic functions. In patients with PD, the loss of striatal dopamine coupled with the limited repertoire of the output nuclei within these pathways allows for an element of 'cross-talk' between competing inputs, which in turn could lead to a paroxysmal excessive inhibition of the thalamus and pedunculopontine nucleus triggering freezing of gait. It is further postulated that this phenomenon may be acting via a transient period of increased synchronization within the basal ganglia oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Some APOE or tau gene polymorphisms have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The reports of a possible association between the APOE 4 allele and dementia in PD are controversial, and some studies suggest that the tau H1/H1 genotype may increase the risk of dementia in PD. Here we analysed these APOE and tau polymorphisms in 86 clinically diagnosed PD patients with dementia (PDD), in 138 clinically diagnosed non-demented PD (PDND) patients, and in 91 healthy controls. Genomic DNA isolated from blood was used for PCR and subsequent RFLP analysis. We examined the possible genetic association of these polymorphisms with dementia in PD, but found no differences in genotypic distributions between the PDND, PDD, and control groups. The effects of tau and APOE polymorphisms on the age at dementia onset were studied using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis but no significant association were found. The lack of association between the APOE 4 allele and PDD suggests that the pathological process involved in the development of dementia in PD is different from the one that occurs in AD.",

    "abstract": "Producing accurate movements may rely on the functional independence of sensorimotor circuits within basal ganglia nuclei. In parkinsonism there is abnormal synchrony of electrical activity within these circuits that results in a loss of independence across motor channels. Local field potential (LFP) recordings reflect the summation of local electrical fields and an increase in LFP power reflects increased synchrony in local neuronal networks. We recorded LFPs from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead in the operating room in 22 cases from 16 subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) who were off medication. There was elevated LFP power at beta frequencies (13-35 Hz) at rest. The LFP spectral profile was consistent across several periods of rest that were separated by movement and/or DBS, and appeared to be a relatively stationary phenomenon. The spectral profile and frequencies of the beta-band peak(s) varied among subjects but were similar between the right and left STNs within certain individuals. These results suggest that the LFP spectrum at rest may characterize a \"signature\" rhythm for an individual with PD. Beta-band power was attenuated after intra-operative STN DBS (p<0.05). The attenuation lasted for 10 s after short periods (30 s) and for up to 50 s after longer periods (5 min) of DBS. The finding that longer periods of DBS attenuated beta power for a longer time suggests that there may be long-acting functional changes to networks in the STN in PD after chronic DBS.",

    "abstract": "Several genetic variations have been associated with Parkinson disease in different populations over the past few years. Although a considerable number of worldwide populations have been screened for these variants, results from Sub-Saharan populations are very scarce in the literature. In the present report we have screened a cohort of Parkinson disease patients (n = 57) and healthy controls (n = 51) from Nigeria for mutations in the genes PRKN, LRRK2 and ATXN3. No pathogenic mutations were found in any of the genes. Hence, common pathogenic mutations in these genes, observed in several different populations, are not a frequent cause of Parkinson disease in Nigeria.",

The sample variance was used to analyze the pressure measurements, demonstrating a numerical similarity of the results obtained with the swallowing of saliva or of biscuits (VAR = 4.41). A statistical difference was observed between the swallowing of saliva and biscuits, showing a significant pressure increase at the end of the rehabilitation program (p < 0.001).\nThe effortful swallow maneuver reinforced by using biofeedback appears to be a therapeutic resource in the rehabilitation of oropharyngeal dysphagia in Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology with probable involvement of genetic-environmental factors. The majority of PD cases (approximately 90-95%) are sporadic, while familial cases account for approximately 5-10% of PD. In a recent report, a heterozygous LRRK2 P755L mutation within LRRK2 exon 19 was found in 2% of Chinese sporadic PD patients and in 0% of normal controls or Caucasians, suggesting that the mutation is disease-associated with ethnic specificity. To further evaluate the role of LRRK2 P755L variant in sporadic PD, we performed direct sequencing of LRRK2 exon 19 in 501 Japanese sporadic PD patients (male 249, female 252, aged 28-92 years, mean 65.0 years) and 583 controls of the Japanese general population as an extended association study. In this group, we found six patients (6/501 = 1.2%) and eight controls of the general population (8/583 = 1.6%) with a heterozygous P755L variant (P = 0.80, chi(2) = 0.064). No other variants were found in exon 19. Together with previous reports, our extended case-controlled study of large sample size suggests that LRRK2 P755L is a non-disease-associated polymorphism in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress appears to be directly involved in the pathogenesis of the neurodegeneration of dopaminergic systems in Parkinson disease. In this study, we formed four dopamine modification adducts derived from docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6/omega-3) and arachidonic acid (C18:4/omega-6), which are known as the major polyunsaturated fatty acids in the brain. Upon incubation of dopamine with fatty acid hydroperoxides and an in vivo experiment using rat brain tissue, all four dopamine adducts were detected. Furthermore, hexanoyl dopamine (HED), an arachidonic acid-derived adduct, caused severe cytotoxicity in human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, whereas the other adducts were only slightly affected. The HED-induced cell death was found to include apoptosis, which also seems to be mediated by reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial abnormality. Additionally, the experiments using monoamine transporter inhibitor and mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells that lack the monoamine transporter indicate that the HED-induced cytotoxicity might specially occur in the neuronal cells. These data suggest that the formation of the docosahexaenoic acid- and arachidonic acid-derived dopamine adducts in vitro and in vivo, and HED, the arachidonic acid-derived dopamine modification adduct, which caused selective cytotoxicity of neuronal cells, may indicate a novel mechanism responsible for the pathogenesis in Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting nearly 3 million patients in Europe and North America, characterized by a core phenotype of motor deficits, akinesia, rigidity, postural disturbance and tremor, which is complicated by other neurological deficits during its long progression. Our knowledge about the pathophisiology of PD was limited, up to 25 years ago, to the observation of the lesion of the nigro-striatal dopamine neurons in these patients. The subjects who developed PD as a consequence of exposure to neurotoxic compounds, increased our knowledge about the pathogenesis of this disease. More recently, genetic alterations have been found in patients with PD. The function of the proteins coded by the genes involved in PD has been investigated in genetic models of this disease from invertebrate to rodents. Mutated proteins responsible for PD have been tested in vivo and in vitro, in cellular models or in artificial constructs. A wealth of important information about the function of alpha-synuclein, parkin, DJ-1, PINK and dardarin is available, most notably about the first two causes of familial PD discovered, alpha-synuclein and parkin, responsible for autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive PD, respectively. Different animal models of alpha-synuclein and parkin have been extensively investigated. The in vitro and in vivo studies performed in genetic models of PD have shown that the proteins involved in the pathogenesis of PD interact with one another and have multiple mechanisms of cell toxicity. From the available data, it is clear that the mechanisms leading to cell degeneration in PD are variable in the different subtypes of this disease. Neuroprotective therapies should, therefore, be multiple and tailored according to the factors involved in the different cases. In this study, we review what we have learned from the genetic models of PD and the putative strategies to be tested in the near future.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the level of agreement between caregiver and Parkinson's disease (PD) patient reports of neuropsychiatric problems.\nForty-three patients and 43 informants who knew the patient well (caregivers) participated in the study. Caregivers rated patients' behaviour, as well as their own stress, using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Information from patients was obtained using commonly used scales (Beck Depression Inventory, Apathy Scale, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Depression Scale). Both the patients and the caregivers also completed the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale, which assesses behaviours associated with apathy, disinhibition and executive dysfunction.\nThe level of agreement between these self and caregiver reports was low, with only 45.8% agreement for depression, 45.0% for apathy, 28.6% for hallucinations, 26.9% for sleep problems and 6.7% for anxiety.\nGiven this low level of agreement between self and other report, these two methods of assessment cannot be considered interchangeable.",

    "abstract": "The membrane transporter multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1, P-gp) regulates the bioavailability of endogenous and exogenous compounds and has been implicated in disorders such as Parkinson's disease, cancer, epilepsy, human immunodeficiency virus disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. To promote further understanding of the role of MDR1 in disease, we have characterized cellular MDR1 mRNA expression in post-mortem human and fresh-frozen Sprague-Dawley rat tissues by using radioactive oligonucleotide probe in situ hybridization. We report MDR1 mRNA in human and rat endothelial cells of small vessels in the brain and pia mater. Mdr1 mRNA is also expressed in the blood vessel walls of rat sensory dorsal root and sympathetic ganglia. In peripheral tissues, we have observed MDR1 mRNA in human and rat liver and renal tubules and in human adrenal cortex and the epithelial lining of rat intestine. In female and male reproductive tissues of rat, strong gene activity has been found in steroid-hormone-synthesizing cells. Quantification of MDR1 mRNA in human striatum has revealed reduced levels in Parkinson patients compared with control individuals. The high expression of MDR1 mRNA in blood vessels of the nervous system, in tissues involved in absorption and excretion, and in tissues forming barriers to the environment support the physiological role of MDR1 as a regulator of intracellular levels of endogenous and exogenous compounds.",

    "abstract": "In our stereotactic procedure, intraoperative radiological documentation of electrode localization is performed using the Stereoplan. The aim of the study was to evaluate its accuracy.\nData of 20 consecutive patients, treated for Parkinson's disease by implantation of deep brain stimulators into the subthalamic nucleus, were collected prospectively. During surgery, Stereoplan coordinates of the tip of the central macroelectrodes were compared with intended coordinates along the central trajectory at 4 levels: (1) 10 mm above the anatomical target, (2) in the target, (3) in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, and (4) at the depth of contact 1. Before the frame's removal, Stereoplan coordinates of the contacts of the definitive electrode were compared with postoperative MRI coordinates. The mean of the differences was calculated in the x-, y-, and z-axis. Clinical results at 6 months were recorded.\nThe mean of the differences between Stereoplan coordinates and intended coordinates for the macroelectrodes was lower than 1 mm. A submillimeter difference was also found for the definitive contacts. At 6 months, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III score improved by 70.6% compared with the baseline score. Dyskinesia and motor fluctuations decreased by 85.7 and 87%, respectively (p < 0.0001).\nStereoplan could be considered an accurate intraoperative radiological system which assures the correct position of the electrode in the anatomical target.",

Improvement in motor function of PD patients has been established with subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS). While variations in DBS settings (i.e. amplitude, frequency and pulse width) on motor function have been explored, little data has evaluated the relationship of DBS settings on cognitive function. This study evaluated the extent to which DBS settings were associated with cognitive function.\nThe study was a prospective clinical trial of STN DBS for the treatment of refractory PD. Twenty patients were evaluated once preoperatively and an average of 5 months following bilateral STN DBS. Measures included a test of motor disability, a neuropsychological test battery and subjective mood measures of anxiety and depression.\nMotor function significantly improved following bilateral STN DBS. Compared to preoperative performance, verbal fluency declined while visuoconstructional skills improved. Amplitude and pulse width were significantly correlated with measures of cognitive function. Multiple regression found DBS stimulator settings, along with anxiety, to be significant predictors of cognitive measures.\nIncreased amplitude and pulse width and decreased anxiety were associated with improved cognitive test scores. Although preliminary, these data have potential theoretical and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a common manifestation of Parkinson disease (PD) which is characterized by dream-enacting behaviors, unpleasant dreams, and loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep.

The effects on RBD were evaluated before and 3 months after stable pramipexole therapy through patient and bed partner interviews and blind assessment of video-polysomnographic measures. Pramipexole improved parkinsonism in all patients. Patients and bed partners reported no significant changes in frequency and severity of the abnormal RBD related motor and vocal sleep behaviors or the frequency of unpleasant dreams. Video-polysomnography analyses showed no differences in RBD related sleep measures including tonic submental electromyographic activity, phasic submental electromyographic activity, percentage of REM sleep time spent with abnormal behaviors, and severity of the abnormal behaviors detected on the videotapes.\nIn PD, pramipexole improved parkinsonism but did not modify RBD related symptoms and objective video-polysomnographic abnormalities. This observation suggests that in PD, dopamine mechanisms do not play a central role in the pathogenesis of RBD.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we report a patient with Parkinson's disease (PD) presenting with subacute motor symptoms, especially rigidity. The 75-year-old man had relatively moderate PD for 12 years, which was treated with levodopa until he developed marked rigidity. The rigidity became worse, with prolonged off-periods, despite treatment with increased doses of levodopa. At the time of hospitalization he was unable to walk independently, but the clinical neurological examination only revealed aggravation of parkinsonian signs. MRI of the brain showed an intracerebral lesion, which was later confirmed as glioblastoma multiforme. The main feature was onset of marked rigidity a few weeks before severe tumour-specific symptoms developed, but spasticity or hyperreflexia were neither reported at the time of symptom exacerbation nor during hospitalization. This case demonstrates the importance of considering other underlying neurological disease in parkinsonian patients presenting with rapid progression of parkinsonian symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1) is regarded as one of the mammalian cell's main antioxidant enzymes inactivating hydrogen peroxide and protecting against oxidative stress. Using control, Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies tissue (DLB) we have shown that GPx-1 is a 21-kD protein under reducing conditions in all tissues examined but is not in high abundance in human brain. Using immunohistochemistry we have mapped the cellular distribution of GPx-1 and have shown it to be in highest levels in microglia and with lower levels in neurons. Only a trace amount was detectable in astrocytes using immunofluorescence and GPx-1 was not detectable in oligodendrocytes. GPx-1 positive microglia were hypertrophied and more abundant in PD and DLB tissues and were seen to be making multiple contacts with neurons. In some cases neurons containing Lewy bodies were surrounded by microglia. Unstructured Lewy bodies were enveloped with a layer of GPx-1 that was partially colocalized with alpha-synuclein whereas concentric Lewy bodies had discrete deposits of GPx-1 around the periphery which appeared to be involved in the degradation of the Lewy bodies. These results suggest that abnormal alpha-synuclein as found in Lewy bodies produce hydrogen peroxide and these neurons are capable of directing antioxidant enzymes to regions of oxidative stress. These results also suggest that GPx-1 positive microglia are involved in neuroprotection in PD and DLB and that GPx-1 is an important antioxidant enzyme in neuronal defences.",

    "abstract": "This Practice Point commentary discusses long-term follow-up of a treatment intervention study on Parkinson disease (PD). Katzenschlager et al. report on 166 of 302 survivors of a randomized open-label study that compared initial therapy with levodopa, with levodopa plus selegiline, or with bromocriptine, in early untreated PD. The primary study publication, from 1993, suggested that bromocriptine-treated participants were less likely than levodopa-treated participants to develop motor complications during the subsequent 4 years, although levodopa was more effective at relieving symptoms of parkinsonism. The current publication presents data after a median follow-up of 14 years and suggests that protection from motor complications does not persist over the long term. Furthermore, participants who were randomly allocated to initial treatment with levodopa showed better relief of disability and better quality of life over the long term. More than 60% of the original PD cohort had died over the 14-year time interval, underscoring the continued poor prognosis of late-stage PD. The Katzenschlager studies and other recent publications underscore the need to develop newer treatment strategies that consider the multisystem nature of the illness and expand treatment horizons beyond the single neurotransmitter dopamine.",

These data support a possible role of vitamin D insufficiency in PD. Further studies are needed to determine the factors contributing to these differences and elucidate the potential role of vitamin D in pathogenesis and clinical course of PD.",

    "abstract": "Many patients with Parkinson disease (PD) have excessive daytime sleepiness and numerous nocturnal sleep abnormalities.\nTo determine the safety and efficacy of the controlled drug sodium oxybate in a multicenter, open-label, polysomnographic study in subjects with PD and sleep disorders. Design, Setting, and Patients Inclusion required an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score greater than 10 and any subjective nocturnal sleep concern, usually insomnia. An acclimation and screening polysomnogram was performed to exclude subjects with sleep-disordered breathing. The following evening, subjects underwent another polysomnogram, followed by an evaluation with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) while practically defined off (\"off\") PD medications, ESS (primary efficacy point), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory, and Fatigue Severity Scale. Subjects then started sodium oxybate therapy, which was titrated from 3 to 9 g per night in split doses (at bedtime and 4 hours later) across 6 weeks, and returned for subjective sleep assessments. They then returned at 12 weeks after initiating therapy for a third polysomnogram, an off-medication UPDRS evaluation, and subjective sleep assessments. Data are expressed as mean (SD).\nWe enrolled 38 subjects. At screening, 8 had sleep apnea (n = 7) or depression (n = 1). Twenty-seven of 30 subjects completed the study. Three dropped out owing to dizziness (n = 3) and concurrent depression (n = 1). The mean dose of sodium oxybate was 7.8 (1.7) g per night. The ESS score improved from 15.6 (4.2) to 9.0 (5.0) (P < .001); the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory score, from 10.9 (4.0) to 6.6 (3.9) (P < .001); and the Fatigue Severity Scale score, from 42.9 (13.2) to 36.3 (14.3) (P < .001). Mean slow-wave sleep time increased from 41.3 (33.2) to 78.0 (61.2) minutes (P = .005). Changes in off-medication UPDRS scores were not significant, from 28.4 (10.3) to 26.2 (9.6).\nNocturnally administered sodium oxybate improved excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue in PD.\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00641186.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients may complain of unsteadiness and impaired balance not only when OFF, but also while being ON with levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), yet influence of LID upon postural stability has not been specifically examined. In this study, we addressed this issue using static and dynamic posturography in patients with advanced PD and typical LID. Relevant postural stability parameters were measured on force platforms when patients were OFF and ON, either in quiet standing or when performing leaning tasks designed to stress postural stability. Simultaneously, LID was assessed clinically using a dyskinesia rating scale of severity and subjective unsteadiness was computed. Displacement of the net center of pressure (COPnet), range of COPnet in the mediolateral and antero-posterior directions and 95% confidence ellipse area for both feet were measured as indicators of postural stability and used for comparison analyses. We found a significant increase of COPnet displacement in all tasks up to 556% (mean: 125+/-165%) when patients were ON with dyskinesia compared to the OFF state. In about half of the patients, this increase was marked and correlated with subjective unsteadiness while ON. There was a good correlation between the clinical scores of dyskinesia severity and most COPnet values. Patients demonstrated a tendency to sustain their weight on the foot less affected by dyskinesia, probably as a compensatory mechanism. Our results suggest that LID may compromise balance and independently contribute to postural instability in advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "This qualitative study explored the perceptions of adults with Parkinson's disease (PD) about the positive and negative aspects and outcomes of a community-based progressive resistance strengthening programme (PRST), motivators to begin and continue with the PRST program, and factors that might facilitate or create barriers to participation in and completion of a PRST programme.\nThree women and 10 men with PD participated in a 10-week community-based strengthening programme. Participants were interviewed at the end of the programme. A phenomenological theoretical framework and a grounded theory methodology were used to underpin the analysis of these data.\nFour themes emerged about the participants' experiences of the programme. These were: (i) Motivators for participation in the PRST programme were broader than physical outcomes, (ii) the outcomes were broader than just physical outcomes, (iii) the indicators of success for participants varied, and (iv) the participants' experience of a disease-specific exercise programme was positive.\nThe outcomes of this study provide insights, not identified through the quantitative results, into the experiences of people with PD, which have implications for clinicians running future strength training programmes for people with PD.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic variance of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), monitored by transcranial doppler (TCD), can reveal the integrated effects of cardio-cerebral vascular autoregulation. We investigated the characteristics of CBFV curve during active standing in multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy volunteers.\nThe CBFV curve of middle cerebral arteries was recorded using TCD in 22 patients with probable MSA; 20 PD patients and 20 volunteers matched for age. All individuals started in a supine posture, followed by abrupt standing for 2 min before returning to supine. The features of CBFV curve were compared among the groups.\nIn the healthy volunteers, the CBFV decreased following standing up but quickly rebounded and reached the same or greater level as the supine baseline. Afterwards, the CBFV decreased abruptly to a sustained level, lower than the supine baseline, forming a spike wave that appeared in CBFV curve. This spike wave was present in 5/22 of MSA, significantly less than PD patients (18/20) and volunteers (20/20) (P<0.001). The CBFV decrease after standing showed no significant difference between MSA than PD (9+/-7 vs. 6+/-3 cm/s, P=0.163).\nThe different pattern of CBFV curves during active standing suggests MSA may possess cardio-cerebral vascular modulation different from PD. The clinical value of the CBFV curve in differentiating MSA from PD needs further investigation.",

This spike wave was present in 5/22 of MSA, significantly less than PD patients (18/20) and volunteers (20/20) (P<0.001). The CBFV decrease after standing showed no significant difference between MSA than PD (9+/-7 vs. 6+/-3 cm/s, P=0.163).",

    "abstract": "Non-dopaminergic treatments are increasingly being recognised as part of the therapeutic armamentarium for Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinical and pathological studies have shown that the disease extends beyond the substantia nigra pars compacta and involves various non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems that mediate both motor and non-motor symptoms that characterise PD. To date, several therapeutic strategies have been proposed to treat such symptoms. However, despite the significant morbidity associated with these symptoms, particularly non-motor symptoms, research into and drug development for problems such as mood and autonomic dysfunction remain scarce. Here, we review novel non-dopaminergic approaches that are in at least phase II clinical development for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "A variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly occur in Parkinson's disease. Extensive research the last 10 years has provided new knowledge in the field.\nThis review is based on literature retrieved from a Medline search and own research and clinical experience.\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms occur in the majority of patients with Parkinson's disease, and are associated with impaired quality of life for patients and relatives, additional deterioration of function and increased use of health resources. Medical and surgical therapies can induce or worsen such symptoms. Cognitive impairment and dementia are among the most common and severe complications to Parkinson's disease. No disease-modifying treatment is available, but rivastigmine was effective in one large randomised trial. Visual hallucinations are common and often persistent, but can be treated with klozapin if reducing the number and dose of antiparkinson agents are not helpful. Depression occurs frequently, usually mild, but there is little evidence of treatment efficacy. Apathy, anxiety and sleep disturbances are additional commonly occurring neuropsychiatric symptoms. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are so frequent in Parkinson's disease that they should be considered an integral part of the disease; it is important that clinicians are aware of these symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Early Parkinson's disease is dominated by a motor syndrome called parkinsonism, but as the disease develops motor complications and non-motor problems may occur as well. This paper describes how to diagnose Parkinson's disease and the various motor complications and gives recommendations on how to treat the symptoms in these patients.\nThe paper builds on international evidence-based publications and the Norwegian guidelines for treatment of Parkinson's disease.\nMotor symptoms such as tremor at rest, akinesia, rigidity and postural instability are the cardinal signs in Parkinson's disease. After diagnosing a patient with the disease we recommend to start with selegiline as a disease-modifying treatment strategy. When symptoms lead to functional impairment, symptomatic treatment should be started in addition. Dopamine agonists are primarily recommended in younger patients and levodopa in the older ones. When the patients develop motor complications it is important to first thoroughly evaluate the problems to arrive at the best possible treatment strategy. If a sufficient response is not obtained both deep brain stimulation and treatment with continuous delivery of medication should be considered.",

    "abstract": "The \"orbitofrontal\" and \"cingulate\" frontostriatal loops and the mesolimbic dopaminergic system that modulates their function have been implicated in theory of mind (ToM). Parkinson's disease (PD) provides a model for assessing their role in humans. Results of the handful of previous studies of ToM in PD providing preliminary evidence of impairment remain controversial, mainly because the patients included in these studies were not accurately described, making it difficult to determine whether their ToM deficits were due to general cognitive deterioration or to a more specific dopaminergic deficit. The aim of our study was therefore to re-examine previous results highlighting ToM in PD and to explore the involvement of the dopaminergic pathways in ToM. ToM was investigated in 17 newly diagnosed PD patients (early PD group), 27 PD patients in the advanced stages of the disease (advanced PD group) and 26 healthy matched controls (HC), using two ToM tasks: a visual one, which is thought to reflect the \"affective\" ToM subcomponent (\"Reading the Mind in the Eyes\"), and a verbal one, which is thought to reflect both the \"affective\" and the \"cognitive\" ToM subcomponents (faux pas recognition). Furthermore, the early PD group was studied in two conditions: with and without dopamine replacement therapy (DRT). We failed to find any significant difference in ToM between the early PD patients and the HC group. Furthermore, there was no difference between the early PD patients in the medicated and unmedicated conditions. Conversely, the advanced PD patients scored poorly on the intention attribution question (\"cognitive\" ToM score) in the faux pas recognition task. The present results suggest that the deficit in ToM only occurs in the more advanced stages of the disease. In addition, our results would appear to indicate that these advanced PD patients present \"cognitive\" ToM impairment rather than global (\"cognitive\" and \"affective\") ToM impairment. In other words, the ToM deficit would appear to be present in PD patients where the degenerative process has spread beyond the dopaminergic pathways, but not in early PD patients where neuronal loss is thought to be restricted to the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. In conclusion, our results suggest that the dopaminergic pathways are not involved in ToM.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure that has been shown effective in improving the cardinal motor signs of advanced Parkinson's disease, however, declines in cognitive function have been associated with bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS. Despite the fact that most activities of daily living clearly have motor and cognitive components performed simultaneously, postoperative assessments of cognitive and motor function occur, in general, in isolation of one another. The primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of unilateral and bilateral STN DBS on upper extremity motor function and cognitive performance under single- and dual-task conditions in advanced Parkinson's disease patients. Data were collected from eight advanced Parkinson's disease patients between the ages of 48 and 70 years (mean 56.5) who had bilaterally placed STN stimulators. Stimulation parameters for DBS devices were optimized clinically and were stable for at least 6 months prior to study participation. Data were collected while patients were Off anti-parkinsonian medications under three stimulation conditions: Off stimulation, unilateral DBS and bilateral DBS. In each stimulation condition patients performed a cognitive (n-back task) and motor (force tracking) task under single- and dual-task conditions. During dual-task conditions, patients performed the n-back and force-maintenance task simultaneously. Under relatively simple dual-task conditions there were no differences in cognitive or motor performance under unilateral and bilateral stimulation. As dual-task complexity increased, cognitive and motor performance was significantly worse with bilateral compared with unilateral stimulation. In the most complex dual-task condition (i.e. 2-back + force tracking), bilateral stimulation resulted in a level of motor performance that was similar to the Off stimulation condition. Significant declines in cognitive and motor function under modest dual-task conditions with bilateral but not with unilateral STN DBS suggest that unilateral procedures may be an alternative to bilateral DBS for some patients, in particular, those with asymmetric symptomology. From a clinical perspective, these results underscore the need to assess cognitive and motor function simultaneously during DBS programming as these conditions may better reflect the context in which daily activities are performed.",

Rater-based -SCOPA-Motor, modified Parkinson's Psychosis Rating Scale, Clinical Impression of Severity Index for PD (CISI-PD), Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatrics- and self-administered -SCOPA-Autonomic, SCOPA-Sleep, SCOPA-Psychosocial, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, EuroQoL- assessments were applied. For SCOPA-Cog, the following psychometric attributes were analysed: acceptability, internal consistency, dimensionality, construct validity, and precision. A cut-off point for dementia and SCOPA-Cog score's predictors were explored.\nSCOPA-Cog was free from floor and ceiling effect. The internal consistency was satisfactory (alpha = 0,83) and the item-total correlation resulted equal or upper than 0,45. Two factors were identified (52% of variance), one of them formed by 3 out of the 4 memory-related items. The correlation with other measures was weak (rS < 0,35), except for the CISI-PD's item 'cognitive state' (rS = 0,51). SCOPA-Cog scored significantly different for Hoehn and Yahr stages and for patients grouped by age, age at onset of PD, and education. The standard error of measurement was 3,02. A cut-off point 19/20 reached 76% sensitivity and specificity for dementia. Age and age at onset of PD resulted the strongest predictors.\nSCOPA-Cog is a consistent, valid, and precise measure for assessment of the cognitive disorder in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease with invariant loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons and striatal projections. This disorder is well known for the associated motoric symptoms including resting tremor and the inability to initiate movement. However, it is now apparent that Parkinson's disease is a multisystem disorder with patients exhibiting symptoms derived from peripheral nervous system and extra-nigral dysfunctions in addition to the prototypical nigrostriatal damage. Although the etiology for sporadic Parkinson's disease is unknown, information gleaned from both familial forms of the disease and animal models places misfolded alpha-synuclein at the forefront. The disease is currently without a cure and most therapies target the motoric symptoms relying on increasing dopamine tone. In this review, the role of alpha-synuclein in disease pathogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target focusing on toxic conformers of this protein is considered. The addition of protofibrillar/oligomer-directed neurotherapeutics to the existing armamentarium may extend the symptom-free stage of Parkinson's disease as well as alleviate pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that impairment of mitochondrial function and oxidative damage are contributing factors to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have reported decreased levels of the mitochondrial electron transport chain carrier, coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) in plasma and platelets from PD patients. Although a deficit in peripheral CoQ(10) has been reported no studies have assessed the CoQ(10) status of the PD brain. In this study we investigated the CoQ(10) status of the substantia nigra, cerebellum, cortex and striatum brain regions of both PD patients and age-matched controls. The results of this study indicate a significant reduction (p=0.007) in CoQ(10) concentration in the cortex region of the brain. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate evidence of a deficit in brain CoQ(10) status may be involved in the pathophysiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms that respond to dopaminergic therapy. However, there is increasing interest in nonmotor PD features such as hyposmia, sleep disorders, dementia, depression, and psychoses. We review neuroimaging studies in nonmotor symptoms of PD and the use of dopaminergic imaging to support screening of nonmotor symptoms for early PD. Neuroimaging data document nonmotor pathophysiologic involvement of systems beyond the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. These neuroimaging studies support a broader view of PD with early involvement in time and wider involvement of monoamine and cortical systems that may provide targets for novel therapies for nonmotor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Different loss-of-function mutations were identified underlying PGRN haploinsufficiency in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. PGRN mutations were also identified in other neurodegenerative brain diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer disease, though their biologic contribution to these diseases remains elusive. Because of its apparent role in neuronal survival, we argued that PGRN might also contribute to Parkinson disease (PD) pathogenesis.\nWe screened PGRN exons for mutations in 255 patients with PD and 459 control individuals by direct genomic sequencing. Genetic association of PGRN with risk for PD was assessed using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the gene.\nIn patients we identified four missense mutations of which p.Asp33Glu and p.Arg514Met were absent in control individuals. Single SNP and haplotype analyses did not detect significant associations with PD.\nOur results do not support a major role for PGRN in the genetic etiology of Parkinson disease (PD). At this stage and in the absence of functional data, it remains unclear whether p.Asp33Glu and p.Arg514Met are biologically relevant to PD pathogenesis in the mutation carriers.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to characterize the relationship between cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction employing cardiac (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake and other autonomic function parameters in Parkinson's disease (PD). 79 PD patients were studied. We performed (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy to assess the extent of cardiac sympathetic denervation. Electrocardiogram readings at rest and postural change in blood pressure were also examined. Coefficient variation of RR intervals (CVR-R) was used as an index for cardiac parasympathetic activity. Cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake did not vary significantly among the Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) stages. There was a significant correlation between cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake and CVR-R (early, r=0.457, p<0.001; late, r=0.442, p<0.001). While the correlation was present among the patients who had had the disease less than two years (early, r=0.558, p<0.001; late, r=0.530, p<0.001), the patients with the disease duration longer than two years did not have such a significant correlation. Age, disease duration, corrected QT interval, or postural blood pressure change did not correlate with cardiac (123)I-MIBG uptake. Orthostatic hypotension was observed in 13 out of 72 subjects, and reduced CVR-R was a major determinant for the development of orthostatic hypotension. We conclude that cardiac parasympathetic dysfunction occurs concurrent with sympathetic denervation as revealed by (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy in PD and contributes to the development of orthostatic hypotension.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is common in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and has been attributed to early pathological deposition of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in primary olfactory centers. However, olfactory deficits do not always worsen over time despite progression of disease raising the possibility of additional pathobiological mechanisms contributing to olfactory functions in PD, such as changes in olfactory neurotransmitter functions. Neurotransmitter changes, such as altered dopaminergic status, may also better explain the selective nature of odor identification deficits in PD. Proper odor identification depends on higher order structures, such as the hippocampus, for olfactory cognitive or memory processing. Using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), we previously identified three odors (banana, licorice, dill pickle, labeled as UPSIT-3) that PD subjects most frequently failed to recognize compared to age- and gender-matched controls. We also identified six odors that were equally successfully identified by controls and PD subjects (NPD-Olf6). A ratio of UPSIT-3 divided by NPD-Olf6 scores provides another descriptor of selective hyposmia in PD (\"olfactory ratio\"). In this study we investigated the pathophysiology of hyposmia in PD using dopamine transporter (DAT) PET. Twenty-nine PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr stages I-III; 7f/22m; age 60.2+/-10.8) underwent olfactory testing using the UPSIT and [(11)C]beta-CFT DAT PET. DAT binding potentials (BP) were assessed in the hippocampus, amygdala, ventral and dorsal striatum. We found that correlation coefficients between total UPSIT scores and regional brain DAT BP were highest for the hippocampus (Rs=0.54, P=0.002) and lower for the amygdala (Rs=0.44, P=0.02), ventral (Rs=0.48, P=0.008) and dorsal striatum (Rs=0.39, P=0.03). Correlations were most significant for the selective hyposmia measures and hippocampal DAT: UPSIT-3 (Rs=0.65, P=0.0001) and the olfactory ratio (Rs=0.74, P<0.0001). We conclude that selective hyposmia in PD is more robustly correlated with hippocampal rather than amygdala, ventral or dorsal striatal dopamine innervation as shown by DAT binding. These findings indicate that mesolimbic dopamine innervation of the hippocampus may be a determinant of selective hyposmia in PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to explore the potential effect of the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor entacapone coadministration on the rate of absorption and matched latency to motor response of an oral test dose of levodopa/benserazide in the treatment of Parkinson disease (PD).\nFourteen PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr stages 2-2.5) entered the study protocol. They underwent an oral levodopa instrumental kinetic-dynamic test on 2 occasions, 4 weeks apart, according to an intrasubject open comparative design: at the first examination, while receiving their usual levodopa/benserazide therapy, and at the second one after a 4-week entacapone (200 mg) dosing concomitantly with usual first morning levodopa/benserazide intake.\nEntacapone coadministration was associated with a median 15-minute lengthening (P < 0.05) of time to peak levodopa plasma concentration compared with levodopa/benserazide alone but failed to have a statistically significant effect on matched latency to drug motor effect. Levodopa peak plasma concentration was nearly identical in the 2 treatments.\nOverall, the delayed latency to single-dose peak plasma levodopa concentration on entacapone cotreatment was modest and of negligible clinical significance in a cohort of moderately affected PD patients.",

We investigated the normalized cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (nCMRGlc) with HRRT PET in basal ganglia (BG) nuclei of 10 early-stage PD patients and in 9 healthy volunteers. PET data were co-registered to magnetic resonance images and analyzed in a three-dimensional volume-of-interest (VOI) approach. After normalization for global brain activity, PD patients showed a significantly higher nCMRGlc than controls bilaterally in the BG output nuclei (pallidum, substantia nigra) and unilateral in the caudate and putamen. The metabolic activity of the nucleus accumbens, the subthalamic nucleus, the corpus amygdaloideum and the red nucleus was normal. These first HRRT PET data in living parkinsonian humans extend previous brain imaging findings of abnormal network activity in the BG and confirm output nuclei and striatal overactivation also in early stage PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Safety and efficacy of tolcapone was studied in 237 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) in a prospective, open-label, multicenter, non-interventional trial. Main outcome measures were tolerability (adverse events=AE) and safety parameters (liver enzymes). A subgroup analysis was performed for patients at < 70 years and > or = 70 years of age. Improvement of symptoms based on investigator global assessment was reported in 84% of all patients: 14.8% greatly improved, 42.6% improved, and 27% slightly improved. Slight worsening was reported in only 2.6% of subjects. There were no significant differences concerning the treatment efficacy between the age subgroups (p=0.74). The incidence of AE was slightly higher in the subgroup of patients > or = 70 years than in the subgroup of patients < 70 years (relative risk, RR=3.03; 95% confidence interval, CI=1.04-8.96; p=0.03), but AE judged as potentially related to tolcapone were equally distributed among both groups (8.5% vs. 2.9%, RR: 2.91; CI=0.82-10.27; p=0.08). Diarrhea was the most common potentially tolcapone-related AE in both groups. Elevations of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase=AST, and alanine aminotransferase=ALT) above the upper limit of normal were observed in 19% (CI=8.3-23.4) of all patients with slightly but not statistically significant higher percentages in the young patients group compared to older patient group (RR=0.54; CI=0.28-1.04; p=0.06). This observational study provides evidence that tolcapone can be effectively and safely used for the treatment of response fluctuations in elderly patients with PD.",

This technology is an intracellular application of gene-engineered antibodies, aimed at ablating the abnormal function of intracellular molecules. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with no cure.

Here, we review the origin, production, and therapeutic mechanisms of intrabodies and the potential of intrabody protection against alpha-syn toxicity. Furthermore, we propose possible intrabody applications against leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), whose mutations are the most frequent known cause of familial and sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "In 1994 we commenced deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus for patients with severe tremor. This was done under the guidance of Professor Alim Benabid from Grenoble, France, who pioneered the technique. In the beginning we commenced DBS of the thalamus for patients with severe tremulous Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and in one case, severe post-traumatic tremor. In all, we had 28 patients for whom the procedure was performed for tremulous Parkinson's disease, six patients with essential tremor and one patient with post-traumatic tremor. In 1997, again under the guidance of Professor Benabid, we commenced bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation (STN) for patients with severe Parkinson's disease. We were the second unit in Australia to become established for these procedures. A total of 45 patients have undergone STN DBS and have been followed up on a regular basis by the same neurologist (DOS). The surgical complications and long-term complications, including hardware problems will be reviewed retrospectively, as well as the long-term benefits of these surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "We studied the involvement of the electrophysiological localization of the subthalamic nucleus (NST) using a multi-unit recording technique by means of semi-microelectrode in a set of thirty Parkinson's patients who benefited from a bilateral stimulation of the NST and who were operated on under local or general anesthesia. The multi-unit recording technique by means of semi-microelectrodes appeared efficient, capable of improving the localization of the NST and leading to improvement in clinical results. We believe that the use of our technique will allow for time savings while providing good results, and that the choice of the angle of the trajectory will allow for improved localization of the NST and thus improved clinical results.",

    "abstract": "Rasagiline (Azilect) is a potent, highly selective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B of the second generation. Rasagiline is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) as monotherapy (without levodopa) or as adjunct therapy (with levodopa) in patients with end of dose fluctuations. The efficacy and tolerability of rasagiline has been demonstrated in large-scale, controlled clinical studies in patients with early PD as well as with more advanced PD. This multicentred post-marketing observational study included an investigation of the efficacy and tolerability of rasagiline in a large patient population under conditions of the daily routine in neurologic practice with a special attention on the collection of data regarding a patients' subjective evaluation of quality of life. A total of 754 patients with Parkinson's disease were enrolled, 545 of the patients (63% male patients, mean age 68 years, mean duration of PD 6 years, Hoehn & Yahr stage II to III in 69% of the patients) started rasagiline 1 mg/day as adjunct therapy for up to 4 months. The PD symptoms were rated by the physicians using the Columbia University Rating Scale (CURS) and the clinical fluctuations subscale of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, part IV B). Different aspects of quality of life were rated by the patients using the self-rating Parkinson's Disease Questionaire (PDQ-39). In addition, patients documented the number of hours spend in the OFF-state in \"24-hour\" home diaries prior to each of the assessment visits. During the treatment period rasagiline was most frequently co-administered with levodopa/DCI (81.7%) and/or dopamine agonists (65.8%). The mean treatment duration was 117.4 (+/-36.4) days, during which PD medication remained unchanged in 86.6% of the cases. The improvement rates in each of the CURS items ranged between 31.1% to 48.4% and the total score was reduced by 22% under the therapy of rasagiline. In the motor part (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) the total score was reduced from 6.2 to 4.8, within the other items from 14.7 to 11.5. The proportion of patients without OFF-periods increased from 33.3% to 49.5%. Determined from \"24-hours\" home diaries, time spend in the OFF-state during wake time decreased from 120 minutes to 45 minutes. In all 8 aspects of quality of life rated by the patients an reduction of the disability could be documented. The PDQ-39 total score was reduced from 36.4 by 7.3 points (20.1%). In total, 29 of the 545 patients who received rasagiline as combination therapy had switched directly from previous combination therapy with selegiline. In this subgroup CURS total score improved from 17.0 to 12.9 points during treatment. The proportion of patients without OFF-periods increased from 36% to 48% and the daily time spent in the OFF-state was reduced from 45 minutes to 30 minutes. The PDQ-39 total score improved by 6.5 points (22.2%). All in all, adverse events were reported by 8.4% of the patients. In conclusion this post-marketing observational study has shown that in patients with pre-existing combination therapy the add-on medication of rasagiline resulted in improvements of motor and non-motor functions. Furthermore, motor complications were significantly reduced and led to an improved quality of life in the self-estimation of the patients. This also applies to those patients with selegiline pre-treatment.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of istradefylline 20 mg once daily versus placebo as an adjunct to levodopa in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) who have motor fluctuations. Istradefylline (KW-6002) is an adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist that in primate models of PD improves motor function without causing or worsening dyskinesia. This 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, Phase 3 study of istradefylline was conducted in subjects experiencing an average daily OFF time of at least 3 hours (116 randomized to istradefylline; 115 to placebo). All were on stable levodopa regimens; 90% were also on stable regimens of other anti-Parkinson's medications. Istradefylline-treated subjects had significant placebo-corrected reductions in daily OFF time from baseline to endpoint: 4.6% (P = 0.03) and 0.7 hours (P = 0.03). For ON time with troublesome dyskinesia, the changes between istradefylline and placebo were not significant. Istradefylline was well tolerated, with 6 (5.2%) istradefylline-treated and 7 (6.1%) placebo-treated subjects withdrawing from the study because of adverse events. Dyskinesia, lightheadedness, tremor, constipation, and weight decrease were reported more often with istradefylline than placebo. We conclude that istradefylline is well tolerated and significantly reduces OFF time as an adjunct to levodopa in PD subjects with motor fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Evaluate the influence of depressive symptoms on the recognition of emotional prosody in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and identify types of emotion on spoken sentences.\nThirty-five PD patients and 65 normal participants were studied. Dementia was checked with the Mini Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating scale, and DSM IV. Recognition of emotional prosody was tested by asking subjects to listen to 12 recorded statements with neutral affective content that were read with a strong affective expression. Subjects had to recognize the correct emotion by one of four descriptors (angry, sad, cheerful, and neutral). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was employed to rate depressive symptoms with the cutoff 14.\nTotal ratings of emotions correctly recognized by participants below and above the BDI cutoff were similar among PD patients and normal individuals. PD patients who correctly identified neutral and anger inflections presented higher rates of depressive symptoms (p = 0.011 and 0.044, respectively). No significant differences were observed in the normal group.\nDepression may modify some modalities of emotional prosody perception in PD, by increasing the perception of non-pleasant emotions or lack of affection, such as anger or indifference.",

    "abstract": "Dementia with Parkinson's disease represents a controversial issue in the complex group of alpha-synucleinopathies. The author acknowledges the concept of a \"continuum\" between Parkinson disease's (PD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and dementia in Parkinson's disease (PDD). However, the practicing neurologist needs to identify the phenotypic signs of each dementia. The treatment and prognosis are different in spite of the overlaps between them. The main aim of this review was to characterize the clinical diagnoses of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease (PDD). Secondarily, the review discussed some epidemiological and neuropsychological issues. Selection of articles was not systematic and reflects the author's opinion, where the main text selected was the recommendations from the Movement Disorder Society Task Force for PDD diagnosis. The Pub Med, OVID, and Proquest data bases were used for the search.\nDem\u00eancia com doen\u00e7a de Parkinson constitui um assunto controverso no complexo grupo das alfa-sinucleinopatias.

    "abstract": "(123)I-FP-CIT SPECT binding to striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) is markedly reduced in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and it may also help in identifyng pre-symptomatic nigrostriatal dysfunction in subjects at risk. This study used semi-quantitative analysis of 123I-FP-CIT SPECT to evaluate the possibility of a more extensive and earlier diagnosis of dopaminergic damage. We used qualitative visual assessment and semiquantitative measures of striatal DAT binding using (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT in 154 patients with suspected PD. A control group comprised 18 people age-matched to the PD group whose follow-up disclosed essential tremor. Abnormal striatal 123I-FP-CIT uptake was evident in 134 out of 154 patients (87%). Qualitative visual assessment showed striatal dopaminergic (123)I-FP-CIT uptake was significantly reduced in 60.4% (controlateral putamen to the symptoms), in 31.3% (caudate nucleus) and in 8.3% (ipsolateral basal ganglia to the symptoms). Semi-quantitative analysis showed the following results: 32.8%, 50.7% and 16.5% respectively. We compared these two assessments and their correlation with PD clinical progression. At 24 month follow-up, patients with greater dopaminergic damage at semiquantitative analysis showed a more severe motor disability. Our findings indicate that (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT with semiquantitative analysis can offer a more accurate characterization of the dopaminergic damage in patients with suspected Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Objectives.\u2002 The aims of this study were to clarify the direction and degree of brain shift, and to determine the predictive factors for a brain shift during deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Materials and Methods.\u2002 To evaluate the brain shift during bilateral STN-DBS, the position of the anterior commissure (AC), posterior commissure (PC), midcommissure point (MC), and tip of the frontal lobe and anterior horn of the lateral ventricle were calculated pre- and poststereotactic operations in the three-dimensional direction employing special software (Leksell SurgiPlan). To determine the predictive factors for a brain shift, patient's age, operation hours, width of the third ventricle, bicaudate index (BCI), and cella media index (CMI) were compared with the shift of MC. Results.\u2002 In 50 patients, the MC shifted mainly in the posterior direction (y-axis: 1.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0mm), and the shifts in the inferior direction (z-axis: 0.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43\u00a0mm) and lateral direction (x-axis: 0.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39\u00a0mm) were small. The shift of the MC in the posterior direction correlated well with the shift of the tip of the anterior lobe and anterior horn. Among the predictive factors examined, namely, the patient's age, operation hours, width of the third ventricle, BCI, and CMI, only the CMI showed a correlation with the shift of the MC (r\u00a0=\u00a00.42, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, Pearson's correlation coefficient; and p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, logistic regression analysis). Conclusions.\u2002 In bilateral STN-DBS, brain shift occurred mainly in the posterior direction, and the CMI is useful for the prediction of a brain shift. Enlargement of the body part of the lateral ventricle is the most reliable factor for predicting a brain shift.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common age-related movement disorder, with a prevalence of approximately 2% among people over 65 years of age. The diagnosis of PD is currently based on the clinical manifestations of the disease; therefore, the availability of peripheral biomarkers would have a great impact. In this review, we discuss and compare several attempts made to find peripheral biomarkers of PD to achieve early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, therapy assessment and classification of disease subtypes. Several investigators focused on proteins that are involved in PD pathogenesis. However, the best choice for a sensible biomarker-discovery procedure makes use of global approaches such as metabolomics and proteomics. In addition, the tissue or compartment where biomarkers are located, plays a basic role. In this context, lymphocytes are of particular interest because they are circulating dopaminergic cells, and display several functional modifications in PD.",

    "abstract": "Motor and non-motor fluctuations are well known sequelae of dopaminergic therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly during the advanced stages. However, the prevalence of fluctuations early in the treatment course has been less well recognised and may be missed clinically if not specifically probed. We examined the used of a survey for this purpose. Patients to be surveyed were recruited by neurologists and geriatricians at 20 Australian centres. Patients had a diagnosis of idiopathic PD with a duration of fewer than 5 years and were considered by their treating physician to be non-fluctuating or had no change in their treatment plan in the prior 6 months. Patients, with or without assistance, completed a 19-item wearing-off questionnaire to assess the presence of motor and non-motor fluctuations that indicated early wearing-off. Investigators assessed the usefulness of the questionnaire in detecting fluctuations and guiding PD treatment. Of 105 patients recruited, 92 were eligible for analysis. There were 56 (61%) identified as having fluctuations. Patients with wearing-off were younger (mean 67 vs 72 years), and more likely to have had PD for more than 3 years. About half the patients (49%) were able to complete the questionnaire independently. Clinicians perceived the questionnaire as useful for detecting fluctuations and adjusting treatment. A simple and easily administered wearing-off questionnaire may be useful in the early detection of fluctuations in PD patients and assist in guiding therapy.",

    "abstract": "In rat models of Parkinson's disease, injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into different areas of the basal ganglia result in dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra. The extent and time course of the dopaminergic lesions varies between the models. While the effects on neurons have been extensively studied, little is known about the effects on astrocytes. We compared astrocytic activation (i.e. increase in number and staining intensity of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactive cells) at the injection site and in downstream structures of the motor loop, i.e. the globus pallidus (GP) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) following 6-OHDA lesion of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) or the striatum. Lesions in both regions resulted in astrocytic activation at the lesion site, but their remote effects varied. MFB injections caused astrocytic activation in the ipsi- and contralateral striatum, whereas striatal injections resulted in astrocytic activation in the GP and STN. Since 6-OHDA injections into the MFB and the striatum result in complete and partial SNc lesions, respectively, we hypothesize that communication links exist between astrocytes, or between neurons and astrocytes, along neuronal pathways that transmit activating signals in response to neuronal damage-but only if the neuronal pathways are at least partially intact.",

    "abstract": "We determined plasma amantadine concentrations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in daily clinical practice and investigated the relationship between plasma concentration and adverse reactions to clarify the safe therapeutic range. Seventy-eight consecutive PD patients on stable amantadine treatment were recruited. Plasma concentration of amantadine was measured 3h after the administration of morning amantadine dose. Serum creatinine was measured to estimate renal function. The mean daily dose of amantadine was 135.1+/-62.3mg/day, and the mean plasma amantadine concentration was 812.5+/-839.5 ng/ml (range, 91-4400 ng/ml). Plasma amantadine concentration increased according to increasing renal dysfunction. Three patients exhibited adverse reactions, such as myoclonus, hallucinations, and delirium, and all of them showed plasma amantadine concentration >3000 ng/ml. None of the three cases had previously shown such side effects. PD patients who have not developed any psychiatric symptoms as adverse reactions to the treatment may develop myoclonus, hallucination, or delirium when the plasma concentration of amantadine exceeds 3000 ng/ml. It is therefore recommended to use amantadine at the plasma concentration of less than 3000 ng/ml in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, especially in elderly patients.",

The conversion of alpha-synuclein from soluble monomer to insoluble aggregates through the toxic oligomeric intermediates underlie the neurodegeneration associated with PD. Redox active metal ions such as iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) are known to enhance alpha-synuclein fibrillogenesis. In the present study, we have implemented mathematical approach to monitor the kinetics of aggregation of alpha-synuclein nucleation and elongation constants based on fluorescence studies. In this pretext, we have implemented mathematical simulations like self and absolute analysis. The mathematical model discussed in this paper is the first of its kind and might prove useful for predicting the drug intervention time to prevent alpha-synuclein aggregation and has future clinical application.",

Cost effectiveness will be evaluated using a three-way comparison of the cost per fall averted and the cost per quality adjusted life year saved across two physical therapy interventions and a control group.\nThis study has the potential to determine whether targetted physical therapy as an adjunct to standard care can be cost effective in reducing falls in people with PD.\nNo: ACTRN12606000344594.",

    "abstract": "Motion processing involves multiple hierarchical steps, from the magnocellular pathway, sensitive to high temporal frequency modulations, to subsequent motion integration within the visual cortical dorsal stream. We have tested whether motion integration deficits in mild Parkinson disease (PD) can be explained by visual deficits in earlier processing nodes. Contrast sensitivity deficits in the magnocellular pathway, were compared with speed discrimination of local dots moving in random directions, speed and direction discrimination of moving surfaces and motion integration as measured by 2D coherence thresholds (n=27). We have found that low-level magnocellular impairment in PD does not explain deficits in subsequent steps in motion processing. High-level performance was abnormal in particular for tasks requiring perception of coherently moving surfaces. Motion coherence deficits were predictive of visuomotor impairment, corroborating a previous magnetic stimulation study in normal subjects. We conclude that dorsal stream deficits in PD have a high-level visual cortical basis independent of low-level magnocellular damage.",

No comparative trials of these two alternatives were performed.\nWe present a subanalysis from a randomized crossover clinical trial where levodopa infusion as monotherapy was compared with any other combination of pharmacotherapy in fluctuating patients. Four patients used apomorphine infusion and oral levodopa in the comparator arm. The results of these four patients are presented in detail.\nThe duration of the trial was 3 + 3 weeks. Patients were video-recorded half-hourly on two non-consecutive days of both treatment arms. Blinded video ratings were used. Patient self-assessments of motor function and quality-of-life (QoL) parameters were captured using an electronic diary.\nRatings in moderate to severe \"off\" state ranged 0-44% on apomorphine infusion and 0-6% on levodopa infusion. Moderate to severe dyskinesias were not recorded in any of the treatments. QoL was reported to be improved in all patients on duodenal levodopa infusion.\nMonotherapy with duodenal infusion of levodopa was more efficacious and brought greater QoL than combination therapy with apomorphine infusion in these fluctuating patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has long been considered predominantly a motor disorder. However, its frequent association with dementia, which contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality of the condition, is gaining increasing recognition. PD dementia (PDD) has a unique clinical profile and neuropathology, distinct from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cholinergic deficits, a feature of both AD and PDD, underlie the rationale for cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in both conditions. In clinical practice, it is important that PDD should be recognised and appropriately treated. This review aims to outline the recently proposed clinical diagnostic criteria for PDD and to summarise the guidelines/recommendations published since 2006 on the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in the management of PDD. Although the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine has recently been approved for the management of PDD, there remains a need for the development of novel therapies that can affect key mechanisms of the disease or prevent/delay patients with PD and mild cognitive impairment from progressing to PDD.",

    "abstract": "Conflicting research suggests that deep brain stimulation surgery, an effective treatment for medication-refractory Parkinson's disease (PD), may lead to selective cognitive declines. We compared cognitive performance of 22 PD patients who underwent unilateral DBS to the GPi or STN to that of 19 PD controls at baseline and 12 months. We hypothesized that compared to PD controls, DBS patients would decline on tasks involving dorsolateral prefrontal cortex circuitry (letter fluency, semantic fluency, and Digit Span Backward) but not on other tasks (Vocabulary, Boston Naming Test), and that a greater proportion of DBS patients would fall below Reliable Change Indexes (RCIs). Compared to controls, DBS patients declined only on the fluency tasks. Analyses classified 50% of DBS patients as decliners, compared to 11% of controls. Decliners experienced less motor improvement than non-decliners. The present study adds to the literature through its hypothesis-driven method of task selection, inclusion of a disease control group, longer-term follow-up and use of Reliable Change. Our findings provide evidence that unilateral DBS surgery is associated with verbal fluency declines and indicate that while these changes may not be systematically related to age, cognitive or depression status at baseline, semantic fluency declines may be more common after left-sided surgery. Finally, use of Reliable Change highlights the impact of individual variability and indicates that fluency declines likely reflect significant changes in a subset of patients who demonstrate a poorer surgical outcome overall.",

    "abstract": "We studied regional gray matter density in the hippocampus in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We obtained magnetic resonance scans in 44 PD patients (PD patients with dementia (PDD) = 9, non-demented PD patients with visual hallucinations (PD + VH) = 16, and PD patients without dementia and without visual hallucinations (PD - VH) = 19) and 56 controls matched for age and years of education. A region of interest (ROI) of the hippocampus following voxel-based morphometry (VBM) procedures was used to perform group comparisons, single-case individual analysis and correlations with learning scores. Group comparisons showed that PDD patients and PD+VH patients had significant hippocampal gray matter loss compared to controls. In PDD patients, hippocampal gray matter loss involved the entire hippocampus and in PD+VH this reduction was mainly confined to the hippocampal head. 78 % of PDD patients, 31 % of PD+VH patients and 26 % of PD-VH patients had hippocampal head gray matter loss when compared to controls. These results suggest that in PD the neurodegenerative process in the hippocampus starts in the head of this structure and later spreads to the tail and that, in addition, memory impairment assessed by Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) correlates with hippocampal head gray matter loss.",

Multiple linear regression analysis and structural equation modelling were used to construct a model of factors that influence HRQoL.\nA model with good fit was constructed that identified various impairments and disabilities as important contributors to HRQoL in PD. Of the disabilities, psychosocial well-being had a larger impact on HRQoL than physical functioning. Of the impairments, depression had the largest contribution to HRQoL, followed by axial motor symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and urinary symptoms. In addition, pain, psychiatric and motor complications, and daytime sleepiness had small but significant influences on HRQoL.\nMultiple factors, including disabilities, nonmotor symptoms and axial motor symptoms, affect HRQoL in patients with PD. In patients who are on symptomatic treatment aiming to alleviate mainly motor symptoms, there is a large impact on HRQoL of nonmotor and nondopaminergic symptoms. Research is warranted to develop and evaluate management strategies for the aspects that currently impact on HRQoL as psychosocial well-being, depressive symptoms, axial motor symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and urinary symptoms.

    "abstract": "Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are two neurodegenerative disorders within the category of tauopathies, which must be considered in differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Although specific clinical and neuroradiological features help to guide the clinician to a likely diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, CBD or PSP, differential diagnosis remains difficult. The aim of our study was to analyse apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(ave)) maps from patients with clinical diagnosis of CBD (corticobasal syndrome, CBS), classical phenotype of PSP (Richardson's syndrome, RS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) in order to identify objective markers to discriminate between these groups. Thirteen Parkinson's disease patients, 10 RS patients, 7 CBS patients and 9 healthy volunteers were recruited and studied in a 1.5 T MR scanner. Axial diffusion-weighted images were obtained and the ADC(ave) map was generated. Regions of interest (ROIs) included mesencephalon, corpus callosum and left and right superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidus, posterior limb of internal capsule, frontal and parietal white matter. Histograms of ADC(ave) were generated for all voxels in left and right cerebral hemispheres and in left and right deep grey matter regions separately, and the 50th percentile values (medians) were determined. The ratio of the smaller to the larger median value (symmetry ratio) was calculated for left and right hemispheres and for left and right deep grey matter regions (1 = perfect symmetry). Putaminal ADC(ave) values in CBS and RS were significantly greater than those in Parkinson's disease and healthy volunteers, but could not distinguish CBS from RS patients. In CBS patients, the values of the medians of cerebral hemispheres histograms were significantly higher than those in RS, Parkinson's disease and healthy volunteers, while the hemispheric symmetry ratio in CBS (0.968, range 0.952-0.976) was markedly reduced compared with RS (0.993, range 0.992-0.994), Parkinson's disease (0.991, range 0.988-0.993) and healthy controls (0.990, range 0.988-0.993). The hemispheric symmetry ratio differentiated CBS patients from RS and Parkinson's disease patients with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. In RS patients, the ADC(ave) values of the SCPs were significantly greater than those in Parkinson's disease and healthy volunteers. Our findings confirm that putaminal ADC(ave) values evaluation provides a good discrimination between Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms, including RS and CBS. Furthermore, diffusion-weighted imaging, by detecting the brain microstructural correlates of the typical asymmetric signs and symptoms in CBS and the SCP involvement in RS, was shown to aid characterization and differentiation of atypical parkinsonism.",

Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), COX-2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and phosphorylated P38 (p-P38) were used to observe the changes of positive cell number in the midbrain after treatment with ginsenoside Rg1.\nCompared with the control mice, the mice with PD presented with typical symptoms of PD. The number of p-P38-, COX-2-, and PGE2-positive cells significantly increased in the SN area 6 h after the 3rd injection of 30 mg/kg MPTP (P<0.01). The number of TH-positive neurons in the PD model group was substantially reduced by about 60% (P<0.01) in 24 h after the 5th injection of MPTP. In mice with ginsenoside Rg1 treatment, the number of p-P38-, COX-2-, and PGE2-positive cells was reduced obviously 6 h after the 3rd injection of MPTP as compared with that in the model group (P<0.01). The number of TH-positive neurons in the SN was decreased by only 30% (P<0.01 vs control group) 24h after the 5th injection of MPTP.\nP38 signaling pathway may play an important role in modulating COX-2 expression in the SN in the early stage of MPTP-induced subacute PD, and ginsenoside Rg1 may act on the P38 signaling pathway to protect the DA neurons in PD.",

    "abstract": "In addition to classic motor symptoms, Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by cognitive and emotional deficits, which have been demonstrated to precede motor impairments. The present study addresses the question of whether a partial degeneration of dopaminergic neurons using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in rats is able to induce premotor behavioral signs. The time-course of nigrostriatal damage was evaluated by tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry and the levels of dopamine, noradrenaline, and 5-HT in various brain regions were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Behavioral tests that assessed a variety of psychological functions, including locomotor activity, emotional reactivity and depression, anxiety and memory were conducted on 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Bilateral infusion of 6-OHDA in the striatum of rats caused early (1 week) damage of dopaminergic terminals in striatum and in cell bodies in substantia nigra pars compacta. The nigrostriatal lesion was accompanied by early loss of dopamine in the striatum, which remained stable through a 3-week period of observation. In addition, a late (3 weeks) loss of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus, was seen. Additional noradrenergic and serotonergic alterations were observed after 6-OHDA administration. The results indicated that 6-OHDA lesioned rats show decreased sucrose consumption and an increased immobility time in the forced swimming test, an anhedonic-depressive-like effect. In addition, an anxiogenic-like activity in the elevated plus maze test and cognitive impairments were observed on the cued version of the Morris water maze and social recognition tests. These findings suggest that partial striatal dopaminergic degeneration and parallel dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic alterations in striatum and prefrontal cortex may have caused the emotional and cognitive deficits observed in this rat model of early phase PD.",

Consequently, a reduction of functional proteasome activity has been implicated in Parkinson's disease. VP025 (Vasogen Inc.) is a preparation of phospholipid nanoparticles incorporating phosphatidylglycerol that has been shown to have neuroprotective effects. We show that VP025 prevents the deficits in motor coordination and dopamine observed in a proteasome inhibitor rat model of PD. Thus, VP025 may have a therapeutic effect on the impairment of dopaminergic-mediated motor activity induced by proteasome inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The early diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) may be challenging, because of clinical overlapping features with Parkinson's disease (PD) and other parkinsonian syndromes such as the Parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P). Conventional MRI can help in differentiating parkinsonian disorders but its diagnostic accuracy is still unsatisfactory. On the basis of the pathological demonstration of superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) atrophy in patients with PSP, we assessed the SCP apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in patients with PSP, PD, and MSA-P in order to evaluate its differential diagnostic value in vivo. Twenty-eight patients with PSP (14 with possible-PSP and 14 with probable-PSP), 15 PD, 15 MSA-P, and 16 healthy subjects were studied by using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). ADC was calculated in regions of interest defined in the left and right SCP by two clinically blinded operators. Intrarater (r = 0.98, P < 0.001) and interrater reliability (r = 0.97; P < 0.001) for SCP measurements were high. Patients with PSP had higher SCP rADC values (median 0.98 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s) than patients with PD (median 0.79 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, P < 0.001), MSA-P (median 0.79 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, P < 0.001), and healthy controls (median 0.80 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, P < 0.001). DWI discriminated patients with PSP from PD and healthy subjects on the basis of SCP rADC individual values (100% sensitivity and specificity) and from patients with MSA-P (96.4% sensitivity and 93.3% specificity). The higher values of rADC in SCP of patients with PSP correspond with the in vivo microstructural feature of atrophy detected postmortem and provide an additional support for early discrimination between PSP and other neurodegenerative parkinsonisms.",

    "abstract": "The impact of dual tasks on gait in Parkinson's disease (PD) reveals lack of automaticity and increased cognitive demands. We explored which characteristics explained walking speed with and without dual task interference and if they reflected the cognitive demands of the task. In 130 people with PD, gait performance was quantified in the home using accelerometers allowing estimates of single and dual task walking speed and interference (difference between dual and single task). Multiple regression analysis was used to explore the effect of 12 characteristics representing four domains (personal, motor symptoms, cognitive, affective) on gait outcomes. Thirty-seven percent of variance in single task speed was explained by increased fear of falling, sex, age, disease severity, and depression; 34% of variance in dual task speed was explained by increased fear of falling, disease severity, medication, and depression; 12% of variance in interference scores was explained by greater disease severity and impaired executive function. Personal, motor, affective, and cognitive characteristics contribute to walking speed and interference, highlighting the multifactorial nature of gait. Different patterns of characteristics for each outcome indicates the impact of cognitive demand and task complexity, providing cautious support for dual task speed and interference as valid proxy measures of cognitive demand in PD gait.",

    "abstract": "Nordic walking may improve mobility in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we examined whether the beneficial effects persist after the training period. We included 19 PD patients [14 men; mean age 67.0 years (range 58-76); Hoehn and Yahr stage range 1-3] who received a 6-week Nordic walking exercise program. Outcome was assessed prior to training (T1), immediately after the training period (T2) and-in a subgroup of 9 patients--5 months after training (T3). At T2, we observed a significant improvement in timed 10-m walking, the timed get-up-and-go-test (TUG), the 6-min walking test and quality of life (PDQ-39). All treatment effects persisted at T3. Compliance was excellent, and there were no adverse effects. These preliminary findings suggest that Nordic walking could provide a safe, effective, and enjoyable way to reduce physical inactivity in PD and to improve the quality of life. A large randomized clinical trial now appears justified.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to analyze the doppler sonography findings of vertebrobasilar circulation (VB) in patients with Parkinson's disease. 40 patients were analyzed (25 men's and 15 women) with Parkinson's disease, average age was 61.9 years (SD=11.43), treated at the Clinic for Neurology in Tuzla. Device for doppler sonography was Multidop x 4. Doppler sonography findings of VB circulation were analyzed in order to computerized tomography (CT) findings of the brain (with or without ischemic lacunar lesions) and in order to presence of postural disturbances as one of dominant Parkinson's disease symptoms during actual hospitalization. Our results suggest that vertebrobasilar insufficiency is more frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease (no matter of type) and postural disturbances as a dominant symptom comparing to group of Parkinson's disease patients without postural disturbances. These results implicate the importance of doppler sonography findings of vertebrobasilar circulation in patients with Parkinson's disease and possibility of considering role of vertebrobasilar insufficiency in development of postural disturbances.",

    "abstract": "Pisa syndrome (PS) is a dystonic lateroflexion of the trunk with a postural disturbance resembling the leaning tower of Pisa. Initially reported as a side effect related to antipsychotic therapy, this original dystonic posture is also manifested in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple system atrophy, or in rare idiopathic cases. Recent observations have described the onset of PS with subchronic course in patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we report on the acute development of PS in a parkinsonian patient during treatment with entacapone/levodopa/carbidopa combination. This case illustrates how, in contrast to previously well-known chronic/subchronic forms, this axial dystonic posture may occur in PD as an acute onset reversible type, related to levodopa treatment.",

    "abstract": "Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is a bypass re-entrant tachycardia that results from an abnormal connection between the atria and ventricles. Mutations in PRKAG2 have been described in patients with familial WPW syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Based on the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling in the development of annulus fibrosus in mice, it has been proposed that BMP signalling through the type 1a receptor and other downstream components may play a role in pre-excitation.\nUsing the array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH), we identified five individuals with non-recurrent deletions of 20p12.3. Four of these individuals had WPW syndrome with variable dysmorphisms and neurocognitive delay. With the exception of one maternally inherited deletion, all occurred de novo, and the smallest of these harboured a single gene, BMP2. In two individuals with additional features of Alagille syndrome, deletion of both JAG1 and BMP2 were identified. Deletion of this region has not been described as a copy number variant in the Database of Genomic Variants and has not been identified in 13 321 individuals from other cohort examined by array CGH in our laboratory.\nOur findings demonstrate a novel genomic disorder characterised by deletion of BMP2 with variable cognitive deficits and dysmorphic features and show that individuals bearing microdeletions in 20p12.3 often present with WPW syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) is common in patients (pts) with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome but atrial flutter/fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) is rare. Although AF occurs in 18% of adult WPW pts, its incidence in children is unknown. We sought to determine risk factors for AVRT spontaneously degenerating to AF during electrophysiologic studies (EPS) in children with WPW.\nThis was a retrospective study of children with WPW referred for accessory pathway (AP) ablation without clinical AF. Standard electrophysiologic protocols were performed to induce AVRT. To determine if AF degeneration was associated with patient characteristics, 2-sample t-tests, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact were used.\nThere were 53 (31 males) WPW pts studied. During EPS, AVRT degenerated to AF in 27/53 (51%). RVR was seen in 18/27 (67%) patients. The ventricular cycle length (CL) during AF was shorter with RVR (211 + 24 ms) than without (313 + 65 ms) (P = 0.01). AF occurred more commonly among patients with right anterior AP (P = 0.05). Patient gender, age, height, weight, body surface area, persistence of preexcitation on exercise testing, baseline CL, AVRT conduction, and AP number were not significant AF determinants. The AVRT CL was significantly shorter in patients with (265.2 + 41.5 ms) versus those without (308 + 59 ms) AF (P = 0.01). Preliminary data suggest that AP location may be related to patient ethnicity.\nAF with RVR occurred following AVRT induction during EPS in 34% of our WPW patients, typically associated with right-sided AP locations. Time intervals for RVR to degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and lead to SCD are yet to be determined.",

Patient gender, age, height, weight, body surface area, persistence of preexcitation on exercise testing, baseline CL, AVRT conduction, and AP number were not significant AF determinants. The AVRT CL was significantly shorter in patients with (265.2 + 41.5 ms) versus those without (308 + 59 ms) AF (P = 0.01). Preliminary data suggest that AP location may be related to patient ethnicity.",

    "abstract": "To assess whether Parkinson Disease (PD) patients are impaired at perceiving emotions from facial and prosodic cues and whether any putative defective performance concerns recognition of a particular emotion.\nBraak et al. [1] demonstrated that in different stages PD pathology involves the nigrostriatal system, the amygdala, and the insular cortex. Discrete brain lesions to these structures can cause selective deficits in recognising facial and prosodic stimuli expressing particular emotions. However, the investigation of facial and prosodic emotional processing in PD patients has lead to conflicting results.\nWe compared 27 cognitively unimpaired PD patients with control subjects by means of the Facial Emotion Recognition Battery and the Emotional Prosody Recognition Battery.\nPD patients were impaired in recognising, selecting, and matching facial affects. In particular, the Facial Emotion Recognition Battery demonstrated a severe impairment in recognising sad and fearful faces. In the Emotional Prosody Recognition Battery PD patients demonstrated a diffuse impairment, including the recognition of emotional and propositional prosody.\nFace emotion processing is impaired in PD patients, with a disproportionate deficit involving fear and sadness. The pattern of face expression processing impairment in PD patients might depend on the regional distribution of the pathology. The widespread involvement of both emotional and propositional prosodic processing parallels the aprosodic characteristics of Parkinsonian speech production.",

    "abstract": "mtDNA common variation is inconsistently reported to modify the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). We evaluated the impact of the mitochondrial haplogroups, subhaplogroups, coding and non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms on PD risk in 241 PD patients and 277 control subjects. After stratification by gender, we found that haplogroup J (OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.069-0.53; P = 0.0014) was associated with a lower PD risk in males. Unexpectedly, subhaplogroup analysis based on the control region (CR) polymorphisms demonstrated that subcluster K1a was more prevalent in healthy controls, while K1c was more frequent in PD patients (P = 0.025 and P = 0.011, respectively; two-tailed Fisher's exact test). Additionally, we confirmed the hypothesis that sublineages (U4 + U5a1 + K+J1c + J2), previously proposed to partially uncouple oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), decrease PD risk (P = 0.027, chi2 with Yates' correction). The putative protective effect of uncoupling mtDNAs against PD might result from decreased production of reactive oxygen species. We propose that stratification into subhaplogroups or by gender could be necessary to reveal the involvement of specific mtDNA sublineages in PD pathogenesis.",
