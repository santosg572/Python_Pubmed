    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder, but current therapies are only symptomatic. A promising alternative to address the neurodegenerative process is the use of neurotrophic factors, such as the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). However, its clinical use has been limited due to its short half-life and rapid degradation after in vivo administration, in addition to difficulties in crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This barrier is a limiting factor in brain drug development, making the future progression of neurotherapeutics difficult. In the past few years, intranasal drug delivery has appeared as an alternative non-invasive administration route to bypass the BBB and target drugs directly to the CNS. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the in vivo neuroprotective effect of intranasally administered GDNF, encapsulated in chitosan-coated nanostructured lipid carrier (CS-NLC-GDNF), in a 6-OHDA partially lesioned rat model. The developed CS-NLC-GDNF showed a particle size of approximately 130 nm and high encapsulation efficiency. The in vitro study in PC-12 cells demonstrated the ability of the encapsulated GDNF to protect these cells against 6-OHDA toxin. After two weeks of daily intranasal administration of treatments, the administration of CS-NLC-GDNF achieved a behavioral improvement in rats, as well as a significant improvement in both the density of TH+ fibres in the striatum and the TH+ neuronal density in the SN. Thus, it can be concluded that the nose-to-brain delivery of CS-NLC-GDNF could be a promising therapy for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "A 70-year-old woman with Parkinson disease was admitted to the emergency department with altered consciousness, fever and convulsive movements without experiencing withdrawal from antiparkinsonian medication. Six hours after the emergency department visit, the patient had a hyperpyrexia (> 40\u00b0C) and a systolic blood pressure of 40 mmHg. There was no evidence of bacterial infection based on extensive workups. The patient was discharged without aggravation of Parkinson disease symptoms after treatment that included administration of dantrolene sodium, enforcement of continuous renal replacement therapy and cooling blankets. Malignant syndrome should be suspected if high fever occurs in Parkinson disease patients without evidence of a definitive infection.",

    "abstract": "To examine the nature of the association between affective disorders and psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nIn PD, psychosis and affective disorders are common and independently impact quality of life and mortality. Both depression and psychosis are correlated with the occurrence of cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that they may share neurobiological substrates. Anxiety has not been examined as a correlate of psychosis.\n144 PD subjects were evaluated with the Schedule for Assessment of Positive Symptoms to assess psychotic features, while depression and anxiety were examined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID) and self-assessment scales Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Correlational analyses assessed associations between hallucinations and delusions with depression and anxiety.\nA diagnosis of anxiety (SCID) was significantly (p=.015) associated with hallucinations (OR=4.81, CI=1.36-16.99). Severity of anxiety (BAI) significantly predicted (p=.03) the presence of hallucinations (OR=1.08, CI=1.01-1.15) and delusions (OR=1.09, CR=1.01-1.17). Current depression (SCID) was significantly (p=.001) associated with the presence of hallucinations (OR=6.12, CI=2.04-18.39) and delusions (OR=7.14, CI=2.23-22.93). Multiple linear regressions revealed that severity of anxiety remained an independent predictor (p<.05) of both the number of types of hallucinations (t=3.06, p=.003) and delusions (t=2.87, p=.005). Severity of depression was a significant predictor of the total number of delusions (t=2.28, p=.024).\nThis study demonstrates an association between depression and psychosis and, for the first time, an association between anxiety and psychosis. These associations may have implications on pathophysiology and treatment of psychosis in PD.",

    "abstract": "In order to investigate the effect of Shouwu Shudi Yin on dopaminegic neurons in MPTP induced Parkinson's disease mouse model and the possible mechamism, the experimental mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, Shouwu Shudi Yin, MPTP and the treatment (MPTP+Shouwu Shudi Yin) groups. The number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells in the substantia nigra was measured by immunohistochemistry, and mRNA expression of TH and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were detected by PCR. The results showed that the number of TH positive cells and mRNA expression of TH were significantly reduced in MPTP group compared with the control (P<0.05), and pretreated with Shouwu Shudi Yin didn't show protective effect. Compared to MPTP group, the mRNA expression of four subtypes of GPX were increased in various degrees in the treatment group pretreated with Shouwu Shudi Yin, although the difference was not statistically significant. These indicated that the preventive medication of Shouwu Shudi Yin don't have protective effect on the mice with Parkinson' s disease induced by MPTP, but it may enhance the antioxidant capacity through increasing the expression of GPX.",

    "abstract": "Sleep dysfunction is a common and disabling non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves motor symptoms and subjective sleep in PD, but alternative stimulation parameters to optimize sleep have not been explored. We hypothesized that low frequency STN DBS would improve objective sleep more than conventional settings.\nTwenty PD subjects with STN DBS (18 unilateral, 2 bilateral) underwent 3 non-consecutive nights of polysomnography: DBS off; DBS high frequency (\u2265130 Hz); and DBS low frequency (60 Hz). Motor symptom tolerability was assessed 30 minutes after resumption of baseline settings the morning following polysomnography. The primary outcome was change in sleep efficiency between high and low frequency nights measured with repeated measures ANOVA.\nThere was no difference in sleep efficiency between nights at high frequency (82.1% (72.6-90.1)) (median (IQR)), low frequency (81.2% (56.2-88.8)), or DBS off (82.8% (75.7-87.4)), p=0.241. Additionally, there was no difference in sleep stage percent, arousals, limb movements, subjective sleep quality, or objective vigilance measures. These outcomes did not change after adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, or side of surgery. No residual adverse motor effects were noted.\nAlthough well tolerated, low frequency STN DBS did not improve objective sleep in PD. Remarkably, objective measures of sleep were not worse with DBS off. These observations point to the potential for adaptive stimulation approaches, through which DBS settings could be optimized during sleep to meet individual needs. Additionally, these changes could preserve battery life without compromising patient outcomes.",

The phosphorylation state of \u03b1S was related to the disease, prompting interest in this process. The presumed physiological function and the disease action of \u03b1S involves membrane interaction. Here, we study the effect of phosphorylation at positions 87 and 129, mimicked by the mutations S87A, S129A (nonphosphorylated) and S87D, S129D (phosphorylated) on membrane binding. Local binding is detected by spin-label continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance. For S87A/D, six positions (27, 56, 63, 69, 76, and 90) are probed; and for S129A/D, three (27, 56, and 69).

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an old age disorder of basal ganglia which involves oligomerization of \u03b1-synuclein protein and formation of intercellular inclusions known as \"Lewy bodies\" in substantia nigra and caudate nuclei in brain which is progressive in nature. It is second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremor at rest, muscle rigidity, slowness of movement (bradykinesia, akinesia), and changes in posture (instability). Both excess and deficiency in levels of transition metals (especially iron, copper) can be detrimental to the central nervous system. Abnormalities in iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) metabolism have been reported to produce oxidative stress which is one of the major cause in pathogenesis of PD. In the present study 35 PD patients and 33 controls of Northern Indian population were included and serum levels of Fe, Cu and ceruloplasmin (Cp) were measured. Serum Fe (",

Despite this, many non-motor symptoms remain unreported by patients and consequently untreated. This study explored barriers to help-seeking using two theoretical frameworks, the Common Sense Model of illness perception and Theoretical Domains Framework. A total of 20 participants completed semi-structured interviews to explore symptom beliefs and help-seeking behaviour. Uncertainty about the relationship of non-motor symptoms to Parkinson's disease and lack of clarity around treatments were common. Embarrassment and communication difficulties were common for potentially sensitive symptoms such as sexual dysfunction. Symptom perceptions and beliefs about help-seeking acted as barriers to reporting non-motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, the basal ganglia have been considered the main brain region implicated in Parkinson's disease. This single area perspective gives a restricted clinical picture and limits therapeutic approaches because it ignores the influence of altered interactions between the basal ganglia and other cerebral components on Parkinsonian symptoms. In particular, the basal ganglia work closely in concert with cortex and cerebellum to support motor and cognitive functions. This article proposes a theoretical framework for understanding Parkinson's disease as caused by the dysfunction of the entire basal ganglia-cortex-cerebellum system rather than by the basal ganglia in isolation. In particular, building on recent evidence, we propose that the three key symptoms of tremor, freezing, and impairments in action sequencing may be explained by considering partially overlapping neural circuits including basal ganglia, cortical and cerebellar areas. Studying the involvement of this system in Parkinson's disease is a crucial step for devising innovative therapeutic approaches targeting it rather than only the basal ganglia. Possible future therapies based on this different view of the disease are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract has now been recognized to affect all stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). The consequences lead to problems with absorption of oral medication, erratic treatment response, as well as silent aspiration, which is one of the key risk factors in developing pneumonia. The issue is further complicated by other gut abnormalities, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and an altered gut microbiota, which occur in PD with variable frequency. Clinically, these gastrointestinal abnormalities might be associated with symptoms such as nausea, early-morning \"off\", and frequent motor and non-motor fluctuations. Therefore, non-oral therapies that avoid the gastrointestinal system seem a rational option to overcome the problems of oral therapies in PD. Hence, several non-oral strategies have now been actively investigated and developed. The transdermal rotigotine patch, infusion therapies with apomorphine, intrajejunal levodopa, and the apomorphine pen strategy are currently in clinical use with a few others in development. In this review, we discuss and summarize the most recent developments in this field with a focus on non-oral dopaminergic strategies (excluding surgical interventions such as deep brain stimulation) in development or to be licensed for management of PD.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how a person lives with a chronic illness, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), is necessary to provide individualized care and professionals role in person-centered care at clinical and community levels is paramount. The present study was aimed to analyze the psychometric properties of the Living with Chronic Illness-PD Scale (EC-PC) in a wide Spanish-speaking population with PD. International cross-sectional study with retest was carried out with 324 patients from four Latin American countries and Spain. Feasibility, acceptability, scaling assumptions, reliability, precision, and construct validity were tested. The study included 324 patients, with age (mean\u00b1s.d.) 66.67\u00b110.68 years. None of the EC-PC items had missing values and all acceptability parameters fulfilled the standard criteria. Around two-third of the items (61.54%) met scaling assumptions standards. Concerning internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha values were 0.68-0.88; item-total correlation was >0.30, except for two items; item homogeneity index was >0.30, and inter-item correlation values 0.14-0.76. Intraclass correlation coefficient for EC-PC stability was 0.76 and standard error of measurement (s.e.m.) for precision was 8.60 (for a EC-PC s.d.=18.57). EC-PC presented strong correlation with social support (",

    "abstract": "Hemoglobin (Hb) has been shown to be expressed within dopaminergic neurons and to have a role in maintaining iron and mitochondrial homeostasis. In Parkinson's disease tissues, Hb has been localized to the mitochondrion. Though heme synthesis occurs within the mitochondria, the localization of Hb to this organelle has only recently been described. It is now important to understand whether Hb expression is protective or is a part of the neurodegenerative process. It is possible that the accumulation of neuronal or mitochondrial Hb is initially protective, but over many decades causes pathology. Studying Hb in neurons can give insight into the iron accumulation seen in the brain and the potential role of alpha-synuclein as a ferrireductase. In this review, we discuss the interactions of neuronal and mitochondrial Hb with other proteins and its possible role in pathways relevant to Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "In a previous multinational, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study, levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) was tolerable and significantly improved 'off' time in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, efficacy and safety in the Asian population has not yet been demonstrated. In this open-label study, efficacy and safety of LCIG were assessed in Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese advanced PD patients with motor complications not adequately controlled by available PD medication. The patients were treated with LCIG monotherapy for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the mean change from baseline to week 12 in 'off' time, as reported in the PD Symptom Diary, normalized to a 16\u2009h waking day and analyzed by a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Thirty-one patients were enrolled (23 Japanese, 4 Taiwanese, 4 Korean) and 28 (90%) completed the study. For those who completed the study, the mean (s.d.) total daily levodopa dose from LCIG was 1,206.3 (493.6)\u2009mg/day at final visit (",

    "abstract": "Interest has grown in centering Parkinson's disease (PD) care provision on the welfare of the patient with PD. By putting the welfare of patients first, this patient-centric focus tends to subordinate the welfare of others including clinicians and carers. A possible solution is person-centered care. Rather than remove the spotlight from the patients, it widens that light to illuminate moral interests of all healthcare participants as persons whose welfare is interdependent. It assumes that unwellness among clinicians, for example, can impact the quality of the PD care they provide, such that caring for clinicians may also optimize the welfare of persons with PD. For PD, we suggest how the two models differ and why these differences are important to understand and act on to optimize benefit for participating stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) are among the most frequent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). PD-MCI is six times more likely than age-matched controls to develop dementia and the PDD prevalence is 80% after 15-20 years of disease. Therefore, research has focused on the identification of early dementia biomarkers including specific cognitive at-risk profiles hoping to implement therapeutic interventions when they are most likely to be efficacious. However, given the heterogeneous neuropathological, neurochemical, and neuropsychological nature of cognitive deficits, definition of a comprehensive cognitive model of PDD is a challenge. Evidence from neuroimaging studies using different methods and techniques suggests that in addition to degeneration of the dopaminergic system, other mechanisms have a role including \u03b2-amyloid and tau deposition, and that specific cognitive scales could help identifying a malignant profile. Prospective studies combining neuroimaging techniques and specific cognitive tests are required to define the interplay between the various neurodegenerative processes and the contribution of structural disconnection in brain functional networks, heralding the development of dementia in PD.",

The cellular mechanisms underlying this dysfunction, however, are not understood. In this study, olfactory bulbs (OBs) from male control and PD subjects were examined by histology for changes in cytoarchitecture. These studies found that the general OB laminar organization and the number of interneurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase were unaltered. In contrast, the number of mitral/tufted projection neurons and interneurons expressing Calretinin were significantly decreased in PD subjects. This study reveals changes in OB cytoarchitecture mediated by PD and provides valuable insight into identifying specific OB neuronal populations vulnerable to PD-related neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa has been the gold standard for Parkinson's disease treatment for more than 40 years. Its bioavailability is hindered by dietary amino acids, leading to fluctuations in the motor response particularly in late-stage (stage 3 and 4 on Hoehn and Yahr scale) patients. The routine dietary intervention consists of low-protein (<0.8\u2009g/kg) diets or the redistribution of daily protein allowance to the last meal. Computational modeling was used to examine the fluctuation of gastrointestinal levodopa absorption under consideration of the diet by (i) identifying the group of patients that could benefit from dietary interventions, (ii) comparing existing diet recommendations for their impact on levodopa bioavailability, and (iii) suggesting a mechanism-based dietary intervention. We developed a multiscale computational model consisting of an ordinary differential equations-based advanced compartmentalized absorption and transit (ACAT) gut model and metabolic genome-scale small intestine epithelial cell model. We used this model to investigate complex spatiotemporal relationship between dietary amino acids and levodopa absorption. Our model predicted an improvement in bioavailability, as reflected by blood concentrations of levodopa with protein redistribution diet by 34% compared with a low-protein diet and by 11% compared with the ante cibum (a.c.) administration. These results are consistent with the reported better outcome in late-stage patients. A systematic analysis of the effect of different amino acids in the diet suggested that a serine-rich diet could improve the bioavailability by 22% compared with the a.c. administration. In addition, the slower gastric emptying rate in PD patients exacerbates the loss of levodopa due to competition. Optimizing dietary recommendations in quantity, composition, and intake time holds the promise to improve levodopa efficiency and patient's quality of life based on highly detailed, mechanistic models of gut physiology endowed with improved extrapolative properties, thus paving the way for precision medical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects over one million individuals in the US alone. PD is characterized by a plethora of motor and non-motor manifestations, resulting from a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and disbalance of several other neurotransmitters. A growing body of evidence points to significant alterations of the circadian system in PD. This is not surprising given the pivotal role that dopamine plays in circadian regulation as well as the role of circadian influences in dopamine metabolism. In this review we present basic and clinical investigations that examined the function of the circadian system in PD.",

    "abstract": "To ablate accessory pathway successfully and conveniently, accurate localization of the pathway is needed. Electrophysiologists use different algorithms before taking the patients to the electrophysiology (EP) laboratory to plan the intervention accordingly. In this study, we used Arruda algorithm to locate the accessory pathway. The objective of the study was to determine the accuracy of the Arruda algorithm for locating the pathway on surface ECG.\nIt was a cross-sectional observational study conducted from January 2014 to January 2016 in the electrophysiology department of Hayat Abad Medical Complex Peshawar Pakistan. A total of fifty nine (n=59) consecutive patients of both genders between age 14-60 years presented with WPW syndrome (Symptomatic tachycardia with delta wave on surface ECG) were included in the study. Patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) before taking patients to laboratory was analysed on Arruda algorithm. Standard four wires protocol was used for EP study before ablation. Once the findings were confirmed the pathway was ablated as per standard guidelines.\nA total of fifty nine (n=59) patients between the age 14-60 years were included in the study. Cumulative mean age was 31.5 years\u00b112.5 SD. There were 56.4% (n=31) males with mean age 28.2 years\u00b110.2 SD and 43.6% (n=24) were females with mean age 35.9 years\u00b114.0 SD. Arruda algorithm was found to be accurate in predicting the exact accessory pathway (AP) in 83.6% (n=46) cases. Among all inaccurate predictions (n=9), Arruda inaccurately predicted two third (n=6; 66.7%) pathways towards right side (right posteroseptal, right posterolateral and right antrolateral).\nArruda algorithm was found highly accurate in predicting accessory pathway before ablation.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate motor and non-motor symptoms in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients and to determine the self-reported influence of all existing symptoms on their quality of life (QoL).\nThe sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, medical treatments, and Modified Hoehn and Yahr (mH&Y) scores of IPD patients without cognitive impairment were recorded. A survey questioning different motor and non-motor symptoms was administered to the patients. The patients were asked to rate their symptoms by number from the greatest influence to the least influence on their QoL. Subjects were divided into two groups: those suffering from IPD for \u22645 years (Group 1) and those suffering from IPD for >5 years (Group 2). These groups were compared in terms of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, existing symptoms, and influences of these symptoms on their QoL.\nThere were 63 patients in Group 1 and 37 patients in Group 2. No statistically significant differences were detected between the groups with respect to sociodemographic characteristics or mH&Y scores. The most common motor symptoms in both of these groups were tremor and bradykinesia; meanwhile, the non-motor symptoms most frequently encountered in these groups were pain-cramps, constipation, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Again, while the symptoms that most greatly disturbed QoL in all patients were reported to be tremor and bradykinesia, the most disturbing non-motor symptom was frequent voiding/incontinence, which was a less common symptom. Pain-cramp, constipation, and EDS, which were the most frequent non-motor symptoms, were the symptoms that least disturbed QoL.\nIt is widely accepted that motor symptoms determine QoL in IPD. However, non-motor symptoms are seen during all phases of the disease. The impact of non-motor symptoms on the QoL of IPD patients remains substantial. Therefore, in addition to the well-known motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms, which may be overlooked during physical examination yet may profoundly impact QoL, should be questioned and treated appropriately to improve QoL in PD patients as much as possible.",

Few neuroimaging works have attempted to identify the neural features of PD-EDS, but various findings were reported. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature on mood and neuroimaging correlates of PD-EDS. A MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycInfo search for peer-reviewed original research articles on depression, anxiety, and neuroimaging in PD-EDS identified 26 studies on depression, nine on anxiety, and eight on neuroimaging. Half of the studies reported greater depression in PD-EDS-positive patients compared with PD-EDS-negative patients. There was a significantly positive correlation between depression and PD-EDS. Limited studies on anxiety in PD-EDS suggested a weak correlation between anxiety and EDS. For depression and anxiety, the effect sizes were medium when EDS was subjectively measured, but became small when EDS was objective measured. Current neuroimaging studies generally suggested diminished neural structural and functional features (eg, brain volume, white matter integrity as indicated by fractional anisotropy, and cerebral metabolism) in patients with PD-EDS. Future studies should apply objective and subjective measures of mood symptoms and EDS and improve the neuroimaging methodology via using multimodal techniques and whole-brain analysis to provide new clues on the mood and neural correlates of PD-EDS.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a major progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Accurate diagnosis of PD is crucial to control the symptoms appropriately. However, its clinical diagnosis mostly relies on the subjective judgment of physicians and the clinical symptoms that often appear late. Recent neuroimaging techniques, along with machine learning methods, provide alternative solutions for PD screening. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection technique, based on iterative canonical correlation analysis (ICCA), to investigate the roles of different brain regions in PD through T1-weighted MR images.

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to observe the structural changes of the extracorticospinal tract in Parkinson's disease (PD) using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) magnetic resonance (MR) scans. The association of DTI parameters and brain-iron accumulation with PD was examined and imaging signs useful in the diagnosis of PD were explored. The study included 30 patients with PD and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls who underwent routine MR, SWI and DTI scans. The corrected phase (CP) values of the substantia nigra (SN), red nucleus (RN), globus pallidus (GP) and putamen (PUT) were measured, and fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were obtained. Significant differences were found in the CP values between the PD and control groups in the SN, RN and PUT, but there were no differences in other regions of interest (ROIs). The FA values of the SN and PUT in the PD group were significantly decreased compared with those of the control group, but there was no significant difference in the FA values of the GP. Furthermore, there was no significant inter-group difference in the ADC values of any ROIs. In conclusion, SWI is a method useful for evaluating brain-iron deposition in PD. Increasing iron storage levels have previously been shown to be associated with PD pathogenesis but not with the degree of PD severity. FA values may be useful for diagnosing PD, and DTI may offer some insight into PD pathomechanisms and clinical diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) are better predictors of quality of life changes, caregiver burden, and mortality than motor symptoms. Levodopa has limited, and sometimes detrimental, effects on these symptoms. In this review we discuss recent evidence on pharmacological treatments for non-motor symptoms.\nBreakthroughs have been made in the treatment of psychosis and sleep dysfunction. Pimavanserin has become the first FDA approved drug for PD psychosis. There is also new research supporting cholinesterase inhibitors for sleep disorders in PD. Other studies, including several novel treatments, have shown mixed results for apathy, depression, and fatigue.\nFurther research is needed to develop treatments for non-motor symptoms in PD. Preclinical and postmortem studies indicate that non-motor symptoms in PD may arise from pathology in non-dopamine systems. Although sometimes used off-label, therapies that target such systems have been under-utilized in treating non-motor symptoms and warrant further clinical investigation.",

An electronic database search of PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and Embase was conducted, to examine current scientific literature for potential benefits of Tai Chi on physical function and well-being among persons with PD. A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria: 7 randomized clinical trials and 4 quasi-experimental studies. PD participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0548) were on average age 68 years old and 50% women. Overall, participants enrolled in Tai Chi had better balance and one or more aspect of well-being, though mixed results were reported. Further research is needed with more rigorous study designs, larger sample sizes, adequate Tai Chi exercise doses, and carefully chosen outcome measures that assess the mechanisms as well as the effects of Tai Chi, before widespread recommendations can be made.",

    "abstract": "In light of the fact that the number of elderly citizens in society is steadily increasing, the search for dietary factors which might prolong mental agility is growing in significance. Coffee, together with its main ingredient, caffeine, has been the focus of much attention from various researchers, as data on its beneficial effects on human health continue to accumulate. Most reports indicate that moderate coffee consumption may in fact lower the risk for common neurodegenerative conditions, i.e. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Regardless, due to their complex pathogenesis as well as methodology of scientific research, the exact impact of coffee consumption remains to be fully elucidated. At present, it seems safe to inform the general public that coffee drinkers need not fear for their health. Possibly, in the future experts will recommend drinking coffee not only to satisfy individual taste preferences but also to decrease age-related mental deterioration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and as a consequence, by decreased dopamine levels in the striatum. Currently available therapies are not able to stop or reverse the progression of the disease. A novel therapeutic approach is based on cell therapy with stem cells, in order to replace degenerated neurons. Among stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells seemed the most promising thanks to their capacities to differentiate toward dopaminergic neurons and to release neurotrophic factors. Indeed, mesenchymal stem cells are able to produce different molecules with immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, angiogenic, chemotactic effects and that stimulate differentiation of resident stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated for the first time from bone marrow, but can be collected also from adipose tissue, umbilical cord and other tissues. In this review, we focused our attention on mesenchymal stem cells derived from different sources and their application in Parkinson's disease animal models.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety negatively impacts the quality of life of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and caregivers. Despite high prevalence, there is a paucity of trials investigating effective treatments for anxiety in PD. This uncontrolled study investigated the use of a manualized and tailored Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for anxiety in PD.\nParticipants completed 6 weekly CBT sessions. Pre-, post- and follow-up (3 and 6\u00a0months) assessments were made. Change in outcomes were analysed using t-tests and Reliability Change Index. Of 17 PD patients who agreed to CBT, 12 completed the intervention.\nThis study showed a significant reduction in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores in PD immediately post CBT (t(11)\u00a0=\u00a03.59, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01), maintained at 3-month (t(8)\u00a0=\u00a02.83, p\u00a0=\u00a0.02) and 6-month (t(7)\u00a0=\u00a02.07, p\u00a0=\u00a0.04) follow-up. A reduction in caregiver burden (t(11)\u00a0=\u00a02.68, p\u00a0=\u00a0.03) was observed post intervention. Improvements in motor disability (t(11)\u00a0=\u00a02.41, p\u00a0=\u00a0.04) and cognitive scores (t(11)\u00a0=\u00a0-2.92, p\u00a0=\u00a0.01) were also observed post intervention and at follow-up.\nTailored CBT can be used to treat anxiety in PD.\nThis study provides preliminary evidence suggesting that tailored CBT reduces anxiety in PD with persisting benefits, and lowers caregiver burden.",

The overall purpose of the current study was to explore driving and driving cessation for people with PD and their families.\nA descriptive phenomenological approach was employed using semi-structured interviews and 34 interviews were conducted overall (22 participants with PD and 12 family members).\nExperiences of anxiety and worry that had an impact on driving and driving cessation arose from the data, and this article specifically captured the lived experience of anxiety with driving and driving cessation for people with PD and their families.\nFindings reveal that the experience of anxiety while driving, as well as anticipatory anxiety and/or worry related to driving cessation, affect the driving experiences and wellbeing of people with PD.\nImplications of the study findings are outlined and aim to provide information about the needs to enable future clinical directions to be developed.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is a very common non-motor symptom in Parkinson disease (PD) patients. It included physical fatigue and mental fatigue. The potential mechanisms of mental fatigue involving serotonergic dysfunction and abnormal iron metabolism are still unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the fatigue symptoms, classified PD patients into fatigue group and non-fatigue group, and detected the levels of serotonin, iron and related proteins in CSF and serum. In CSF, 5-HT level is significantly decreased and the levels of iron and transferrin are dramatically increased in fatigue group. In fatigue group, mental fatigue score is negatively correlated with 5-HT level in CSF, and positively correlated with the scores of depression and excessive daytime sleepiness, and disease duration, also, mental fatigue is positively correlated with the levels of iron and transferrin in CSF. Transferrin level is negatively correlated with 5-HT level in CSF. In serum, the levels of 5-HT and transferrin are markedly decreased in fatigue group; mental fatigue score exhibits a negative correlation with 5-HT level. Thus serotonin dysfunction in both central and peripheral systems may be correlated with mental fatigue through abnormal iron metabolism. Depression, excessive daytime sleepiness and disease duration were the risk factors for mental fatigue of PD.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are very common and contribute to the severity of patient's disability. We evaluated the occurrence of autonomic symptoms in Greek patients with PD utilizing the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic questionnaire (SCOPA-AUT), a specific 23-item self-completed questionnaire for the assessment of autonomic dysfunction in patients with PD.\nOne hundred and sixty-one PD patients and forty matched controls were enrolled in the study. Clinical assessment was performed with the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Patients completed a demographic questionnaire, the Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest), the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and the SCOPA-AUT scale which was properly translated into Greek and validated for the study.\nSCOPA-AUT scale showed a good reliability profile and\u00a0 correlated well with other measures for non-motor symptoms and health-related quality measures in PD patients. PD patients scored higher than controls in the total SCOPA -AUT score (mean score 11.9 versus 6.4). Patients reported problems in many items of the SCOPA-AUT, but the most common autonomic symptoms emerged in the Urinary and the Gastrointestinal domains. Especially sialorrhea, constipation, straining for defecation, incontinence and nocturia differentiated patients from controls. Furthermore, mean total SCOPA-AUT score correlated with duration and severity of the disease.\nAutonomic symptoms in PD are too important to remain undetected. By incorporating into everyday practice the use of suitable and reliable questionnaires, physicians will be able to adequately detect and manage these symptoms. Hippokratia 2016, 20(2):115-120.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, is a major socio-economic burden in modern society. While there is presently no cure for PD, enhancing the number of neural stem cells (NSCs) and/or stimulating their differentiation into new neurons are promising therapeutic strategies. Many proneurogenic factors have been implicated in controlling NSCs activity, including the microRNA (miR)-124. However, current strategies described for the intracellular delivery of miR involve mostly unspecific or inefficient platforms. In Saraiva et\u00a0al. we developed miR-124 loaded nanoparticles (NPs) able to efficiently deliver miR-124 into neural stem/progenitor cells and boost neuronal differentiation and maturation ",

    "abstract": "Continuous delivery to the jejunum of levodopa-carbidopa is a promising therapy in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, as it reduces motor fluctuation. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and jejunal tube (PEG-J) placement is a suitable option for this. However, studies focused in PEG-J management are lacking.\nWe report our experience regarding this technique, including technical success, adverse events and outcomes, in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.\nTwenty-seven advanced Parkinson's disease patients (17 men, median age: 64 years, median disease duration: 11 years) were included in a retrospective study from June 2007 to April 2015. The median follow-up period was 48 months (1-96).\nNo adverse events were noted during and after nasojejunal tube insertion (to assess treatment efficacy). After a good therapeutic response, a PEG-J was placed successfully in all patients. The PEG tube was inserted according to Ponsky's method. The jejunal extension was inserted during the same procedure in all patients. Twelve patients (44%) experienced severe adverse events related to the PEG-J insertion, which occurred after a median follow-up of 15.5 months. Endoscopy was the main treatment modality. Patients who experienced severe adverse events had a higher comorbidity score (\nWhile all patients responded well to levodopa-carbidopa regarding neurological outcomes, gastro-intestinal severe adverse events were frequent and related to comorbidities. Endoscopic treatment is the cornerstone for management of PEG-J related events. In conclusion, clinicians and endoscopists, as well as patients, should be fully informed of procedure-related adverse events and patients should be followed in centres experienced in their management.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory processes contribute to the eventual death of motor neurons and the development of symptoms in both idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Given the faster rate of progression and more severe symptoms associated with MSA, we hypothesized that markers of inflammation would be more evident in the peripheral blood of MSA than PD patients, and that evidence of this inflammation might assist early diagnosis of MSA versus PD.\nWe performed multiplex analysis to determine the concentrations of 37 immune-associated cytokines and chemokines isolated from the plasma of patients with PD (n = 25) and MSA (n = 14) and compared our results to those of age-matched controls (n = 15). We then applied a mixed-effect multiple regression model to determine if the concentration of cytokines in the plasma of patients with PD and MSA changed significantly over time.\nPatients with MSA had a trend towards overall lower levels of immune-associated cytokines, while serum cytokine levels were increased in patients with PD. Statistically adjusted comparisons of overall changes in cytokine concentrations between the PD and MSA groups revealed higher concentrations of T-cell-associated cytokines TNF\u03b2 and IL-7 in PD. Comparison of samples taken over time revealed significantly faster rates of change in 4 different cytokine concentrations (IL-4, IL-15, IL-2, and IL-9) in patients with MSA versus patients with PD.\nOur results suggest that single measurements of plasma concentrations of inflammation-associated cytokines cannot be used to distinguish disease states. However, measurements made over time may correlate with pathogenesis. The significant changes in T-cell-associated cytokines may shed light on immune mechanisms that contribute to PD and MSA disease progression.",

    "abstract": "A pivotal role of oxidative stress has been emphasized in the pathogenesis as well as in the disease progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed at investigating serum levels of antioxidant vitamins and elucidating whether they could be associated with the pathogenesis and progression of PD.\nSerum levels of retinol, \u03b1- and \u03b3-tocopherols, \u03b1- and \u03b2-carotenes, lutein, lycopene, zeaxanthin and \u03b2-cryptoxanthin were measured and compared between 104 patients with idiopathic PD and 52 healthy controls matched for age and gender. In order to examine the relationship between antioxidant vitamins and the disease progression, multiple group comparisons were performed among the early PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage I and II, N = 47), advanced PD (stage III and IV, N = 57) and control groups. Separate correlation analyses were performed between the measured antioxidant vitamins and clinical variables, such as Hoehn and Yahr stage and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score.\nCompared to controls, PD patients had lower levels of \u03b1- and \u03b2-carotenes and lycopene. \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene and lycopene levels were significantly reduced in advanced PD patients relative to early PD patients and were negatively correlated with Hoehn and Yahr stage and UPDRS motor score in PD patients. No significant differences were found in serum levels of retinol, \u03b1- and \u03b3-tocopherols, and other carotenoids between PD patients and controls. No significant correlations were found between these vitamin levels and clinical variables in PD patients.\nWe found that serum levels of some carotenoids, \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene and lycopene, were lower in PD patients, and that these carotenoids inversely correlated with clinical variables representing disease progression. Our findings suggest that decreases in serum \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene and lycopene may be associated with the pathogenesis as well as progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "We studied some structural and functional parameters of erythrocyte membranes in mice at the late presymptomatic and early symptomatic stages of experimental Parkinson's disease induced by administration of MPTP (hemolysis, microviscosity of different regions of the lipid bilayer, LPO intensity, activity of antioxidant enzymes, and kinetic properties of acetylcholinesterase). At the presymptomatic stage, significant deviations of the studied parameters from the normal were observed; they were similar in direction and magnitude to those in humans with Parkinson's disease. At the early symptomatic stage, most parameters tended to normal. Microviscosity of bulk lipids increased at the presymptomatic stage and decreased after appearance of clinical symptoms. This dynamics probably reflects activation of compensatory mechanisms aimed at inhibition of oxidative stress triggered by the development of the pathological process.",

At baseline, all patients had their standing height, weight, and waist circumference measurements taken using a standard scale. Their body mass index was then calculated. A fasting blood of 5 ml was obtained from each patient in the morning. ELISA was used to analyze leptin concentrations. The severity of PD was evaluated using the Hoehn and Yahr scale, and the clinical status of patients was evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. The cognitive status of whole patients was evaluated using a validated form of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale in Turkey (MoCA-TR).\nThe mean ages of the patients and controls were 59.37\u00b19.22 and 58.50\u00b19.85 years, while the mean leptin levels were 4.13\u00b13.61 and 3.12\u00b12.43 ng/mL, respectively. Leptin levels did not differ between PD patients and the controls. PD patients had significantly lower MoCA-TR scores than the controls (p=0.028). MoCA-TR scores were not correlated to leptin levels in PD patients.\nIn this study, we could not find a relationship between blood leptin levels of PD patients and cognition as assessed by MoCA-TR.

    "abstract": "Though striatal and postural deformities are known to occur commonly in atypical Parkinsonism patients, these may also be seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). These are frequently misdiagnosed as joint or orthopaedic pathology leading to unnecessary investigations. This study was conducted to observe the various striatal and postural deformities among patients with PD in India.\nThis study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching institute in north# India. Seventy consecutive patients with PD diagnosed as per the modified UK Brain Bank criteria were included. Various striatal (hand & foot) and postural (antecollis, camptocormia, scoliosis & Pisa syndrome) deformities and their relation with the duration of disease, severity [measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)] and levodopa intake were analyzed.\nOf the 70 patients with PD, 34 (48.57%) had either striatal or postural deformities. Striatal foot was the most common deformity observed (25.71%). Camptocormia was the second most common deformity (20%). Striatal and postural deformities were seen in more advanced PD as suggested by significantly higher UPDRS and Hoehn and Yahr scale (P<0.001). Striatal deformities were more ipsilateral to PD symptom onset side (agreement 94.44%). Pisa and scoliosis concavity were more on contralateral side to PD symptoms onset side (66.67%).\nOur results showed that striatal and postural deformities were common and present in about half of the patients with PD. These deformities we more common in patients with advanced stage of PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether there was an association between glutathione S-transferase M1(GSTM1)gene polymorphism and Parkinson's disease (PD) susceptibility by pooling published data. We performed comprehensive electronic database search for articles published between February12,2015 and April30 2016. The published case-control or cohort studies related to GSTM1 gene polymorphism and Parkinson's disease susceptibility were screened, reviewed, and included in this meta-analysis. The correlation between GSTM1 gene polymorphism and PD susceptibility was expressed by odds ratio (OR) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Publication bias was evaluated by Begg's funnel plot and Egger's line regression test. All analysis was done by stata11.0 software. After searching the PubMed, EMBASE, and CNKI databases, seventeen case-control studies with 3,538 PD and 5,180 controls were included in the final meta-analysis. The data was pooled by a fixed-effect model for lack of statistical heterogeneity across the studies; the results showed GSTM1 null expression can significant increase the susceptibility of PD (OR=1.11, 95% CI:1.01-1.21, P<0.05). Subgroup analysis indicated GSTM1 gene polymorphism was associated with PD susceptibility in the Caucasian ethnic group (OR=1.15, 95% CI:1.05-1.27, P<0.05) but not in the Asian ethnic group (OR=0.89, 95% CI:0.70-1.12, P>0.05). Begg's funnel plot and Egger's line regression test showed no significant publication bias. Based on the present evidence, GSTM1 null expression can significant increase the susceptibility of PD in persons of Caucasian ethnicity.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the abnormal brain activities in the early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD), the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded with 20 channels from non-dementia PD patients (18 patients, 8 females) and age matched healthy controls (18 subjects, 8 females) during the resting state. Two methods based on the ordinal patterns of the recorded series, i.e., permutation entropy (PE) and order index (OI), were introduced to characterize the complexity of the cortical activities for two groups. It was observed that the resting-state EEG of PD patients showed lower PE and higher OI than healthy controls, which indicated that the early-stage PD caused the reduced complexity of EEG. We further applied two methods to determine the complexity of EEG rhythms in five sub-bands. The results showed that the gamma, beta and alpha rhythms of PD patients were characterized by lower PE and higher OI, i.e., reduced complexity, than healthy subjects. No significant differences were observed in theta or delta rhythms between two groups. The findings suggested that PE and OI were promising methods to detect the abnormal changes in the dynamics of EEG signals associated with early-stage PD. Further, such changes in EEG complexity may be the early markers of the cortical or subcortical dysfunction caused by PD.",

    "abstract": "Given the importance of ethnic differences in the evaluation of various aspects of symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), we present the formal procedure for completing the traditional Chinese translation of the International and Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society/UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS) and highlight the discrepancy in nonmotor symptoms (NMS) between patients in Eastern and Western countries.\nA total of 350 native Chinese-speaking PD patients were recruited from multiple hospitals in Eastern countries; they completed the MDS-UPDRS. The translation process was executed and factor analysis was performed to determine the structure of the scale. Chi-squared and t tests were used to compare frequency and severity of PD symptoms between the Chinese-speaking and English-speaking groups (n = 876).\nNMS and motor symptoms were more severe in the Western population (Part I: \nThe traditional Chinese version of the MDS-UPDRS can be designated as an official translation of the original scale, and it is now available for use. Moreover, NMS in PD constitute a major issue worldwide, and the pattern of NMS among the Chinese population is more marked in terms of cognition-based symptoms and activities of daily living.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is an age-related, disabling neurodegenerative disorder. Although sufferers usually respond to dopamine agonists for extended periods, the disease remains progressive and adverse drug effects can compromise effective long term treatment. Cell-based therapies have been the subject of much hype and optimism with regard to PD. Proof of principle was provided in the 1980s with fetal tissue transplantation trials demonstrating successful graft survival. Embryonic stem cells and reprogrammed or transdifferentiated somatic cells may provide alternative sources of tissue with the potential to overcome the material shortages and technical difficulties that have hindered fetal neural transplants. This article will review the state of the science for cell based therapies and examine the ethical issues that societies must negotiate regarding their clinical use.",

    "abstract": "To assess body distribution and timing of appearance of rest tremor in Parkinson's disease.\nInformation was obtained by a computerized database containing historical information collected at the first visit and data collected during the subsequent follow-up visits. Information on rest tremor developed during the follow-up could be therefore obtained by our own observation in a proportion of patients.\nAmong 289 patients, rest tremor was reported at disease onset in 65.4% of cases and detected at last follow-up examination in 74.4% of patients. Analysis of patients who did not report rest tremor at disease onset indicated that 26% of such patients (9% in the overall population) manifested rest tremor over the disease course. Rest tremor spread to new sites in 39% of patients who manifested rest tremor at disease onset. Regardless of tremor presentation at disease onset or during the follow-up, upper limb was the most frequent tremor localization. Over the follow-up, rest tremor developed faster in the upper limb than in other body sites. The risk of developing rest tremor during the follow-up was not affected by sex, side of motor symptom onset and site of tremor presentation. However, age of disease onset >63years was associated with an increased risk of rest tremor spread.\nThis study provides new information about body distribution and timing of rest tremor appearance during the course of early stages of Parkinson's disease that may help clinicians in patients' counselling.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus and surrounding region (PPNR) is a novel treatment strategy for gait freezing in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, clinical results have been variable, in part because of the paucity of functional information that might help guide selection of the optimal surgical target. In this study, we use simultaneous magnetoencephalography and local field recordings from the PPNR in seven PD patients, to characterize functional connectivity with distant brain areas at rest. The PPNR was preferentially coupled to brainstem and cingulate regions in the alpha frequency (8-12 Hz) band and to the medial motor strip and neighboring areas in the beta (18-33 Hz) band. The distribution of coupling also depended on the vertical distance of the electrode from the pontomesencephalic line: most effects being greatest in the middle PPNR, which may correspond to the caudal pars dissipata of the pedunculopontine nucleus. These observations confirm the crucial position of the PPNR as a functional node between cortical areas such as the cingulate/ medial motor strip and other brainstem nuclei, particularly in the dorsal pons. In particular they suggest a special role for the middle PPNR as this has the greatest functional connectivity with other brain regions.",

    "abstract": "To assess reductions of cerebral glucose metabolism in Parkinson's disease (PD) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and their associations with cognitive decline.\nFDG-PET was performed on a cohort of 79 patients with newly diagnosed PD (mean disease duration 8\u2005months) and 20 unrelated controls. PD participants were scanned while on their usual dopaminergic medication. Cognitive testing was performed at baseline, and after 18\u2005months using the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) and Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) computerised batteries, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). We used statistical parametric mapping (SPM V.12) software to compare groups and investigate voxelwise correlations between FDG metabolism and cognitive score at baseline. Linear regression was used to evaluate how levels of cortical FDG metabolism were predictive of subsequent cognitive decline rated with the MMSE and MoCA.\nPD participants showed reduced glucose metabolism in the occipital and inferior parietal lobes relative to controls. Low performance on memory-based tasks was associated with reduced FDG metabolism in posterior parietal and temporal regions, while attentional performance was associated with more frontal deficits. Baseline parietal to cerebellum FDG metabolism ratios predicted MMSE (\u03b2=0.38, p=0.001) and MoCA (\u03b2=0.3, p=0.002) at 18\u2005months controlling for baseline score.\nReductions in cortical FDG metabolism were present in newly diagnosed PD, and correlated with performance on neuropsychological tests. A reduced baseline parietal metabolism is associated with risk of cognitive decline and may represent a potential biomarker for this state and the development of PD dementia.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that is diagnosed and measured clinically by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Tools for continuous and objective monitoring of PD motor symptoms are needed to complement clinical assessments of symptom severity to further inform PD therapeutic development across several arenas, from developing more robust clinical trial outcome measures to establishing biomarkers of disease progression. The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Disease Research and Intel Corporation have joined forces to develop a mobile application and an Internet of Things (IoT) platform to support large-scale studies of objective, continuously sampled sensory data from people with PD. This platform provides both population and per-patient analyses, measuring gait, activity level, nighttime activity, tremor, as well as other structured assessments and tasks. All data collected will be available to researchers on an open-source platform. Development of the IoT platform raised a number of engineering considerations, including wearable sensor choice, data management and curation, and algorithm validation. This project has successfully demonstrated proof of concept that IoT platforms, wearable technologies and the data they generate offer exciting possibilities for more robust, reliable, and low-cost research methodologies and patient care strategies.",

    "abstract": "In the substantia nigra of human brain, neuromelanin (NM) released by degenerating neurons can activate microglia with consequent neurodegeneration, typical of Parkinson's disease (PD). Synthetic analogues of NM were prepared to develop a PD model reproducing the neuropathological conditions of the disease. Soluble melanin-protein conjugates were obtained by melanization of fibrillated \u03b2-lactoglobulin (fLG). The melanic portion of the conjugates contains either eumelanic (EufLG) or mixed eumelanic/pheomelanic composition (PheofLG), the latter better simulating natural NMs. In addition, the conjugates can be loaded with controlled amounts of iron. Upon melanization, PheofLG-Fe conjugates maintain the amyloid cross-\u03b2 protein core as the only structurally organized element, similarly to human NMs. The similarity in composition and structural organization with the natural pigment is reflected by the ability of synthetic NMs to activate microglia, showing potential of the novel conjugates to model NM induced neuroinflammation. Thus, synthetic NM/microglia constitute a new model to develop anti-Parkinson drugs.",

PD patients have special motor as well as non-motor symptoms over time. There are several limitations in the study of PD such as unavailability of data, proper diagnosis and treatment methods. These limitations significantly reduce the quality of PD patient life quality, either directly or indirectly. PD also imposes great financial burdens to PD patients and their family. This project aims to analyze the most common reasons for PD patient hospitalization, review complications that occur during inpatient stays, and measure the costs associated with PD patient characteristics. Using the HCUP NIS data, comprehensive data analysis has been performed. The results are customized visualized using Tableau and other software systems. The preliminary findings sheds light into how to improve the life quality of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Tremor is a common symptom shared in both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Essential tremor (ET) subjects. The differential diagnosis of PD and ET tremor is important since the realization of treatment depends on specific medication. A novel feature is developed based on a hypothesis that tremor of PD subject has a larger fluctuation during resting than action task. Tremor signal is collected using a triaxial gyroscope sensor attached to subject's finger during kinetic and resting task. The angular velocity signal is analyzed by transforming a one-dimensional to two-dimensional signal using a relation of signal and its delay versions. Tremor fluctuation is defined as the area of 95% confidence ellipse covering the two-dimensional signal. The tremor fluctuation during kinetic and resting task is used as classification features. The support vector machine is used as a classifier and tested with 10-fold cross-validation. This novel feature provides a perfect PD/ET classification with 100% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.",

    "abstract": "Our research team has previously used four Electroencephalography (EEG) leads to successfully detect and predict Freezing of Gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it remained to be determined whether these four sensor locations that were arbitrarily chosen based on their role in motor control are indeed the most optimal for FOG detection. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the most optimal location and combination of sensors to detect FOG amongst a 32-channel EEG montage using our EEG classification system. EEG measures, including power spectral density, centroid frequency and power spectral entropy, were extracted from 7 patients with PD and FOG during a series of Timed up and Go tasks. By applying a feed-forward neural networks to classify EEG data, the obtained results showed that even a small number of electrodes suffice to construct a FOG detector with expected performance, which is comparable to the use of a full 32 channels montage. This finding therefore progresses the realization of a FOG detection system that can be effectively implemented on a daily basis for FOG prevention, improving the quality of life for many patients with PD.",

We extract a set of temporal and spectral features from the ambulatory signals and then introduce a semi-supervised classification algorithm based on K-means and self-organizing tree map clustering methods. Two different types of cluster labeling are introduced: hard and fuzzy labeling. The developed algorithm is evaluated on a dataset from triaxial gyroscope sensors for 12 PD patients. The average result of using K-means and fuzzy labeling on the trunk and the more affected leg sensors' readings was 75.96%, 70.57%, and 86.93% for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. The accuracy for individual patients varied from 99.95% to 42.53%, which was correlated with dyskinesia severity and the improvement of the PD symptoms with medication.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) became a standard therapeutic option in Parkinson's disease (PD), even though the underlying modulated network of STN-DBS is still poorly described. Probabilistic tractography and connectivity analysis as derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed together with modelling of implanted electrode positions and linked postoperative clinical outcome. Fifteen patients with idiopathic PD without dementia were selected for DBS treatment. After pre-processing, probabilistic tractography was run from cortical and subcortical seeds of the hypothesized network to targets represented by the positions of the active DBS contacts. The performed analysis showed that the projections of the stimulation site to supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1) are mainly involved in the network effects of STN-DBS. An involvement of the \"hyperdirected pathway\" and a clear delimitation of the cortico-spinal tract were demonstrated. This study shows the effects of STN-DBS in PD distinctly rely on the network connections of the stimulated region to M1 and SMA, motor and premotor regions.",

For processing data tremors acquired by the sensor device we have developed an Android application which allows an evaluation of the state of PD patients based on three types of tests that are in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale recommended by the Movement Disorder Society (MDS-UPDRS); the tests performed in the application are: postural tremor of the hands, kinetic tremors of the hands and resting tremor amplitude. The results of PD Patients showed that despite receiving medication to minimize symptoms of their disease, patients have a considerable tremor amplitude, which affects the normal development of their daily activities. In addition, the spectral analysis of the tremors shows that two of the patients were correctly diagnosed with PD while the third patient showed spectral characteristics which led us to suggest to the treating physician reconsider the diagnosis.",

Firstly, using the continuous wavelet transform, the P wave, the QRS complex and the T wave are detected, then their durations are computed after determination of the boundary location (onsets and offsets of the P, QRS and T waves). Secondly, the PR duration, the QRS duration and the upstroke of the QRS complex are used to determine the presence or absence of the delta wave. This algorithm has been tested on the Physionel database (ptbdb) in order to evaluate its robustness. It has been applied to clinical signals from patients affected by WPW syndrome. This method can provide assistance to practitioners in order to detect the WPW syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Dual-mode multielectrode recordings have become routine in rodent neuroscience research. However, robust and reliable application of acute, multielectrode recording methods in brain especially for in vivo research remains a challenge. In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the efficacy of L-dopa therapy depends on its ability to restore Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the striatum. In this paper, We describe a low cost thin film 16 sites implantable microelectrode array (MEA) chip fabricated by standard lithography technology for in vivo test. In urethane anesthetized rats, the MEA probes were implanted acutely for simultaneous recording of local field potentials, spikes, and L-dopa therapy evoked dopamine overflow on the same spatiotemporal scale. We present a detailed protocol for array fabrication, then show that the device can record Spikes, LFPs and dopamine variation in real time. Across any given microelectrode, spike amplitudes ranged from 80 to 300 \u03bc\u03bd peak to peak, with a mean signal-tonoise ratio of better than 5:1. Calibration results showed the MEA probe had high sensitivity and good selectivity for DA. Comparison with existing methods allow single mode recording, our neural probes would be useful for examining specific spatiotemporal relationships between electrical and chemical signaling in the brain.",

In this paper, we present the development and initial validation of a quantitative assessment tool for Parkinson's disease (QAPD), a system designed to assist researchers and clinicians in the study of PD. The system integrates motion tracking, data gloves, and electromyography to collect movement related data from multiple body parts. As part of the system, a custom MATLAB\u00ae based toolbox has been designed to quantify bradykinesia, tremor, micrographia, and muscle rigidity using both standard and contemporary data analysis techniques. We believe this system can be a useful assessment tool to assist clinicians and researchers in diagnosing and estimating movement dysfunction in individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "More than 70% of patients suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit resting tremor in their extremities, hampering their ability to perform daily activities. Based on our earlier studies on corticospinal transmission of tremor signals [10,11], we hypothesize that cutaneous afferents evoked by surface stimulation can produce an inhibitory effect on propriospinal neurons (PN), which in turn will suppress tremor signals passing through the PN. This paper presents the development of a closed-loop system for tremor suppression by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of sensory fibers beneath the skin. The closed-loop system senses EMGs of forearm muscles, and detects rhythmic bursting in the EMG signal. When a tremor is detected by the system, a command signal triggers a stimulator to output a train of bi-phasic, current regulated pulses to a pair of surface electrodes. The stimulation electrode is placed on the dorsal hand skin near the metacarpophalangeal joint of index finger, which is innervated by the superficial radial nerve that projects an inhibitory afferent to PNs of forearm muscles. We tested the closed-loop system in 3 normal subjects to verify the algorithm and in 2 tremor dominated PD subjects for feasibility of tremor detecting and suppression. Preliminary results indicate that the closed-loop system can detect tremor in all subjects, and tremor in PD patients was suppressed significantly by electrical stimulation of cutaneous afferents.",

    "abstract": "Gait Initiation Failure (GIF) is one of the most disabling gait disturbances seen in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Gait Initiation is a complex motor task that requires motor and cognitive processing to enable the correct selection, timing and scaling of movement. Failure to initiate the first step often precipitates falls and leads to significant morbidity. However, the brain mechanisms underlying GIF remain unknown. This study utilized an ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) technique to investigate the brain dynamic changes underlying GIF and aims to detect the occurrence of GIF in four PD patients. We sought to determine whether episodes of GIF might be associated with a characteristic brain signal that could be detected by surface EEG. This preliminary investigation analyzed the EEG signals through power spectra density (PSD) and centroid frequency (CF) to show that the GIF episodes were associated with significant increases in the high beta band (21-38Hz) across the central, frontal, occipital and parietal EEG sites. By implementing PSD and CF as input features with two-layer Back Propagation neural networks as a classifier, the proposed system was able to detect GIF events with a classification performance of 84.27% sensitivity and 84.80% accuracy. This is the first study to show cortical dynamic changes associated with GIF in Parkinson's disease, providing valuable information to enhance the performance of future GIF detection that could be translated into clinical practice.",

PD patients with RBD represent faster motor progression and cognitive dysfunction. We used diffusion imaging to assess which regions are involved in this phenomenon. In the current study, we computed Quantitative Anisotropic (QA), which is based on spin distribution function (SDF) that quantifies the density of diffusing water and is more sensitive to psychological differences between groups and also diffusion MRI connectometry to conduct group analysis between age and gender matched PD patients with and without RBD. The major regions with significantly reduced QA in PD patients with RBD were left and right cingulum and left and left inferior occipital fasciculus.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we intended to differentiate patients with essential tremor (ET) from tremor dominant Parkinson disease (PD). Accelerometer and electromyographic signals of hand movement from standardized upper extremity movement tests (resting, holding, carrying weight) were extracted from 13 PD and 11 ET patients. The signals were filtered to remove noise and non-tremor high frequency components. A set of statistical features was then extracted from the discrete wavelet transformation of the signals. Principal component analysis was utilized to reduce dimensionality of the feature space. Classification was performed using support vector machines. We evaluated the proposed method using leave one out cross validation and we report overall accuracy of the classification. With this method, it was possible to discriminate 12/13 PD patients from 8/11 patients with ET with an overall accuracy of 83%. In order to individualize this finding for clinical application we generated a posterior probability for the test result of each patient and compared the misclassified patients, or low probability scores to available clinical follow up information for individual cases. This non-standardized post hoc analysis revealed that not only the technical accuracy but also the clinical accuracy limited the overall classification rate. We show that, in addition to the successful isolation of diagnostic features, longitudinal and larger sized validation is needed in order to prove clinical applicability.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, chronic disease that many patients live with for many years. In this work we propose a mHealth approach based on a set of unobtrusive, simple-in-use, off-the-self, co-operative, mobile devices that will be used for motor and non-motor symptoms monitoring and evaluation, as well as for the detection of fluctuations along with their duration through a waking day. Ideally, a multidisciplinary and integrated care approach involving several professionals working together (neurologists, physiotherapists, psychologists and nutritionists) could provide a holistic management of the disease increasing the patient's independence and Quality of Life (QoL). To address these needs we describe also an ecosystem for the management of both motor and non-motor symptoms on PD facilitating the collaboration of health professionals and empowering the patients to self-manage their condition. This would allow not only a better monitoring of PD patients but also a better understanding of the disease progression.",

    "abstract": "The development of wearable sensors has opened the door for long-term assessment of movement disorders. However, there is still a need for developing methods suitable to monitor motor symptoms in and outside the clinic. The purpose of this paper was to investigate deep learning as a method for this monitoring. Deep learning recently broke records in speech and image classification, but it has not been fully investigated as a potential approach to analyze wearable sensor data. We collected data from ten patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease using inertial measurement units. Several motor tasks were expert-labeled and used for classification. We specifically focused on the detection of bradykinesia. For this, we compared standard machine learning pipelines with deep learning based on convolutional neural networks. Our results showed that deep learning outperformed other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms by at least 4.6 % in terms of classification rate. We contribute a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of deep learning for sensor-based movement assessment and conclude that deep learning is a promising method for this field.",

    "abstract": "Technological developments have seen the miniaturization of sensors, small enough to be embedded in wearable devices facilitating unobtrusive and longitudinal monitoring in free-living environments. Concurrently, the advances in algorithms have been ad-hoc and fragmented. To advance the mainstream use of wearable technology and improved functionality of algorithms all methodologies must be unified and robustly tested within controlled and free-living conditions. Here we present and unify a (i) gait segmentation and analysis algorithm and (ii) a fall detection algorithm. We tested the unified algorithms on a cohort of young healthy adults within a laboratory. We then deployed the algorithms on longitudinal (7 day) accelerometer-based data from an older adult with Parkinson's disease (PD) to quantify real world gait and falls. We compared instrumented falls to a self-reported falls diary to test algorithm efficiency and discuss the use of unified algorithms to impact free-living assessment in PD where accurate recognition of gait may reduce the number of automated detected falls (38/week). This informs ongoing work to use gait and related outcomes as pragmatic clinical markers.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability is one of the predominant symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite its significant impact on the deterioration in quality of life in PD patients, mechanistic causes of the instability have not been clarified. Joint inflexibility at ankle and hip joints might be such a major cause, leading to small variability in the center of pressure (CoP) during quiet stance. However, this conjecture is still controversial. Thus, quantitative characterization of CoP patterns during quiet stance in PD patients remains a matter of research. Here we performed a linear discriminant analysis for CoP data in PD patients and age-matched healthy elderly during quiet stance, and showed that CoP variations in PD patients and those in healthy elderly could be well distinguished with an accuracy of about 90%, to which appropriately selected sway indices characterizing aspects of power spectrum for the CoP variations contributed. Specifically, major factors responsible for the discrimination were all associated with increase in the power at a high-frequency band (near and over 1 Hz) along with reduction at the low-frequency regime (lower than about 0.7 Hz). Then, the power-ratio, defined as the relative spectral power in a band around 1 Hz, was examined, since the power in this band reflects postural sway with anti-phase coordinated motions of the ankle and hip joints. We showed that the power-ratio values were significantly smaller in the PD patients than those in the healthy subjects. This difference as well as the results of the linear discriminant analysis suggest joint inflexibility in PD patients, particularly at hip joint, which diminished anti-phase coordination between trunk and lower extremity, leading to postural instability in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Apathy, one of the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), has been associated with reduced daily functioning, cognition, treatment compliance, quality of life, and increased caregiver burden and distress, among other outcomes.\nThe purpose of the present study was to develop and gather pilot data on the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the Parkinson's Active Living (PAL) program, to our knowledge, the first behavioral treatment specifically designed to target apathy in patients with PD. The Parkinson's Active Living is a primarily telephone-based, 6-week activity scheduling and monitoring intervention that incorporates external cueing to target disease-related self-generational deficits to reduce levels of apathy in nondemented, highly apathetic patients with PD.\nParticipants aged 44 to 86 years (mean = 66, SD [standard deviation] = 10.7) ranging in disease duration from <1 to 23 years with elevated apathy (Apathy Evaluation Scale >35) were enrolled in a 1-arm trial and tested at 3 time points (baseline, posttest, and 1-month follow-up).\nFeasibility aspects (ie, acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, adaptation, integration, and expansion) and efficacy of PAL program are reported. Matched pairs t tests showed a medium to large effect of treatment on patient apathy (52% showing \u22651 SD improvement), depression (33% showing \u22651 SD improvement), and quality of life at posttest, with improvements in apathy and depression maintained at follow-up.\nThe program may hold promise as an effective nonpharmacological intervention for apathy in PD. Implications and future directions are discussed. Randomized controlled trials are needed.",

    "abstract": "In patients with motor fluctuations complicating Parkinson's disease (PD), delays in time-to-ON with levodopa are common. This open-label study aimed to assess the effect of apomorphine on time-to-ON in PD patients with morning akinesia.\nThe safety population included 127 enrolled patients, and the full analysis set (FAS) included 88 patients. Patients completed a 7-day levodopa baseline period recording their time-to-ON following each morning dose of levodopa. Patients were titrated to an optimal dose of apomorphine (2-6 mg) while taking trimethobenzamide antiemetic therapy. Apomorphine was injected each morning for a 7-day treatment period and time-to-ON was self-recorded in 5-minute blocks. The primary efficacy variable was time-to-ON in the apomorphine treatment period versus the baseline levodopa period. Secondary assessments included and global impression scales. Safety and tolerability were assessed through adverse events (AEs).\nPatients receiving apomorphine achieved mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) time-to-ON 23.72 \u00b1 14.55 minutes, reduced from 60.86 \u00b1 18.11 minutes with levodopa (\nApomorphine injections significantly reduced time-to-ON in PD patients experiencing delayed onset of their morning levodopa dose, and was well tolerated in most patients.

    "abstract": "Mental disturbances have been described in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Of these, the common conditions are delirium and psychosis. Delirium has been attributed to change of environment, especially hospital stay and infections; while psychosis is due to drugs like dopamine agonists. This is a case of a 75-year-old male, on levodopa therapy for PD, who presented with delirium and ended up with a cocktail diagnosis: Cryptococcal meningitis, Hashimoto's Encephalopathy (HE), Urinary tract infection with acute renal failure, Uremic encephalopathy and Levodopa induced psychosis. This case report, therefore, highlights the need to look for other causes of delirium in a patient with PD who is on levodopa therapy.",

    "abstract": "Striatal neurons can be either projection neurons or interneurons, with each type exhibiting distinct susceptibility to various types of brain damage. In this study, 6-hydroxydopamine was injected into the right medial forebrain bundle to induce dopamine depletion, and/or ibotenic acid was injected into the M1 cortex to induce motor cortex lesions. Immunohistochemistry and western blot assay showed that dopaminergic depletion results in significant loss of striatal projection neurons marked by dopamine- and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein, molecular weight 32 kDa, calbindin, and \u03bc-opioid receptor, while cortical lesions reversed these pathological changes. After dopaminergic deletion, the number of neuropeptide Y-positive striatal interneurons markedly increased, which was also inhibited by cortical lesioning. No noticeable change in the number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons was found in 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rats. Striatal projection neurons and interneurons show different susceptibility to dopaminergic depletion. Further, cortical lesions inhibit striatal dysfunction and damage induced by 6-hydroxydopamine, which provides a new possibility for clinical treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Research in the last decade strongly suggests that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-mediated therapeutic benefits are mainly due to their secretome, which has been proposed as a possible therapeutic tool for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Indeed, it has been shown that the MSC secretome increases neurogenesis and cell survival, and has numerous neuroprotective actions under different conditions. Additionally, using dynamic culturing conditions (through computer-controlled bioreactors) can further modulate the MSC secretome, thereby generating a more potent neurotrophic factor cocktail (i.e., conditioned medium). In this study, we have characterized the MSC secretome by proteomic-based analysis, investigating its therapeutic effects on the physiological recovery of a 6-hydroxidopamine (6-OHDA) PD rat model. For this purpose, we injected MSC secretome into the substantia nigra (SNc) and striatum (STR), characterizing the behavioral performance and determining histological parameters for injected animals versus untreated groups. We observed that the secretome potentiated the increase of dopaminergic neurons (i.e., tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells) and neuronal terminals in the SNc and STR, respectively, thereby supporting the recovery observed in the Parkinsonian rats' motor performance outcomes (assessed by rotarod and staircase tests). Finally, proteomic characterization of the MSC secretome (through combined mass spectrometry analysis and Bioplex assays) revealed the presence of important neuroregulatory molecules, namely cystatin C, glia-derived nexin, galectin-1, pigment epithelium-derived factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin-6, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Overall, we concluded that the use of human MSC secretome alone was able to partially revert the motor phenotype and the neuronal structure of 6-OHDA PD animals. This indicates that the human MSC secretome could represent a novel therapeutic for the treatment of PD. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2017;6:634-646.",

    "abstract": "Epimedium sagittatum is a traditional Chinese herb normally which is used to treat the osteoporosis, cardiovascular dysfunction, and to improve neurological and sexual function in China, Korea and Japan. Icariin is the major active ingredient in Epimedium sagittatum. In the present research, we examined the neuroprotective effects of icariin on dopaminergic neurons and the possible mechanisms in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nOvariectomized PD mice were treated with vehicle or icariin (3 days before MPTP injections) with or without the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059. The dopamine (DA) content in the striatum was studied by HPLC. Western blot was used to determine the protein expressions of Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase 3 in the striatum. The numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) neurons in the substantial nigra pars compacta (SNpc) were assessed by immunohistochemistry. The activation of Akt and ERK by icariin were detected in doparminergic MES23.5 cells.\nIcariin pretreatment could ameliorate the decreased striatum DA content and the loss of TH-IR neurons in the SNpc induced by MPTP. The MPTP-induced changes of Bcl-2, Bax and caspase 3 protein expressions in the striatum could be reversed by icariin pretreatment. Blockade of PI3K/Akt or MEK/ERK signaling pathway by LY294002 or PD98059 could attenuate the increase of DA content in the striatum and TH-IR in the SNpc induced by icariin in PD mice model. Additionally, icariin treatment alone significantly induced the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK in a time dependent pattern in dopaminergic MES 23.5 cells. These effects were abolished by co-treatment with LY294002 or PD98059.\nThese data demonstrated that icariin has neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons in PD mice model and the potential mechanisms might be related to PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurological disorder that directly affects human gait. It leads to slowness of movement, causes muscle rigidity and tremors. Analyzing human gait serves to be useful in studies aiming at early recognition of the disease. In this paper we perform a comparative analysis of various nature inspired algorithms to select optimal features/variables required for aiding in the classification of affected patients from the rest.\nFor the experiments, we use a real life dataset of 166 people containing both healthy controls and affected people. Following the optimal feature selection process, the dataset is then classified using a neural network.\nThe experimental results show Binary Bat Algorithm outperformed traditional techniques like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm and Modified Cuckoo Search Algorithm with a competitive recognition rate on the dataset of selected features. We compare this through different criteria like cross-validated accuracies, true positive rates, false positive rates, positive predicted values and negative predicted values.",

    "abstract": "[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between manual dexterity and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Motor Exam as a clinical tool for quantifying upper extremity function in persons with Parkinson's disease. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-two persons with idiopathic Parkinson's disease participated in this study. This study measured two clinical outcomes, the box-and-block test and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Motor Exam, to investigate the relationships between manual dexterity and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Motor Exam. [Results] The box-and-block test on the more affected side was positive relationship with the box-and-block test on the less affected side. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-motor exam score had a negative correlation with the box-and-block test results for both sides. [Conclusion] A positive association was noted between manual dexterity and motor function in patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease. The results of this study suggest that the box-and-block test and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Motor Exam are good clinical measures that quantify upper extremity function and are necessary for the accurate evaluation of patients and to plan intervention strategies.",

All patients with pure autonomic failure, most patients with multiple system atrophy, and 18% of patients with PD will develop symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. However, the extent of central and peripheral norepinephrine deficiency, parasympathetic nuclei degeneration, and arterial baroreflex failure may be differentially impaired in these disorders. Consequently, clinical features and prognostic implications of autonomic dysfunction in a\u2010synucleinopathies may be more complex than previously envisioned. The case described in this report highlights the clinical similarities between PD and pure autonomic failure, raising the question of whether pure autonomic failure represents a restricted Lewy body synucleinopathy or an early manifestation of PD.",

However, the effects of an inpatient rehabilitation program for advanced Parkinson's disease have not been fully investigated.\nTo assess the effects of intensive inpatient rehabilitation.\nWe enrolled 31 patients (mean age 69.5 \u00b1 9.4 years; mean disease duration 8.8 \u00b1 6.4 years) with advanced Parkinson's disease, without severe cognitive impairment. The median Hoehn-Yahr stage was IV. Patients received 2 h of individualized rehabilitation for 6-7 days each week for 1 month. At hospital discharge, patients and caregivers were instructed to continue daily exercise.\nMotor and total scores of Functional Independence Measures significantly improved between admission and discharge in patients with stage III and IV disease, but not stage V. There was no significant effect of Hoehn-Yahr stage on improvements in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores, (total, part I, II or III), cognitive Functional Independence Measures or Berg Balance Scale.\nIntensive inpatient rehabilitation was effective even in advanced Parkinson's disease. Intensive inpatient rehabilitation, together with home and day-care exercise, might counteract the progressive motor decline in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a brief, episodic phenomenon affecting over half of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and leads to significant morbidity. The pathophysiology of FOG remains poorly understood but is associated with deficits in cognitive function and motor preparation.\nWe studied 20 people with PD (10 with FOG, 10 without FOG) and performed a timed response target detection task while electroencephalographic data were acquired. We analysed the data to detect and examine cortical markers of cognitive decision making (P3b or centroparietal positivity, CPP) and motor readiness potential. We analysed current source density (CSD) to increase spatial resolution and allow identification of distinct signals.\nThere was no difference in the P3b/CPP response between people with PD with and without FOG, suggesting equivalent cognitive processing with respect to decision-making. However, the FOG group had significant difference with an earlier onset and larger amplitude of the lateralized readiness potential. Furthermore, the amplitude of the lateralised readiness potential correlated strongly with total Frontal Assessment Battery score.\nThe difference in lateralized readiness potentials may reflect excessive recruitment of lateral premotor areas to compensate for dysfunction of the supplementary motor area and resultant loss of automatic motor control. This early, excessive recruitment of frontal networks occurs in spite of equivalent motor scores and reaction times between groups.\nThe saturation of frontal processing mechanisms could help explain deficits in attentional set-shifting, dual-tasking and response inhibition which are frequently reported in FOG.",

The essay interrogates the historically situated value-laden assumptions about character traits thought to be correlated with neuro-molecular variations measured in the brain. The epistemological security of the bio-psychological model is examined in the light of patients' own interpretations of their cognitive experiences of creativity, and the meaning of their feeling \"emergent\" as contrasted to the experience of a static human existence.",

    "abstract": "Safranal, a major constituent of saffron, possesses antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties showing considerable neuroprotective effects. However, whether safranal shows therapeutic effect on Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential effect of safranal on PD using an in vitro model of PD induced by rotenone. We found that safranal significantly inhibited rotenone-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, safranal also markedly suppressed the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cell apoptosis induced by rotenone. Further investigation showed that safranal inhibited the expression of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and promoted the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in rotenone-induced dopaminergic neurons. Meanwhile, the downstream antioxidant enzyme genes of Nrf2 including glutathione S transferase (GST), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLc), NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase1 (HO-1) were also induced by safranal in rotenone-induced dopaminergic neurons. However, the knockdown of Nrf2 significantly abrogated the protective effect of safranal on rotenone-induced neurotoxicity. Taken together, our study suggests that safranal protects against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity associated with Nrf2 signaling pathway implying that safranal may serve as a potent and promising therapeutic drug for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a consequence of the severe neurodegenerative process and are characterized by the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, aggravation of non-motor symptoms. Treatment with peroral and transdermal drugs can't provide an adequate control of PD symptoms and quality-of-life of the patients at this stage of disease. Currently, three device-aided therapies: deep brain stimulation (DBS), intrajejunal infusion of duodopa, subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine can be used in treatment of patients with advanced stages of PD. Timely administration of device-aided therapies and right choice of the method determine, to a large extent, the efficacy and safety of their use. Despite the high efficacy of all three methods with respect to the fluctuation of separate symptoms, each method has its own peculiarities. The authors reviewed the data on the expediency of using each method according to the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms, patient's age, PD duration, concomitant pathology and social support of

    "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy of bilateral electrical stimulation (ES) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) after preceding pallidotomy or ventrolateral (VL) thalamotomy.\nThe study included 9 patients with bilateral STN ES who had undergone previous unilateral destructive surgery on the subcortical structures: pallidotomy (5 patients) and VL thalamotomy (4). A control group consisted of 9 patients with STN ES, without prior destructive surgery. A clinical and neurological examination included quantitative assessment of motor disturbances using the Hoehn-Yahr scale and Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS). UPDRS was used to evaluate the motor activity (IIIrd part of the scale) and severity of drug-induced dyskinesia and motor fluctuations (IVth part of the scale).\nIn the group of STN ES with preceding destruction of the subcortical structures, an improvement in motor functions in the early period (6 months) was 45%, and severity of drug-induced complications was decreased by 75%. In a group of STN DBS without destruction, motor disturbances were improved by 61%, and drug-induced complications were decreased by 77%. Improvement in motor functions amounted to 51.9% in patients with preceding pallidotomy (GPi destruction) and 37.5% in a group with preceding VL thalamotomy. The equivalent dose of levodopa was reduced by 51.39%, from 1,008\u00b1346 to 490\u00b1194, in the study group and by 55.04%, from 963\u00b196 to 433\u00b1160, in the control group.\nBilateral STN neurostimulation is effective after unilateral stereotaxic destruction of the subcortical structures in PD patients.\n\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Although the precise pathogenetic mechanisms of PD remain undetermined, there appears to be both genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the risk of developing PD. With regard to environmental risk factors, there has been significant interest related to the role of diet, nutrition, and nutrients on the onset and progression of PD. As the current treatments are predominantly focused on symptomatic management, efforts must be directed toward prevention of the PD and identification of potentially modifiable risk and preventive factors. This comprehensive review gives an overview of studies examining the role of micronutrients in PD, and provides guidance on the value of the reported outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Drinking caffeinated coffee has been reported to provide protection against Parkinson's disease (PD). Caffeine is an adenosine A2A receptor (encoded by the gene ADORA2A) antagonist that increases dopaminergic neurotransmission and Cytochrome P450 1A2 (gene: CYP1A2) metabolizes caffeine; thus, gene polymorphisms in ADORA2A and CYP1A2 may influence the effect coffee consumption has on PD risk.\nIn a population-based case-control study (PASIDA) in Denmark (1,556 PD patients and 1,606 birth year- and gender-matched controls), we assessed interactions between lifetime coffee consumption and 3 polymorphisms in ADORA2A and CYP1A2 for all subjects, and incident and prevalent PD cases separately using logistic regression models. We also conducted a meta-analysis combining our results with those from previous studies.\nWe estimated statistically significant interactions for ADORA2A rs5760423 and heavy vs. light coffee consumption in incident (OR interaction = 0.66 [95% CI 0.46-0.94], p = 0.02) but not prevalent PD. We did not observe interactions for CYP1A2 rs762551 and rs2472304 in incident or prevalent PD. In meta-analyses, PD associations with daily coffee consumption were strongest among carriers of variant alleles in both ADORA2A and CYP1A2.\nWe corroborated results from a previous report that described interactions between ADORA2A and CYP1A2 polymorphisms and coffee consumption. Our results also suggest that survivor bias may affect results of studies that enroll prevalent PD cases.",

    "abstract": "MRI brain changes in Parkinson's disease (PD) are controversial.\nWe aimed to describe structural and functional changes in PD.\nSixty-six patients with PD (57.94\u2009\u00b1\u200910.25\u2009years) diagnosed according to the UK Brain Bank criteria were included. We performed a whole brain analysis using voxel-based morphometry (VBM-SPM 8 software), cortical thickness (CT) using CIVET, and resting-state fMRI using the Neuroimaging Analysis Kit software to compare patients and controls. For VBM and CT we classified subjects into three groups according to disease severity: mild PD [Hoehn and Yahr scale (HY) 1-1.5], moderate PD (HY 2-2.5), and severe PD (HY 3-5).\nWe observed gray matter atrophy in the insula and inferior frontal gyrus in the moderate PD and in the insula, frontal gyrus, putamen, cingulated, and paracingulate gyri in the severe groups. In the CT analysis, in mild PD, cortical thinning was restricted to the superior temporal gyrus, gyrus rectus, and olfactory cortex; in the moderate group, the postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, and inferior frontal gyrus were also affected; in the severe PD, areas such as the precentral and postentral gyrus, temporal pole, fusiform, and occipital gyrus had reduced cortical thinning. We observed altered connectivity at the default mode, visual, sensorimotor, and cerebellar networks.\nSubjects with mild symptoms already have cortical involvement; however, further cerebral involvement seems to follow Braak's proposed mechanism. Similar regions are affected both structurally and functionally. We believe the combination of different MRI techniques may be useful in evaluating progressive brain involvement and they may eventually be used as surrogate markers of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the stratium, are the hallmarks of the disease. Numerous studies have shown that dysfunctions of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and oxidative stress are associated with sPD development. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, constantly undergoing processes of fusion and fission. Shape of mitochondrial network is modified in accordance to cellular needs and external stimuli. Growing number of evidence show the presence of disturbances of mitochondrial dynamics in sPD. The aim of this article is to summarize recent data concerning role of mitochondrial dynamics in sPD pathogenesis.\nSporadyczna forma choroby Parkinsona (sPD) jest jedn\u0105 z najcz\u0119\u015bciej wyst\u0119puj\u0105cych chor\u00f3b neurodegeneracyjnych.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by motor dysfunction and cognitive decline, may demonstrate specific patterns of brain atrophy. Although cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies show correlation between regional brain volume loss and cognitive impairment, there is only scarce evidence from longitudinal studies validating the link between cognition and brain anatomy in PD.\nTo test the relationship between magnitude and spatial extent of atrophy in PD patients with progressive, significant cognitive decline and dementia (PDD).\nWe followed thirty-three initially non-demented patients with prevalent PD for three years while monitoring cognitive function and brain atrophy. Longitudinally acquired T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were analyzed in the voxel-based morphometry framework of SPM.\nGroups did not differ significantly with respect to age or gender. More males developed PDD (7 males, 3 females) compared to those remaining intact (12 males, 11 females). Clusters of lower grey matter volume were found in PDD compared to PD in left uncus at baseline and an expanded region that included the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus at 36months. The cognitive status by scan interaction showed differential changes between groups in the right insula. At a more liberal statistical threshold we observed changes in the right insula and bilateral hippocampi as well as the right cuneus additional to the lower brain stem.\nRegion specific atrophy, consistent with the pattern of cortical Lewy body deposition seen in autopsy studies, can be detected with MRI in PD patients with significant cognitive decline. MRI may be useful for tracking cognitive decline in PD.",

However, there is still little understanding of the nature, and variations of severity of this symptom.\nTo evaluate the severity of nocturnal hypokinesia and sleep positions in PD patients using multisite wearable sensors.\nNocturnal parameters and sleep positions in 18 PD couples were assessed and compared using wearable sensors (limbs and trunk) for one night in their homes. Nocturnal parameters included number, velocity, acceleration, degree, limb movements and the number of times they got out of bed.\nPD patients had significantly fewer episodes of turns in bed than their spouses (p=0.043), which was associated with significantly slower speed (p=0.005), acceleration (p=0.005) and fewer degrees (p=0.017).

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) was recognized associated with both familial and sporadic Parkinson Disease (PD). Seven missense mutations (G2019S, R1441C, R1441G, R1441H, Y1699C, I2020T, N1437H) of it have been confirmed disease- causing. They were common among Caucasian PD patients, but rarely reported in Asian, especially in Chinese Han population.\nWe aimed to identify the frequencies of these seven mutations of LRRK2 in Chinese early-onset PD (EOPD) patients and analyze the phenotypes.\nOne hundred and thirty seven EOPD patients were enrolled for genetic testing. The seven disease-causing mutations of LRRK2 were carried out by target sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer. The identified variants were further confirmed by Sanger sequence. The clinical materials were investigated retrospectively.\nOnly one patient (0.73%) was found carrying pathogenetic LRRK2 mutation of R1441C. The age at onset of the female patient was 44. She manifested typical motor symptoms of PD and responded well to levodopa therapy. Longitudinal evaluation showed progression of motor symptoms and depression but no cognitive impairment. The dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging via [11C]-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-fluorophenyl) tropan (CFT) and Positron emission computed tomography (PET) revealed typical dopamine transporter uptake reduction.\nThe LRRK2 R1441C mutation was found in a Chinese EOPD patient for the first time. The manifestations of LRRK2-R1441C carriers were indistinguishable from sporadic PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Experimental, neuropathological and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies support \u03c4 and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) relevance in Parkinson's disease (PD) related dementia. Lesser motor fluctuations (MFs) and non-motor features have also been related to PD-dementia. Yet, little is known about the association of MFs and non-motor symptoms with CSF \u03c4 and A\u03b2 in PD. We hypothesized that lesser MFs and non-motor predominance are related to these CSF markers and dementia-risk in PD. We studied 58 PD patients (dementia at baseline, n=21; dementia at 18-months, n=35) in whom CSF A\u03b2 and \u03c4 had been determined with ELISA techniques. MFs and a number of non-motor symptoms (apathy, anxiety, irritability, depression, visual hallucinations, spatial disorientation, memory complaints) over disease course were dichotomized as absent-mild vs. moderate-severe by retrospective clinical chart review blind to CSF findings. Non-motor predominance was defined as \u22653 non-motor symptoms (after the cohort-median of non-motor symptoms per patient) with \u22652 being moderate-severe and \u22651 having been present from onset, with all these being more disabling overall than motor features. Cross-sectionally, CSF biomarkers were non-parametrically compared according to dichotomized MFs and non-motor predominance. Longitudinally, dementia was the outcome (dependent variable), CSF markers, MFs and non-motor predominance were the predictors (independent variables), and potential modifiers as age, sex, and memory complaints were the covariates in binary regression models. Absent-mild MFs were associated with higher CSF \u03c4 markers and shorter time-to-dementia, while non-motor predominance and decreasing CSF A\u03b2 independently increased longitudinal dementia-risk. In summary, absent-mild MFs, non-motor predominance and CSF \u03c4 and A\u03b2 might define endophenotypes related to the timing or risk of dementia in PD.",

The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), Charlson Index (CI), Comorbidity-Polypharmacy Score (CPS) and Elixhauser Comorbidity Measure (ECM) were used to assess comorbidity at baseline and at 3years. Forty-four AD patients and 44 control subjects were included as comparator groups.\nTotal number of comorbidities (ICD-10) and polypharmacy at baseline were higher in PD and AD patients than controls (4.4\u00b12.3 vs 5.2\u00b12.4 vs 3.4\u00b11.9 [p=0.001] and 81.6% vs 75% vs 56.8% [p=0.003], respectively). Diseases of the circulatory system (ICD-10/chapter-IX) and endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (ICD-10/chapter-IV) were the most frequent in all groups. There was a significant increase in comorbidity (mean, +1.6\u00b12.8) in all groups (p<0.0001) without differences between them. Seventeen patients died and 8 cases were did not follow-up. Comorbidity was a predictor of death in PD patients after adjust for other covariates (including age, sex, disease duration, disease stage, motor status and non-motor symptoms): ICD-10 (total number of comorbidities), hazard ratio 1.285 (95% confidence interval, 1.047-1.577; p=0.017); CI, hazard ratio 1.462 (95% confidence interval, 1.045-2.047; p=0.027).\nComorbidity is frequent in PD patients, increases significantly over time and predicts mortality.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, with neuropsychiatric manifestations among the most frequent non-motor symptoms. Health-related quality of life is a patient-reported outcome that reflects the impact of the disease on physical, mental, and social wellbeing, and on other aspects of patient' life. Although older studies on health-related quality of life in Parkinson's disease mainly investigated the role of the motor impairment, recent research focused on non-motor symptoms has highlighted the critical role that behavioural disturbances due to neuropsychiatric symptoms play in determining health related quality of life. A considerable number of studies have demonstrated the importance of depression as a determinant of health-related quality of life in this population, but less evidence is available regarding the role of other neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, apathy, psychosis, and impulse control disorders. This narrative review analyses recent literature on this topic, focusing on studies in which neuropsychiatric symptoms were investigated as potential determinants of quality of life using regression techniques, including discussion of the assessment tools used.",

    "abstract": "IPX066 (Rytary\u00ae; carbidopa and levodopa [CD-LD] extended-release capsules) was designed to achieve therapeutic LD plasma concentrations within 1h of dosing and maintain LD concentrations for a prolonged duration in early or advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).\nIn this open-label study, patients underwent 6weeks of conversion to IPX066 from their prior controlled-release (CR)\u00b1immediate-release (IR) CD-LD therapy and 6months of maintenance (with an additional 6months of IPX066 at some sites). Clinical utility was assessed at both the end of conversion and maintenance.\nAmong 43 patients initiated on IPX066, 33 completed conversion. The mean LD conversion ratio was 1.8 among 30 patients previously on CR plus IR (and 1.5 among 3 previously taking CR alone). The mean IPX066 dosing frequency was 3.5times/day compared with 2.6times/day for CR plus 4.6times/day for IR previously (and 4.7times/day for CR alone). By patient and clinician global improvement ratings after 6-month maintenance, \u226543.8% of patients were much or very much improved from their previous treatment, and \u226568.8% were at least minimally improved. Adverse events were consistent with those reported in prior IPX066 studies.\nThese results suggest that advanced PD patients using CR CD-LD\u00b1IR can be safely converted to IPX066, with high likelihood of achieving a stable regimen, less frequent LD dosing, and improved overall clinical benefit.\nClinicaltrials.govNCT01411137.",

    "abstract": "To assess the psychometric properties of a Norwegian translation of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) for use in populations of headache, Parkinson's disease (PD), and healthy controls.\nThe BIS-11 was forward and backward translated by native speakers of both Norwegian and English to give Norwegian BIS-11 (Nor-BIS-11). A convenience sample (110 subjects) of healthy controls (47), PD patients (43), and chronic headache patients (20) (the latter two recruited from a Neurology outpatient clinic), were asked to complete the scale (a subset twice for test-retest). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were done for a single-factor model, the original three-factor model and a two-factor model. Test-retest results were analyzed using the Bland-Altman approach.\nThe Nor-BIS-11 scale showed good utility and acceptability as well as good test-retest reliability in this sample. Cronbach's \u03b1 was .68, test-retest bias was -0.73, Cohen's \u03b4\u00a0=\u00a0-.134, and limits of agreement were -11.48 to 10.01. The factor structure was found to fit better with a two-factor model than with the original model with three factors. The model fit indices indicated a moderate fit.\nThe Nor-BIS-11 scale is acceptable and reliable to use in Parkinson's disease patients, chronic headache patients, and healthy controls. The results should be interpreted in a two-factor model but with caution due to low construct validity. External validity needs to be further tested.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) usually emerges with a unilateral side-of-onset (left-onset: LOPD; right-onset: ROPD; Marinus & van Hilten, 2015) due to an asymmetrical degeneration of striatal dopaminergic neurons (Donnemiller et\u00a0al., \nThirty ROPD and 14 LOPD cases were drawn from a Boston clinic specializing in PD. Various cognitive and neuropsychological measures were used in an attempt to discover if there were indeed any differences between LOPD and ROPD in this cohort.\nFor LOPD, duration of illness was found to be significantly greater than that of ROPD. However, further testing was able to confirm that despite this difference, it was not the cause of the other significant differences found. Furthermore, this increased duration was consistent with a previous study (Munhoz et\u00a0al., \nClear and significant differences between LOPD and ROPD were found within our cohort. LOPD showed greater impairment of working memory, greater anxiety, and greater duration of illness-all independent of one another; whereas, those with ROPD had greater magical ideation, also independent of any other variables.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of coverage depth in next-generation sequencing data allows the detection of gene dose alterations. We explore the frequency of such structural events in a Spanish cohort of sporadic PD cases.\nGene dose alterations were detected with the eXome-Hidden Markov Model (XHMM) software from depth of coverage in resequencing data available for 38 Mendelian and other risk PD loci in 394 individuals (249 cases and 145 controls) and subsequently validated by quantitative PCR.\nWe identified 10 PD patients with exon dosage alterations in PARK2, GBA-GBAP1, and DJ1. Additional functional variants, including 2 novel nonsense mutations (p.Arg1552Ter in LRRK2 and p.Trp90Ter in PINK1), were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. This combined approach disclosed the genetic cause of 12 PD cases.\nGene dose alterations related to PD can be correctly identified from targeting resequencing data. This approach substantially improves the detection rate of cases with causal genetic alterations. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

    "abstract": "The incidence rate of Parkinson's disease (PD) is \u22642% in Chinese individuals >65 years old, accounting for 40% of the global total of PD patients. The pathogenesis of PD is not yet clear, and oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is considered to be the main reason for the onset of PD. Studies have shown that matrine exhibits good antioxidant activity. Thus, the present study aimed to observe the protective effect and mechanism of matrine on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neuron damage. A total of 25 C57BL male mice were randomly divided into 5 groups, consisting of the control group (group A), the MPTP group (group B) and three matrine (4, 8 and 16 mg/kg) plus MPTP treatment groups (groups C, D and E, respectively). Results from a pole-climbing test and locomotor activity experiments were recorded. The mice were sacrificed 4 days later and brain dissection was performed. The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) were assessed. The expression level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the ventral midbrain was studied by immunofluorescence analysis. The expression level of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the ventral midbrain was studied by western blot analysis. The experiments were repeated three times. Compared with control mice, the PD mice exhibited the typical behaviors associated with PD; matrine can alleviate this phenomenon, and with increasing matrine concentration, the symptoms were reduced significantly. Compared with the control mice, the PD mice had lower SOD and GSH activity, and matrine partially reversed the change in SOD and GSH activity. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the level of TH in the ventral midbrain decreased significantly in the PD mice, and that the mice administered matrine showed higher expression of TH and levels of TH-positive cells. Western blotting results showed that the expression of Nrf2 in the ventral midbrain decreased significantly in the PD mice, and that matrine was able to reverse this phenomenon. In conclusion, by promoting antioxidant-related Nrf2 signaling pathways in the ventral midbrain, matrine can inhibit the oxidative damage of dopamine neurons in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterised by degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein and motor symptoms. Current dopamine-replacement strategies provide symptomatic relief, however their effectiveness wear off over time and their prolonged use leads to disabling side-effects in PD patients. There is therefore a critical need to develop new drugs and drug targets to protect dopaminergic neurons and their axons from degeneration in PD. Over recent years, there has been robust evidence generated showing that epigenetic dysregulation occurs in PD patients, and that epigenetic modulation is a promising therapeutic approach for PD. This article first discusses the present evidence implicating global, and dopaminergic neuron-specific, alterations in the methylome in PD, and the therapeutic potential of pharmacologically targeting the methylome. It then focuses on another mechanism of epigenetic regulation, histone acetylation, and describes how the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes that mediate this process are attractive therapeutic targets for PD. It discusses the use of activators and/or inhibitors of HDACs and HATs in models of PD, and how these approaches for the selective modulation of histone acetylation elicit neuroprotective effects. Finally, it outlines the potential of employing small molecule epigenetic modulators as neuroprotective therapies for PD, and the future research that will be required to determine and realise this therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "The quest for neuroprotective drugs to slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), has been largely unrewarding. Preclinical evidence suggests that repurposing quetiapine, lithium, valproate, fluoxetine, donepezil, and memantine for early and pre-symptomatic disease-modification in NDDs may be promising and can spare regulatory barriers. The literature of these psychotropics in early stage and pre-symptomatic AD, PD, and HD is reviewed and propitious findings follow. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase of AD: salutary human randomized controlled trial findings for low-dose lithium and, in selected patients, donepezil await replication. Pre-symptomatic AD: human epidemiological data indicate that lithium reduces AD risk. Animal model studies (AMS) reveal encouraging results for quetiapine, lithium, donepezil, and memantine. Early PD: valproate AMS findings show promise. Pre-symptomatic PD: lithium and valproate AMS findings are encouraging. Early HD: uncontrolled clinical data indicate non-progression with lithium, fluoxetine, donepezil, and memantine. Pre-symptomatic HD: lithium and valproate are auspicious in AMS. Many other promising findings awaiting replication (valproate in MCI; lithium, valproate, fluoxetine in pre-symptomatic AD; lithium in early PD; lithium, valproate, fluoxetine in pre-symptomatic PD; donepezil in early HD; lithium, fluoxetine, memantine in pre-symptomatic HD) are reviewed. Dose- and stage-dependent effects are considered. Suggestions for signal-enhancement in human trials are provided for each NDD stage.",

    "abstract": "Recently, it has been demonstrated that bicycling ability remains surprisingly preserved in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who suffer from freezing of gait. Cycling has been also proposed as a therapeutic means of treating PD symptoms, with some preliminary success. The neural mechanisms behind these phenomena are however not yet understood. One of the reasons is that the investigations of neuronal activity during pedaling have been up to now limited to PET and fMRI studies, which restrict the temporal resolution of analysis, and to scalp EEG focused on cortical activation. However, deeper brain structures like the basal ganglia are also associated with control of voluntary motor movements like cycling and are affected by PD. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes implanted for therapy in PD patients provide rare and unique access to directly record basal ganglia activity with a very high temporal resolution. In this paper we present an experimental setup allowing combined investigation of basal ganglia local field potentials (LFPs) and scalp EEG underlying bicycling in PD patients. The main part of the setup is a bike simulator consisting of a classic Dutch-style bicycle frame mounted on a commercially available ergometer. The pedal resistance is controllable in real-time by custom software and the pedal position is continuously tracked by custom Arduino-based electronics using optical and magnetic sensors. A portable bioamplifier records the pedal position signal, the angle of the knee, and the foot pressure together with EEG, EMG, and basal ganglia LFPs. A handlebar-mounted display provides additional information for patients riding the bike simulator, including the current and target pedaling rate. In order to demonstrate the utility of the setup, example data from pilot recordings are shown. The presented experimental setup provides means to directly record basal ganglia activity not only during cycling but also during other movement tasks in patients who have undergone DBS treatment. Thus, it can facilitate studies comparing bicycling and walking, to elucidate why PD patients often retain the ability to bicycle despite severe freezing of gait. Moreover it can help clarifying the mechanism through which cycling may have therapeutic benefits.",

    "abstract": "Experimental data show that perceptual cues can either exacerbate or ameliorate freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's Disease (PD). For example, simple visual stimuli like stripes on the floor can alleviate freezing whereas complex stimuli like narrow doorways can trigger it. We present a computational model of the cognitive and motor cortico-basal ganglia loops that explains the effects of sensory and cognitive processes on FOG. The model simulates strong causative factors of FOG including decision conflict (a disagreement of various sensory stimuli in their association with a response) and cognitive load (complexity of coupling a stimulus with downstream mechanisms that control gait execution). Specifically, the model simulates gait of PD patients (freezers and non-freezers) as they navigate a series of doorways while simultaneously responding to several Stroop word cues in a virtual reality setup. The model is based on an actor-critic architecture of Reinforcement Learning involving Utility-based decision making, where Utility is a weighted sum of Value and Risk functions. The model accounts for the following experimental data: (a) the increased foot-step latency seen in relation to high conflict cues, (b) the high number of motor arrests seen in PD freezers when faced with a complex cue compared to the simple cue, and (c) the effect of dopamine medication on these motor arrests. The freezing behavior arises as a result of addition of task parameters (doorways and cues) and not due to inherent differences in the subject group. The model predicts a differential role of risk sensitivity in PD freezers and non-freezers in the cognitive and motor loops. Additionally this first-of-its-kind model provides a plausible framework for understanding the influence of cognition on automatic motor actions in controls and Parkinson's Disease.",

    "abstract": "Many therapeutic strategies aimed at relieving symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are currently used for treatment of this disease. With a hallmark of progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, the absence of properly operational dopaminergic circuitry becomes a therapeutic target. Following diagnosis, dopamine replacement can be given in the form of L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine). Even though it is recognized as standard of care, this treatment strategy does not prevent the affected neurons from degenerating. Therefore, studies have been performed using gene therapy (GT) to make dopamine (DA) available from within the brain using an artificial DA circuitry. One approach is to administer a GT aimed at delivering the key enzymes for DA synthesis using a lentiviral vector system (Palfi et al., 2014). A similar approach has been investigated with adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and GTP-cyclohydrolase I (Bankiewicz et al., 2000), which are downregulated in PD. Another GT approach to mitigate symptoms of PD used AAV-mediated delivery of GAD-67 (glutamate decarboxylase) (Kaplitt et al., 2007). This approach mimics the inhibitory effect of DA neurons on their targets, in reducing motor abnormalities. Finally, disease modifying strategies have been undertaken using neurotrophic factors such as neurturin (NTN) (Marks et al., 2008; Bartus et al., 2013a) or are ongoing with the closely related Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Those approaches are aiming at rescuing the degenerating neurons. All of the above mentioned strategies have their own merits, but also some disadvantages. So far, none of clinical applied GT studies has resulted in significant clinical benefit, although some clinical studies are ongoing and results are expected over the next few years.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal atrophy has been associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, literature on how hippocampal atrophy affects the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in PD has been limited. Previous studies assessed the hippocampus as an entire entity instead of their individual subregions. We studied the progression of cognitive status in PD subjects over 18 in relation to hippocampal subfields atrophy.\n65 PD subjects were included. Using the MDS task force criteria, PD subjects were classified as either having no cognitive impairment (PD-NCI) or PD-MCI. We extended the study by investigating the hippocampal subfields atrophy patterns in those who converted from PD-NCI to PD-MCI (PD-converters) compared to those who remained cognitively stable (PD-stable) over 18\u00a0months. Freesurfer 6.0 was used to perform the automated segmentation of the hippocampus into thirteen subregions.\nPD-MCI showed lower baseline volumes in the left fimbria, right CA1, and right HATA; and lower global cognition scores compared to PD-NCI. Baseline right CA1 was also correlated with baseline attention. Over 18\u00a0months, decline in volumes of CA2-3 and episodic memory were also seen in PD-converters compared to PD-stable. Baseline volumes of GC-DG, right CA4, left parasubiculum, and left HATA were predictive of the conversion from PD-NCI to PD-MCI.\nThe findings from this study add to the anatomical knowledge of hippocampal subregions in PD, allowing us to understand the unique functional contribution of each subfield. Structural changes in the hippocampus subfields could be early biomarkers to detect cognitive impairment in PD.",

    "abstract": "Histological evidence suggests that pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD) goes beyond nigrostriatal degeneration and also affects the cerebral cortex. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques allow the assessment of changes in brain tissue composition. However, the development and pattern of disease-related cortical changes have not yet been demonstrated in PD with qMRI methods. The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal cortical microstructural changes in PD with quantitative T1 relaxometry.\n13 patients with mild to moderate PD and 20 matched healthy subjects underwent high resolution T1 mapping at two time points with an interval of 6.4\u00a0years (healthy subjects: 6.5\u00a0years). Data from two healthy subjects had to be excluded due to MRI artifacts. Surface-based analysis of cortical T1 values was performed with the FreeSurfer toolbox.\nIn PD patients, a widespread decrease of cortical T1 was detected during follow-up which affected large parts of the temporo-parietal and occipital cortices and also frontal areas. In contrast, age-related T1 decrease in the healthy control group was much less pronounced and only found in lateral frontal, parietal and temporal areas. Average cortical T1 values did not differ between the groups at baseline (\nIn patients with PD, the development of widespread changes in cortical microstructure was observed as reflected by a reduction of cortical T1. The pattern of T1 decrease in PD patients exceeded the normal T1 decrease as found in physiological aging and showed considerable overlap with the pattern of cortical thinning demonstrated in previous PD studies. Therefore, cortical T1 might be a promising additional imaging marker for future longitudinal PD studies. The biological mechanisms underlying cortical T1 reductions remain to be further elucidated.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to dysfunction in multiple cortico-striatal circuits. The neurodegeneration has also been associated with impaired white matter integrity. This structural and functional \"disconnection\" in PD needs further characterization. We investigated the structural and functional organization of the PD whole brain connectome consisting of 200 nodes using diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional MRI, respectively. Data from 20 non-demented PD patients on dopaminergic medication and 20 matched controls were analyzed using graph theory-based methods. We focused on node strength, clustering coefficient, and local efficiency as measures of local network properties; and network modularity as a measure of information flow. PD patients showed reduced white matter connectivity in frontoparietal-striatal nodes compared to controls, but no change in modular organization of the white matter tracts. PD group also showed reduction in functional local network metrics in many nodes distributed across the connectome. There was also decreased functional modularity in the core cognitive networks including the default mode and dorsal attention networks, and sensorimotor network, as well as a lack of modular distinction in the orbitofrontal and basal ganglia nodes in the PD group compared to controls. Our results suggest that despite subtle white matter connectivity changes, the overall structural organization of the PD connectome remains robust at relatively early disease stages. However, there is a breakdown in the functional modular organization of the PD connectome.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases affect not only the life quality of aging populations, but also their life spans. All forms of neurodegenerative diseases have a massive impact on the elderly. The major threat of these brain diseases includes progressive loss of memory, Alzheimer's disease (AD), impairments in the movement, Parkinson's disease (PD), and the inability to walk, talk, and think, Huntington's disease (HD). Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are highlighted as a central feature of brain degenerative diseases. Oxidative stress, a condition that occurs due to imbalance in oxidant and antioxidant status, has been known to play a vital role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including AD, PD, and HD. A large number of studies have utilized oxidative stress biomarkers to investigate the severity of these neurodegenerative diseases and medications are available, but these only treat the symptoms. In traditional medicine, a large number of medicinal plants have been used to treat the symptoms of these neurodegenerative diseases. Extensive studies scientifically validated the beneficial effect of natural products against neurodegenerative diseases using suitable animal models. This short review focuses the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, and HD and the protective efficacy of natural products against these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Early and accurate identification of Parkinsonian syndromes (PS) involving presynaptic degeneration from nondegenerative variants such as scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD) and tremor disorders is important for effective patient management as the course, therapy, and prognosis differ substantially between the two groups. In this study, we use single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images from healthy normal, early PD, and SWEDD subjects, as obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, and process them to compute shape- and surface-fitting-based features. We use these features to develop and compare various classification models that can discriminate between scans showing dopaminergic deficit, as in PD, from scans without the deficit, as in healthy normal or SWEDD. Along with it, we also compare these features with striatal binding ratio (SBR)-based features, which are well established and clinically used, by computing a feature-importance score using random forests technique. We observe that the support vector machine (SVM) classifier gives the best performance with an accuracy of 97.29%. These features also show higher importance than the SBR-based features. We infer from the study that shape analysis and surface fitting are useful and promising methods for extracting discriminatory features that can be used to develop diagnostic models that might have the potential to help clinicians in the diagnostic process.",

    "abstract": "Recently, based on voice cepstral analysis, Benba et al. (IEEE T. Neur. Sys. Reh., vol. 24, pp. 1100-1108, 2016) have reported discrimination between patients with Parkinson's disease and different neurological disorders with high classification accuracy up to 90%. Using the same approach, we were able to experimentally separate two groups of normal healthy speakers with 96% classification accuracy and showed that the method proposed by Benba et al. may not be appropriate for discrimination between different neurological diseases. In particular, voice cepstral analysis appears to be sensitive to specific speakers' characteristics such as gender or age. Our findings emphasize several assumptions that can be considered as basic necessary conditions for research reporting speech data in progressive neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "For years, conventional wisdom has held that patients with asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation (asymptomatic WPW or WPW pattern) were at low risk for adverse outcomes. This assumption has been challenged more recently in a number of observational/natural history studies as well as in prospective trials in which patients were more aggressively studied via invasive electrophysiology study (EPS) and more aggressively treated, in some cases, with pre-emptive catheter ablation, despite the lack of symptoms. In sum, the data do not definitively support one approach (early, up-stream EPS and/or ablation) vs. the other (watchful waiting with close monitoring). The most recent pediatric and adult guidelines reflect this ambiguity with a broad spectrum of approaches endorsed.",

Details of the occurrence and nature of these disorders in the atypical parkinsonian neurodegenerative disorders, and in non-Parkinson's patients prescribed dopaminergic stimulation for other disease processes, are slowly emerging. Here we review what is known about the phenomenology, epidemiology and risk factors for impulsive-compulsive behaviours in Parkinson's disease and in other, less well studied, patient groups. By analyzing the available published data, this review identifies potential clues as to the underlying neurobiological mechanism of these disorders, and further identifies critical gaps yet to be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are two of the most common movement disorders. Leaving aside their motor features, these two conditions share several non-motor features, including cognitive dysfunction and personality changes. However, there are few data comparing the cognitive and personality profiles of ET with PD. Here we compare the cognitive and personality profiles of the two diseases.\nThirty-two consecutive non-demented ET patients (13 females and 19 males) (67.7\u00b19.8 years), 32 non-demented PD patients (13 females and 19 males) (67.7\u00b19.5 years), and 32 healthy matched controls (14 females and 18 males) (67.9\u00b110.1 years) underwent a neuropsychological test battery, including a global cognitive assessment and tests of attention, executive function, memory, language, and visuospatial function, as well as the Personality Assessment Inventory. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed, adjusted for age, sex, years of education, medications that potentially affect cognitive function, number of medications, and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Total Score.\nNeuropsychological scores were similar in PD and ET patients, but patients with disease performed more poorly than control subjects in cognitive tasks such as attention, executive function, memory, and naming.\nET and PD exhibited similar deficits in specific aspects of neuropsychological functioning, particularly those thought to rely on the integrity of the prefrontal cortex, and this suggests involvement of frontocerebellar circuits. These findings further challenge the traditional view of ET as a benign and monosymptomatic disorder.",

    "abstract": "A knowledge gap about Parkinson's disease (PD) often exists amongst PD patients, the level and accuracy of which can influence their attitude and perceptions about the disease. Increased awareness of this information deficit can help physicians identify interventions that will improve patient's knowledge and perceptions about PD.\nTo evaluate general understanding of PD and identify knowledge gaps amongst PD patients using a validated PD knowledge questionnaire.\nA cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted in 108 PD patients (34 working; 74 retired). The questionnaire covers three domains of PD, including diagnosis, therapeutic options, and disease course with a total knowledge score ranging from 0 to 26. Subjects with dementia were excluded.\nPatient misconceptions were reflected in the mean (SD) total, diagnosis, therapeutic options, and disease course scores: 14.64 (3.32), 7.76 (1.93), 3.85 (1.28), and 3.03 (1.41) respectively. The working age subgroup had significantly higher knowledge scores than the retired age group for the whole questionnaire (p=0.004), as well as the diagnosis (p=0.001) and therapeutic sections (p=0.023). Three dependent variables, including younger age at recruitment (<60years old), female gender, and higher disease duration (\u22654years), were identified as predictors of a higher level of PD knowledge amongst PD patients.\nSignificant knowledge gaps were identified amongst PD patients in all three aspects of the questionnaire. Timely identification of patients with inaccurate or insufficient disease-related knowledge could help healthcare professionals choose more suitable multimodal educational interventions.",

    "abstract": "Propofol is an intravenous sedative-hypnotic agent that is commonly used to induce and maintain general anaesthesia. This drug has antioxidant properties, which are partly caused by a phenolic structure similar to \u03b1-tocopherol. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of propofol on the level of oxidative stress biomarkers in the frontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum in rats with experimental Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe experiment was performed on 24 male Wistar rats assigned to the following groups: 1 - control; 2 - PD; 3 - PD with propofol. The dopaminergic systems were damaged with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) administered to each lateral ventricle (2x15 \u03bcg/5 \u03bcl). 60 mg/kg of propofol was later given to the 8-week-old rats intraperitoneally. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and its enzymes Cu/ZnSOD and MnSOD, together with the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, total oxidative status (TOS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), were measured.\nIn the 2nd group, a significant increase in MDA concentration in the striatum, hippocampus and thalamus, and an increase of TOS in the striatum, thalamus and cerebellum were noted, along with a TAC decrease in the cortex, striatum and thalamus. Propofol caused a significant decrease in MDA levels in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus and thalamus, and a decrease in TOS levels in the cortex, striatum and cerebellum, with increased TAC in all evaluated structures.\nA shortage of natural antioxidants is observed in PD, along with an increase in pro-oxidants in many brain areas. Propofol inhibits oxidative stress in the brain, which shows its neuroprotective properties against oxidative damage.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the current genetic evidence for the involvement of various cell types and tissue types in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, especially in relation to the neuroinflammatory hypothesis of neurodegenerative diseases.\nWe obtained large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We used multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, as a positive control. We applied stratified LD score regression to determine if functional marks for cell type and tissue activity, and gene-set lists were enriched for genetic heritability. We compared our results to those from two gene-set enrichment methods (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and enrichr).\nThere were no significant heritability enrichments for annotations marking genes active within brain regions, but there were significant heritability enrichments for annotations marking genes active within cell types that form part of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. We found this for MS (as expected) and also for AD and PD. The strongest signals were from the adaptive immune system (e.g., T cells) for PD, and from both the adaptive (e.g., T cells) and innate (e.g., CD14: a marker for monocytes, and CD15: a marker for neutrophils) immune systems for AD. Annotations from the liver were also significant for AD. Pathway analysis provided complementary results.\nFor AD and PD, we found significant enrichment of heritability in annotations marking gene activity in immune cells.",

We found this for MS (as expected) and also for AD and PD. The strongest signals were from the adaptive immune system (e.g., T cells) for PD, and from both the adaptive (e.g., T cells) and innate (e.g., CD14: a marker for monocytes, and CD15: a marker for neutrophils) immune systems for AD. Annotations from the liver were also significant for AD. Pathway analysis provided complementary results.",

    "abstract": "Stem cell treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are expected to reach clinical trials soon. Most of the approaches currently under development involve transplantation of immature progenitors that subsequently undergo phenotypic and functional maturation in\u00a0vivo, and predicting the long-term graft outcome already at the progenitor stage remains a challenge. Here, we took an unbiased approach to identify predictive markers expressed in dopamine neuron progenitors that correlate with graft outcome in an animal model of Parkinson's disease through gene expression analysis of >30 batches of grafted human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived progenitors. We found that many of the commonly used markers did not accurately predict in\u00a0vivo subtype-specific maturation. Instead, we identified a specific\u00a0set of markers associated with the caudal\u00a0midbrain that correlate with high dopaminergic yield\u00a0after transplantation in\u00a0vivo. Using these markers, we\u00a0developed a good manufacturing practice (GMP) differentiation protocol for highly efficient and reproducible production of transplantable dopamine progenitors from hESCs.",

    "abstract": "30-40% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience depression during their illness; identifying subtypes of depression and groups at risk remains a challenge in routine clinical care. One avenue that remains underexplored is the gender-specific profiles manifested in PD depression. We sought to explore this in a large sample of clinical PD patients.\n307 patient records at a tertiary referral centre were reviewed for clinical and demographic factors. We used recursive partitioning to determine which items on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were most useful in differentiating patients who scored in the depressed range (\u226514) from those who scored in the non-depressed range (\u226413). We also used recursive partitioning to identify those BDI items that were most effective in differentiating depressed from non-depressed patients in both genders.\nWe were able to identify a subset of items on the BDI that were most useful in partitioning depressed from non-depressed in the entire cohort. Partitioning of men and women with PD depression relied on different key BDI items, melancholy featuring prominently in women, while the more classical factors associated with depression in PD (apathy and loss of libido) featured more prominently in men.\nUnique factors not previously identified as core features of depression in PD were found most useful in partitioning depressed women from non-depressed women. This raises the possibility that a female-specific depressive profile has been under-appreciated in past work. Additional studies are required to discern how this may impact future research, diagnosis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease and may affect a wide range of everyday activities, cause disability and reduce quality of life. It occurs at every stage of PD, and once present will often persist and may worsen over time. Lack of a consensus of definition and classification, and a range of different self-reporting scales has so far made the study of fatigue challenging. We review a unifying taxonomy for defining fatigue in clinical and research contexts as well as case definition criteria for PD-related fatigue. The potential causes of fatigue in PD are discussed as are recommendations for treatment.",

    "abstract": "To investigate response shift, the recalibration of perceived quality of life (QoL) relative to symptomatic changes in Parkinson disease (PD).\nHealth-related QoL in PD is influenced by improvement vs. decline in disease severity. However, it is unclear how disease course changes internal standards of QoL over time.\n124 PD patients were subdivided based on Total UPDRS change over 1 year (stable, improved, declined). The EuroQol Visual Analog Scale assessed QoL at baseline (T1) and 1 year later (T2). At T2, patients rated current QoL (T2-current) and reappraised their T1 QoL (T2-retrospective). Recalibration response shifts were represented by the difference between T1 and T2-retrospective QoL ratings.\nAt follow-up (T2), the total patient sample reported no difference between current (T2 current mean (M)\u00a0=\u00a076.3) and retrospective (T2-R M\u00a0=\u00a077.8) QoL ratings. While there was no significant difference between T1 (M\u00a0=\u00a079.2) and T2-R ratings 1 year later (M\u00a0=\u00a077.8) for the total sample, there was a change by group interaction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005) which showed that retrospectively, decliners reduced ratings (M \u0394\u00a0=\u00a0-9.0) and improvers increased ratings (M \u0394\u00a0=\u00a0+6.4) while stable patients did not change.\nWhen PD patients consider their health status one year ago, decliners recalibrate and downgrade last year's health assessment, while improvers upgrade last year's assessment. Changes in internal calibrations cushion periods of decline or improvement in PD such that patients tend to \"stabilize\" their general disease course when recalling symptom trajectory, providing insight into the process of adaptation to the effects of disease progression and treatment over time.",

Additionally, whether these complaints were affected by characteristics such as age at onset of Parkinson disease, sex, disease duration, and severity was investigated.\nThis study comprised a total of 79 individuals, 39 Parkinson patients and a control group of 40 individuals. Parkinson diagnosis was provided by a neurology expert according to the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria. All patients were evaluated by a urologist with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and an overactive bladder (OAB) questionnaire.\nCompared with the control group, the Parkinson patient group had statistically significantly higher rates of urological complaints (P < 0.001), irritative symptoms (P < 0.001), voiding symptoms (P < 0.001), OAB score (P < 0.001), IPSS total score (P = 0.007), and treatment requirements (P < 0.001).\nUrologic complaints were observed more frequently in the Parkinson patient group compared to the control group. Another important result of this study is that in the Parkinson patient group there was no difference found between urologic complaints in terms of sex.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) presents clinically with several motor subtypes that exhibit variable treatment response and prognosis. Here, we investigated genetic variants for their potential association with PD motor phenotype and progression.\nWe screened 10 SNPs, previously associated with PD risk, for association with tremor-dominant (TD) versus postural-instability gait disorder (PIGD) motor subtypes. SNPs that correlated with the TD/PIGD ratio in a discovery cohort of 251 PD patients were then evaluated in a multi-site replication cohort of 559 PD patients. SNPs associated with motor phenotype in both cross-sectional cohorts were next evaluated for association with (1) rates of motor progression in a longitudinal subgroup of 230 PD patients and (2) brain alpha-synuclein (\nGenotype at rs356182, near \nOur study demonstrates that the GG genotype at rs356182 provides molecular definition for a clinically important endophenotype associated with (1) more tremor-predominant motor phenomenology, (2) slower rates of motor progression, and (3) decreased brain expression of ",

This patient was referred to the pharmacist pharmacotherapy service by a neurology physician. PD has been shown in the medical literature to be caused by chronic exposure to high levels of manganese. It may be concluded that daily doses of manganese well above the upper limit of 9 mg per day were taken by this patient for an extended period of time, possibly causing PD via manganism.\nThis case illustrates the unknown risks taken by patients who use excessive amounts of over-the-counter herbals and supplements and how pharmacists can assist patients and physicians in the proper use of these popular products.\nAI = Adequate intake, EMS = Eosinophilia myalgia syndrome, MTM = Medication therapy management, UL = Tolerable upper limit.",

    "abstract": "We describe the case of an early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD) patient, suffering from a severe and unusual dyskinetic gait pattern, earlier described as \"Silly walk.\" On presentation, the 58-year-old patient showed a painful, bizarre dyskinetic gait disorder, resulting in a significantly impairment of her social life. We developed an individual conservative training method for the patient, using \"Cueing mechanisms,\" well known for treatment of Freezing in PD, to overcome her dyskinetic gait pattern. An impressive improvement was seen after the use of visual and acousting cues. We, therefore, conclude that it might be important for PD patients to recognize these specific movement abnormalities and start early with individualized training methods. Moreover, especially for \"Silly walk\" individuals, \"Cueing\" strategies can be an important new basis of conservative training methods for dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "With the development of effective systems for gene delivery to the central nervous system (CNS), gene therapy has become a therapeutic option for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Gene therapies that are the most advanced in the clinic have been designed to more effectively compensate for the lack of dopamine signaling in the basal ganglia and rescue the cardinal motor symptoms of PD. However, it remains essential to devise novel therapies to prevent neurodegeneration and disease progression. Since gene therapy has been initially proposed for the delivery of neurotrophins to support the survival and function of dopaminergic neurons, our understanding of PD etiology has changed dramatically. Genes implicated in familial forms of the disease and genetic risk factors associated with sporadic PD have been identified. The spreading of the \u03b1-synuclein pathology, as well as perturbations of the lysosomal and mitochondrial activities, appear to play critical roles in the pathogenesis. These findings provide novel targets for gene therapy against PD, but at the same time underline the complexity of this chronic disease. Here we review and discuss the successes and limitations of gene therapy approaches, which have been proposed to provide neuroprotection in PD.",

    "abstract": "Motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are tightly linked to the degeneration of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and their projections into the striatum. Moreover, a broad range of non-motor symptoms like anxiety and depression frequently occur in PD, most likely related to the loss of serotonergic neurons and their projections into corresponding target regions. Strikingly, nigral dopaminergic neurons and raphe serotonergic neurons are severely affected in PD showing characteristic hallmarks of PD neuropathology, in particular alpha-synuclein containing Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. So far, the initial events underlying neurodegenerative processes in PD are not well understood. Several observations, however, indicate that neurites and synapses of diseased neurons may be the first subcellular compartments compromised by alpha-synuclein associated pathology. In particular axonal pathology and deficits in axonal transport may be leading to the onset of synucleinopathies such as PD. This review will highlight current findings derived from imaging and neuropathological studies in PD patients, as well as cellular and animal PD models, which define the initial underlying structural and molecular events within dopaminergic and serotonergic circuits leading to the 'dying back' degeneration of axonal projections in PD.",

    "abstract": "Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) represents a selective form of autophagy involved in the degradation of specific soluble proteins containing a pentapeptide motif that is recognized by a cytosolic chaperone able to deliver proteins to the lysosomes for degradation. Physiologically, CMA contributes to maintain crucial cellular functions including energetic balance and protein quality control. Dysfunctions in CMA have been associated to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases characterized by accumulation and aggregation of proteins identified as CMA substrates. In particular, increasing evidence highlights the existence of a strong relationship between CMA defects and Parkinson's disease (PD). Several mutations associated with familial forms of PD (SNCA, LRRK2, UCHL1 and DJ-1) have been demonstrated to block or reduce the activity of CMA, the main catabolic pathway for alpha-synuclein (asyn). CMA dysfunctions also leads to a mislocalization and inactivation of the transcription factor MEF2D that plays a key-role in the survival of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, reduced levels of CMA markers have been observed in post mortem brain samples from PD patients. The aim of this review article is to provide an organic revision of evidence for the involvement of CMA dysfunctions in the pathogenesis of PD. Updated findings obtained in patient's specimens will be resumed, and results deriving from ",

    "abstract": "Depression is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and adversely affects quality of life. Both unilateral and bilateral subthalamic (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) effectively treat the motor symptoms of PD, but questions remain regarding the impact of unilateral STN DBS on non-motor symptoms, such as depression.\nWe report changes in depression, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), in 50 consecutive PD patients who underwent unilateral STN DBS. Participants were also evaluated with UPDRS part III, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The primary outcome was change in HAMD-17 at 6 months versus pre-operative baseline, using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Secondary outcomes included the change in HAMD-17\u00a0at 3, 12, 18, and 24 months post-operatively and correlations amongst outcome variables using Pearson correlation coefficients. As a control, we also evaluated changes in HAMD-17 in 25 advanced PD patients who did not undergo DBS.\nParticipants with unilateral STN DBS experienced significant improvement in depression 6 months post-operatively (4.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.02) compared to preoperative baseline (7.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.44) (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) (p\u00a0=\u00a0<0.0001). HAMD-17 scores did not correlate with UPDRS part III at any time-point. Interestingly, the HAMD-17 was significantly correlated with sleep quality and quality of life at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months post-operatively. Participants without DBS experienced no significant change in HAMD-17 over the same interval.\nUnilateral STN DBS improves depression 6 months post-operatively in patients with PD. Improvement in depression is maintained over time and correlates with improvement in sleep quality and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) medication errors, including both missing dopaminergic drug doses and antidopaminergic usage, have been suggested as risk factors for prolonged hospital stays. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of such errors in PD patients admitted to public acute-care hospitals in the Basque Country over a two year period and their association with clinically relevant adverse health outcomes, such as length of hospital stay and mortality.\nAll PD patients admitted to any of the 11 public acute-care hospitals in the Basque Country in 2011-2012 were included. Medication errors involved incorrect timing or the complete omission of administration for dopaminergic drugs, and the administration of centrally acting antidopaminergics. A logistic regression and a competing risk analysis were applied to verify whether those errors affected intrahospital mortality and length of stay.\nThe study included 1628 patients admitted 2546 times. Medication errors, affecting almost one third of admissions and half of patients, were associated with higher mortality: inappropriately omitted dopaminergic drug doses OR\u00a0=\u00a01.92 CI 95% (1.34-2.76); inappropriate antiemetic administration OR\u00a0=\u00a02.15 CI 95% (1.36-3.39); and inappropriate antipsychotic administration OR\u00a0=\u00a01.91 CI 95% (1.33-1.73). Inappropriately omitted doses and both inappropriate antipsychotic and antiemetic administration were associated with a significant 4-day increase in median hospital stay.\nMedication errors (missing dopaminergic drug doses and centrally acting antidopaminergic use) are not only associated with increased length of hospital stays in PD patients, but also with a higher mortality rate.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion (LCIG) is indicated in patients with advanced levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease (PD) for the treatment of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Here we describe 4 PD patients who developed disabling diphasic dyskinesias after LCIG initiation.\nThe clinical data of 33 PD patients consecutively treated with LCIG therapy were obtained through direct clinical observation and detailed review of medical records.\nWithin 10 days, after LCIG introduction, we identified 4 subjects (12.1%) with persistent and disabling diphasic dyskinesia (DD). We tried to manage these symptoms by increasing morning LCIG flow and adding \"extended-release\" formulations of dopamine-agonists and levodopa/carbidopa during bedtime. Within 1 month, all patients presented a gradual reduction in the duration and severity of DD.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report describing the occurrence of DD in a small cohort of advanced PD patients after LCIG initiation. We wish to draw the attention of clinicians to the risk of developing disabling DD in PD patients switched to the LCIG monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The effect of subthalamic deep brain stimulation on balance in Parkinson's disease remains unclear.\nTo evaluate the effect of subthalamic nucleus stimulation on balance in Parkinson's disease using posturography.\n16 patients (9 women) who underwent subthalamic deep brain stimulation [mean age 59.6 years (46-70); mean disease duration 15.6 years (7-25); mean duration of subthalamic stimulation 32.1 months (3.0-69.6)] and 13 healthy age-matched controls were evaluated using a static posturography analysis. Patients were assessed under four conditions: 1) off medication/off stimulation; 2) off medication/on stimulation; 3) on medication/off stimulation and 4) on medication/on stimulation in ten experimental paradigms, some reproducing common situations of daily living. The displacement of the centre of pressure was analyzed using 14 posturographic parameters. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare patients with controls. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare patients under different clinical conditions.\nPatients off medication/off stimulation showed larger and more rapid displacements of the centre of pressure than controls in most paradigms (p<0.05), particularly when performing a dual task. Subthalamic stimulation alone reduced the lateral excursion and anterior-posterior velocity of the centre of pressure in quite stance paradigms (p<0.05). Subthalamic stimulation combined with antiparkinsonian medication did not induce statistically significant changes in posturagraphic measures in any experimental paradigm.\nAlthough subthalamic stimulation alone may induce some positive effect on balance, subthalamic stimulation in addition to antiparkinsonian medication, which is the usual treatment in clinical practice, did not modify balance as assessed by static posturography in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease primarily characterized by the hallmarks of motor symptoms, such as tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. However, through clinical investigations in patients and experimental findings in animal models of Parkinson's disease for years, it is now well recognized that Parkinson's disease is more than just a motor-deficit disorder. The majority of Parkinson's disease patients suffer from nonmotor disabilities, for instance, cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, sensory dysfunction, and sleep disorder. So far, anti-PD prescriptions and surgical treatments have been mainly focusing on motor dysfunctions, leaving cognitive impairment a marginal clinical field. Within the nonmotor symptoms, cognitive impairment is one of the most common and significant aspects of Parkinson's disease, and cognitive deficits such as dysexecutive syndrome and visuospatial disturbances could seriously affect the quality of life, reduce life expectancy, prolong the duration of hospitalization, and therefore increase burdens of caregiver and medical costs. In this review, we have done a retrospective study of the recent related researches on epidemiology, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, genetics, and potential treatment of cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease, aiming to provide a summary of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and make it easy for clinicians to tackle this challenging issue in their future practice.",

    "abstract": "Psychosis is one of the debilitating non-motor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is considered to be a risk factor for emergence of psychosis in PD. Early detection of relevant cognitive impairment may serve as a predictor for development of psychosis, with implications for prevention and early intervention. However, the exact pattern of cognitive impairment associated with psychosis is not clear. In this article, we aim to critically review the literature on case-control studies in PD patients with and without psychosis in order to understand the pattern of cognitive impairment in those with psychosis. Majority of studies conducted till date have focused on executive and visuospatial functions. Despite some inconsistencies, most of the studies found significant impairment in these domains in PD patients with psychosis compared to those without psychosis. Studies assessing for other cognitive functions such as attention, language and memory in PD patients have also found worse performance in those with psychosis. Although there is enough evidence to suggest that PD patients with psychosis have poor cognitive functioning, it is unclear if these deficits are generalized or specific. The available evidence, which is primarily in the form of cross-sectional studies assessing for specific cognitive deficits, is not adequate to indicate a clear demarcating pattern of cognitive deficits, which differentiates PD patients with and without psychosis. Longitudinal studies with extensive cognitive assessment are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The power of Drosophila genetics has attracted attention in tackling important biomedical challenges such as the understanding and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder which results from the relentless degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Over the past two decades tremendous advances have been made in identifying genes responsible for inherited forms of PD. The ease of genetic manipulation in Drosophila has spurred the development of numerous models of PD, including expression of human genes carrying pathogenic mutations or the targeted mutation of conserved orthologs. The genetic and cellular analysis of these models is beginning to reveal fundamental insights into the pathogenic mechanisms. Numerous pathways and processes are disrupted in these models but some common themes are emerging. These often implicate aberrant synaptic function, protein aggregation, autophagy, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, an impressive list of small molecule compounds have been identified as effective in reversing pathogenic phenotypes, paving the way to explore these for therapeutic interventions.",

To reveal specific structural requirements for direct stabilization of the transcription factors responsible for triggering the antihypoxic and antioxidant programs, we studied flavones, isoflavones and catechols including dihydroxybenzoate, didox, levodopa, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), using novel luciferase-based reporters specific for the first step in HIF1 or Nrf2 protein stabilization. Distinct structural requirements for either transcription factor stabilization have been found: as expected, these requirements for activation of HIF ODD-luc reporter correlate with ",

    "abstract": "Using neuropsychological investigation and visual event-related potentials (ERPs), we aimed to compare the ERPs and cognitive function of nondemented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with and without visual hallucinations (VHs) and of control subjects. We recruited 12 PD patients with VHs (PD-H), 23 PD patients without VHs (PD-NH), and 18 age-matched controls. All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and visual ERPs measurement. A visual odd-ball paradigm with two different fixed interstimulus intervals (ISI) (1600\u2009ms and 5000\u2009ms) elicited visual ERPs. The frontal test battery was used to assess attention, visual-spatial function, verbal fluency, memory, higher executive function, and motor programming. The PD-H patients had significant cognitive dysfunction in several domains, compared to the PD-NH patients and controls. The mean P3 latency with ISI of 1600\u2009ms in PD-H patients was significantly longer than that in controls. Logistic regression disclosed UPDRS-on score and P3 latency as significant predictors of VH. Our findings suggest that nondemented PD-H patients have worse cognitive function and P3 measurements. The development of VHs in nondemented PD patients might be implicated in executive dysfunction with altered visual information processing.",

    "abstract": "A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is classically established after the manifestation of motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. However, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that nonmotor symptoms, especially gastrointestinal dysfunctions, could be considered as early biomarkers since they are ubiquitously found among confirmed patients and occur much earlier than their motor manifestations. According to Braak's hypothesis, the disease is postulated to originate in the intestine and then spread to the brain via the vagus nerve, a phenomenon that would involve other neuronal types than the well-established dopaminergic population. It has therefore been proposed that peripheral nondopaminergic impairments might precede the alteration of dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system and, ultimately, the emergence of motor symptoms. Considering the growing interest in the gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease, this review aims at providing a comprehensive picture of the multiple gastrointestinal features of the disease, along with the therapeutic approaches used to reduce their burden. Moreover, we highlight the importance of gastrointestinal symptoms with respect to the patients' responses towards medical treatments and discuss the various possible adverse interactions that can potentially occur, which are still poorly understood.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is the second most common neurological illness in United States. Neurologically, it is characterized by the selective degeneration of a unique population of cells, the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. The current treatment is symptomatic and mainly involves replacement of dopamine deficiency. This therapy improves only motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and is associated with a number of adverse effects including dyskinesia. Therefore, there is unmet need for more comprehensive approach in the management of PD. Cannabis and related compounds have created significant research interest as a promising therapy in neurodegenerative and movement disorders. In this review we examine the potential benefits of medical marijuana and related compounds in the treatment of both motor and nonmotor symptoms as well as in slowing the progression of the disease. The potential for cannabis to enhance the quality of life of Parkinson's patients is explored.",

    "abstract": "Neurological diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and ischemic stroke have increased in occurrence and become important health issues throughout the world. There is currently no effective therapeutic strategy for addressing neurological deficits after the development of these major neurological disorders. In recent years, it has become accepted that adult neural stem cells located in the subventricular and subgranular zones have the ability to proliferate and differentiate in order to replace lost or damaged neural cells. There have been many limitations in the clinical application of both endogenous and exogenous neurogenesis for neurological disorders. However, many studies have investigated novel mechanisms in neurogenesis and have shown that these limitations can potentially be overcome with appropriate stimulation and various approaches. We will review concepts related to possible therapeutic strategies focused on the perspective of neurogenesis for the treatment of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and ischemic stroke based on current reports.",

Recent studies suggest that environmental factors may contribute for neurodegeneration through induction of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, that is carried out by enzymes, such as DNMT1 and DNMT3B. This present study targeted to investigate the association among DNMT1 and DNMT3B polymorphisms with PD. Five hundred and twenty-two participants (214 PD patients following UK Brain Bank criteria and 308 healthy individuals) were evaluated.

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has been linked to familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. However, it is still unresolved whether LRRK2 in dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons may or may not aggravate the phenotype. We demonstrate that knocking down (KD) the Lrrk gene by RNAi in DAergic neurons untreated or treated with paraquat (PQ) neither affected the number of DAergic clusters, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein levels, lifespan nor locomotor activity when compared to control (i.e. TH/+) flies. KD transgenic Lrrk flies dramatically increased locomotor activity in presence of TH enzyme inhibitor alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (aMT), whereas no effect on lifespan was observed in both fly lines. Most importantly, KD Lrrk flies had reduced lipid peroxidation (LPO) index alone or in presence of PQ and the antioxidant minocycline (MC, 0.5mM). Taken together, these findings suggest that Lrrk appears unessential for the viability of DAergic neurons in D. melanogaster. Moreover, Lrrk might negatively regulate homeostatic levels of dopamine, thereby dramatically increasing locomotor activity, extending lifespan, and reducing oxidative stress (OS). Our data also indicate that reduced expression of Lrrk in the DAergic neurons of transgenic TH>Lrrk-RNAi/+ flies conferred PQ resistance and absence of neurodegeneration. The present findings support the notion that reduced/suppressed LRRK2 expression might delay or prevent motor symptoms and/or frank Parkinsonism in individuals at risk to suffer autosomal dominant Parkinsonism (AD-P) by blocking OS-induced neurodegenerative processes in the DAergic neurons.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease, a progressive neuro-degeneration of multiple systems damaging motor and non-motor functions, affects individual and societal dimensions negatively. In addition to standard treatments, complementary and alternative medicine has been adopted, in which acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medical practice by needle penetration at specific stimulation points (acupoints) along the body, indicates positive outcomes in this illness. Apart from offering an overview of using acupuncture in Parkinson's disease, this literature review analyses the effects of acupuncture on Parkinson's-induced physical symptoms and mental problems such as slow movements, stiffness, constipation, and sleep disorders. In light of the 35 reviewed research projects in mainland China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States of America, this study reveals the optimization of this approach through combined therapy and its preventive contribution using acupuncture alone. It also suggests research and practical implications that hint at enhancements in medical applications.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is often traumatic. It is then important to organize this announcement in order to support the patient in this major step of his care course. Anxiety and depression are present in about 50% of PD patients. Besides pharmacological treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy induces improvement in anxio-depressive symptoms. We have to promote physical activity for PD patients, from the beginning of the disease, because it prevents from deconditioning, improves motor and non-motor symptoms, quality of life, and decreases loneliness. Rehabilitation may be also proposed (physiotherapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy). But there is no specific recommendation in PD, and usual activities can be proposed. Therapeutic education is an answer for PD patients who need to know and understand their disease and treatment. Organization of therapeutic education is different depending of the teams: group workshop and/or individual sessions, conduct by doctors or paramedical staff (nurse, physiotherapist, psychologist\u2026). Therapeutic education programs are always evolving. It will soon be proposed therapeutic education for care partners, and some patients may join therapeutic education staff.",

    "abstract": "An increase in beta oscillations within the basal ganglia nuclei has been shown to be associated with movement disorder, such as Parkinson's disease. The motor cortex and an excitatory-inhibitory neuronal network composed of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the external globus pallidus (GPe) are thought to play an important role in the generation of these oscillations. In this paper, we propose a neuron mass model of the basal ganglia on the population level that reproduces the Parkinsonian oscillations in a reciprocal excitatory-inhibitory network. Moreover, it is shown that the generation and frequency of these pathological beta oscillations are varied by the coupling strength and the intrinsic characteristics of the basal ganglia. Simulation results reveal that increase of the coupling strength induces the generation of the beta oscillation, as well as enhances the oscillation frequency. However, for the intrinsic properties of each nucleus in the excitatory-inhibitory network, the STN primarily influences the generation of the beta oscillation while the GPe mainly determines its frequency. Interestingly, describing function analysis applied on this model theoretically explains the mechanism of pathological beta oscillations.",

    "abstract": "The effects of Parkinson's disease (PD) on the dynamics of impulsive action selection and suppression have recently been studied using distributional analyses, but with mixed results, especially for selection. Furthermore, some authors have suggested that impulsivity, regarded as a personality trait, shares common features with behavioral tasks' measures. The current study was designed to clarify the impact of PD on impulsive action selection and suppression, and investigate the link between cognitive action control and self-reported impulsivity. We administered an oculomotor version of the Simon task to 32 patients with PD and 32 matched healthy controls (HC), and conducted distributional analyses in accordance with the activation-suppression model. Patients and HC also filled out the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) questionnaire. Results showed that patients with PD were faster overall and exhibited a greater congruence effect than HC. They also displayed enhanced impulsive action selection. By contrast, the suppression of impulsive responses was similar across both groups. Furthermore, patients had higher impulsivity scores, which were correlated with higher impulsive action selection and higher suppression. Our study yielded two interesting findings. First, PD resulted in a higher number of fast errors. The activation-suppression model suggests that patients with PD are more susceptible to the impulsive action selection induced by the irrelevant stimulus dimension. Second, impulsive action selection and suppression were both associated with trait impulsivity, as measured by the BIS, indicating that these two aspects of impulsivity share common features.",

    "abstract": "Over the years, a number of distinct treatments have been adopted for the management of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), including pharmacologic therapies and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Efficacy is most often evaluated by subjective assessments, which are prone to error and dependent on the experience of the examiner. Our goal was to identify an objective means of assessing response to therapy.\nIn this study, we employed objective analyses in order to visualize and identify differences between three groups: healthy control (N\u00a0=\u00a010), subjects with PD treated with DBS (N\u00a0=\u00a012), and subjects with PD treated with levodopa (N\u00a0=\u00a016). Subjects were assessed during execution of three dynamic tasks (finger taps, finger to nose, supination and pronation) and a static task (extended arm with no active movement). Measurements were acquired with two pairs of inertial and electromyographic sensors. Feature extraction was applied to estimate the relevant information from the data after which the high-dimensional feature space was reduced to a two-dimensional space using the nonlinear Sammon's map. Non-parametric analysis of variance was employed for the verification of relevant statistical differences among the groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, K-fold cross-validation for discriminant analysis based on Gaussian Finite Mixture Modeling was employed for data classification.\nThe results showed visual and statistical differences for all groups and conditions (i.e., static and dynamic tasks). The employed methods were successful for the discrimination of the groups. Classification accuracy was 81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06% (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation) and 71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08%, for training and test groups respectively.\nThis research showed the discrimination between healthy and diseased groups conditions. The methods were also able to discriminate individuals with PD treated with DBS and levodopa. These methods enable objective characterization and visualization of features extracted from inertial and electromyographic sensors for different groups.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterized by the selective and progressive death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation is important in the degeneration of DA neurons. The purinergic receptor subtype P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is key in the activation and proliferation of microglia. The present study aimed to examine whether inhibiting purinergic P2X7 receptors is neuroprotective in a rat model of PD, specifically via inhibiting p38 mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase (MAPK). In an intranigral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) rat model of PD, immunohistochemical analysis revealed enhanced expression of P2X7R was observed in microglia. The administration of the P2X7R antagonist, brilliant blue G (BBG), reduced activation of the microglia and the loss of nigral DA neurons. In addition, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis revealed the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK increased in the microglia of the LPS\u2011injected rats, which was inhibited by BBG treatment. The p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, reduced microglial activation and the loss of DA neurons. Thus, these findings suggested that inhibition of P2X7R by BBG attenuated microglial activation and the loss of substantia nigra DA neurons via p38 MAPK in the rat LPS model of PD.",

    "abstract": "In the absence of visual feedback, humans depend upon proprioceptive information for reaching movements and coordination. Use of sensory information in order to assist movement is impaired in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been postulated that patients with PD compensate for this kinaesthetic deficit by relying on visual information.\nWe report two farmers who first noticed symptoms of PD when working on the farm in situations requiring processing of the proprioceptive/kinaesthetic information in order to execute motor output in the absence of visual cues. A 68-year-old right-handed farmer had a 5-year history of left hand awkwardness. He first noticed the problem while performing artificial insemination in cattle using the recto-vaginal technique. He was diagnosed with PD 15\u00a0months after his initial symptoms and responded well to a combination of carbidopa-levodopa and ropinirole but has not returned to performing artificial insemination since. Clinical examination revealed asymmetric parkinsonism with normal sensation on gross neurological examination (including proprioception). A 60-year-old right-handed farmer had a 6-year history of difficulty manoeuvring his right hand whilst turning the calf during calving only when he did not have direct sight of his hand. 18\u00a0months later he developed right hand tremor and bradykinesia. He was diagnosed with PD 2\u00a0years following these initial symptoms. He had a good response to a combination of carbidopa-levodopa, rasagiline and ropinirole. He switched to using his left hand during calf delivery but is not as dextrous as previously. Clinical examination revealed parkinsonism, more marked in the right hand and normal sensation in all modalities.\nAlthough task-specific motor impairment could explain the symptoms of these patients, it is noteworthy that loss of visual feedback was central to both of these presentations. Given that early kinaesthetic deficits are known to be present in patients with PD, we postulate that removing visual feedback can expose such deficits in early PD, even when not detectable on routine examination. These two patients suggest that sensorimotor control can be impaired early in PD and may be the first symptom. Once the visual compensatory mechanism is not available, it becomes difficult or impossible to perform complex hand movements.",

    "abstract": "Severe putamen dopamine depletion characterizes Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The extent of the depletion is greater than can be accounted for by loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals alone. We used putamen tissue levels and ratios of cysteinyl and parent catechols to explore possible denervation-independent abnormalities of dopamine synthesis and fate in PD and MSA. 5-S-Cysteinyldopa (Cys-DOPA) is produced from spontaneous oxidation of DOPA and 5-S-cysteinyldopamine (Cys-DA) from spontaneous oxidation of DA.\nPost-mortem putamen tissue samples from 17 PD and 25 MSA patients and 30 controls were assayed for endogenous catechols including DA, its cytoplasmic metabolites (Cys-DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde), and tyrosine hydroxylation products proximal to DA (DOPA and Cys-DOPA).\nThe PD and MSA groups did not differ in mean values of parent or cysteinyl catechols, and the data for the two groups were lumped. In the patients an index of vesicular storage of DA (the ratio of DA to the sum of its cytoplasmic metabolites) averaged 54% of control (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and an index of L-aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase (LAAAD) activity (the ratio of DA and the sum of its cytoplasmic metabolites to the sum of DOPA\u00a0+\u00a0Cys-DOPA) averaged 21% of control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). An index of innervation (the sum of DOPA\u00a0+\u00a0Cys-DOPA) averaged 63% of control (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).\nBased on patterns of parent and cysteinyl catechols in putamen, PD and MSA involve decreased vesicular uptake and decreased LAAAD activity in the residual dopaminergic terminals. The combination seems to contribute importantly to dopamine depletion in these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D is thought to contribute to brain health, but it is unclear whether low vitamin D levels are associated with increased incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD). Using ultraviolet B (UV-B) as a surrogate for vitamin D levels, we conducted a nationwide ecologic study in France in order to examine the association of UV-B with PD incidence.\nWe used French national drug claims databases to identify PD cases using a validated algorithm. UV-B data from the solar radiation database were derived from satellite images. We estimated PD incidence (2010-2012) at the canton level (small administrative French unit) and used multilevel Poisson regression to examine its association with UV-B (2005 annual average), after adjustment for age, sex, deprivation index, density of neurologists, smoking, proportion of agricultural land, and vitamin D supplementation.\nAnalyses are based on 69,010 incident PD patients. The association between UV-B and PD incidence was quadratic (P<0.001) and modified by age (P<0.001). Below 70y, incidence was higher in the bottom quintile (relative risk, RR\nIn this nationwide study, there was an age-dependent quadratic association between UV-B and PD incidence. This study suggests that reasonable UV-B exposure is associated with lower PD risk in younger persons and that future studies should examine dose-response relations and take age into account.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and has a great influence on quality of life. However, little is known about risk factors for development of anxiety in PD. We investigated which factors were associated with longitudinal changes in severity of anxiety symptoms and development of future anxiety in patients who were not anxious at baseline.\nAnalyses were performed on data of the PROfiling PARKinson's disease (PROPARK) cohort, a 5-year hospital-based longitudinal cohort of over 400 patients with PD who have been examined annually. Linear mixed models were used to identify factors associated with longitudinal changes in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Anxiety (HADS-A) scores. Survival analysis using data of patients who were not anxious at baseline was performed to identify predictors of future anxiety (i.e. HADS-A \u2265 11).\nOf 409 patients who were included at baseline, 67 (16%) had anxiety, whereas 64 (19%) of the remaining 342 non-anxious patients developed anxiety after a mean (SD) follow-up of 2.6 (1.3) years. Seventy percent of the patients with anxiety were also depressed. Female gender, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, dysautonomia, insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) at baseline were associated with higher HADS-A scores over time and, except for female gender and EDS, all of these variables were independent predictors of development of anxiety in patients who were not anxious at baseline.\nAnxiety is highly prevalent in PD. Higher anxiety scores over time and future development of anxiety are associated with female gender, cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, insomnia and EDS. Anxiety and depression usually coexist and share similar determinants, suggesting a common pathophysiological mechanism.",

The left nigrostriatal system appears more susceptible to early degeneration than the right, and a left-lateralized pattern of early neuropathological changes is also described in several neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Huntington's disease. In this study, we evaluated hemispheric differences in estimated rates of atrophy in a large, well-characterized cohort of PD patients.\nOur cohort included 205 PD patients who underwent clinical assessments and T1-weighted brain MRI's. Patients were classified into Early (\nOur results show that patients classified as Early stage exhibit a greater estimated rate of cortical atrophy in left frontal regions, especially the left insula and olfactory sulcus. This pattern was replicated in left-handed patients, and was not influenced by the degree of motor symptom asymmetry (i.e., left-sided predominant motor symptoms). Patients classified as Late stage exhibited greater atrophy in the bilateral occipital, and right hemisphere-predominant cortical areas.\nWe show that cortical degeneration in PD differs between cerebral hemispheres, and findings suggest a pattern of early left, and late right hemisphere with posterior cortical atrophy. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this asymmetry and pathologic implications.",

    "abstract": "The presence of mutations in glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene is a known factor increasing the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations carriers have earlier disease onset and are more likely to develop neuropsychiatric symptoms than other sporadic PD cases. These symptoms have primarily been observed in Parkinson's patients carrying the most common pathogenic mutations L444P and N370S. However, recent findings suggest that other variants across the gene may have a different impact on the phenotype as well as on the disease progression. We aimed to explore the influence of variants across GBA gene on the clinical features and treatment related complications in PD. In this study, we screened the GBA gene in a cohort of 532 well-characterised PD patients and 542 controls from southern Spain. The potential pathogeniticy of the identified variants was assessed using in-silico analysis and subsequently classified as benign or deleterious. As a result, we observed a higher frequency of GBA variants in PD patients (12.2% vs. 7.9% in controls, p = 0.021), earlier mean age at disease onset in GBA variant carriers (50.6 vs. 56.6 years; p = 0.013), as well as more prevalent motor and non-motor symptoms in patients carrying deleterious variants. In addition, we found that dopaminergic motor complications are influenced by both benign and deleterious variants. Our results highlight the fact that the impact on the phenotype highly depends on the potential pathogenicity of the carried variants. Therefore, the course of motor and non-motor symptoms as well as treatment-related motor complications could be influenced by GBA variants.",

    "abstract": "To validate the adapted Italian version of the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), a tool to assess non-motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA cross cultural adaptation of the NMSS into Italian and a psychometric analysis of the translated version of the NMSS was carried out in patients with PD from two university centres-affiliated hospitals. The quality of data and the acceptability, reliability and construct validity of NMSS were analyzed. The following standard scales were also applied: Hoehn and Yahr staging, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Beck Depression Inventory, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Autonomic Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease-Motor, Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part I and Modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) was calculated.\nSeventy-one patients with PD were assessed (mean age years 69.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6 SD; 31% women; mean length of disease 6.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6 years; H&Y median: 2). Mean NMSS was 39.76 (SD 31.9; skewness 0.95). The total score of NMSS was free of floor or ceiling effects and showed a satisfactory reliability (Cronbach's alpha coefficient on total score was 0.72 [range for domains: 0.64-0.73], SEM value was 3.88 [\u00bd SD\u00a0=\u00a031.90]). Significant positive correlations were found among total NMSS and other NMS standard tests, but no significant correlation appeared with UPDRS part III, CIRS and LEDD.\nThe Italian NMSS is a comprehensive and helpful measure for NMS in native Italian patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is caused by the destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. One of the possible factors involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is impaired oxidativeantioxidative balance.\nThe present study aimed to evaluate selected parameters of the liver oxidative-antioxidative system in a Wistar rat model with Parkinson's disease treated with propofol.\nExperiments were performed on 32 rats divided into 4 groups: 1 - control, 2 - Parkinson's disease, 3 - control with propofol, 4 - Parkinson's disease with propofol. The rats were decapitated at 8 weeks of age and their livers were collected. In the liver, the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR) and the concentrations of: Malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS) were assessed.\nThe study demonstrated a decrease in CAT activity and an increase in MDA, TOS concentrations in group 2 compared to that of group 1. Administration of propofol in rats of group 4 caused an increase in CAT activity and a decrease in MDA concentration compared to that of group 2 and an increase in TAC, CAT, GR levels, decrease in MDA levels compared to that of group 1. There was also an increase in GR and TAC in group 3 compared to that of group 1.\nPropofol in Parkinson's disease stimulates the production of antioxidant enzymes in the liver, simultaneously decreasing oxidative stress, which has a beneficial effect on the oxidative-antioxidative balance.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic dysfunctions are part of a spectrum of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of autonomic dysfunctions and their influence on the quality of life (QoL) in PD patients, adjusted for age, sex, disease duration and motor symptoms. Patients were evaluated for motor function (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS part III), disease stage (Hoehn and Yahr scale, H&Y scale), autonomic dysfunction (Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease, Autonomic, SCOPA-AUT) and QoL (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, PDQ-39). Urinary, gastrointestinal and sexual autonomic dysfunctions were most frequently reported, while the most severe symptoms were reported for sexual and urinary systems. Age and motor symptoms did not correlate with autonomic dysfunction, while disease duration correlated with cardiovascular dysfunction. There were sex differences on the thermoregulation subscale. All types of autonomic dysfunction influenced QoL, mostly gastrointestinal and thermoregulatory dysfunctions, except for sexual one. Many aspects of QoL (activity of daily living, emotion, cognitive functions, communication and social support) except for stigma and mobility were affected by autonomic dysfunctions. Age, disease duration, sex and motor symptoms were not found to affect global QoL scores, but had detrimental effects on different PDQ-39 dimensions. Autonomic dysfunctions influence QoL in more aspects than motor symptoms, age, disease duration and sex. Patients tend to be more stigmatized with motor than non-motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Emerging concepts suggest that a multitude of pathology ranging from misfolding of alpha-synuclein to neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurotransmitter driven alteration of brain neuronal networks lead to a syndrome that is commonly known as Parkinson's disease. The complex underlying pathology which may involve degeneration of non-dopaminergic pathways leads to the expression of a range of non-motor symptoms from the prodromal stage of Parkinson's to the palliative stage. Non-motor clinical subtypes, cognitive and non-cognitive, have now been proposed paving the way for possible subtype specific and non-motor treatments, a key unmet need currently. Natural history of these subtypes remains unclear and need to be defined. In addition to in vivo biomarkers which suggest variable involvement of the cholinergic and noradrenergic patterns of the Parkinson syndrome, abnormal alpha-synuclein accumulation have now been demonstrated in the gut, pancreas, heart, salivary glands, and skin suggesting that Parkinson's is a multi-organ disorder. The Parkinson's phenotype is thus not just a dopaminergic motor syndrome, but a dysfunctional multi-neurotransmitter pathway driven central and peripheral nervous system disorder that possibly ought to be considered a syndrome and not a disease.",

    "abstract": "Several MRI studies have demonstrated hippocampal atrophy in Parkinson's disease (PD), a structure considered a key element in spatial learning. Despite this, no study has been undertaken to investigate spatial navigation in PD using a virtual version of the Morris water maze, which is the gold standard for testing hippocampal function in rodents.\nWe studied 17 cognitively unimpaired PD patients, 12 PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 15 controls in a virtual water maze procedure.\nMeasured by the main outcome parameters latency to locate the target and heading error (average difference between direction of movement toward anticipated target and real direction toward the target), controls performed significantly better on the virtual water maze task than cognitively unimpaired PD patients or PD patients with MCI, while there was no significant difference between latter two groups.\nThe virtual water maze test differentiates PD patients from controls, but does not distinguish between cognitively normal and cognitively impaired PD patients, indicating a possible dopamine dependent component in spatial learning. Spatial performance deficits might thus constitute very early signs of dopamine depletion independent of the presence of MCI in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate dynamic thiol-disulphide homeostasis in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and to determine its relationship with the clinical stage as assessed by the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale.\nFifty-two patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), diagnosed according to the United Kingdom Brain Bank Criteria for idiopathic PD, and 41 healthy individuals were included in the study. Clinical staging of patients was performed according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Peripheral blood samples were taken from all participants, and their native thiol and total thiol concentrations were measured using the newly developed automated method. In addition, their amount of disulphide bonds, disulphide/native thiol, disulphide/total thiol and native thiol/total thiol ratios were calculated.\nConsidering the data obtained from Parkinson's patients and the control group, both native thiol (-SH) and total thiol (-SH+-S-S) levels were found significantly lower in patients with Parkinson's disease. A negative and statistically significant relationship was found between both disease duration and disease stage and native thiol (-SH), total thiol (-SH+-S-S) levels and -SH/(-SH+-S-S-) ratio. A positive and statistically significant relationship was found between both disease duration and stage and -S-S-/-SH and -S-S-/(-SH+-S-S-) ratios.\nIn patients with Parkinson's disease, dynamic thiol-disulphide homeostasis is disrupted, according to disease stage and duration. This balance, easily measured by using the newly developed automated method, can be used in monitoring disease progression. To our knowledge, our study will be the first report in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes, nano-sized extracellular vesicles secreted by most cell types, are found in all kinds of biological fluids and tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). The proposed functions of these vesicles include roles in cell-cell signaling, removal of cellular debris, and transfer of pathogens between cells. Many studies have revealed that exosomes derived from the CNS occur in the cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral body fluids, and their contents are altered during disease, making them an appealing target for biomarker development in Parkinson's disease (PD). Exosomes have been shown to spread toxic \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1syn) between cells and induce apoptosis, which suggests a key mechanism underlying the spread of \u03b1syn aggregates in the brain and the acceleration of pathology in PD. However, potential neuroprotective roles of exosomes in PD have also been reported. On the treatment side, as drug delivery vehicles, exosomes have been used to deliver small interfering RNAs and catalase to the brain, and have shown clear therapeutic effects in a mouse model of PD. These features of exosomes in PD make them extremely interesting from the point of view of developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "The Movement Disorder Society Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson's disease (MDS-PD Criteria) was introduced by the Movement Disorder Society in 2015 for research purposes. However, its use for clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease still needs further revision. This study compares the UK-Criteria versus MDS-PD Criteria in the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease referred to the China-Japan Friendship Hospital of Beijing, China. To compare the MDS-PD Criteria with the UK-Criteria and discuss the feasibility of the clinical application of MDS-PD Criteria as a general guide to clinical diagnosis of PD in Chinese PD patients. 150 patients of neurology clinic of China-Japan Friendship Hospital of Beijing were recruited in our research. They were divided into three groups: UK-Criteria group, MDS-PD Criteria group and a combined group of UK and MDS-PD Criteria. Clinical history was collected while physical and auxiliary examinations were done by a trained neurologist according to the corresponding criteria. An interrater reliability analysis using the Kappa statistic claimed substantial agreement (\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.626) between the MDS-PD Criteria and the UK-Criteria. The differences between the diagnostic results of these two criteria were statistically significant by paired\u00a0Chi-square\u00a0test (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000). It was found that levodopa-induced dyskinesia had a good positive predictive value, while early bulbar impairment and inspiratory dysfunction presented a negative predictive value. The MDS-PD Criteria emphasize the importance of non-motor symptoms, keeping the motor symptoms as the core for the clinical diagnosis of PD, and establish categories of diagnosis features and levels of certainty which are more complete and organized to be used and replicated by non specialized physicians to evaluated patients with Parkinsonism. The higher sensitivity of MDS-PD Criteria compared with UK-Criteria is worth being widely used in clinical work.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor deficits which result from the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. Gene therapy using growth factors such as VEGF seems to be a viable approach for potential therapeutic treatment of PD. In this study, we utilized a novel non-viral gene carrier designated as PEI-PLL synthesized by our laboratory to deliver VEGF gene to study its effect by using both cell culture as well as animal models of PD. For cell culture experiments, we utilized 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mediated cell death model of MN9D cells following transfection with either a control plasmid or VEGF expressing plasmid. As compared to control transfected cells, PEI-PLL mediated VEGF gene delivery to MN9D cells resulted in increased cell viability, increase in the number of Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells and decreased apoptosis following 6-OHDA insult. Next, we studied the therapeutic potential of PEI-PLL mediated VEGF gene delivery in SNPc by using unilateral 6-OHDA Medial forebrain bundle (MFB) lesion model of PD in rats. VEGF administration prevented the loss of motor functions induced by 6-OHDA as determined by behavior analysis. Similarly, VEGF inhibited the 6-OHDA mediated loss of DA neurons in Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta (SNPc) as well as DA nerve fibers in striatum as determined by TH immunostaining. In addition, PEI-PLL mediated VEGF gene delivery also prevented apoptosis and microglial activation in PD rat models. Together, these results clearly demonstrated the beneficial effects of PEI-PLL mediated VEGF gene delivery on dopaminergic system in both cell culture and animal models of PD.\nIn this report, we exploited the potential of PEI-PLL to deliver VEGF gene for the potential therapeutic treatment of PD by using both cell culture and animal models of PD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the use of novel polymeric gene carriers for the delivery of VEGF gene to DA neurons with improved transfection efficiency. Finally, the study will lead to a significant advancement in the field of non-viral PD gene therapy treatment.",

    "abstract": "Puberty is a critical period of development during which the brain undergoes reorganizing and remodeling. Exposure to stress during this period is thought to interfere with normal brain development and increase susceptibility to mental illnesses. In female mice, pubertal exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial endotoxin, has been shown to alter sexual, anxiety-like, and depression-like behaviors and cognition in an enduring manner. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. The present study examined age and sex difference in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and dopamine-dependent and Parkinson-like behaviors following LPS treatment. The results show that LPS treatment during adulthood causes an enduring increase in TH expression in many of the brain regions examined. In contrast, there is no change in TH expression following LPS treatment during puberty. However, pubertal LPS treatment induces enduring behavioral deficits in tests of Parkinson-like behaviors, more so in male than in female mice. These results suggest that the low levels of TH following exposure to pubertal immune challenge may predispose mice to Parkinson-like behavior. These findings add to our understanding of stress and immune responses during puberty and their impact on mental health later in life.",

    "abstract": "Altered emotional processing, including reduced emotion facial expression and defective emotion recognition, has been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, few studies have objectively investigated facial expression abnormalities in PD using neurophysiological techniques. It is not known whether altered facial expression and recognition in PD are related.\nTo investigate possible deficits in facial emotion expression and emotion recognition and their relationship, if any, in patients with PD.\nEighteen patients with PD and 16 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Facial expressions of emotion were recorded using a 3D optoelectronic system and analyzed using the facial action coding system. Possible deficits in emotion recognition were assessed using the Ekman test. Participants were assessed in one experimental session. Possible relationship between the kinematic variables of facial emotion expression, the Ekman test scores, and clinical and demographic data in patients were evaluated using the Spearman's test and multiple regression analysis.\nThe facial expression of all six basic emotions had slower velocity and lower amplitude in patients in comparison to healthy controls (all \nThe results in this study provide further evidence of altered emotional processing in PD.

    "abstract": "It remains unclear how deep brain stimulation (DBS) modulates the global neuronal network involving cortical activity. We aimed to evaluate changes in cortical activity in six (two men; four women) patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who underwent unilateral globus pallidus interna (GPI) DBS surgery using a multi-channel near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. As five of the patients were right-handed, DBS was performed on the left in these five cases. The mean age was 66.8 \u00b1 4.0 years. The unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) motor scores were evaluated at baseline and 1- and 6-month follow-up. Task-related NIRS experiments applying the block design were performed at baseline and 1-month follow-up. The mean of the total UPDRS motor score was 48.5 \u00b1 11.1 in the off-medication state preoperatively. Postoperatively, total UPDRS motor scores improved to 26.8 \u00b1 16.6 (",

    "abstract": "Several gender differences have been reported in Parkinson's Disease (PD). We evaluated the burden of non-motor symptoms (NMS) in PD and the possible gender differences in their occurrence.\nThe FRAGAMP study is a large multicenter case-control study. PD patients and controls underwent a face-to-face interview and a neurological examination performed by trained neurologists. Presence of NMS was investigated using a standardized questionnaire; cognitive impairment and depression were assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale respectively.\n585 PD patients (59.5% men) and 481 controls (34.9% men) were enrolled in the study. All NMS were significantly more frequent among PD patients than controls. PD women showed a significantly higher frequency of depression and urinary disturbances than parkinsonian men; a close frequency among PD women and men was recorded for hallucination, cognitive impairment and sleep disorders. Nonetheless, with respect to the control population, according to logistic regression stratified by sex and adjusted by age, PD men showed a stronger positive significant association with almost all NMS compared to women, excepting for urinary disturbances. The strongest association among PD men was recorded for cognitive impairment (adjusted OR 5.44 for men and 2.82 for women) and depression (adjusted OR 30.88 for men and 12.72 for women).\nWith respect to the general population, presence of NMS was stronger associated with male gender. Our data suggest that the presence of NMS among PD men is more strictly due to the neurodegenerative processes related to PD.",

PD women showed a significantly higher frequency of depression and urinary disturbances than parkinsonian men; a close frequency among PD women and men was recorded for hallucination, cognitive impairment and sleep disorders. Nonetheless, with respect to the control population, according to logistic regression stratified by sex and adjusted by age, PD men showed a stronger positive significant association with almost all NMS compared to women, excepting for urinary disturbances. The strongest association among PD men was recorded for cognitive impairment (adjusted OR 5.44 for men and 2.82 for women) and depression (adjusted OR 30.88 for men and 12.72 for women).",

    "abstract": "Re-emergent tremor (RET) and the classical parkinsonian rest tremor were considered as two different phenomena of the same central tremor circuit. However, clinical and accelerometric characteristics of these tremors were not previously compared in a single study. We evaluated disease characteristics and accelerometric measurements of two tremor types in 42 patients with Parkinson's disease. Disease specific features and accelerometric measurements of peak frequency, amplitude at peak frequency and the root mean square (RMS) amplitude of two tremor types were compared. Eighteen patients had RET and the mean latency of the RET was 9.48 (\u00b19.2)s. Groups of only rest tremor and RET did not differ significantly in age of disease onset, disease duration and severity and mean levodopa equivalent dose. Comparison of peak frequency and amplitude at peak frequency were not different between the groups, but RMS amplitude was significantly higher in the RET group (p=0.03). RMS amplitude of RET was also correlated with disease severity (r=.48, p=0.04). These results support the previous notion that rest tremor and RET are analogue, both are triggered by the same central ossilator with RET being only the suppression of the rest tremor due to arm repositioning.",

Both motor and nonmotor scores improved, with a beneficial effect on executive functions, quality of life and apathy. Significant metabolic changes were observed, with overall increases in the right fusiform gyrus and hippocampus, alongside a decrease in the left middle frontal gyrus. Consistent correlations between significant changes in clinical scores and metabolism were established.\nWell tolerated, add-on apomorphine appears to be an interesting option for patients with fluctuations and contra-indications for DBS.

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit poor decision-making, and the underlying neural correlates are unclear. We used voxel-based morphometry with Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration through Exponentiated Lie algebra to examine this issue.\nThe decision-making abilities of 20 patients with PD and 37 healthy controls (HCs) were measured with a computerized Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). We assessed the local gray matter volumes of the patients and HCs and their correlations with decision-making performance, disease duration, disease severity, and anti-Parkinsonism medication dose.\nCompared with the HCs, the patients with PD exhibited poor IGT performances. The gray matter volumes in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, left inferior temporal cortex, and right middle frontal gyrus were decreased in the patients. Results in the regression analysis showed that lateral orbitofrontal volume correlated with performance in the IGT in PD. Regions that correlated with disease duration, severity, and medication dose did not overlap with orbitofrontal regions.\nOur results indicate that the lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex are related to decision-making in PD patients. Since the medial orbitofrontal cortex is shown to be involved in monitoring reward, reward monitoring seems to be impaired as a whole in PD patients. Meanwhile, the lateral region is related to evaluation of punishment, which is considered to have an influence on individual differences in decision-making performance in PD patients.",

Since the medial orbitofrontal cortex is shown to be involved in monitoring reward, reward monitoring seems to be impaired as a whole in PD patients. Meanwhile, the lateral region is related to evaluation of punishment, which is considered to have an influence on individual differences in decision-making performance in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Lower body mass index (BMI) is associated with orthostatic hypotension (OH) in the general population, especially in the elderly; however, no studies have addressed this issue in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nWe investigated the results of the head-up tilt test and BMI of patients with PD, and evaluated whether BMI is related to orthostatic systolic blood pressure (SBP) change during the head-up tilt test. PD patients were divided into male and female groups, and further divided into middle-aged (age<65years) and elderly (age\u226565years) subgroups in each sex.\nOH was observed in 13 of 64 male and 12 of 75 female patients with PD. BMI was lower in patients with OH than in those without, in both men and women. In the elderly group, a significant correlation between BMI and orthostatic SBP change was found (men, r=0.47, p=0.006; women, r=0.43, p=0.005), and a BMI below mean-0.5 standard deviation increased OH odds (men: BMI<20.5; odds ratio, 6.79; 95% CI, 1.06-43.36; women: BMI<18.5; odds ratio, 5.11; 95% CI, 1.05-24.96).\nLower BMI is a predisposing factor of OH in elderly patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is poorly understood; however, with the established understanding of basal ganglia function, its manifestations should be more easily interpretable. This review examines freezing of gait (FOG) from such a perspective.\nA search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from the year 2000 onward for review articles, focused on the pathophysiology of FOG, was used to determine current concepts. A previously established model of basal ganglia function was used to determine the concepts' validities. At the core of the model are deficits in motor set maintenance and timing cue production for automatic movement. It includes the shift between attention and automation to the predominant attention control of gait in PD.\nThe difficulties of the found concepts to explain FOG stem from failure to characterize different FOG components, from the assumption that all components share a similar pathophysiology, from a failure to separate basic deficits from compensatory mechanisms, and from the assumption that cognitive deficits are the cause of FOG rather than representing an inadequate compensation to FOG. Pragmatic approaches to management use the attention shift, with the provision of visual information about correct amplitude of step to correct initiation deficits, and motor blocks during gait. It also emphasizes the need to prevent step length reduction on turns, environmental situations, and cognitive overload.\nThe concept of automatic deficits in set maintenance and cue production best describe FOG manifestations in PD and, with the use of attention, the concept also provides pragmatic strategies for management.",

Although the discovery of levodopa is a prime example of successful translation of basic neuroscience into clinical routine, the history of apomorphine was based on less solid evidence. Despite this, both drugs are, more than 6 decades after the first clinical experiments, still the two most efficacious medications to treat patients with Parkinson's disease. New and promising delivery strategies for both levodopa and apomorphine are currently under investigation to further improve clinical responses.",

A definite description of the clinical characteristics of PD patients who are compound heterozygotes or homozygotes for mutations in the GBA gene (GD-PD) requires further elucidation.\nWe assessed motor, cognitive, olfactory and autonomic functions as well as demographic data and medical history in a cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish PD patients who were screened for seven common mutations in the GBA gene. We then compared three groups of patients (matched for age and disease duration) who were distinguished by their GBA mutation status, idiopathic PD (iPD), GBA heterozygote PD (GBA-PD) and GD-PD.\nOut of a total of 1050 AJ PD patients screened, 12 were found to be either homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for mutations in the GBA gene. These patients had an earlier age of onset, more severe motor impairment, poorer cognition and lower olfactory scores.

    "abstract": "GPR37 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in the brain. The precise function of GPR37 is still unknown, but a number of evidences indicate it modulates the dopaminergic system. Here, we aimed to determine the role of GPR37 on the control of cocaine-mediated electrophysiological effects (synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity) in corticostriatal synapses. Accordingly, we evaluated basal synaptic transmission and paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) in wild-type and GPR37KO mice slices. Regardless of the genotype, a low concentration of cocaine (2\u03bcM) did not modify basal synaptic transmission. Conversely, a higher dose of cocaine (30\u03bcM) decreased synaptic transmission in both genotypes, although with different intensities: approximately 30% in slices from wild-type mice and 45% in slices from GPR37-KO mice. On the other hand, no differences in PPS ratio were observed between wild-type and GPR37-KO cocaine-treated mice. Overall, our data suggest that GPR37 is involved in cocaine-induced modification of basal synaptic transmission without modifying cocaine effects in short-term plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix-based biomaterials have many advantages over synthetic polymer materials for regenerative medicine applications. In central nervous system (CNS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is widely studied as a potential agent for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the poor stability of bFGF hampered its clinical use. In this study, CNS-derived biologic scaffold containing bFGF was used to enhance and extend the neuroprotective effect of bFGF on PD targeted therapy. Decellularized brain extracellular matrix (dcBECM) was prepared by chemical extraction. The biocompatibility of dcBECM was evaluated using CCK-8 assay and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The controlled-release behavior of dcBECM containing bFGF (bFGF+dcBECM) was confirmed by ELISA assay. Furthermore, the cytocompatibility and neuroprotective effect of bFGF+dcBECM was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. From results, dcBECM showed a three-dimensional network structure with high biocompatibility. MRI of dcBECM implanted rats showed nearly seamless fusion of dcBECM with the adjoining tissues. The cumulative release rate of bFGF+dcBECM in vitro reached to 75.88% at 10h and maintained sustained release trend during the observation. ELISA results in vivo further confirmed the sustained-release behavior (from 12h to 3d) of bFGF+dcBECM in brain tissues. Among the experimental groups, bFGF+dcBECM group showed the highest cell survival rate of PD model cells, improved behavioral recovery and positive expressions of neurotrophic proteins in PD recovered rats. In conclusion, sustained neuroprotection in PD rats was achieved by using bFGF+dcBECM. The combination of dcBECM and bFGF would be a promising therapeutic strategy to realize an effective and safe alternative for CNS disease treatment.",

    "abstract": "Re-emergent tremor (RET) is a postural tremor that appears after a variable delay in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence and the clinical characteristics of RET in a population of patients with PD.\nWe consecutively assessed 210 patients with PD. We collected the patients' demographic and clinical data. RET was clinically characterized in terms of latency, severity and body side affected. We also investigated a possible relationship with motor and non-motor symptoms and differences in the clinical features in patients with and without RET.\nRET was present in 42/210 patients. The mean latency of RET was 9.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.8 seconds. Mean severity was 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9. RET was unilateral in 21 patients. Patients with RET had less severe speech, posture and gait disorders and upper limb and global bradykinesia than patients without RET. Similar findings were observed when we compared patients with RET with patients with tremor at rest associated with action tremor, patients with isolated action tremor and patients with no tremor. By contrast, patients with RET tremor did not clinically differ from those with isolated tremor at rest.\nOur results suggest that patients with RET and patients with isolated tremor at rest represent the same clinical subtype, whereas patients with action tremor (whether isolated or associated with tremor at rest) might belong to a distinct subtype that is clinically worse. Patients with RET represents a benign subtype of PD, even within the tremor-dominant phenotype.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of ethanol extract from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GP-EX) on memory deficits in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) (MPTP-lesioned mice). MPTP (30\u2009mg/kg/day, 5 days)-lesioned mice showed deficits of habit learning memory and spatial memory, which were further aggravated by treatment with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) (25\u2009mg/kg, 21 days). However, treatment with GP-EX (50\u2009mg/kg, 21 days) ameliorated memory deficits in MPTP-lesioned mice treated with L-DOPA (25\u2009mg/kg): GP-EX prevented the decreases in retention latency time in the passive avoidance test and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunopositive cells and dopamine levels in the nigrostriatum. GP-EX also reduced increases in retention transfer latency time of the elevated plus-maze test and expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and improved decreases in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus in the same models. By contrast, L-DOPA treatment (10\u2009mg/kg, 21 days) ameliorated memory deficits in MPTP-lesioned mice, which were further improved by GP-EX treatment. These results suggest that GP-EX ameliorates habit learning memory deficits by activating dopaminergic neurons and spatial memory deficits by modulating NMDA receptor-ERK1/2-CREB system in MPTP-lesioned mice treated with L-DOPA. GP-EX may serve as an adjuvant phytonutrient for memory deficits in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and characterized by motor system disorders resulting in loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. CXC195, a novel tetramethylpyrazine derivative, has been shown strongest neuroprotective effects due to its anti-apoptotic activity. However, whether CXC195 protects against DA neuronal damage in PD and the mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects are unknown. The purpose of our study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective role of CXC195 and to elucidate its mechanism of action against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced mouse model of PD. CXC195 administration improved DA neurodegeneration in PD mice induced by 6-OHDA. Our further findings confirmed treatment of CXC195 at the dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg significantly inhibited the apoptosis by decreasing the level of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, and increasing the level of Bcl-2 in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Meanwhile, 6-OHDA also decreased the amount of phosphorylated Akt while increased GSK-3\u03b2 activity (the amount of phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2 at Ser9 was decreased) which was prevented by CXC195. Wortmannin, a specific PI3K inhibitor, dramatically abolished the changes induced by CXC195. Our study firstly demonstrated that CXC195 protected against DA neurodegeneration in 6-OHDA-induced PD model by its anti-apoptotic properties and PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathway was involved in it.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of specific neurons in selected regions of the central nervous system. The main clinical manifestation (movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and/or psychiatric disturbances) depends on the neuron population being primarily affected. Parkinson's disease is a common movement disorder, whose etiology remains mostly unknown. Progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra causes an impairment of the motor control. Some of the pathogenetic mechanisms causing the progressive deterioration of these neurons are not specific for Parkinson's disease but are shared by other neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature of all the quantitative proteomic investigations of neuronal alterations in different models of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to distinguish between general and Parkinson's disease-specific pattern of neurodegeneration. Then, we merged proteomics data with genetics information from the DisGeNET database. The comparison of gene and protein information allowed us to identify 25 proteins involved uniquely in Parkinson's disease and we verified the alteration of one of them, i.e., transaldolase 1 (TALDO1), in the substantia nigra of 5 patients. By using open-source bioinformatics tools, we identified the biological processes specifically affected in Parkinson's disease, i.e., proteolysis, mitochondrion organization, and mitophagy. Eventually, we highlighted four cellular component complexes mostly involved in the pathogenesis: the proteasome complex, the protein phosphatase 2A, the chaperonins CCT complex, and the complex III of the respiratory chain.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic dysfunction in multiple system atrophy (MSA) comprises cardinal symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (OH) and urinary incontinence. Additionally, cardiovagal and sudomotor abnormalities can be present. Previous studies compared hand skin temperature and its response to cooling in subjects with probable MSA and Parkinson's disease (PD). Significant differences were found indicating that disturbed thermoregulation belongs to MSA autonomic features and could be helpful in differentiation of MSA from PD. The objective of this study was to improve our knowledge about impaired thermoregulation of distal extremities in MSA with parkinsonian features (MSA-P) and PD and to assess the possible interrelations for the different subtypes of autonomic dysfunction in a large cohort of MSA-P, PD and control patients. The patients underwent a standard cooling-rewarming procedure, termed ice test (IT). Electroneurography, heart rate variability, sympathetic skin response and orthostatic tests were performed for the subdivision of the patients. The prevalence of pathological IT was slightly increased in MSA compared with PD and control groups. The presence of pathological IT was related with older patient's age in PD and control groups significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This relation was absent for the MSA patients, who themselves were significantly younger (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Significant association between the presence of pathological IT and OH was determined (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Defective thermoregulation of distal extremities seems to be more severe in the MSA patients. The dysfunction of preganglionic sympathetic neurons might be involved in impaired response to cooling for MSA. The results suggest pathophysiological affinity of impaired sympathetic neurovascular regulation between pathological IT and OH.",

    "abstract": "Motor cortex plasticity is reported to be decreased in Parkinson's disease in studies which pooled patients in various stages of the disease. Whether the early decrease in plasticity is related to the motor signs or is linked to the future development of motor complications of treatment is unclear. The aim of the study was to test if motor cortex plasticity and its cerebellar modulation are impaired in treatment-na\u00efve Parkinson's disease, are related to the motor signs of the disease and predict occurrence of motor complications of treatment.\nTwenty-nine denovo patients with Parkinson's disease were longitudinally assessed for motor complications for four years. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, the plasticity of the motor cortex and its cerebellar modulation were measured (response to paired-associative stimulation alone or preceded by 2 active cerebellar stimulation protocols), both in the untreated state and after a single dose of L-DOPA. Twenty-six matched, healthy volunteers were tested, only without L-DOPA.\nPatients and healthy controls had similar proportions of responders and non-responders to plasticity induction. In the untreated state, the more efficient was the cerebellar modulation of motor cortex plasticity, the lower were the bradykinesia and rigidity scores. The extent of the individual plastic response to paired associative stimulation could indicate a vulnerability to develop early motor fluctuation but not dyskinesia.\nMeasuring motor cortex plasticity in denovo Parkinson's disease could be a neurophysiological parameter that may help identify patients with greater propensity for early motor fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is best managed by a combination of medication and regular physiotherapy. In this context, virtual reality (VR) technology is proposed as a new rehabilitation tool with a possible added value over traditional physiotherapy approaches. It potentially optimises motor learning in a safe environment, and by replicating real-life scenarios could help improve functional activities of daily living.\nThe objective of this review was to summarise the current best evidence for the effectiveness of VR interventions for the rehabilitation of people with PD in comparison with 1) active interventions, and 2) passive interventions. Our primary goal was to determine the effect of VR training on gait and balance. Secondary goals included examining the effects of VR on global motor function, activities of daily living, quality of life, cognitive function, exercise adherence, and the occurrence of adverse events.\nWe identified relevant articles through electronic searches of the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), online trials registers, and by handsearching reference lists. We carried out all searches up until 26 November 2016.\nWe searched for randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of VR exercise interventions in people with PD. We included only trials where motor rehabilitation was the primary goal.\nTwo review authors independently searched for trials that corresponded to the predefined inclusion criteria. We independently extracted and assessed all data for methodological quality. A third review author was responsible for conflict resolution when required.\nWe included 8 trials involving 263 people with PD in the review. Risk of bias was unclear or high for all but one of the included studies. Study sample sizes were small, and there was a large amount of heterogeneity between trials with regard to study design and the outcome measures used. As a result, we graded the quality of the evidence as low or very low. Most of the studies intended to improve motor function using commercially available devices, which were compared with physiotherapy. The interventions lasted for between 4 and 12 weeks.In comparison to physiotherapy, VR may lead to a moderate improvement in step and stride length (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.08; 3 studies; 106 participants; low-quality evidence). VR and physiotherapy interventions may have similar effects on gait (SMD 0.20, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.55; 4 studies; 129 participants; low-quality evidence), balance (SMD 0.34, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.71; 5 studies; 155 participants; low-quality evidence), and quality of life (mean difference 3.73 units, 95% CI -2.16 to 9.61; 4 studies; 106 participants). VR interventions did not lead to any reported adverse events, and exercise adherence did not differ between VR and other intervention arms.The evidence available comparing VR exercise with a passive control was more limited. The evidence for the main outcomes of interest was of very low quality due to the very small sample sizes of the two studies available for this comparison.\nWe found low-quality evidence of a positive effect of short-term VR exercise on step and stride length. VR and physiotherapy may have similar effects on gait, balance, and quality of life. The evidence available comparing VR with passive control interventions was more limited. Additional high-quality, large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to identify molecular targets that have important roles in the progression of Parkinson's disease. The gene expression profile dataset GSE7621 and the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile dataset GSE16658 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. R programing software was used to identify differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. Subsequently, enriched Gene Ontology terms of differentially expressed genes were obtained using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using the starBase database and a miRNA\u2011gene regulatory network was constructed using Cytoscape software. A total of 391\u00a0differentially expressed genes and 88\u00a0differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. Gene Ontology terms that were associated with nervous system activity, including synapse and dopamine metabolic process, were shown to be enriched in the differentially expressed genes. A total of 620\u00a0target genes were identified from the differentially expressed miRNAs, and 10\u00a0overlaps were identified between these target genes and differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, 10\u00a0miRNA\u2011gene regulation pairs were obtained between the overlaps and differentially expressed miRNAs. In conclusion, the present study used bioinformatics analysis of gene and miRNA expression profile datasets, and identified potential therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease\u00a0(PD) is a common progressive and multifactorial neurodegenerative disease, characterized by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Numerous pathological processes including, inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotransmitter imbalance, and apoptosis as well as genetic factors may lead to neuronal degeneration. Motor deficits in PD are due mostly to the progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Neuroprotection of functional neurons is of significance in the treatment of PD. G\u00a0protein\u2011coupled receptors\u00a0(GPCRs) have been implicated in the neuroprotection against PD through the survival of dopaminergic neurons. In addition, phosphatidyl\u2011inositol\u20113\u2011kinase\u00a0(PI3K)/AKT\u00a0signaling has also been demonstrated to be neuroprotective. Knowledge of the mechanisms involved in this cellular protection could be critical for developing treatments to prevent this neurodegenerative disorder. In this review, we highlight the protective roles of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the function of representative serotonin GPCRs. Particular attention is given to the molecular mechanisms of this pathway proposed to explain the favorable effects of food ingredients against neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to examine the frequency, development, concomitants, and risk factors of falls in a population-based incident Parkinson's disease (PD) cohort. One hundred eighty-one drug-na\u00efve patients with incident PD and 173 normal controls recruited from the Norwegian ParkWest study were prospectively monitored over 7\u00a0years. Information on falls was obtained biannually from patients, and at baseline and after 1, 3, 5, and 7\u00a0years of follow-up in control subjects. Generalized estimating equation models for correlated data were applied to investigate concomitant features of falls and risk factors for incident falls during 7\u00a0years of follow-up in PD. Overall, 64.1% of patients reported falling during the study period. The 7-year cumulative incidence of falls in non-falling patients at baseline (n\u00a0=\u00a0153) was 57.5%, with a relative risk to controls of at least 3.1 (95% confidence interval 1.5-6.3; p\u00a0<\u00a00.002). Significant concomitants of falls in patients during the study period were higher age, Unified PD Rating Scale motor score, postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGD) phenotype, dementia, and follow-up time. Higher age at baseline, PIGD phenotype at 1-year visit, and follow-up time were independent risk factors for incident falls during follow-up. Nearly two-thirds of patients in the general PD population experience falls within 7 years of diagnosis, representing a more than threefold increased risk compared to age- and gender-matched controls. Patients with higher age at baseline and early PIGD have the greatest risk of falling and may, therefore, be the prime target of specialized assessment and treatment interventions.",

    "abstract": "In the course of Parkinson's disease (PD), oral medication may lose its effectiveness due to several reasons, like dysphagia, impaired absorption from the gastro-intestinal tract and delayed emptying of the stomach. If these problems occur, a non-oral therapy should be considered. Examples of non-oral therapies are transdermal patches, (e.g. rotigotine) which may overcome motor and nonmotor nighttime problems, and may serve as well to treat daytime response-fluctuations, if oral therapies fail to do so. Other options are injections with apomorphine to treat early morning dystonia and random off-periods during daytime, as well as continuously infused subcutaneous apomorphine for random fluctuations in PD patients. Low-dose apomorphine infusions also may be useful in the peri-operative phase, when PD patients may not be able to swallow oral medication. Finally, levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) infusions or DBS have shown to be effective non-oral options to treat PD patients adequately, if they are not properly controlled by oral options.",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythm is manifested by the behavioral and physiological changes from day to night, which is controlled by the pacemaker and its regulator. The former is located at the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus, while the latter is composed of clock genes present in all tissues. Circadian desynchronization influences normal patterns of day-night rhythms such as sleep and alertness cycles, rest and activity cycles. Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibits diurnal fluctuations. Circadian dysfunction has been observed in PD patients and animal models, which may result in negative consequences to the homeostasis and even exacerbate the disease progression. Therefore, circadian therapies, including light stimulation, physical activity, dietary and social schedules, may be helpful for PD patients. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the circadian dysfunction in PD remain elusive. Further research on circadian patterns is needed. This article summarizes the existing research on the circadian rhythms in PD, focusing on the clinical symptom variations, molecular changes, as well as the available treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently associated with vasomotor symptoms such as distal cold limbs or sensitivity to cold. Coldness of the lower limbs (COL) usually occurs in winter and is often accompanied by pain, potentially causing difficulty in walking or standing. A standard dopaminergic treatment for such symptoms is yet to be established. We describe two patients with PD, who had severe COL during summer. For example, the patients wore many pairs of socks or used heating appliances in the summer. Severe COL can occur in summertime and can be intolerable or unpleasant, since it can worsen disability. The treatment with a dopamine agonist did not sufficiently decrease the severity of COL.",

The underlying mechanisms of this decline are not well understood. The present focused review assesses the evidence for the reliability of the often-reported decline of verbal fluency, as well as the evidence for the suggested mechanisms including disease progression, reduced medication levels, electrode positions, and stimulation effect vs. surgical effects. Finally, we highlight the need for more systematic investigations of the large degree of heterogeneity in the prevalence of verbal fluency worsening after DBS, as well as provide suggestions for future research.",

    "abstract": "As Parkinson's disease progresses, a massive loss of dopaminergic neurons is accompanied by accumulation of alpha-Synuclein (\u03b1Syn) neuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Inclusions first appear in olfactory bulb and enteric neurons then in ascendant neuroanatomical interconnected areas, and finally, in late stages of the disease, Lewy bodies are observed in a substantia nigra pars compacta with clear signs of neuronal loss. It is believed that the spreading of Lewy bodies through the nervous system is a consequence of the cell-to-cell propagation of \u03b1Syn, that can occur via sequential steps of secretion and uptake. Certain pathological forms of transmitted \u03b1Syn are able to seed endogenous counterparts in healthy recipient cells, thus promoting the self-sustained cycle of inclusion formation, amplification and spreading, that ultimately underlies disease progression. Here we review the cell-to-cell propagation of \u03b1Syn focusing on its role in the progression of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable and safe delivery of brain-targeted drugs is highly important for successful therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study was designed to formulate biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs), which were surface-modified with lactoferrin (Lf), for efficient intranasal delivery of rotigotine to the brain for the treatment of PD. Rotigotine NPs were prepared by nanoprecipitation, and the effect of various independent process variables on the resulting properties of NPs was investigated by a Box-Behnken experimental design. The physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of the NPs and Lf-NPs were characterized, and the release kinetics suggested that both NPs and Lf-NPs provided continuous, slow release of rotigotine for 48 h. Neither rotigotine NPs nor Lf-NPs reduced the viability of 16HBE and SH-SY5Y cells; in contrast, free rotigotine was cytotoxic. Qualitative and quantitative cellular uptake studies demonstrated that accumulation of Lf-NPs was greater than that of NPs in 16HBE and SH-SY5Y cells. Following intranasal administration, brain delivery of rotigotine was much more effective with Lf-NPs than with NPs. The brain distribution of rotigotine was heterogeneous, with a higher concentration in the striatum, the primary region affected in PD. This strongly suggested that Lf-NPs enable the targeted delivery of rotigotine for the treatment of PD. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Lf-NPs have potential as a carrier for nose-to-brain delivery of rotigotine for the treatment of PD.",

All patients of PD visiting neurology outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital.\nA total of 150 patients were screened, and 104 were included in this study. They were divided into - Group I with fatigue (score of >4 in each item) and Group II without fatigue.\nData were analyzed by SPSS software version 20.0. Spearman correlation was used to evaluate the convergent validity of the FSS-Ind score with PD-related variables. The principal components analysis was applied to detect the domain structure of the FSS.\nOf the total 104 patients, 68 (65.3%) patients experienced fatigue. The duration of disease was significantly more (\nTranslated version of the FSS, FSS-Ind has high internal consistency and validity which supports its application as an effective tool in detecting fatigue in patients with PD.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of neuromelanin (NM)-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), and it is divided into two motor subtypes: the postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) and the tremor dominant (TD) subtypes. With NM-sensitive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NM-MRI), investigators have been able to accurately detect signal attenuation in SNc of PD; however, the difference of NM loss between PIGD and TD subtypes is still unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in NM-MRI between PD motor subtypes. PD patients were classified into PIGD (n=14) and TD groups (n=9); 20 age and sex matched controls were recruited. We compared the signal intensity contrast ratios in medial and lateral regions of the SNc using NM-MRI in PIGD, TD, and controls, respectively. Remarkable signal attenuation was observed in the lateral part of SNc in PD when compared with the controls, and we were able to detect more severe signal attenuation in the medial part of SNc in PIGD patients in comparison with that in the TD group. Also, the medial part of SNc, ipsilateral to the most clinically affected side, showed the highest power to discriminate the PD motor subtypes (AUC, 81%; sensitivity, 71.4%; specificity, 77.8%). Our results indicated a potential diagnostic value of NM-MRI to discriminate the PD motor subtypes, providing new evidence for the neuropathology-based differences between the two subtypes.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of imposed faster and slower walking speeds on postural stability in people with Parkinson disease (PD).\nCross-sectional cohort study.\nGeneral community.\nPatients with PD (n=84; 51 with a falls history; 33 without) and age-matched controls (n=82) were invited to participate via neurology clinics and preexisting databases. Of those contacted, 99 did not respond (PD=36; controls=63) and 27 were not interested (PD=18; controls=9). After screening, a further 10 patients were excluded; 5 had deep brain stimulation surgery and 5 could not accommodate to the treadmill. The remaining patients (N=30) completed all assessments and were subdivided into PD fallers (n=10), PD nonfallers (n=10), and age-matched controls (n=10) based on falls history.\nNot applicable.\nThree-dimensional accelerometers assessed head and trunk accelerations and allowed calculation of harmonic ratios and root mean square (RMS) accelerations to assess segment control and movement amplitude.\nSymptom severity, balance confidence, and medical history were established before participants walked on a treadmill at 70%, 100%, and 130% of their preferred speed. Head and trunk control was lower for PD fallers than PD nonfallers and older adults. Significant interactions indicated head and trunk control increased with speed for PD nonfallers and older adults, but did not improve at faster speeds for PD fallers. Vertical head and trunk accelerations increased with walking speed for PD nonfallers and older adults, while the PD fallers demonstrated greater anteroposterior RMS accelerations compared with both other groups.\nThe results suggest that improved gait dynamics do not necessarily represent improved walking stability, and this must be respected when rehabilitating gait in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "The upper body accelerations of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) measured by inertial measurement units (IMUs) may contribute towards diagnostic algorithms and help track disease progression. Before extracting variables related to upper body motion, acceleration signals require realignment to a global reference; however, the impact of these techniques on the resulting upper body variables is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to examine the impact of four different realignment methods designed to correct acceleration signals on a range of upper body variables in older adults and in patients with PD. Two minutes of continuous gait were measured in 54 community-dwelling older adults (71.1\u00b16.7\u2009years) and 60 people with PD (age: 68.5\u00b19.1\u2009years). Three IMUs placed on the 5th lumbar vertebra, 7th cervical vertebra and the back of the head recorded the acceleration of the upper body. A selection of upper body variables sensitive to impaired upper body control in PD and four acceleration realignment methods were compared. A mixed-model ANOVA showed that the choice of realignment method significantly affected the values of upper body variables as well as their ability to discriminate between the PD and control group. Our findings indicate researchers and clinicians should be cautious when comparing upper body variables extracted from IMUs using different realignment methods, and consideration of realignment technique will be important when identifying the most sensitive markers of disease presence and progression. Therefore, it's strongly recommend that researchers consider and report their realignment methods when assessing upper body variables during gait.",

We included 17 PD patients with the end-of-dose myoclonus and 16 PD patients without myoclonus between January 2010 and June 2011. Surface electromyography of upper extremity muscles and long latency reflexes (LLRs) were performed. Positive or negative myoclonus with a duration of 35-100\u00a0ms was observed. Rest tremor was less frequent in the group with myoclonus. Only one PD patient with myoclonus had C reflex. Mean LLR amplitude was significantly high in PD with myoclonus compared to the group without myoclonus (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024). Dopaminergic treatment unrelated myoclonus is less related to rest tremor in PD, may be positive or negative, and exhibits similar features to cortical myoclonus.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease uses bi-hemispheric high-frequency stimulation within the subthalamus, however, the specific impacts of bilaterality of DBS are still not clear. Thus, we aimed to study the individual-level clinical impact of locations of right-left contact pair-up accounting for each subthalamic nucleus (STN) anatomy.\nContact locations and effects at 1 year were studied retrospectively in an unselected series of 53 patients operated between 2004 and 2010. Location of contacts was defined relatively to the main axis of STN used to map longitudinal and transversal positions, and STN membership (out meaning out-of-STN). Contact pairings were described via three methods: (i) Unified contact location (UCL) collapsing DBS into an all-in-one contact; (ii) balance of contact pair-up (BCPU), defined as symmetric or asymmetric regardless of laterality; (iii) hemisphere-wise most frequent contact pair-up (MFCP) regardless of BCPU. Clinical data were: mean levodopa equivalent dose, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score III without medication, UPDRS II and III speech sub-scores, UPDRS II freezing sub-score, 1 year versus preoperative values, with and without levodopa. Ad-hoc two-sided tests were used for statistical analysis.\nWorsening speech, was more frequent for UCL_out patients and when the left MFCP contact was rear and/or superolateral, however, it less frequent for BCPU-asymmetric patients. Worsening freezing was more frequent when the right MFCP contact was rear and superolateral.\nThese results point to strategies for minimizing dysarthria and freezing as adverse effects of DBS.",

Deep brain stimulation is generally reserved for patients who become refractory to l-dopa treatment.\nWe present a male patient with a 9-year course of PD who at 53 years of age preferred deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus over initial l-dopa treatment. The patient argued that he wanted to avoid the serious adverse effects of l-dopa, which would have presented within his time of full professional activity. DBS resulted in significant motor improvement lasting for 6 years without l-dopa treatment.\nLarge multicentre-based international trials with long follow-ups are needed to answer the effectiveness of early DBS in PD.",

    "abstract": "Iron accumulation in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) has been proved to be a prominent pathophysiological feature of Parkinson's diseases (PD), which can induce the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, up-regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and further loss of motor control. In recent years, iron chelation therapy has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for PD, which has shown significant improvements in clinical trials. However, the current iron chelators are suboptimal due to their short circulation time, side effects, and lack of proper protection from chelation with ions in blood circulation. In this work, we designed and constructed iron chelation therapeutic nanoparticles protected by a zwitterionic poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) to delay the saturation of iron chelators in blood circulation and prolong the in vivo lifetime, with HIV-1 trans-activating transcriptor (TAT) served as a shuttle to enhance the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. We explored and investigated whether the Parkinsonian neurodegeneration and the corresponding symptoms in behaviors and physiologies could be prevented or reversed both in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated that iron chelator loaded therapeutic nanoparticles could reverse functional deficits in Parkinsonian mice not only physiologically but also behaviorally. On the contrary, both untreated PD mice and non-TAT anchored nanoparticle treated PD mice showed similar loss in DA neurons and difficulties in behaviors. Therefore, with protection of zwitterionic polymer and prolonged in vivo lifetime, iron chelator loaded nanoparticles with delayed saturation provide a PD phenotype reversion therapy and significantly improve the living quality of the Parkinsonian mice.",

    "abstract": "The addition of oral entacapone to levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel treatment leads to less conversion of levodopa to 3-O-methyldopa, thereby increasing levodopa plasma concentration. The objective of this study was to compare systemic levodopa exposure of the newly developed levodopa-entacapone-carbidopa intestinal gel after a 20% dose reduction with levodopa exposure after the usual levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel dose in a randomized crossover trial in advanced Parkinson's disease patients.\nIn this 48-hour study, 11 patients treated with levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel were randomized to a treatment sequence. Blood samples were drawn at prespecified times, and patient motor function was assessed according to the treatment response scale.\nSystemic exposure of levodopa did not differ significantly between treatments (ratio, 1.10 [95% confidence interval, 0.951-1.17]). Treatment response scale scores did not significantly differ between treatments (P\u2009=\u20090.84).\nLevodopa-entacapone-carbidopa intestinal gel allowed a lower amount of levodopa administration and was well tolerated. Long-term studies are needed to confirm the results. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation has been described as a common hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and is believed to further exacerbate the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Current therapies are unable to prevent the disease progression. A significant association has been demonstrated between PD and low levels of vitamin D in patients serum, and vitamin D supplement appears to have a beneficial clinical effect. Herein, we investigated whether vitamin D administered orally in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced preclinical animal model of PD protects against glia-mediated inflammation and nigrostriatal neurodegeneration. Vitamin D significantly attenuated the MPTP-induced loss of tyrosine hydrlase (TH)-positive neuronal cells, microglial cell activation (Iba1-immunoreactive), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and TLR-4 expression, typical hallmarks of the pro-inflammatory (M1) activation of microglia. Additionally, Vitamin D was able to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression in distinct brain areas of the MPTP mouse. Importantly, we also assessed the anti-inflammatory property of vitamin D in the MPTP mouse, in which it upregulated the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2) mRNA expression as well as increasing the expression of CD163, CD206 and CD204, typical hallmarks of alternative activation of microglia for anti-inflammatory signalling (M2). Collectively, these results demonstrate that vitamin D exhibits substantial neuroprotective effects in this PD animal model, by attenuating pro-inflammatory and up-regulating anti-inflammatory processes.",

    "abstract": "To examine the development of factors associated with insomnia in a cohort of originally drug-naive patients with incident Parkinson disease (PD) during the first 5 years after diagnosis.\nOne hundred eighty-two drug-naive patients with PD derived from a population-based incident cohort and 202 control participants were assessed for insomnia before treatment initiation and were repeatedly examined after 1, 3, and 5 years. Insomnia was diagnosed according to the Stavanger Sleepiness Questionnaire. The Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale was used to differentiate sleep initiation problems from problems of sleep maintenance. Generalized estimating equation models were applied for statistical measures.\nThe prevalence of insomnia in general was not higher in patients with PD compared to controls at the 5-year follow-up. There were changes in the prevalence of the different insomnia subtypes over the 5-year follow-up. The prevalence of solitary problems in sleep maintenance increased from 31% (n = 18) in the drug-naive patients at baseline to 49% (n = 29) after 1 year and were associated with the use of dopamine agonists and higher Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale scores. The prevalence of solitary sleep initiation problems decreased continuously from 21% (n = 12) at baseline to 7.4% (n = 4) after 5 years; these were associated with less daytime sleepiness.\nThe prevalence rates of the different insomnia subtypes changed notably in patients with early PD. The frequency of sleep maintenance problems increased, and these problems were associated with dopamine agonist use and depressive symptoms, while the total number of patients with insomnia remained stable. Our findings reflect the need for early individual assessments of insomnia subtypes and raise the possibility of intervention to reduce these symptoms in patients with early PD.",

    "abstract": "More than 10% of patients clinically diagnosed with Parkinson disease demonstrate normal dopamine uptake on dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DaTscan), but little is known about how cognitive function differs between patients with dopamine deficiency on DaTscan and patients with scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD). We compared the cognitive function of these two groups of patients over 2 years.\nWe retrospectively analyzed data obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative on 309 participants clinically diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson disease who had scored in the normal range on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment at baseline and had completed 1- and 2-year follow-up visits. We compared the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores at 1 and 2 years between the 42 participants with SWEDD and the 267 with dopamine deficiency.\nMean cognitive scores did not differ significantly between groups at 1 year, but at 2 years the participants with SWEDD performed more poorly. At 2 years, 31% of the participants with SWEDD versus 15% of those with dopamine deficiency had statistically reliable cognitive impairment.\nThis study provides evidence that some individuals clinically diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson disease but with SWEDD demonstrate early cognitive decline. The results also suggest that recently diagnosed patients with SWEDD may be at even greater risk for cognitive decline than patients with DaTscan-confirmed early-stage Parkinson disease. While patients with SWEDD likely represent a heterogeneous group of etiologies, our results highlight the need to monitor these patients' cognitive function over time.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp31p is a DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI family protein that was previously shown to be important for survival in the stationary phase of growth and under oxidative stress. Recently, it was identified as a chaperone or as glutathione-independent glyoxalase. To elucidate the role played by this protein in budding yeast cells, we investigated its involvement in the protection against diverse environmental stresses. Our study revealed that HSP31 gene expression is controlled by multiple transcription factors, including Yap1p, Cad1p, Msn2p, Msn4p, Haa1p and Hsf1p. These transcription factors mediate the HSP31 promoter responses to oxidative, osmotic and thermal stresses, to potentially toxic products of glycolysis, such as methylglyoxal and acetic acid, and to the diauxic shift. We also demonstrated that the absence of the HSP31 gene sensitizes cells to these stressors. Overproduction of Hsp31p and its homologue Hsp32p rescued the sensitivity of glo1\u0394 cells to methylglyoxal. Hsp31p also reversed the increased sensitivity of the ald6\u0394 strain to acetic acid. Since Hsp31p glyoxalase III coexists in S. cerevisiae cells with thousand-fold more potent glyoxalase I/II system, its biological purpose requires substantiation. We postulate that S. cerevisiae Hsp31p may have broader substrate specificity than previously proposed and is able to eliminate various toxic products of glycolysis. Alternatively, Hsp31p might be effective under high concentration of exogenous methylglyoxal present in some natural environmental niches populated by budding yeast, when glyoxalase I/II system capacity is saturated.",

In addition, disease severity was assessed using clinical scales such as Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn & Yahr scale, and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39.\nStep and stride lengths, gait speed, and step-time variability were improved significantly (P<.05) because of 12-week polestriding intervention. Also, the UPDRS motor score, the UPDRS axial score, and the scores of UPDRS subscales on walking and balance improved significantly after the intervention.\nBecause increased step-time variability and decreased step and stride lengths are associated with PD severity and an increased risk of falls in PD, the observed improvements suggest that regular practice of polestriding may reduce the risk of falls and improve mobility in people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Altered movement control is typically the first noticeable symptom manifested by Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Once under treatment, the effect of the medication is very patent and patients often recover correct movement control over several hours. Nonetheless, as the disease advances, patients present motor complications. Obtaining precise information on the long-term evolution of these motor complications and their short-term fluctuations is crucial to provide optimal therapy to PD patients and to properly measure the outcome of clinical trials. This paper presents an algorithm based on the accelerometer signals provided by a waist sensor that has been validated in the automatic assessment of patient's motor fluctuations (ON and OFF motor states) during their activities of daily living. A total of 15 patients have participated in the experiments in ambulatory conditions during 1 to 3 days. The state recognised by the algorithm and the motor state annotated by patients in standard diaries are contrasted. Results show that the average specificity and sensitivity are higher than 90%, while their values are higher than 80% of all patients, thereby showing that PD motor status is able to be monitored through a single sensor during daily life of patients in a precise and objective way.",

    "abstract": "We present our experience at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), describing our surgical technique, and reporting our clinical results, and morbidities. Twenty patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) who underwent bilateral STN-DBS were studied. Patients were assessed preoperatively and followed up for one year using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) in \"on\" and \"off\" medication and \"on\" and \"off\" stimulation conditions. At one-year follow-up, we calculated significant improvement in all the motor aspects of PD (UPDRS III) and in activities of daily living (UPDRS II) in the \"off\" medication state. The \"off\" medication UPDRS improved by 49.3%, tremors improved by 81.6%, rigidity improved by 50.0%, and bradykinesia improved by 39.3%. The \"off\" medication UPDRS II scores improved by 73.8%. The Levodopa equivalent daily dose was reduced by 54.1%. The UPDRS IVa score (dyskinesia) was reduced by 65.1%. The UPDRS IVb score (motor fluctuation) was reduced by 48.6%. Deep brain stimulation of the STN improves the cardinal motor manifestations of the idiopathic PD. It also improves activities of daily living, and reduces medication-induced complications.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether iron deposition in deep brain nuclei assessed using high-pass filtered phase imaging plays a role in motor disease severity in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nSeventy patients with mild to moderate PD and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) underwent susceptibility-weighted imaging on a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Phase shifts (radians) in deep brain nuclei were derived from high-pass filtered phase images and compared between groups. Analysis of clinical laterality and correlations with motor severity (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III, UPDRS-III) were performed. Phase shifts (in radians) were compared between HVs and three PD subgroups divided according to UPDRS-III scores using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age and regional area.\nParkinson's disease patients had significantly (P < 0.001) higher radians than HVs bilaterally in the putamen, globus pallidus and substantia nigra (SN). The SN contralateral to the most affected side showed higher radians (P < 0.001) compared to the less affected side. SN radians positively correlated with UPDRS-III and bradykinesia-rigidity subscores, but not with tremor subscores. ancova followed by post hoc Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons revealed that SN radians were significantly greater in the PD subgroup with higher UPDRS-III scores compared to both lowest UPDRS-III PD and HV groups (P < 0.001).\nIncreased nigral iron accumulation in PD appears to be stratified according to disease motor severity and correlates with symptoms related to dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This semi-quantitative in vivo iron assessment could prove useful for objectively monitoring PD progression, especially in clinical trials concerning iron chelation therapies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by intracellular, insoluble Lewy bodies composed of highly stable \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) amyloid fibrils. \u03b1-synuclein is an intrinsically disordered protein that has the capacity to assemble to form \u03b2-sheet rich fibrils. Oxidiative stress and metal rich environments have been implicated in triggering assembly. Here, we have explored the composition of Lewy bodies in post-mortem tissue using electron microscopy and immunogold labeling and revealed dityrosine crosslinks in Lewy bodies in brain tissue from PD patients. In vitro, we show that dityrosine cross-links in \u03b1-syn are formed by covalent ortho-ortho coupling of two tyrosine residues under conditions of oxidative stress by fluorescence and confirmed using mass-spectrometry. A covalently cross-linked dimer isolated by SDS-PAGE and mass analysis showed that dityrosine dimer was formed via the coupling of Y39-Y39 to give a homo dimer peptide that may play a key role in formation of oligomeric and seeds for fibril formation. Atomic force microscopy analysis reveals that the covalent dityrosine contributes to the stabilization of \u03b1-syn assemblies. Thus, the presence of oxidative stress induced dityrosine could play an important role in assembly and toxicity of \u03b1-syn in PD.",

To systematically analyze the anti-parkinsonian activity of echinacoside (ECH) in a neurotoxic model of PD and provide a future basis for basic and clinical investigations, male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into blank control, PD model and ECH-administration groups. ECH significantly suppressed the dopaminergic neuron loss (P\u2009<\u20090.01) caused by MPTP and maintained dopamine content (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and dopamine metabolite content (P\u2009<\u20090.05) compared with that measured in mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced damage. Additionally, ECH inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the substantia nigra, which suggested the involvement of neuroinflammation. The relevant cytokines were detected with a Proteome Profiler Array, which confirmed that ECH participated in the regulation of seven cytokines. Given that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and NF-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) signals are considered to be closely related to neuroninflammation, the gene expression levels of p38MAPK and six NF-\u03baB DNA-binding subunits were assessed. Western blotting analysis showed that both p38MAPK and the NF-\u03baB p52 subunit were upregulated in the MPTP group and that ECH downregulated their expressions. Minocycline was administered as the positive control to inhibit neuroinflammation, and no differences were detected between the minocycline- and ECH-mediated inhibition of the p38MAPK and NF-\u03baB p52 signals. In conclusion, echinacoside is a potential novel orally active compound for regulating neuroinflammation and related signals in Parkinson's disease and may provide a new prospect for clinical treatment.",

In July 2014, she came to our hospital, of which she lived in the neighborhood. In the last part of December 2014, she felt uneasy about her fecal smell and saw a psychiatrist in the first part of January 2015. Quetiapine (25\u2005mg/day) was added. In the last part of January, she complained of fecal smell everywhere and could not take a meal. No-one else could detect the smell. A diagnosis of olfactory hallucination was made. The next day after increasing to 75mg/day, however, she was admitted to our hospital because of refusing to take medicine. After introducing donepezil, olfactory hallucination subsided and her appetite was improved.

    "abstract": "Apomorphine is often considered an archetypal dopamine agonist used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it can be clearly differentiated from most other commonly used dopamine agonists on the basis of its pharmacology and on its unique clinical profile. Like levodopa and dopamine, apomorphine acts as a potent, direct and broad spectrum dopamine agonist activating all dopamine receptor subtypes. It also has affinity for serotonin receptors, and \u03b1-adrenergic receptors. Apomorphine is usually titrated to a dose that provides an equivalent antiparkinsonian response to that provided by levodopa, and its subcutaneous delivery allows a rapid onset of action, usually within 7-10\u00a0min. The mode of apomorphine delivery impacts on its clinical profile so as to provide two very different approaches to therapy in PD. When administered as an acute subcutaneous injection, it induces reliable and rapid relief from OFF periods underscoring its utility as a rescue medication. When given as a subcutaneous infusion, it significantly improves overall daily OFF time and there is also evidence to suggest that, in those patients who replace most or all of their oral drugs with apomorphine infusion, dyskinesia may also improve. In this paper, we review the rich pharmacology of apomorphine and review its efficacy in PD based on data from clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory abnormalities are often overlooked; however, because of their potential comorbidity, they must be analyzed to determine the most effective treatment for patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Among various theories on respiratory abnormalities in PD, \"upper airway obstruction\" and \"restrictive respiratory disorders\" are 2 of the most accepted etiologies; both appear to be related to basal ganglia dysfunction. Complex vocal cord muscle dysfunction contributes to stridor, which can be a manifestation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction. Stridor is a lethal form of upper airway obstruction in PD patients; its most frequent causes are bilateral vocal cord palsy, laryngeal spasms, and dystonia of the supra-laryngeal muscle. Several previous studies have suggested that levodopa administration induces a significant improvement of both lung function and symptoms of parkinsonian syndrome.\nWe reported a 77-year-old gentleman PD patient admitted for acute levodopa-responsive stridor resulting from bilateral vocal cord palsy. Dopaminergic therapy prevented the need for subsequent endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy treatment.\nIt is vital to understand that complex vocal cord muscle dysfunction may be related to nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction in PD patients. The strategy of levodopa up-titration should be considered an option because it may be beneficial in relieving both stridor and parkinsonian syndrome, and in preventing respiratory failure.",

Older patients are more likely to have olfactory dysfunction before MS than younger patients. Rapid eye movement behavior disorder is more prone to happen in patients with older age, older onset age, more severe depression, sleep problems, and autonomic dysfunctions. Patients with rapid eye movement behavior disorder before MS are older in onset age than after group.Olfactory dysfunction, constipation, rapid eye movement behavior disorder, and depression, as early warning NMSs of PD, connected to each other.

    "abstract": "Neurotrophic factors are essential for neuronal survival, plasticity, and development and have been implicated in the action mechanism of antidepressants. In this study, we assessed the neurotrophic factor-inducing and neuroprotective properties of antidepressants. In the first part of the study, we found that fluoxetine, imipramine, and milnacipran (i.p., 20\u00a0mg/kg/day for 1\u00a0week or 3\u00a0weeks) upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the striatum and substantia nigra both at 1\u00a0week and 3\u00a0weeks. In contrast, an increase in the glial-derived neurotrophic factor was more obvious at 3\u00a0weeks after the antidepressants treatment. Specifically, it was found that fluoxetine and imipramine are more potent in raising the levels of neurotrophic factors than milnacipran. Furthermore, antidepressants elevated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated-protein kinase (ERK1/2) and the serine/threonine kinase Akt. In the second part of the study, we compared the neuroprotective effects of fluoxetine, imipramine, and milnacipran in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of Parkinson's disease. Pretreament with fluoxetine, imipramine or milnacipran for 3\u00a0weeks reduced MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and microglial activation in the nigrostriatal pathway. Neurochemical analysis by HPLC exhibited that antidepressants attenuated the depletion of striatal dopamine. In consistent, beam test showed that behavioral impairment was ameliorated by antidepressants. Neuroprotective effects were more prominent in the fluoxetine or imipramine treatment group than in milnacipran treatment group. Finally, we found that neuroprotection of the antidepressants against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells was attenuated by ERK or Akt inhibitor. These results indicate that neuroprotection by antidepressants might be associated with the induction of neurotrophic factors, and antidepressant could be a potential therapeutic intervention for treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in PINK1 (PARK6), a serine/threonine kinase involved in mitochondrial homeostasis, are associated with early onset Parkinson's disease. Fibroblasts from Parkinson's disease patients with compound heterozygous mutations in exon 7 (c.1488 + 1G > A; c.1252_1488del) showed no apparent signs of mitochondrial impairment. To elucidate changes primarily caused by lack of functional PINK1, we over-expressed wild-type PINK1, which induced a significant downregulation of LRRK2 (PARK8). Indeed, we found that LRRK2 protein basal levels were significantly higher in the mutant PINK1 fibroblasts. To examine the interaction between the two PARK genes in a disease-relevant cell context, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from mutant, carrier and control fibroblasts by lentiviral-mediated re-programming. Efficiency of neural induction and dopamine differentiation using a floor-plate induction protocol was similar in all genotypes. As observed in fibroblasts, PINK1 mutant neurons showed increased LRRK2 expression both at the RNA and protein level and transient over-expression of wild-type PINK1 efficiently downregulated LRRK2 levels. Additionally, we confirmed a dysregulation of LRRK2 expression in fibroblasts from patients with a different homozygous mutation in PINK1 exon 4, c.926G > A (G309D). Thus, our results identify a novel role of PINK1 modulating the levels of LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease fibroblasts and neurons, suggest a convergent pathway for these PARK genes, and broaden the role of LRRK2 in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to define the frequency of a primitive reflex, the buccopalpebral reflex (BPR), and its association with the clinical situation in patients with Parkinson disease.\nBetween May 2010 and May 2011, 222 patients, 115 with Parkinson disease and 107 patients without any sign of neurodegenerative disease, were included in the study. All included patients were examined for BPR and snout reflex and were also evaluated with the Mini Mental State Examination. All patients with Parkinson disease were classified with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Hoehn and Yahr Score to determine their clinical severity.\nSixteen patients with Parkinson disease (13.9%) had a BPR (+) and 4 patients in the control group (3.7%) (P < 0.001). The UPDRS score, UPDRS daily life activities score, and UPDRS motor system score were all higher in the group with BPR (+). All patients with a BPR also had a positive snout reflex.\nBPR is more frequent in patients with Parkinson disease than in patients without a neurodegenerative disease.",

However, little is known about the potential synergic effects of combined Vim and STN DBS. We describe a 79-year-old man with medication-refractory tremor-dominant PD. Bilateral Vim DBS electrode implantation produced insufficient improvement. Therefore, the patient underwent additional unilateral left-sided STN DBS. Whereas Vim or STN stimulation alone led to partial improvement, persisting tremor resolution occurred after simultaneous stimulation. The combination of both targets may have a synergic effect and is an alternative option in suitable cases.",

    "abstract": "Many patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have difficulties in performing a second task during walking (i.e., dual task walking). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising approach to study the presumed contribution of dysfunction within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to such difficulties. In this pilot study, we examined the feasibility of using a new portable and wireless fNIRS device to measure PFC activity during different dual task walking protocols in PD. Specifically, we tested whether PD patients were able to perform the protocol and whether we were able to measure the typical fNIRS signal of neuronal activity.\nWe included 14 PD patients (age 71.2\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4\u00a0years, Hoehn and Yahr stage II/III). The protocol consisted of five repetitions of three conditions: walking while (i) counting forwards, (ii) serially subtracting, and (iii) reciting digit spans. Ability to complete this protocol, perceived exertion, burden of the fNIRS devices, and concentrations of oxygenated (O\nTwo participants were unable to complete the protocol due to fatigue and mobility safety concerns. The remaining 12 participants experienced no burden from the two fNIRS devices and completed the protocol with ease. Bilateral PFC O\nThese findings suggest that a new wireless fNIRS device is a feasible measure of PFC activity in PD during dual task walking. Future studies should reduce the level of noise and inter-individual variability to enable measuring differences in PFC activity between different dual walking conditions and across health states.",

    "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is characterised by complex motor enactment of dreams and is a potential prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease (PD). Of note, patients with PD observed during RBD episodes exhibit improved motor function, relative to baseline states during wake periods. Here, we review recent epidemiological and mechanistic findings supporting the prodromal value of RBD for PD, incorporating clinical and electrophysiological studies. Explanations for the improved motor function during RBD episodes are evaluated in light of recent publications. In addition, we present preliminary findings describing changes in the activity of the basal ganglia across the sleep-wake cycle that contribute to our understanding of RBD.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the feasibility and efficacy of a novel system (Gamepad [GAMing Experience in PArkinson's Disease]) for biofeedback rehabilitation of balance and gait in Parkinson disease (PD).\nRandomized controlled trial.\nClinical rehabilitation gym.\nSubjects with PD (N=42) were randomized into experimental and physiotherapy without biofeedback groups.\nBoth groups underwent 20 sessions of training for balance and gait. The experimental group performed tailored functional tasks using Gamepad. The system, based on wearable inertial sensors, provided users with real-time visual and acoustic feedback about their movement during the exercises. The physiotherapy group underwent individually structured physiotherapy without feedback.\nAssessments were performed by a blinded examiner preintervention, postintervention, and at 1-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and 10-m walk test (10MWT). Secondary outcomes included instrumental stabilometric indexes and the Tele-healthcare Satisfaction Questionnaire.\nGamepad was well accepted by participants. Statistically significant between-group differences in BBS scores suggested better balance\u00a0performances of the experimental group compared with the physiotherapy without biofeedback group both posttraining (experimental group-physiotherapy without biofeedback group: mean, 2.3\u00b13.4 points; P=.047) and at follow-up (experimental group-physiotherapy without biofeedback group: mean, 2.7\u00b13.3 points; P=.018). Posttraining stabilometric indexes showed that mediolateral body sway during upright stance\u00a0was significantly reduced in the experimental group compared with the physiotherapy without biofeedback group (experimental group-physiotherapy without biofeedback group: -1.6\u00b11.5mm; P=.003). No significant between-group differences were found in the other outcomes.\nGamepad-based training was feasible and superior to physiotherapy without feedback in improving BBS performance and retaining it for 1 month. After training, 10MWT data were comparable between groups. Further development of the system is warranted to allow the autonomous use of Gamepad outside clinical settings, to enhance gait improvements, and to increase transfer of training effects to real-life contexts.",

    "abstract": "The characteristics and pathogenesis of spinopelvic alignment in Parkinsons's disease (PD) patients-including differences compared to non-PD subjects and their relationships with the severity of PD-have not been clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of spinopelvic alignment in patients with PD.\nForty-eight PD patients complaining of chronic low back pain were included (PD group). The PD condition, determined using the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score; radiographic spinopelvic alignment; lumbar range of motion (ROM); and low back pain-related quality of life assessments were evaluated. Fifty age- and sex-matched patients with adult spinal deformities were included as controls (ASD group).\nThe spinopelvic alignments of the PD/ASD groups demonstrated sagittal vertical axes of 120.9/106.3\u00a0mm and pelvic incidences of 49.7/52.9\u00b0, with no significant differences. Conversely, there were significant differences in the thoracic kyphosis (TK; 27.6/16.7\u00b0), lumbar lordosis (-22.7/-7.9\u00b0), and pelvic tilt (25.3/34.4\u00b0) (all, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). With regard to correlations with the PD condition, the H&Y stage demonstrated significant correlations with the sagittal vertical axis, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and lumbar ROM (all, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and the UPDRS score tended to correlate with the TK and thoracolumbar kyphosis (both, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).\nCharacteristic spinal conditions in PD exist, with progressed PD condition causing stooped posture with increased thoracic or thoracolumbar kyphosis and decreased lumbar ROM; moreover, global sagittal malalignment progresses without sufficient compensatory mechanisms such as loss of TK and pelvic retroversion.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Following the discovery of the PD-causing D620N mutation in the VPS35 (Vacuolar sorting protein 35) gene, dysfunction in the subcellular retromer complex has been strongly implicated in pathogenesis of PD. Although the function and dysfunction of the retromer has been a focus of study for some time, the role of this complex in the development of PD is not fully understood. Investigating cellular alterations that occur when the retromer is rendered dysfunctional, such as when the D620N disease-causing mutation is introduced into various model systems, shows that endosomal processing defects are major contributors to the disease phenotype. Altered trafficking of retromer cargo molecules, reduced cellular survival and altered processing of alpha-synuclein have all been observed in the presence of the D620N mutation. In addition, interactions between the retromer and the protein products of other familial Parkinsonism-related genes, has made the retromer a prime target of research in PD. This review gives an overview of the changes in retromer function, identified thus far, that may contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in PD.",

The specific incidence in Parkinson's disease is not known; however, this case series suggests that it is noticeably more than in the general population at 100/100,000/year. This paper highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of constipation to prevent volvulus developing and thevarious treatments currently available.",

    "abstract": "The lower urinary tract is controlled by complex neural mechanisms not only in the periphery, but also in the central nervous systems (CNS). Thus, patients with a wide variety of neurological diseases often also have lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), including those with Parkinson disease (PD) or multiple system atrophy (MSA). LUTS are common comorbidities associated with both of these neurodegenerative diseases and are likely to impair patients' quality of life. The motor symptoms of PD and MSA often seem similar; however, the pathophysiology, and thus the treatment of LUTS differs considerably. Antimuscarinics are the first-line treatment of storage LUTS in patients with PD or MSA; however, care should be taken in the management of these patients, especially in those with MSA owing to the high risk of inefficient voiding, and thus an increased post-void residual volume. Other treatments of PD-related LUTS include \u03b1-adrenoceptor antagonists, which improve voiding dysfunction, transurethral resection of the prostate for bladder outlet obstruction owing to prostate enlargement, and neuromodulation and intradetrusor botulinum toxin injections for storage LUTS. However, more conservative treatments, including intermittent catheterization, are required for LUTS in patients with MSA, owing to the high incidence of impaired detrusor contractility and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that nonmotor symptoms (NMS) like gastrointestinal (GI) complaints are frequently reported in Parkinson's disease (PD), no therapeutic guidelines are available. This study aimed to manage some lower GI-NMS in a group of patients with PD. A total of 40 patients (17 males, 23 females; mean age 76.05\u00b12.09 years) were randomly selected for this study. Patients were confirmed to have PD (modified Hoehn-Yars scale: 2.075\u00b10.4) who had undergone levodopa or dopamine agonist treatment. In the non-motor symptoms questionnaire (NMS-Quest), regarding GI complaints, the following were recorded: abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation of mild-to-moderate severity. Laboratory studies, abdominal ultrasound, and upper and lower digestive endoscopies were performed to rule out organic issues. All patients increased their water intake to 2 L/d and alimentary fiber to 20-25 g/d. Twenty patients received trimebutine 200 mg three times daily half an hour before meals.

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit both motor and non-motor symptoms. Among the non-motor symptoms, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is frequently observed. Here, we evaluated baroreflex function, vascular reactivity and neuroanatomical changes in brainstem regions involved in the neural control of circulation in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD. Male Wistar rats received a bilateral injection of 6-OHDA or vehicle into the striatum. After 61days, baroreflex function and vascular reactivity were assessed. The 6-OHDA and vehicle groups showed similar increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in response to phenylephrine (PE). However, the bradycardia observed in the vehicle group was blunted in the 6-OHDA-treated rats. Injection of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) decreased hypotension, tachycardia and vascular relaxation in 6-OHDA-treated rats. Bilateral intrastriatal 6-OHDA led to massive degeneration of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra and to reductions in the numbers of A1/C1 and A5 catecholaminergic neurons while sparing A2 neurons within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). 6-OHDA-treated rats also showed decreases in Phox2b-expressing neurons in the NTS and in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity in the nucleus ambiguus. Altogether, our data suggest that this model of PD includes neuroanatomical and functional changes that lead to cardiovascular impairment.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FoG) in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is an environmentally sensitive, intermittent problem that occurs most often during turning. FoG is difficult for clinicians to evaluate and treat because it can be difficult to elicit during a clinical visit. Here, we aimed to develop a clinically valid objective measure of freezing severity during a 2-min 360-degree turning-in-place. Twenty-eight subjects with PD (16 freezers, FoG+, and 12 nonfreezers, FoG-) in the \"off\" state and 14 healthy control subjects were tested. Subjects wore three inertial sensors (one on each shin and one on the waist) while (1) turning in place for 2 min (alternating 360 degrees to the right with 360 degrees to the left) and (2) performing an Instrumented 7-m Timed Up and Go test (ITUG). Performance was videotaped, and clinical severity of FoG was independently rated by two movement disorders specialists (co-authors). Turning in place consistently resulted in FoG (13 out of 16 subjects with PD) while FoG was clinically observed in only two subjects with PD during the ITUG test. The Freezing Ratio during the turning test was significantly correlated with the clinical ratings (\u03c1=0.7, p=0.003) and with score on the new FoG questionnaire (\u03c1=0.5, p=0.03). After correcting for symptom severity (UPDRS-III), out of the four objective measures of the turning test (total number of turns, average turn peak speed and average turn smoothness), only the Freezing Ratio was significantly different across groups (p=0.04). Freezing can be well quantified with body-worn inertial sensors during a 2-min turning-in-place protocol.",

    "abstract": "Assess MDS-UPDRS items for gender-, age-, and race/ethnicity-based differential item functioning.\nAssessing differential item functioning is a core rating scale validation step. For the MDS-UPDRS, differential item functioning occurs if item-score probability among people with similar levels of parkinsonism differ according to selected covariates (gender, age, race/ethnicity). If the magnitude of differential item functioning is clinically relevant, item-score interpretation must consider influences by these covariates. Differential item functioning can be nonuniform (covariate variably influences an item-score across different levels of parkinsonism) or uniform (covariate influences an item-score consistently over all levels of parkinsonism).\nUsing the MDS-UPDRS translation database of more than 5,000 PD patients from 14 languages, we tested gender-, age-, and race/ethnicity-based differential item functioning. To designate an item as having clinically relevant differential item functioning, we required statistical confirmation by 2 independent methods, along with a McFadden pseudo-R\nMost items showed no gender-, age- or race/ethnicity-based differential item functioning. When differential item functioning was identified, the magnitude statistic was always in the \"negligible\" range, and the scale-level impact was minimal.\nThe absence of clinically relevant differential item functioning across all items and all parts of the MDS-UPDRS is strong evidence that the scale can be used confidently. As studies of Parkinson's disease increasingly involve multinational efforts and the MDS-UPDRS has several validated non-English translations, the findings support the scale's broad applicability in populations with varying gender, age, and race/ethnicity distributions. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine mental health conditions among hospitalized individuals with Parkinson's disease in the United States.\nThis was a serial cross-sectional study of hospitalizations of individuals aged \u226560 identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample dataset from 2000 to 2010. We identified all hospitalizations with a diagnosis of PD, alcohol abuse, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, impulse control disorders, mania, psychosis, substance abuse, and attempted suicide/suicidal ideation. National estimates of each mental health condition were compared between hospitalized individuals with and without PD. Hierarchical logistic regression models determined which inpatient mental health diagnoses were associated with PD, adjusting for demographic, payer, geographic, and hospital characteristics.\nWe identified 3,918,703 mental health and substance abuse hospitalizations. Of these, 2.8% (n\u2009=\u2009104, 437) involved a person also diagnosed with PD. The majority of mental health and substance abuse patients were white (86.9% of PD vs 83.3% of non-PD). Women were more common than men in both groups (male:female prevalence ratio, PD: 0.78, 0.78-0.79, non-PD: 0.58, 0.57-0.58). Depression (adjusted odds ratio 1.32, 1.31-1.34), psychosis (adjusted odds ratio 1.25, 1.15-1.33), bipolar disorder (adjusted odds ratio 2.74, 2.69-2.79), impulse control disorders (adjusted odds ratio 1.51, 1.31-1.75), and mania (adjusted odds ratio 1.43, 1.18-1.74) were more likely among PD patients, alcohol abuse was less likely (adjusted odds ratio 0.26, 0.25-0.27). We found no PD-associated difference in suicide-related care.\nPD patients have unique patterns of acute care for mental health and substance abuse. Research is needed to guide PD treatment in individuals with pre-existing psychiatric illnesses, determine cross provider reliability of psychiatric diagnoses in PD patients, and inform efforts to improve psychiatric outcomes. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with pronounced grey matter atrophy in various brain regions. However, the association between atrophy patterns and progression from no cognitive impairment (NCI) to Parkinson's disease (PD)-MCI is not clearly known. We investigated the pattern and progression of atrophy in subcortical structures and its impact on cognition in patients with mild PD.\nSixty-five patients with mild PD with baseline and longitudinal clinical and neuropsychological assessments, and structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were studied. Movement Disorder Society Task Force criteria were used to classify patients with PD into PD-NCI (n = 54) and PD-MCI (n = 11). Based on progression over time, those who remained without cognitive impairment were classified as PD-stable (n = 42) and those who converted to MCI over 18 months were classified as PD-converters (n = 12). FreeSurfer was used to measure cortical thickness and subcortical volumes at baseline and follow-up.\nParkinson's disease-MCI showed baseline thalamus atrophy and progressive atrophy in the thalamus, caudate, presubiculum, cornu ammonis 1 and 2-3, and significant memory and executive dysfunction compared with PD-NCI. PD-converters had greater accumbens atrophy at baseline and progressive atrophy in the thalamus, caudate and accumbens with dysfunctions in memory and executive domains.\nProgression of cognitive impairment in non-demented PD is associated with a specific pattern of subcortical atrophy. Findings from this study will allow future studies to investigate in the role of subcortical structures as a biomarker for PD dementia.",

    "abstract": "Detection of saccades (fast eye-movements) within raw mobile electrooculography (EOG) data involves complex algorithms which typically process data acquired during seated static tasks only. Processing of data during dynamic tasks such as walking is relatively rare and complex, particularly in older adults or people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Development of algorithms that can be easily implemented to detect saccades is required. This study aimed to develop an algorithm for the detection and measurement of saccades in EOG data during static (sitting) and dynamic (walking) tasks, in older adults and PD. Eye-tracking via mobile EOG and infra-red (IR) eye-tracker (with video) was performed with a group of older adults (n\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u200910) and PD participants (n\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u200910) (\u2a7e50 years). Horizontal saccades made between targets set 5\u00b0, 10\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 apart were first measured while seated. Horizontal saccades were then measured while a participant walked and executed a 40\u00b0 turn left and right. The EOG algorithm was evaluated by comparing the number of correct saccade detections and agreement (ICC",

    "abstract": "The abnormality of nuclear receptor-related protein 1 (Nurr1) in expression and function can contribute to neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons and occurrence of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its related mechanism in PD is still unknown. In this study, we found that Nurr1 was down-regulated and CCL2 was up-regulated in PD patients and PD mice. CCL2 promoted apoptosis and secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in SH-SY5Y cells and inhibited cell viability while knockdown of CCL2 exerted the opposite effects. Nurr1 overexpression inhibited apoptosis, the release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and promoted viability in \u03b1-Syn-treated SH-SY5Y cells, which was markedly promoted by CCL2 antibody and dramatically reversed by CCL2. Nurr1 overexpression negatively regulated CCL2 expression in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. Furthermore, Nurr1 overexpression remarkably relieved MPTP-induced movement disorder and spatial memory deficits and played neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory roles in MPTP-induced PD mice by down-regulating CCL2 in\u00a0vivo. In conclusion, Nurr1 overexpression exerts neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory roles via down-regulating CCL2 in both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro PD models, contributing to developing mechanism-based and neuroprotective strategies against PD.",

It is unclear whether such activity occurs in the STN in dystonia, and, if not, whether dystonia has another distinctive neural population activity in the STN.\nTwelve patients with PD, and eight patients with dystonia underwent DBS electrode implantation targeting the STN. Seven dystonia patients were off medication and one was on aripiprazole and clonazepam. LFPs were recorded from the DBS electrodes in PD in the on/off medication states and in dystonia. Power spectra and temporal dynamics measured by the with Lempel-Ziv complexity of the LFPs were compared among these states.\nNormalised power spectra and Lempel-Ziv complexity of subthalamic LFPs differed between dystonia off and PD on/off, and between PD off and on over the low frequency, beta and high gamma bands. Patients with dystonia and off medication had lower beta power but higher low frequency and high gamma power than PD. Spectral power in the low beta frequency (11-20Hz) range was attenuated in medicated PD.\nThe results suggest that dystonia and PD are characterized by different patterns of oscillatory activities even within the same nucleus, and exaggerated beta activity may relate to hypo-dopaminergic status.",

The recognition of this problem and treatment options are limited in clinical practice.\nTo evaluate the efficacy of nocturnal apomorphine infusion, using a wearable sensor, in patients who are already on daytime continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion and still suffer from nocturnal hypokinesia.\nNocturnal parameters in 10 PD patients before and during nocturnal infusion were assessed over two nights at their homes, using a wearable sensor (trunk). Nocturnal parameters included number, velocity, acceleration, degree, and duration of rolling over, and number of times they got out of bed. Correlations with validated clinical rating scales were performed.\nFollowing nocturnal apomorphine infusion (34.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.5\u00a0mg per night), there were significant improvements in the number of turns in bed (p\u00a0=\u00a00.027), turning velocity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.046), and the degree of turning (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028) in PD patients. Significant improvements of Modified Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), the axial score of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013), and Nocturnal Akinesia Dystonia and Cramp Scale (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014) were also observed.\nOur study was able to demonstrate quantitatively the efficacy of nocturnal apomorphine infusion in PD patients with nocturnal hypokinesia and demonstrated the feasibility of using wearable sensors to yield objective and quantifiable outcomes in a clinical trial setting. More studies are needed to determine the long-term efficacy of this treatment in a large prospective cohort of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Optimal care of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients should involve a multidisciplinary team (MDT) of which a PD nurse specialist (PDNS) is a key member. The role of a PDNS is particularly prominent in the care of advanced PD patients suitable for apomorphine because, in addition to nursing skills, apomorphine treatment requires liaison, training, interaction and coordination with patients, caregivers and other members of the MDT as well as the interface with primary care physicians. The therapeutic success of apomorphine therapy depends not only upon the pharmacologic drug response, but also on how well the patient understands his/her disease and how to handle the therapy. In this respect, a PDNS is a vital member of the MDT who provides education and training, support, and is available for consultation when problems arise. In this article, we review the literature on the contribution of PDNSs in both continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion and intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injection and highlight the various beneficial aspects of PDNS care, supported by scientific evidence when available. Despite a low level of published evidence, there is strong clinical evidence that the impact of PDNSs on the management of apomorphine therapy is vital and indispensable for the success of this treatment.",

    "abstract": "To review the available scientific evidence about the effectiveness of auditory cues during gait initiation and turning in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nWe conducted a literature search in the following databases: Brain, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Library Plus, CENTRAL, Trip Database, PEDro, DARE, OTseeker, and Google Scholar. We included all studies published between 2007 and 2016 and evaluating the influence of auditory cues on independent gait initiation and turning in patients with Parkinson's disease. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed with the Jadad scale.\nWe included 13 studies, all of which had a low methodological quality (Jadad scale score\u22642). In these studies, high-intensity, high-frequency auditory cues had a positive impact on gait initiation and turning. More specifically, they 1) improved spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters; 2) decreased freezing, turning duration, and falls; and 3) increased gait initiation speed, muscle activation, and gait speed and cadence in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nWe need studies of better methodological quality to establish the Parkinson's disease stage in which auditory cues are most beneficial, as well as to determine the most effective type and frequency of the auditory cue during gait initiation and turning in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Cell replacement therapy is a promising avenue into the investigation and treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), and in some cases, significant long-term motor improvements have been demonstrated. The main source of donor tissue is the human fetal ventral mesencephalon (FVM), which consists of a mixed neuronal population, and its heterogeneity likely contributes to the inconsistent outcome observed in clinical trials. Therefore, detailed knowledge about the neuronal subpopulations in the VM seems essential for successful cell transplantation. Interestingly, it has been reported that some tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) neurons in the VM of adult rats and in cultured midbrain-derived neuroblasts coexpress additional neurotransmitters. Thus, the present study investigated, by means of colocalization analyses, the possible expression of GABA or serotonin in TH+ neurons. For that purpose, both fetal rat and human dissociated, organotypic and neurosphere FVM cultures as well as an animal model of PD were investigated. In dissociated rat FVM cultures, approximately 30% of the TH+ neurons coexpressed serotonin, while no colocalization with GABA was observed. Interestingly, coexpression of TH and serotonin was found to be dependent on the time in culture, the plating density, and the exposure to neurotrophic factors, that is, higher cell densities and treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor resulted in a significantly reduced coexpression rate. Notably, even though approximately 30% of the dopaminergic neurons in the donor tissue coexpressed serotonin, no colocalization could be detected in grafts 1 month after intrastriatal transplantation into hemiparkinsonian rats. In conclusion, a significant and susceptible subpopulation of dopaminergic neurons in FVM tissues coexpresses serotonin. This might have potential implications for the future selection and handling of cells prior to transplantation in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease. Both medical and surgical choices provide symptomatic treatment. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a conventional treatment for hematological diseases, has demonstrated its effectiveness in acute and chronic neurological diseases through its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptosis mechanisms. Based on previous in vitro and in vivo studies, we administered a lower dose (3.3 \u03bcg/kg) G-CSF injection for 5 days and six courses for 1 year in early-stage PD patients as a phase I trial. The four PD patient's mean unified PD rating scale motor scores in medication off status remained stable from 23 before the first G-CSF injection to 22 during the 2-year follow-up. 3,4-Dihydroxy-6-18F-fluoro-l-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) studies also revealed an annual 3.5% decrease in radiotracer uptake over the caudate nucleus and 7% in the putamen, both slower than those of previous reports of PD. Adverse effects included transient muscular-skeletal pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated liver enzymes. Based on this preliminary report, G-CSF seems to alleviate disease deterioration for early stage PD patients. The effectiveness of G-CSF was possibly due to its amelioration of progressive dopaminergic neuron degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsonian-pyramidal syndrome (PPS) is an early onset form of Parkinson's disease (PD) that shows degeneration of the extrapyramidal region of the brain to result in a severe form of PD. The toxic protein build-up has been implicated in the onset of PPS. Protein removal is mediated by an intracellular proteasome complex: an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the targeting component, is essential for function. FBXO7 encodes the F-box component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase linked to familial forms of PPS. The Drosophila melanogaster homologue nutcracker (ntc) and a binding partner, PI31, have been shown to be active in proteasome function. We show that altered expression of either ntc or PI31 in dopaminergic neurons leads to a decrease in longevity and locomotor ability, phenotypes both associated with models of PD. Furthermore, expression of ntc-RNAi in an established \u03b1-synuclein-dependent model of PD rescues the phenotypes of diminished longevity and locomotor control.",

    "abstract": "It is currently unknown whether speech and limb motor effectors in Parkinson's disease (PD) are controlled by similar underlying brain processes. Based on computerized objective analysis, the aim of this study was to evaluate potential correlation between speech and mechanical tests of upper limb motor function. Speech and upper limb motor tests were performed in 22 PD patients and 22 healthy controls. Quantitative acoustic analyses of eight key speech dimensions of hypokinetic dysarthria, including quality of voice, sequential motion rates, consonant articulation, vowel articulation, average loudness, loudness variability, pitch variability, and number of pauses, were performed. Upper limb movements were assessed using the motor part of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, contactless three-dimensional motion capture system, blinded expert evaluation, and the Purdue Pegboard Test. Significant relationships were observed between the quality of voice assessed by jitter and amplitude decrement of finger tapping (r\u00a0=\u00a00.61, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), consonant articulation evaluated using voice onset time and expert rating of finger tapping (r\u00a0=\u00a00.60, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and number of pauses and Purdue Pegboard Test score (r\u00a0=\u00a00.60, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). The current study supports the hypothesis that speech impairment in PD shares, at least partially, similar pathophysiological processes with limb motor dysfunction. Vocal fold vibration irregularities appeared to be influenced by mechanisms similar to amplitude decrement during repetitive limb movements. Consonant articulation deficits were associated with decreased manual dexterity and movement speed, likely reflecting fine motor control involvement in PD.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been linked with functional brain changes. Previously, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we reported reduced cortico-striatal activity in patients with PD who also had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. those who did not (non-MCI). We followed up these patients to investigate the longitudinal effect on the neural activity. Twenty-four non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (non-MCI: 12, MCI: 12) were included in the study. Each participant underwent two fMRIs while performing the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task 20 months apart. The non-MCI patients recruited the usual cognitive corticostriatal loop at the first and second sessions (Time 1 and Time 2, respectively). However, decreased activity was observed in the cerebellum and occipital area and increased activity was observed in the medial prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe during planning set-shift at Time 2. Increased activity in the precuneus was also demonstrated while executing set-shifts at Time 2. The MCI patients revealed more activity in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes during planning set-shifts, and in the parietal and occipital lobes, precuneus, and cerebellum, during executing set-shift at Time 2. Analysis regrouping of both groups of PD patients revealed that hippocampal and thalamic activity at Time 1 was associated with less cognitive decline over time. Our results reveal that functional alteration along the time-points differed between the non-MCI and MCI patients. They also underline the importance of preserving thalamic and hippocampal function with respect to cognitive decline over time.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian retromers play a critical role in protein trans-membrane sorting from endosome to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Recently, retromer alterations have been related to the onset of Parkinson's Disease (PD) since the variant p.Asp620Asn in VPS35 (Vacuolar Protein Sorting 35) was identified as a cause of late onset PD. This variant causes a primary defect in endosomal trafficking and retromers formation. Other mutations in VPS genes have been reported in both sporadic and familial PD. These mutations are less defined. Understanding the specific prevalence of all VPS gene mutations is key to understand the relevance of retromers impairment in the onset of PD. A number of PD-related mutations despite affecting different biochemical systems (autophagy, mitophagy, proteasome, endosomes, protein folding), all converge in producing an impairment in cell clearance. This may explain how genetic predispositions to PD may derive from slightly deleterious VPS mutations when combined with environmental agents overwhelming the clearance of the cell. This manuscript reviews genetic data produced in the last 5 years to re-define the actual prevalence of VPS gene mutations in the onset of PD. The prevalence of p.Asp620Asn mutation in VPS35 is 0.286 of familial PD. This increases up to 0.548 when considering mutations affecting all VPS genes. This configures mutations in VPS genes as the second most frequent autosomal dominant PD genotype. This high prevalence, joined with increased awareness of the role played by retromers in the neurobiology of PD, suggests environmentally-induced VPS alterations as crucial in the genesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is a rostral brainstem structure that has extensive connections with basal ganglia nuclei and the thalamus. Through these the PPN contributes to neural circuits that effect cortical and hippocampal activity. The PPN also has descending connections to nuclei of the pontine and medullary reticular formations, deep cerebellar nuclei, and the spinal cord. Interest in the PPN has increased dramatically since it was first suggested to be a novel target for treating patients with Parkinson's disease who are refractory to medication. However, application of frequency-specific electrical stimulation of the PPN has produced inconsistent results. A central reason for this is that the PPN is not a heterogeneous structure. In this article, we review current knowledge of the neurochemical identity and topographical distribution of neurons within the PPN of both humans and experimental animals, focusing on studies that used neuronally selective targeting strategies to ascertain how the neurochemical heterogeneity of the PPN relates to its diverse functions in relation to movement and cognitive processes. If the therapeutic potential of the PPN is to be realized, it is critical to understand the complex structure-function relationships that exist here.",

    "abstract": "The success of levodopa and other classes of drugs have meant that most people with Parkinson's disease enjoy a good quality of life for many years. However, despite the availability of several drugs and formulations that can be used as monotherapy and in combination, there are a number of disease features that the current therapies are unable to address. The disease continues to progress despite treatment, patients suffer from a myriad of motor and non-motor symptoms, and a neuroprotective therapy is urgently required. To move forward with medical and surgical management, it is important to consider new insights that recent research offers and in this review we examine how a better understanding of the disease pathology and progression might improve and enrich our daily clinical practice. It is also timely to consider the service provision changes that will increasingly be needed to effectively manage the needs of the aging population.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus is an effective treatment for advanced Parkinson disease (PD). However, achieving ideal outcomes by conventional programming can be difficult in some patients, resulting in suboptimal control of PD symptoms and stimulation-induced adverse effects. Interleaving stimulation (ILS) is a newer programming technique that can individually optimize the stimulation area, thereby improving control of PD symptoms while alleviating stimulation-induced side effects after conventional programming fails to achieve the desired results.\nWe retrospectively reviewed PD patients who received DBS programming during the previous 4 years in our hospital. We collected clinical and demographic data from 12 patients who received ILS because of incomplete alleviation of PD symptoms or stimulation-induced adverse effects after conventional programming had proven ineffective or intolerable. Appropriate lead location was confirmed with postoperative reconstruction images. The rationale and clinical efficacy of ILS was analyzed.\nWe divided our patients into 4 groups based on the following symptoms: stimulation-induced dysarthria and choreoathetoid dyskinesias, gait disturbance, and incomplete control of parkinsonism. After treatment with ILS, patients showed satisfactory improvement in PD symptoms and alleviation of stimulation-induced side effects, with a mean improvement in Unified PD Rating Scale motor scores of 26.9%.\nILS is a newer choice and effective programming strategy to maximize symptom control in PD while decreasing stimulation-induced adverse effects when conventional programming fails to achieve satisfactory outcome. However, we should keep in mind that most DBS patients are routinely treated with conventional stimulation and that not all patients benefit from ILS. ILS is not recommended as the first choice of programming, and it is recommended only when patients have unsatisfactory control of PD symptoms or stimulation-induced side effects after multiple treatments with conventional stimulation. A return to conventional stimulation may be required if ILS induces new side effects or the needs of the patient change.",

    "abstract": "Decreased clearance of \u03b1-synuclein (aSyn) and aSyn protein misfolding and aggregation are seen as major factors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies that leads to disruption in neuronal function and eventually to cell death. Prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) can accelerate the aSyn aggregation process, while inhibition of PREP by a small molecule inhibitor decreases aSyn oligomer formation and enhances its clearance via autophagy in different aSyn overexpressing cell types and in transgenic PD animal models. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic PREP inhibition by a small molecule inhibitor, 4-phenylbutanoyl-l-prolyl-2(S)-cyanopyrrolidine (KYP-2047), on aSyn oligomerization, clearance, and underlying spontaneous motor behavior in a virus vector-based aSyn overexpression mouse model 4 weeks after aSyn microinjections and after the onset of symptomatic forepaw bias. Following 4 weeks of PREP inhibition, we saw an improved spontaneous forelimb use in mice that correlated with a decreased immunoreactivity against oligomer-specific forms of aSyn. Additionally, KYP-2047 had a trend to enhance dopaminergic systems activity. Our results suggest that PREP inhibition exhibits a beneficial effect on the aSyn clearance and aggregation in a virus mediated aSyn overexpression PD mouse model and that PREP inhibitors could be a novel therapeutic strategy for synucleinopathies.\nAlpha-synuclein (aSyn) has been implicated in Parkinson's disease, with aSyn aggregates believed to exert toxic effects on neurons, while prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) has been shown to interact with aSyn both in cells and cell free conditions, thus enhancing its aggregation. We demonstrate the possibility to abolish motor imbalance caused by aSyn viral vector injection with chronic 4 week PREP inhibition by a potent small-molecule PREP inhibitor, 4-phenylbutanoyl-l-prolyl-2(S)-cyanopyrrolidine (KYP-2047). Treatment was initiated postsymptomatically, 4 weeks after aSyn injection. KYP-2047-treated animals had a significantly decreased amount of oligomeric aSyn particles and improved dopamine system activity compared to control animals. To our knowledge, this is the first time viral overexpression of aSyn has been countered and movement impairments abolished after their onset.",

    "abstract": "The quality of life (QoL) of informal caregivers of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) (PwP) can be affected by the caring role. Because of cognitive symptoms and diminished activities of daily living, in addition to the management of motor symptoms, carers of PwP and cognitive impairment may experience increased levels of burden and poorer QoL compared with carers of PwP without cognitive impairment. This study aimed to investigate the impact of cognitive impairment in PD upon QoL of carers.\nApproximately 36\u2009months after diagnosis, 66 dyadic couples of PwP and carers completed assessments. PwP completed a schedule of neuropsychological assessments and QoL measures; carers of PwP completed demographic questionnaires and assessments of QoL. Factor scores of attention, memory/executive function and global cognition, as derived by principal component analysis, were used to evaluate cognitive domains.\nHierarchical regression analysis found lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment was a significant independent predictor of poorer carer QoL, in addition to number of hours spent caregiving, carer depression and PD motor severity. Attentional deficits accounted for the largest proportion of variance of carer QoL. Carers of PwP and dementia (n\u2009=\u20099) had significantly poorer QoL scores compared with PwP and mild cognitive impairment (n\u2009=\u200918) or normal cognition (n\u2009=\u200939) carers (p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nAttentional deficits were the strongest predictor of carer QoL compared with other cognitive predictors. Carers for those with PD dementia reported the poorest QoL. Interventions such as respite or cognitive behavioural therapy to improve mood and self-efficacy in carers may improve carer QoL. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Genes encoding cellular membrane trafficking components, namely RAB7L1 and RAB39B, are more recently recognized factors associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Encoded by a gene within the PARK16 locus, RAB7L1 interacts with Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) to act in intracellular transport processes that are likely important for neuronal survival and function. LRRK2 also directly phosphorylates a number of other Rab proteins. On the other hand, nonsense and missense mutations of the X-chromosome localized RAB39B were shown to underlie X-linked intellectual disability (ID) in male patients with early-onset PD. The cellular or neuronal functions of RAB39B are not yet known with certainty, but it has recently been shown to play a role in glutamate receptor trafficking. Importantly, RAB39B is also functionally connected to components for autophagy regulation, which affects \u03b1-synuclein processing and clearance. In this review, we discuss the association of Rabs with PD pathology, and potential etiological mechanisms whereby defects or deficiencies in certain Rab proteins could lead to PD susceptibility. J.

    "abstract": "Purpose To investigate the structural brain connectome in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in patients with PD without MCI. Materials and Methods This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committees, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to enrollment. The individual structural brain connectome of 170 patients with PD (54 with MCI, 116 without MCI) and 41 healthy control subjects was obtained by using deterministic diffusion-tensor tractography. A network-based statistic was used to assess structural connectivity differences among groups. Results Patients with PD and MCI had global network alterations when compared with both control subjects and patients with PD without MCI (range, P = .004 to P = .048). Relative to control subjects, patients with PD and MCI had a large basal ganglia and frontoparietal network with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right hemisphere and a subnetwork with increased mean diffusivity (MD) involving similar regions bilaterally (P < .01). When compared with patients with PD without MCI, those with PD and MCI had a network with decreased FA, including basal ganglia and frontotemporoparietal regions bilaterally (P < .05). Similar findings were obtained by adjusting for motor disability (P < .05, permutation-corrected P = .06). At P < .01, patients with PD and MCI did not show network alterations relative to patients with PD without MCI. Network FA and MD values were used to differentiate patients with PD and MCI from healthy control subjects and patients with PD without MCI with fair to good accuracy (cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [principal + secondary connected components] range, 0.75-0.85). Conclusion A disruption of structural connections between brain areas forming a network contributes to determine an altered information integration and organization and thus cognitive deficits in patients with PD. These results provide novel information concerning the structural substrates of MCI in patients with PD and may offer markers that can be used to differentiate between patients with PD and MCI and patients with PD without MCI.

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic medication adjustments in Parkinson's disease are often solely based on patient reports. However, it is unclear how well patient-based ratings of the levodopa response correlate with clinician-based ratings, and whether this correlation differs between motor symptoms. Here we compare patient-clinician agreement for the effect of levodopa on resting tremor and bradykinesia/rigidity. Furthermore, given patients' reports that tremor is most troublesome during stress, we test for differences in patient-clinician agreement between tremor at rest and stress-induced tremor.\nWe included 42 tremulous Parkinson patients, who were clinically rated (using the MDS-UPDRS) in a practically defined OFF-state and after levodopa-benserazide 200/50\u00a0mg. Using accelerometry, we quantified the effect of dopaminergic medication and behavioral context (rest vs. cognitive stress) on tremor intensity. Patients rated medication effects on tremor and bradykinesia/rigidity using visual analogue scales.\nThere was only moderate patient-clinician agreement for the effect of levodopa on bradykinesia/rigidity (R\nThe moderate correlations between patient ratings and clinical/accelerometry changes indicate the need for methods to better monitor symptom severity and impairments in daily life, for example wearable sensors. Our findings also suggest that context matters: Parkinson patients' subjective experience of levodopa effectiveness on tremor was largely based on the ability of levodopa to reduce tremor during cognitive stress.",

Our findings also suggest that context matters: Parkinson patients' subjective experience of levodopa effectiveness on tremor was largely based on the ability of levodopa to reduce tremor during cognitive stress.",

    "abstract": "Recent research indicated that cognitive speed of processing training (SPT) improved Useful Field of View (UFOV) among individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). The effects of SPT in PD have not been further examined. The objectives of the current study were to investigate use, maintenance and dose effects of SPT among individuals with PD.\nParticipants who were randomized to SPT or a delayed control group completed the UFOV at a six-month follow-up visit. Use of SPT was monitored across the six-month study period. Regression explored factors affecting SPT use. Mixed effect models were conducted to examine the durability of training gains among those randomized to SPT (n = 44), and training dose effects among the entire sample (n = 87).\nThe majority of participants chose to continue to use SPT (52%). Those randomized to SPT maintained improvements in UFOV performance. A significant dose effect of SPT was evident such that more hours of training were associated with greater UFOV performance improvements. The cognitive benefits derived from SPT in PD may be maintained for up to three months.\nFuture research should determine how long gains endure and explore if such training gains transfer.",

    "abstract": "Depressive symptoms are very common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and have a significant impact on the quality of life.\nThe present study analyzed the correlations between over-time changes in depressive symptoms and gray matter parameters of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in non-demented PD patients.\nA significant correlation was observed, between increased scores for depression over time and lower cortical thickness over time in the right temporo-parietal junction, right occipital medial region, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right posterior cingulate region, left middle temporal as well as left supplementary motor area. Furthermore, the presence of depressive symptoms at baseline predicted increased cortical thinning over time in the left middle temporal, left anterior cingulate, right posterior cingulate and right parahippocampal cortices. Finally, a statistically significant negative correlation has been revealed between the thalamus' volume changes over time and the change in depressive symptoms scores. All other analyzed subcortical structures didn't reveal any significant correlations.\nThese results suggest that depressive symptoms in PD patients are associated with gray matter cortical thinning and thalamus volume shrinkage over time and higher scores of depressive symptoms at baseline correlate with a higher rate of cortical thinning longitudinally. The present study highlights the importance of addressing depressive symptoms in PD patients early in the disease.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus (STN) local field potentials (LFP) are neural signals that have been shown to reveal motor and language behavior, as well as pathological parkinsonian states. We use a research-grade implantable neurostimulator (INS) with data collection capabilities to record STN-LFP outside the operating room to determine the reliability of the signals over time and assess their dynamics with respect to behavior and dopaminergic medication. Seven subjects were implanted with the recording augmented deep brain stimulation (DBS) system, and bilateral STN-LFP recordings were collected in the clinic over twelve months. Subjects were cued to perform voluntary motor and language behaviors in on and off medication states. The STN-LFP recorded with the INS demonstrated behavior-modulated desynchronization of beta frequency (13-30 Hz) and synchronization of low gamma frequency (35-70 Hz) oscillations. Dopaminergic medication did not diminish the relative beta frequency oscillatory desynchronization with movement. However, movement-related gamma frequency oscillatory synchronization was only observed in the medication on state. We observed significant inter-subject variability, but observed consistent STN-LFP activity across recording systems and over a one-year period for each subject. These findings demonstrate that an INS system can provide robust STN-LFP recordings in ambulatory patients, allowing for these signals to be recorded in settings that better represent natural environments in which patients are in a variety of medication states.",

    "abstract": "Studies of abnormal regional homogeneity (ReHo) in Parkinson's disease (PD) have reported inconsistent results. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis using the Seed-based d Mapping software package to identify the most consistent and replicable findings. A systematic literature search was performed to identify eligible whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that had measured differences in ReHo between patients with PD and healthy controls between January 2000 and June 4, 2016. A total of ten studies reporting 11 comparisons (212 patients; 182 controls) were included. Increased ReHo was consistently identified in the bilateral inferior parietal lobules, bilateral medial prefrontal cortices, and left cerebellum of patients with PD when compared to healthy controls, while decreased ReHo was observed in the right putamen, right precentral gyrus, and left lingual gyrus. The results of the current meta-analysis demonstrate a consistent and coexistent pattern of impairment and compensation of intrinsic brain activity that predominantly involves the default mode and motor networks, which may advance our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive-linguistic impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been well documented; however, few studies have explored the neurophysiological underpinnings of semantic deficits in PD. This study investigated semantic function in PD using event-related potentials.\nEighteen people with PD and 18 healthy controls performed a semantic judgement task on written word pairs that were either congruent or incongruent.\nThe mean amplitude of the N400 for new incongruent word pairs was similar for both groups, however the onset latency was delayed in the PD group. Further analysis of the data revealed that both groups demonstrated attenuation of the N400 for repeated incongruent trials, as well as attenuation of the P600 component for repeated congruent trials.\nThe presence of N400 congruity and N400 repetition effects in the PD group suggests that semantic processing is generally intact, but with a slower time course as evidenced by the delayed N400. Additional research will be required to determine whether N400 and P600 repetition effects are sensitive to further cognitive decline in PD. (JINS, 2017, 23, 78-89).",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) provides efficient treatment for the alleviation of motor signs in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), but its specific effects on gait is sometimes less successful as it may even lead to an aggravation of freezing of gait. To better understand when axial symptoms can be expected to improve and when they may worsen or be resistant to STN-DBS, we propose here a narrative review that considers the recent literature evidences based on instrumental gait analysis data. Our aim is to report about the efficacy of STN-DBS on PD gait, analyzing the clinical and procedural factors involved, and discussing the strategies for optimizing such effectiveness in patients with advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the relationships between average gait speed collected with the 10Meter Walk Test (Comfortable and Fast) and 6Minute Walk Test (6MWT) in 346 people with Parkinson disease (PD) and how the relationships change with increasing disease severity. Pearson correlation and linear regression analyses determined relationships between 10Meter Walk Test and 6MWT gait speed values for the entire sample and for sub-samples stratified by Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage I (n=53), II (n=141), III (n=135) and IV (n=17). We hypothesized that redundant tests would be highly and significantly correlated (i.e. r>0.70, p<0.05) and would have a linear regression model slope of 1 and intercept of 0. For the entire sample, 6MWT gait speed was significantly (p<0.001) related to the Comfortable 10 Meter Walk Test (r=0.75) and Fast 10Meter Walk Test (r=0.79) gait speed, with 56% and 62% of the variance in 6MWT gait speed explained, respectively. The regression model of 6MWT gait speed predicted by Comfortable 10 Meter Walk gait speed produced slope and intercept values near 1 and 0, respectively, especially for participants in H&Y stages II-IV. In contrast, slope and intercept values were further from 1 and 0, respectively, for the Fast 10Meter Walk Test. Comfortable 10 Meter Walk Test and 6MWT gait speeds appeared to be redundant in people with moderate to severe PD, suggesting the Comfortable 10 Meter Walk Test can be used to estimate 6MWT distance in this population.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the common causes of imbalance, and the balance assessment is necessary for treatment and rehabilitation of these patients. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) has been the main instrument used to evaluate balance impairment. The purpose of this study is to investigate reliability and validity of the Persian translation of BBS in Parkinson disease.\nOne hundred PD patients (with mean age of 56.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.13\u00a0years) were included. Interrater reliability was measured with the Kappa statistics and interclass correlation coefficients.\nThe mean values of the BBS scored by the two evaluators were 47/85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011/09 and 48/03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010/90, respectively. The mean of Kappa coefficient between two examiners was 0.76, which was between 0.38 and 0.93 for various items. The total score recorded by both examiners, interclass correlation coefficient, was 0.99, which is excellent. Cronbach's alpha for Iranian version of BBS was 0.92, which shows the excellent reliability of the questionnaire (0.62-0.9 for all items).\nThe Persian version of the BBS has excellent interrater reliability and internal consistency for the assessment of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element required for optimal functioning of cellular biochemical pathways in the central nervous system. Elevated exposure to Mn through environmental and occupational exposure can cause neurotoxic effects resulting in manganism, a condition with clinical symptoms identical to idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Epigenetics is now recognized as a biological mechanism involved in the etiology of various diseases. Here, we investigated the role of DNA methylation alterations induced by chronic Mn (100\u00a0\u00b5M) exposure in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells in relevance to Parkinson's disease. A combined analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression data for Parkinson's disease-associated genes was carried out. Whole-genome bisulfite conversion and sequencing indicate epigenetic perturbation of key genes involved in biological processes associated with neuronal cell health. Integration of DNA methylation data with gene expression reveals epigenetic alterations to PINK1, PARK2 and TH genes that play critical roles in the onset of Parkinsonism. The present study suggests that Mn-induced alteration of DNA methylation of PINK1-PARK2 may influence mitochondrial function and promote Parkinsonism. Our findings provide a basis to further explore and validate the epigenetic basis of Mn-induced neurotoxicity .",

    "abstract": "Mutations within the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene represent the most common cause of Mendelian forms of Parkinson's disease, among autosomal dominant cases. Its gene product, LRRK2, is a large multidomain protein that belongs to the Roco protein family exhibiting GTPase and kinase activity, with the latter activity increased by pathogenic mutations. To allow rational drug design against LRRK2 and to understand the cross-regulation of the G- and the kinase domain at a molecular level, it is key to solve the three-dimensional structure of the protein. We review here our recent successful approach to build the first structural model of dimeric LRRK2 by an integrative modeling approach.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene, associated with Parkinson's disease, have been shown to affect intracellular trafficking pathways in a variety of cells and organisms. An emerging theme is that LRRK2 can bind to multiple membranous structures in cells, and several recent studies have suggested that the Rab family of small GTPases might be important in controlling the recruitment of LRRK2 to specific cellular compartments. Once localized to membranes, LRRK2 then influences downstream events, evidenced by changes in the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Here, I will discuss available evidence that supports or challenges this outline, with a specific emphasis on those aspects of LRRK2 function that have been controversial or remain to be fully clarified.",

    "abstract": "Apomorphine infusion or injection is an important dopamine agonist non-oral therapy usually used in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) with refractory motor fluctuations. The drug also has appreciable efficacy for nonmotor fluctuations and is the quickest to reverse predictable \"off\" periods. Current subcutaneous administration, however, is complicated by problems associated with needle-based therapies, such as skin nodule formation, skin irritation, and avoidance of this treatment option by needle-phobic subjects. In this review we focus on what the future might hold for apomorphine injection/infusion. We discuss interesting and novel delivery strategies of apomorphine or esters via oral, buccal, inhalation and a novel pump-patch route. We also discuss recent research that has highlighted some important properties of apomorphine in animal models, such as a potential anti-amyloid effect and its potential impact in the management of PD dementia or perhaps even Alzheimer's disease. A potential role for apomorphine infusion in cases with impulse control disorders and other nonmotor issues is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, treatment to improve insulin resistance in T2DM may be useful for PD patients. Glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is a member of the incretin hormone family that can promote insulin release and improve insulin resistance. Several GIP analogues have been developed as potential treatments for T2DM. We had shown previously that D-Ala2-GIP-glu-PAL, a novel long-acting GIP analogue, can play a neuroprotective role in the PD mouse model induced by acute MPTP injection. The drug reduced damage to the dopaminergic neurons and increased CREB-mediated Bcl-2 expression to prevent apoptosis and reduced chronic inflammation in the brain. In the present study, we further tested the effects of chronic treatment by D-Ala2-GIP-glu-PAL in a chronic PD mouse model induced by MPTP (25mg/kg ip.) combination with probenecid (250mg/kg ip.) injection for 5 weeks. The results demonstrated that chronic treatment with D-Ala2-GIP-glu-PAL inhibits MPTP -induced Parkinsonism-like motor disorders in mice, and that the drug prevents dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Moreover, D-Ala2-GIP-glu-PAL also inhibited the increased levels of expression of \u03b1-synuclein in the SNpc and striatum induced by MPTP. Furthermore, drug treatment reduced chronic neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, and increased the expression of BDNF. These findings show that GIP signaling is neuroprotective and holds promise as a novel treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Falls are a major problem for people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite years of focused research knowledge of falls aetiology is poor. This may be partly due to classification approaches which conventionally report fall frequency. This nosology is blunt, and does not take into account causality or the circumstances in which the fall occurred. For example, it is likely that people who fall from a postural transition are phenotypically different to those who fall during high level activities. Recent evidence supports the use of a novel falls classification based on fall related activity, however its clinimetric properties have not yet been tested.\nThis study describes further development of the Fall-Related Activity Classification (FRAC) and reports on its inter-rater reliability (IRR).\nDescriptors of the FRAC were refined through an iterative process with a multidisciplinary team. Three categories based on the activity preceding the fall were identified. PD fallers were categorised as: (1) advanced (2) combined or (3) transitional. Fifty-five fall scenarios were rated by 23 raters using a standardised process. Raters comprised 3 clinical subgroups: (1) physiotherapists, (2) physicians, (3) non-medical researchers. IRR analysis was performed using weighted kappa coefficients and included sub group analysis based on clinical speciality.\nExcellent agreement was reached for all clinicians, \u03ba=0.807 (95% CI 0.732 to 0.870). Clinical subgroups performed similarly well (range of \u03ba=0.780 to 0.822).\nThe FRAC can be reliably used to classify falls. This may discriminate between phenotypically different fallers and subsequently strengthen falls predictors in future studies.",

    "abstract": "The effects of mind-body exercises on individuals with chronic illnesses have attracted increasing attention. However, little effort had been made to systematically review the effects of these mind-body exercises on individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). This review aimed to appraise the current evidence of the effects of mind-body exercises on the physiological and psychological outcomes for the PD population.\nSystematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\nFour English databases, namely, the EMBASE, Ovid Medline, Psych Info, and Cochrane Library, were searched on January 2016.\nStudies involving participants with idiopathic PD were included if mind-body exercises were applied and compared with a non-exercise control to improve physiological and psychosocial well-being. The Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool was used for quality appraisal. RevMan 5.3 was employed to perform this meta-analysis. A subgroup analysis regarding the types and the dose of intervention was conducted to explore the sources of heterogeneity.\nTen studies met the inclusion criteria for quality appraisal. The overall methodological rating of these studies indicated that one study was strong; five studies were moderate; and four studies were weak. Nine articles comprising five Tai Chi, two yoga, and two dance studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results of this review showed that mind-body exercises had a large, significant beneficial effect in motor symptoms in terms of UPDRS III for people with mild to moderate PD [SMD=-0.91, 95% CI (-1.37, -0.45), p<0.05]. Significant subgroup differences were found among various types of mind-body exercises (p=0.001). Yoga demonstrated the largest and most significant beneficial effect in reducing UPDRS III scores [SMD=-2.35, 95% CI (-3.21, -1.50), p<0.01]. The pooled meta-analysis results showed that mind-body exercises had a large, significant effect in improving postural instability in terms of the Berg Balance Scale [SMD=1.48, 95% CI (0.91, 2.06), p<0.01] and Timed Up and Go test [SMD=-0.97, 95% CI (-1.46, -0.47), p<0.01] and moderate, significant effect in improving functional mobility in terms of the Six-minute Walk test [SMD=0.78, 95% CI (0.35, 1.21), p<0.05].\nThis review found that mind-body exercises demonstrated immediate moderate to large beneficial effects on motor symptoms, postural instability, and functional mobility among individuals with mild to moderate PD. However, the effects of mind-body exercises on psychosocial well-being had not been amply investigated, especially for yoga intervention. Future research should address the psychosocial effects of mind-body exercises on the PD population.",

    "abstract": "The dissociation between the processing of verbs and nouns has been debated in light of the Embodied Cognition Theory (EC). The objective of this paper is to verify how action and verb processing deficits of PD patients are modulated by different tasks with different cognitive demands. Action and object lexical-semantic processing was evaluated in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and cognitively healthy controls through three different tasks (verbal fluency, naming and semantic association). Compared to controls, PD patients presented worse performance in naming actions and in the two semantic association tasks (action/object). Action verbal fluency performance was significantly associated with PD severity whereas object semantic association deficits and noun verbal fluency scores were associated to lower scores in measures of global cognitive functioning. Our data suggest that semantic deficits are related to the type of cognitive processing and this is in the line with more flexible EC accounts.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal microbiota influence neurodevelopment, modulate behavior, and contribute to neurological disorders. However, a functional link between gut bacteria and neurodegenerative diseases remains unexplored. Synucleinopathies are characterized by aggregation of the protein \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn), often resulting in motor dysfunction as exemplified by Parkinson's disease (PD). Using mice that overexpress \u03b1Syn, we report herein that gut microbiota are required for motor deficits, microglia activation, and \u03b1Syn pathology. Antibiotic treatment ameliorates, while microbial re-colonization promotes, pathophysiology in adult animals, suggesting that postnatal signaling between the gut and the brain modulates disease. Indeed, oral administration of specific microbial metabolites to germ-free mice promotes neuroinflammation and motor symptoms. Remarkably, colonization of \u03b1Syn-overexpressing mice with microbiota from PD-affected patients enhances physical impairments compared to microbiota transplants from healthy human donors. These findings reveal that gut bacteria regulate movement disorders in mice and suggest that alterations in the human microbiome represent a risk factor for PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this postmortem study was to compare, in Parkinson's disease subjects with and without bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS), the loss of pigmented neurons within the substantia nigra and pathological alpha-synuclein density within the SN and other brain regions.\nPD subjects were identified from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders database (STN-DBS\u2009=\u200911, non-DBS\u2009=\u2009156). Pigmented neuron loss scores within the substantia nigra as well as alpha-synuclein density scores within the substantia nigra and 9 other brain regions were compared, the latter individually and in summary as the Lewy body brain load score.\nDBS subjects had higher alpha-synuclein density scores within the substantia nigra, olfactory bulb, and locus ceruleus, as well as higher total Lewy body brain load scores when compared with non-DBS subjects. No differences in substantia nigra pigmented neuron loss scores were found.\nSTN-DBS subjects tend to have higher alpha-synuclein density scores, but do not have a differential loss of substantia nigra pigmented neurons. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a promising target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease; however, little is known about the expression of LRRK2 in human brain and if/how LRRK2 protein levels are altered in Parkinson's disease.\nWe measured the protein levels of LRRK2 as well as its phosphorylation on serines 910, 935, and 973 in the postmortem brain tissue of Parkinson's disease patients and aged controls with and without Lewy bodies.\nLRRK2 and its phosphorylation were measured by immunoblot in brain regions differentially affected in Parkinson's disease (n\u2009=\u200930) as well as subjects with Lewy bodies restricted to the periphery and lower brain stem (n\u2009=\u200925) and matched controls without pathology (n\u2009=\u200925).\nLRRK2 levels were increased in cases with restricted Lewy bodies, with a 30% increase measured in the substantia nigra. In clinical Parkinson's disease, levels of LRRK2 negatively correlated to disease duration and were comparable with controls. LRRK2 phosphorylation, however, particularly at serine 935, was reduced with clinical Parkinson's disease with a 36% reduction measured in the substantia nigra.\nOur data show that LRRK2 phosphorylation is reduced with clinical PD, whereas LRRK2 expression is increased in early potential prodromal stages. These results contribute to a better understanding of the role of LRRK2 in idiopathic Parkinson's disease and may aid efforts aimed at therapeutically targeting the LRRK2 protein. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Health-related quality of life is a patient-reported outcome that complements clinical evaluation and provides information about disease activity and effects of the treatment. The objective of this review is to present the conceptual framework, the measures, and some of their most relevant applications in the field of Parkinson's disease and movement disorders. Health-related quality of life is a subjective, individual, and multidimensional construct, and its main dimensions are physical, mental, and social, besides global perceptions of health and personal domains. Health-related quality of life measurement is carried out by means of questionnaires or scales, ideally self-applied by patients, and has a diversity of important applications for clinical practice, research, and health policy. Movement disorders and Parkinson's disease are complex conditions impacting all components of patients' health-related quality of life. The use of health-related quality of life tools provides important information on a variety of aspects that are important to patients while complementing clinical evaluations. In particular, studies using this kind of assessment can identify and monitor the most important health-related quality of life determinant factors, allowing tailored assistance and prioritized interventions. In addition, maintaining or improving the patients' health-related quality of life is an objective of care for chronic diseases and, therefore, it has to be monitored over time and as an outcome of clinical trials. Several methods are available for the interpretation of the change in scores of health-related quality of life measures, although a definitive agreement on the most appropriate method is yet to be determined. Presently, health-related quality of life assessment is an important outcome for research and management of chronic conditions such as Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "The impact of dental amalgam on the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still uncertain, although a positive association between dental amalgam and PD has been found in a few case-control studies. The patients with amalgam fillings restored between 2000 and 2008 were identified by using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. The same number of patients who had no new amalgam filling restored was matched by sex, age, and treatment date. Both cohorts were followed up from the treatment date until the date of diagnosis of PD, death, or the end of the year 2008. The individuals who received amalgam fillings had a significantly higher risk of PD afterward (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]=1.583, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.122-2.234, p=0.0089) than those who did not. In the individuals who received amalgam fillings, being diagnosed with diabetes or hyperlipidemia demonstrated a significantly lower HR of PD occurrence than in the patients without diabetes or hyperlipidemia (HR=0.449, 95% CI=0.254-0.794, p=0.0059; HR=0.445, 95% CI=0.260-0.763, p=0.0032) after adjusting for comorbidities and Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores. Meanwhile, hypertension increased the hazard risk of PD (HR=1.645, 95% CI=1.098-2.464, p=0.0159). The patients exposed to dental amalgam fillings were 1.583 times more likely to have PD afterward compared to their non-exposed counterparts after adjusting for comorbidities and CCI scores.",

    "abstract": "Hallucinations have been described in various clinical populations, but they are neither disorder nor disease specific. In schizophrenia patients, hallucinations are hallmark symptoms and auditory ones are described as the more frequent. In Parkinson's disease, the descriptions of hallucination modalities are sparse, but the hallucinations do tend to have less negative consequences. Our study aims to explore the phenomenology of hallucinations in both hallucinating schizophrenia patients and Parkinson's disease patients using the Psycho-Sensory hAllucinations Scale (PSAS). The main objective is to describe the phenomena of these clinical symptoms in those two specific populations. Each hallucinatory sensory modality significantly differed between Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia patients. Auditory, olfactory/gustatory and c\u0153nesthetic hallucinations were more frequent in schizophrenia than visual hallucinations. The guardian angel item, usually not explored in schizophrenia, was described by 46% of these patients. The combination of auditory and visual hallucinations was the most frequent for both Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. The repercussion index summing characteristics of each hallucination (frequency, duration, negative aspects, conviction, impact, control and sound intensity) was always higher for schizophrenia. A broader view including widespread characteristics and interdisciplinary works must be encouraged to better understand the complexity of the process involved in hallucinations.",

No neuroprotective treatments have successfully prevented the progression of this disease. We report that p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is a key survival factor for DA neurons. We observed PAK4 immunoreactivity in rat and human DA neurons in brain tissue, but not in microglia or astrocytes. PAK4 activity was markedly decreased in postmortem brain tissue from PD patients and in rodent models of PD. Expression of constitutively active PAK4",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relation between orthostatic hypotension (OH) and posture-mediated cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD) using a cross-sectional and within-group design.\nIndividuals without dementia with idiopathic PD included 18 with OH (PDOH) and 19 without OH; 18 control participants were also included. Neuropsychological tests were conducted in supine and upright-tilted positions. Blood pressure was assessed in each posture.\nThe PD groups performed similarly while supine, demonstrating executive dysfunction in sustained attention and response inhibition, and reduced semantic fluency and verbal memory (encoding and retention). Upright posture exacerbated and broadened these deficits in the PDOH group to include phonemic fluency, psychomotor speed, and auditory working memory. When group-specific supine scores were used as baseline anchors, both PD groups showed cognitive changes following tilt, with the PDOH group exhibiting a wider range of deficits in executive function and memory as well as significant changes in visuospatial function.\nCognitive deficits in PD have been widely reported with assessments performed in the supine position, as seen in both our PD groups. Here we demonstrated that those with PDOH had transient, posture-mediated changes in excess of those found in PD without OH. These observed changes suggest an acute, reversible effect. Understanding the effects of OH due to autonomic failure on cognition is desirable, particularly as neuroimaging and clinical assessments collect data only in the supine or seated positions. Identification of a distinct neuropsychological profile in PD with OH has quality of life implications, and OH presents itself as a possible target for intervention in cognitive disturbance.",

    "abstract": "Over the past several years, the concept of prodromal Parkinson disease (PD) has been increasingly recognized. This term refers to individuals who do not fulfill motor diagnostic criteria for PD, but who have clinical, genetic, or biomarker characteristics suggesting risk of developing PD in the future. Clinical diagnosis of prodromal PD has low specificity, prompting the need for objective biomarkers with higher specificity. In this qualitative review, we discuss objectively defined putative biomarkers for PD and prodromal PD.\nWe searched Pubmed and Embase for articles pertaining to objective biomarkers for PD and their application in prodromal cohorts. Articles were selected based on relevance and methodology.\nObjective biomarkers of demonstrated utility in prodromal PD include ligand-based imaging and transcranial sonography. Development of serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissue-based biomarkers is underway, but their application in prodromal PD has yet to meaningfully occur. Combining objective biomarkers with clinical or genetic prodromal features increases the sensitivity and specificity for identifying prodromal PD.\nSeveral objective biomarkers for prodromal PD show promise but require further study, including their application to and validation in prodromal cohorts followed longitudinally. Accurate identification of prodromal PD will likely require a multimodal approach. (JINS, 2016, 22, 956-967).",

    "abstract": "Recent failures in clinical trials for disease modification in Parkinson's disease have highlighted the need for a non-human primate model of the synucleinopathy underpinning dopaminergic neuron degeneration. The present study was defined to begin the development of such a model in cynomolgus macaque. We have validated surgical and vector parameters to define a means to provide a robust over-expression of alpha-synuclein which is associated with Lewy-like pathology and robust degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. Thus, an AAV1/2 vector incorporating strong transcription and transduction regulatory elements was used to deliver the gene for the human A53T mutation of alpha-synuclein. When injected into 4 sites within each substantia nigra (7 \u03bcl per site, 1.7 x 1012 gp/ml), this vector provided expression lasting at least 4 months, and a 50% loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons and a 60% reduction in striatal dopamine. Further studies will be required to develop this methodology into a validated model of value as a drug development platform.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present work was to investigate the neurochemical changes induced in the cerebellum of rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Rats were divided into two groups; control and rat model of PD induced by the intrastriatal injection of rotenone. As compared to control, a significant increase in the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters; glutamate and aspartate together with a significant decrease in the inhibitory amino acids, GABA, glycine and taurine were observed in the cerebellum of rat model of PD. This was associated with a significant increase in lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and a significant decrease in reduced glutathione. A significant decrease in acetylcholinesterase and a significant increase in Na+,K+-ATPase were recorded in the cerebellum of rat model of PD. In addition the cerebellar sections from rat model of PD showed marked necrosis of Purkinje cells, irregular damaged cells, cytoplasmic shrinkage, necrosis and perineuronal vacuolation. The present results indicate that the disturbance in the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory amino acids may have a role in the pathogenesis of PD. According to the present neurochemical and histopathological changes, the cerebellum should be taken into consideration during the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac parasympathetic function is strongly affected by aging. Although sympathetic dysfunction has been well documented in Parkinson's disease (PD), cardiac parasympathetic dysfunction has not been well studied. The objective of this study was to clarify the development of cardiac parasympathetic dysfunction in the early phase of PD and to explore the age-corrected correlation between cardiac parasympathetic dysfunction and cardiac sympathetic dysfunction. We reviewed 25 healthy controls and 56 patients with idiopathic PD of Hoehn and Yahr stages I-III. We evaluated cardiac parasympathetic function using the Valsalva ratio, the baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and the coefficient of variation of RR intervals in the resting state (resting-CVRR) and during deep breathing (DB-CVRR). In addition, we measured cardiac ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Oxidative stress has been hypothesized to play a major role in the development of PD in various studies. This study assessed to investigate oxidative and anti-oxidative status in PD patients. We evaluated oxidant/antioxidant status by measuring serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, xanthine oxidase (XO) activities, and activities of antioxidant enzymes, namely, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The study included 29 patients with PD and 32 healthy subjects as controls. Comparison of oxidative parameters in the patient and control groups revealed significantly higher GSH-Px and XO activities in the patient group. Serum MDA and SOD activities in PD patients were not significantly different from the controls. MDA was negatively correlated with duration of the PD and positively with age of onset. There was a negative correlation between SOD and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage. According to these results, we suggest that oxidative stress may contribute to the development of PD.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is now widely accepted as a fundamental aspect of Parkinson's disease (PD). Given the prevalence of cognitive impairment and the associated impact on well-being, evidence-based interventions are needed. However, while research is continually accumulating in order to better understand the pathology and trajectory of cognitive changes, treatment options lag behind. Nonpharmacological approaches are of particular interest in this group, given the typical polypharmacy already present in PD patients. In this regard, cognitive training (CT) is a relatively new and prominent therapeutic option with accumulating scientific support and increasing public awareness. Research has now established benefits across many different populations, and trials investigating the use of CT specifically in PD are becoming more common. We offer a brief summary of CT and its efficacy in PD samples to date, as well as discuss areas requiring further exploration in this group. Crucially, we suggest that CT should be supported as a research priority in PD, given both proven and potential benefits as a noninvasive and well-tolerated behavioral intervention for cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Clinical, pathological and genetic overlap between sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been suggested; however, the relationship between these disorders is still not well understood. Here we evaluated genetic overlap between FTD, AD and PD to assess shared pathobiology and identify novel genetic variants associated with increased risk for FTD.\nSummary statistics were obtained from the International FTD Genomics Consortium, International PD Genetics Consortium and International Genomics of AD Project (n>75\u2005000 cases and controls). We used conjunction false discovery rate (FDR) to evaluate genetic pleiotropy and conditional FDR to identify novel FTD-associated SNPs. Relevant variants were further evaluated for expression quantitative loci.\nWe observed SNPs within the HLA, MAPT and APOE regions jointly contributing to increased risk for FTD and AD or PD. By conditioning on polymorphisms associated with PD and AD, we found 11 loci associated with increased risk for FTD. Meta-analysis across two independent FTD cohorts revealed a genome-wide signal within the APOE region (rs6857, 3'-UTR=PVRL2, p=2.21\u00d710\nOur findings demonstrate genetic pleiotropy in these neurodegenerative diseases and indicate that sporadic FTD is a polygenic disorder where multiple pleiotropic loci with small effects contribute to increased disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) region are selectively destroyed. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) has been well known to play a key role in a variety of processes such as embryogenesis, cell proliferation and protection, and tissue repair during inflammation. However, the evidences for the innate role of Shh in adult brain injury are presently lacking and studies have been needed to unveil the importance of Shh in the process of neurodegeneration. Here, we investigated the role of Shh in the pathologic progress of Parkinson's disease in MPTP-induced animal model system. Interestingly, we observed that Shh expression was gradually increased in MPTP affected SNpc region. Activated microglia exclusively expressed SHH in\u00a0vivo and we could recapitulate Shh induction in activated cultured primary microglia cells. Using the SHH responsive Cre-loxP binary genetic reporter transgenic mouse system, we also found that most of the cell types except for oligodendrocyte in the SNpc region reacted to the SHH by MPTP injection. Taken together, activated microglia induced Shh expression and most neural cells except oligodendrocyte responded to microglia-derived SHH in MPTP-treated SN. These results suggest that SHH in activated microglia by MPTP-injection might be involved in the innate processes of recovery from neurotoxin induced injury in the PD animal model system.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are related, progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disorders with hallmark features that include a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms (behavioral, autonomic and cognitive dysfunction). For almost half a century, the motor aspects have been attributed to Lewy pathology (LP) predominantly in the substantia nigra (SN), causing a major loss of dopaminergic neurons. However, the relative success of dopaminergic replacement therapies for alleviation of solely the parkinsonian features has prompted researchers to further explore other monoaminergic strategies which may tackle all PD-related aspects. In this regard, recent evidence suggests that LP in the locus coeruleus (LC), the brain's main source of norepinephrine (NE), precedes that of the SN, and, may be one of the very first etiological events in PD. Interestingly, oxidized NE has neuroprotective properties and may even prevent the formation of toxic and higher molecular weight \u03b1-synuclein oligomers associated with PD. Moreover, norepinephrinergic neurons directly innervate the SN, and, LC lesioning causes more severe dopaminergic cell loss and supplementary motor manifestations, as shown in preclinical research. In fact, the LC may be considered one of the main orchestrators that controls the other major monoaminergic nuclei, such as the SN and raphe nuclei. Apart from its regulating function, disruption of such a sustainable but vulnerable LC-NE system has been linked to the cognitive pathophysiology of dementia as well. Consequently, LC neuronal loss and the accompanying norepinephrinergic deficiency constitute an important pharmacological target for the (symptomatic) treatment of PD/DLB/PDD. This review, therefore, summarizes and discusses all relevant neurochemical research, including the intriguing link with (prodromal) dementia, several biomarker opportunities, the latest therapeutic strategies to enhance NE signaling, and, finally, some overarching comments and perspectives for future research.",

    "abstract": "Although subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) is often accompanied by Parkinson's disease (PD) and may predict the development of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, longitudinal brain perfusion changes in PD patients with SCI remain to be elucidated. The current prospective study examined cerebral perfusion changes in PD patients with SCI using technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).\nAmong 53 PD patients at baseline, 30 patients were classified into the PD with SCI group and 23 patients were assigned to the PD without SCI group. The mean follow-up interval was 2.3\u00b10.9 years. The Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating, and Global Deterioration Scale were used to assess impairments in cognitive function. Brain SPECT images were acquired at baseline and follow-up.\nSignificant differences between the two groups were not found for demographic variables, PD severity, or cognitive function at either baseline or follow-up. At baseline, the PD with SCI group showed decreased perfusion in the left angular gyrus compared to the PD without SCI group. Longitudinal analysis revealed widespread perfusion reductions primarily in the bilateral temporo-parieto-occipital areas and cerebellum in the PD with SCI group. Relative to the PD without SCI group, an excessive decrease of perfusion was found in the left middle frontal gyrus of the PD with SCI patients.\nOur findings suggest that perfusion deficits in the middle frontal area may play an important role in the pathophysiology of SCI in PD.",

    "abstract": "When oral or transdermal drug therapy in Parkinson's disease becomes less effective, there are three therapies using assisted devices that can reduce motor and non-motor complications: subcutaneous apomorphine infusion pump (SAIP), continuous levodopa/carbidopa duodenal infusion (LDI) and deep brain stimulation (DBS).\nConduct a comparative pharmacoeconomic analysis of the use of SAIP, with LDI and DBS. As a secondary objective arises discuss the profile of the ideal candidate for each of the technicals.\nInformation on life years gained and quality adjusted life years (QALY) according to Hoehn and Yahr scale was obtained, as well as data on costs and resource use for each of the alternatives. The perspective of the analysis was the National Health System and the time horizon was 5 years for costs and patient\u00b4s lifetime for utilities. Outcome measures used were life years gained and QALYs, and incremental cost/utility ratio for comparison.\nCost/utility ratio was obtained for each option: 31,956 euros/QALY for DBS, 38,249 euros/QALY for SAIP, and 75,206 euros/QALY for LDI.\nOur results allow us to add information about effectiveness of different treatments, as these are presented in gain of years lived in full health (QALY). Data obtained contribute to decision making that determine planning and management of each case, without forgetting patient and neurologist preferences, as well as budgetary limitations.\nEstudio farmacoeconomico del tratamiento de la enfermedad de Parkinson avanzada.\nIntroduccion. Cuando el tratamiento farmacologico oral o transdermico de la enfermedad de Parkinson pierde eficacia, se dispone de tres terapias mediante dispositivos asistidos que pueden reducir las complicaciones motoras y no motoras: la apomorfina en infusion subcutanea (ASBI), la bomba de infusion duodenal continua de levodopa/carbidopa (IDL) y la estimulacion cerebral profunda (ECP). Objetivo. Efectuar un analisis farmacoeconomico comparativo del uso de ASBI con IDL y ECP; como objetivo secundario, discutir el perfil del candidato ideal para cada una de las tecnicas. Pacientes y metodos. Se extrajo informacion sobre datos de a\u00f1os de vida ganados y a\u00f1os de vida ganados ajustados por calidad (AVAC) segun la escala de Hoehn y Yahr, e informacion sobre costes y consumo de recursos para cada alternativa. La perspectiva del analisis fue la del Sistema Nacional de Salud, y el horizonte temporal fue de cinco a\u00f1os para los costes y toda la vida del paciente para las utilidades. Las medidas de resultado utilizadas fueron los a\u00f1os de vida ganados y AVAC, y en su comparacion se uso la ratio coste-utilidad incremental. Resultados. El coste-utilidad obtenido para cada opcion fue: 31.956 euros/AVAC para la ECP, 38.249 euros/AVAC para la ASBI y 75.206 euros/AVAC para la IDL. Conclusiones. Los resultados permiten evaluar la efectividad y utilidad de los diferentes tratamientos para la enfermedad de Parkinson avanzada, pues se presentan en ganancias de a\u00f1os vividos en plena salud. Los datos obtenidos contribuyen a la toma de decisiones que determinen la planificacion y gestion de cada caso, sin olvidar las preferencias del paciente y del neurologo, asi como las limitaciones presupuestarias.",

    "abstract": "As a biomarker of axonal injury, neurofilament light chain (NFL) in multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients has been investigated by numerous studies. However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NFL changes are conflicting in MSA patients relative to PD patients to date. Therefore, the current study was carried out to find out possible heterogeneity sources. Furthermore, \"Neurofilament\", \"Neurofilament light chain\" and \"Multiple system atrophy\" were employed to search \"PubMed\", \"Springer\" and \"Medline\" databases until August 2016 with standard mean difference (Std.MD) being calculated. In addition, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to assess possible heterogeneity sources. Nine studies were pooled, in which 212 MSA patients and 373 PD patients were involved. Moreover, CSF NFL in MSA patients was higher than that in PD patients [pooled Std.MD\u00a0=\u00a01.56, 95% CI (1.12, 2.00), p\u00a0<\u00a00.00001] with significant heterogeneity (I ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder of aging, was long believed to be a non-genetic sporadic origin syndrome. The proof that several genetic loci are responsible for rare Mendelian forms has represented a revolutionary breakthrough, enabling to reveal molecular mechanisms underlying this debilitating still incurable condition. While single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indels constitute the most commonly investigated DNA variations accounting for only a limited number of PD cases, larger genomic molecular rearrangements have emerged as significant PD-causing mutations, including submicroscopic Copy Number Variations (CNVs). CNVs constitute a prevalent source of genomic variations and substantially participate in each individual's genomic makeup and phenotypic outcome. However, the majority of genetic studies have focused their attention on single candidate-gene mutations or on common variants reaching a significant statistical level of acceptance. This gene-centric approach is insufficient to uncover the genetic background of polygenic multifactorial disorders like PD, and potentially masks rare individual CNVs that all together might contribute to disease development or progression. In this review, we will discuss literature and bioinformatic data describing the involvement of CNVs on PD pathobiology. We will analyze the most frequent copy number changes in familiar PD genes and provide a \"systems biology\" overview of rare individual rearrangements that could functionally act on commonly deregulated molecular pathways. Assessing the global genome-wide burden of CNVs in PD patients may reveal new disease-related molecular mechanisms, and open the window to a new possible genetic scenario in the unsolved PD puzzle.",

    "abstract": "Although, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) are still elusive, it is now known that spreading of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) pathology and neuroinflammation are important players in disease progression. Here, we developed a novel microfluidic cell-culture platform for studying the communication between two different cell populations, a process of critical importance not only in PD but also in many biological processes. The integration of micro-valves in the device enabled us to control fluid routing, cellular microenvironments, and to simulate paracrine signaling. As proof of concept, two sets of experiments were designed to show how this platform can be used to investigate specific molecular mechanisms associated with PD. In one experiment, na\u00efve H4 neuroglioma cells were co-cultured with cells expressing aSyn tagged with GFP (aSyn-GFP), to study the release and spreading of the protein. In our experimental set up, we induced the release of the contents of aSyn-GFP producing cells to the medium and monitored the protein's diffusion. In another experiment, H4 cells were co-cultured with N9 microglial cells to assess the interplay between two cell lines in response to environmental stimuli. Here, we observed an increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species in H4 cells cultured in the presence of activated N9 cells, confirming the cross talk between different cell populations. In summary, the platform developed in this study affords novel opportunities for the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is recognized by the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein within neurons. In contrast to the current ascending theory where \u03b1-synuclein would propagate from neuron to neuron, we now propose the threshold theory for PD based on evidence of parallel degeneration of both central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) in PD. The functional threshold is lower for the emergence of early symptoms before the classical motor symptoms of PD. This is due to the larger functional reserve of the midbrain dopamine and integrated basal ganglia motor systems to control movement. This threshold theory better accounts for the current neurobiology of PD symptom progression compared to the hypothesis that the disease ascends from the PNS to the CNS as proposed by Braak's hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Distinct speech characteristics that may aid in differentiation between Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) remain tremendously under-explored. Here, the patterns and degree of consonant articulation deficits across voiced and voiceless stop plosives in 16 PD, 16 PSP, 16 MSA and 16 healthy control speakers were evaluated using acoustic and perceptual methods. Imprecise consonant articulation was observed across all Parkinsonian groups. Voice onset time of voiceless plosives was more prolonged in both PSP and MSA compared to PD, presumably due to greater severity of dysarthria and slower articulation rate. Voice onset time of voiced plosives was significantly shorter only in MSA, likely as a consequence of damage to cerebellar structures. In agreement with the reduction of pre-voicing, MSA manifested increased number of voiced plosives misclassified as voiceless at perceptual evaluation. Timing of articulatory movements may provide important clues about the pathophysiology of underlying disease.",

    "abstract": "Sensory information is essential for the precise control of movement. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have higher-order sensory dysfunctions including prolonged temporal discrimination threshold (TDT). However, the impact of prolonged TDT on parkinsonian motor deficits is uncertain.\nThis study includes 33 PD patients and 24 healthy controls. TDT values were measured in the index finger. Using coin rotation task (CRT), dexterous finger movement was assessed. Using an inertial sensor, the speed, amplitude, and frequency of finger tapping were measured. The impact of prolonged index finger TDT on two different finger movements was analyzed using the general estimating equation.\nCompared to healthy controls, TDT was prolonged in the PD patients. There was no impact of TDT on mean values or decrement for amplitude and speed, as well as mean values, decrement and variability of tapping frequency. However, prolonged TDT had a significant impact on the variability in amplitude (B = 436.905 \u00d7 10-4, Wald \u03c72 = 9.140, p = 0.014) and speed (B = 425.655 \u00d7 10-4, Wald \u03c72 = 9.876, p = 0.014) of finger tapping. There was a marginal correlation between TDT and CRT. In addition, CRT correlated with variability in amplitude and speed of finger tapping.\nIn PD, cutaneous temporal discriminative sensory dysfunction appears to be related to increased variabilities in the speed and amplitude of fast repetitive finger movements and disturbed finger dexterity.",

There was a marginal correlation between TDT and CRT. In addition, CRT correlated with variability in amplitude and speed of finger tapping.",

    "abstract": "Chronic constipation (CC) is a common and severe gastrointestinal complaint in Parkinson's disease (PD), but its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. This study evaluated functionally distinct submucosal neurons in relation to colonic motility and anorectal function in PD patients with constipation (PD/CC) vs both CC and controls.\nTwenty-nine PD/CC and 10 Rome III-defined CC patients were enrolled. Twenty asymptomatic age-sex matched subjects served as controls. Colonic transit time measurement and conventional anorectal manometry were evaluated in PD/CC and CC patients. Colonoscopy was performed in all three groups. Colonic submucosal whole mounts from PD/CC, CC, and controls were processed for immunohistochemistry with antibodies for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and peripheral choline acetyltransferase, markers for functionally distinct submucosal neurons. The mRNA expression of VIP and its receptors were also assessed.\nFour subgroups of PD/CC patients were identified: delayed colonic transit plus altered anorectal manometry (65%); delayed colonic transit (13%); altered manometric pattern (13%); and no transit and manometric impairment (9%). There were no differences in the number of neurons/ganglion between PD/CC vs CC or vs controls. A reduced number of submucosal neurons containing VIP immunoreactivity was found in PD/CC vs controls (P<.05). VIP, VIPR1, and VIPR2 mRNA expression was significantly reduced in PD/CC vs CC and controls (P<.05).\nColonic motor and rectal sensory functions are impaired in most PD/CC patients. These abnormalities are associated with a decreased VIP expression in submucosal neurons. Both sensory-motor abnormalities and neurally mediated motor and secretory mechanisms are likely to contribute to PD/CC pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "The recent application of graph theory to brain networks promises to shed light on complex diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to investigate functional changes in sensorimotor and cognitive networks in Parkinsonian patients, with a focus on inter- and intra-connectivity organization in the disease-associated nodal and hub regions using the graph theoretical analyses. Resting-state functional MRI data of a total of 65 participants, including 23 healthy controls (HCs) and 42 patients, were investigated in 120 nodes for local efficiency, betweenness centrality, and degree. Hub regions were identified in the HC and patient groups. We found nodal and hub changes in patients compared with HCs, including the right pre-supplementary motor area (SMA), left anterior insula, bilateral mid-insula, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and right caudate nucleus. In general, nodal regions within the sensorimotor network (i.e., right pre-SMA and right mid-insula) displayed weakened connectivity, with the former node associated with more severe bradykinesia, and impaired integration with default mode network regions. The left mid-insula also lost its hub properties in patients. Within the executive networks, the left anterior insular cortex lost its hub properties in patients, while a new hub region was identified in the right caudate nucleus, paralleled by an increased level of inter- and intra-connectivity in the bilateral DLPFC possibly representing compensatory mechanisms. These findings highlight the diffuse changes in nodal organization and regional hub disruption accounting for the distributed abnormalities across brain networks and the clinical manifestations of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease, affecting about seven to 10 million patients worldwide. The major pathological features of PD are loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway and accumulation of alpha-synuclein molecules, forming Lewy bodies. Until now, there is no effective cure for PD, and investigators are searching for neuroprotective strategies to stop or slow the disease progression. The MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) induced neurotoxicity of the nigrostriatal pathway has been used to initiate PD in animal models. Multiple experimental studies showed the ability of several plant extracts to protect against MPTP induced neurotoxicity through activation of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase enzymes, which reduce the cellular concentration of free radicals, preventing intracellular Ca",

    "abstract": "Recent several meta-analyses and certain case-control studies suggested that the Ras-like without CAAX 2 (RIT2) rs12456492 increased the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in Asian and Caucasian populations. However, as so far, the association between RIT2 rs12456492 and PD is still controversial. We investigated genetic association of RIT2 rs12456492 with PD susceptibility in a Han Chinese population of 1747 ethnic Han Chinese subjects comprising 884 PD patients and 863 healthy controls. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of G at the RIT2 rs12456492 was not significantly different between the cases and the controls. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in genotype distribution between PD patients and healthy controls for the RIT2 rs12456492, even after being stratified by age at onset and gender. In addition, we found that no significant differences were detected in the clinical manifestations for gender, age at onset, and onset symptoms between PD patients with AG\u00a0+\u00a0GG genotypes and those with AA genotypes. Our study from the mainland China demonstrates that RIT2 rs12456492 do not increase the risk of developing PD. Therefore, more replication studies in additional Chinese population and other cohorts are warranted to further clarify the role of RIT2 rs12456492 in PD susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Although Parkinson's Disease (PD) is mostly considered a motor disorder, it can present at early stages as a non-motor pathology. Among the non-motor clinical manifestations, depression shows a high prevalence and can be one of the first clinical signs to appear, even a decade before the onset of motor symptoms. Here, we review the evidence of early dysfunction in neural circuitry associated with depression in the context of PD, focusing on pre-clinical, pre-motor and early motor phases of the disease. In the pre-clinical phase, structural and functional changes in the substantia nigra, basal ganglia and limbic structures are already observed. Some of these changes are linked to motor compensation mechanisms while others correspond to pathological processes common to PD and depression and thus could underlie the appearance of depressive symptoms during the pre-motor phase. Studies of the early motor phase (less than five years post diagnosis) reveal an association between the extent of damage in different monoaminergic systems and the appearance of emotional disorders. We propose that the limbic loop of the basal ganglia and the lateral habenula play key roles in the early genesis of depression in PD. Alterations in the neural circuitry linked with emotional control might be sensitive markers of the ongoing neurodegenerative process and thus may serve to facilitate an early diagnosis of this disease. To take advantage of this, we need to improve the clinical criteria and develop biomarkers to identify depression, which could be used to determine individuals at risk to develop PD.",

    "abstract": "Although hydrotherapy is one of the physical therapies adopted to optimize gait rehabilitation in people with Parkinson disease, the quantitative measurement of gait-related outcomes has not been provided yet. This work aims to document the gait improvements in a group of parkinsonians after a hydrotherapy program through 2D and 3D underwater and on land gait analysis. Thirty-four parkinsonians and twenty-two controls were enrolled, divided into two different cohorts. In the first one, 2 groups of patients underwent underwater or land based walking training; controls underwent underwater walking training. Hence pre-treatment 2D underwater and on land gait analysis were performed, together with post-treatment on land gait analysis. Considering that current literature documented a reduced movement amplitude in parkinsonians across all lower limb joints in all movement planes, 3D underwater and on land gait analysis were performed on a second cohort of subjects (10 parkinsonians and 10 controls) who underwent underwater gait training. Baseline land 2D and 3D gait analysis in parkinsonians showed shorter stride length and slower speed than controls, in agreement with previous findings. Comparison between underwater and on land gait analysis showed reduction in stride length, cadence and speed on both parkinsonians and controls. Although patients who underwent underwater treatment exhibited significant changes on spatiotemporal parameters and sagittal plane lower limb kinematics, 3D gait analysis documented a significant (p<0.05) improvement in all movement planes. These data deserve attention for research directions promoting the optimal recovery and maintenance of walking ability.",

    "abstract": "Reduction of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake has been observed in almost all patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), associated with hyposmia, orthostatic hypotension and rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder (RBD). In contrast, a subgroup of patients with PD with normal MIBG uptake have been reported to have milder disease and preserved cognition compared with those with lower MIBG. The aim of this study was to investigate whether non-motor manifestations of PD differ between patients with normal and abnormal myocardial MIBG uptake.\nAmong 160 de-novo cases of PD, 44 had normal MIBG uptake. Twelve candidate non-motor features were evaluated using questionnaires and laboratory tests.\nPatients with decreased MIBG uptake had more constipation, RBD, cognitive impairment, hyposmia and orthostatic hypotension than did those with normal MIBG uptake. On linear regression analysis, orthostatic hypotension, olfactory function and probable RBD were significantly associated with MIBG uptake in PD. The principal component analysis showed that the group with normal MIBG was not associated with non-motor impairments.\nThese results suggest that patients with PD with normal MIBG scans have a relatively low disease burden compared with those with abnormal MIBG. Fewer synuclein pathologies in the myocardia and sympathetic ganglia in PD with preserved MIBG uptake might be associated with lower threshold patterns of Braak synuclein pathology for non-motor manifestations compared with PD with decreased MIBG.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is likely a key contributor to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressively debilitating neurodegenerative disease that is accompanied by a pathological accumulation of the \u03b1-synuclein protein in a staged manner through the brain. What leads to the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in PD and how this relates to inflammatory pathways, however, is not entirely clear. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is a major pathway mediating inflammation and, in particular, TLR2 is increasingly being implicated in PD. We have, therefore, examined the expression of TLR2 in postmortem brain tissue from PD patients and matched controls. We confirm that TLR2 is increased in PD brain, and find that levels of TLR2 correlate with the accumulation of pathological \u03b1-synuclein. TLR2 was expressed on neurons as well as microglia; however, the neuronal rather than glial expression of TLR2 was significantly increased in PD brain in accordance with disease staging, and TLR2 was strongly localized to \u03b1-synuclein positive Lewy bodies. In cell culture, activation of neuronal TLR2 induced an inflammatory response, including the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and microglial-activating chemokines, as well as the production of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, activation of neuronal TLR2 increased levels of endogenous \u03b1-synuclein protein, which was in turn associated with increased levels of the autophagy/lysosomal pathway marker p62. Finally, promoting autophagy with rapamycin or pharmacological inhibition of the TLR2 signaling pathway prevented the TLR2-mediated increase in \u03b1-synuclein in neuronal cell cultures. These results implicate neuronal TLR2 expression in human PD pathogenesis. In particular, the increased expression of TLR2 on neurons may provide new insight into disease pathogenesis and/or options for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of multifactorial etiology affecting \u223c1% of older adults. Research focused on linking PD to falls and bone fractures has been limited in Emergency Department (ED) settings, where most injuries are identified. We assessed whether injured U.S. ED admissions with PD diagnoses were more likely to exhibit comorbid fall- or non-fall related bone fractures and whether a PD diagnosis with a concomitant fall or bone fracture is linked to worse prognosis.\nWe performed secondary analyses of 2010 Healthcare Utilization Project National ED Sample from 4,253,987 admissions to U.S. EDs linked to injured elderly patients. ED discharges with ICD-9-CM code (332.0) were identified as PD and those with ICD-9-CM code (800.0-829.0) were used to define bone fracture location. Linear and logistic regression models were constructed to estimate slopes (B) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nPD admissions had 28% increased adjusted prevalence of bone fracture. Non-fall injuries showed stronger relationship between PD and bone fracture (OR\nAmong injured U.S. ED elderly patient visits, those with PD had higher bone fracture prevalence and more resource utilization especially among fall-related injuries. No association of PD with in-hospital death was noted.",

    "abstract": "Depression and anxiety remain under-diagnosed and under-treated in those with neurologic diseases such as dementia or Parkinson's Disease (PD). Our objectives were to first, to provide a synthesis of high quality guidelines available for the identification and management of depression or anxiety in those with dementia or PD. Second, to identify areas for improvement for future guidelines.\nWe searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE (2009 to July 24, 2015), grey literature (83 sources; July 24-Sept 6, 2015), and bibliographies of included studies. Included studies were evaluated for quality by four independent reviewers the AGREE II tool. Guideline characteristics, statements and recommendations relevant to depression or anxiety for dementia and PD were then extracted. (PROSPERO CRD: 42016014584) RESULTS: 8121 citations were reviewed with 31 full text articles included for assessment with the AGREE II tool. 17 were of sufficient quality for inclusion. Mean overall quality scores were between 4.25 to 6.5. Domain scores were lowest in the areas of stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence. Recommendations for the screening and diagnosis of depression were found for PD and dementia. There was little evidence to guide diagnosis or management of anxiety. Non-pharmacologic therapies were recommended for dementia patients. Most advocated pharmacologic treatment for depression, for both PD and dementia, but did not specify an agent due to lack of evidence.\nThe available recent high quality guidelines outline several recommendations for the management of comorbid depression or anxiety in PD or dementia. However there remain significant gaps in the evidence.",

    "abstract": "Over the past three decades, significant progress has been made in the development of potential regenerative cell-based therapies for neurodegenerative disease, with most success being seen in Parkinson's disease. Cell-based therapies face many challenges including ethical considerations, potential for immune-mediated rejection with allogeneic and xenogeneic tissue, pathological spread of protein-related disease into the grafted tissue as well as the risk of graft overgrowth and tumorigenesis in stem cell-derived transplants. Preclinical trials have looked at many tissue types of which the most successful to date have been those using fetal ventral mesencephalon grafts, which led to clinical trials, which have shown that in some cases they can work very well. With important proof-of-concept derived from these studies, there is now much interest in how dopaminergic neurons derived from stem cell sources could be used to develop cell-based therapies suitable for clinical use, with clinical trials poised to enter the clinic in the next couple of years.",

    "abstract": "Sexual functioning is often impaired in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and may affect quality of life of patients and their spouse. However, little is known about the practice patterns of neurologists with regard to discussing sexuality in this field. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate to what extent neurologists discuss sexuality with PD patients. A 22-item questionnaire was sent to 139 neurologists specializing in PD. The survey contained questions about their attitudes, knowledge, and practice patterns with respect to sexual dysfunction (SD) in patients with PD. The response rate of the survey was 66.9%. Most participants (56.8%) stated that they address sexuality in less than half of their PD patients. High age of patients (42.0%), insufficient consultation time (37.5%), and a lack of patients' initiative to raise the topic themselves (36.4%) were frequently reported barriers towards discussing sexuality. The majority of participants considered that discussing sexuality is a responsibility that lay with neurologists (85.2%), nurses (73.9%), and patients (72.7%). One quarter of the neurologists reported to have insufficient or no knowledge on SD. The majority of participants regarded screening for SD important or slightly important (85.2%). A large proportion of Dutch neurologists specializing in PD do not routinely discuss sexuality with their PD patients. Sexual healthcare in PD patients may benefit from time-efficient tools and agreements on who is responsible for discussing SD. Furthermore, recommendations in PD guidelines on screening and managing SD should be adapted to fit everyday practice.",

    "abstract": "There is a lack of information about postoperative outcomes and related risk factors associated with spinal surgery in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThis study aimed to investigate the postoperative morbidity and mortality associated with spinal surgery for patients with PD, and the risk factors for poor outcomes.\nThis is a retrospective matched-pair cohort study.\nData of patients who underwent elective spinal surgery between July 2010 and March 2013 were extracted from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, a nationwide inpatient database in Japan.\nIn-hospital mortality and occurrence of postoperative complications.\nFor each patient with PD, we randomly selected up to four age- and sex-matched controls in the same hospital in the same year. The differences in in-hospital mortality and occurrence of postoperative complications were compared between patients with PD and controls. A multivariable logistic regression model fitted with a generalized estimation equation was used to identify significant predictors of major complications (surgical site infection, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, respiratory complications, cardiac events, stroke, and renal failure). Multiple imputation was used for missing data.\nAmong 154,278 patients undergoing spinal surgery, 1,423 patients with PD and 5,498 matched controls were identified. Crude in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with PD than in controls (0.8% vs. 0.3%, respectively). The crude proportion of major complications was also higher in patients with PD (9.8% vs. 5.1% in controls). Postoperative delirium was more common in patients with PD (30.3%) than in controls (4.3%). Parkinson's disease was a significant predictor of major postoperative complications, even after adjusting for other risk factors (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence intervals, 1.37-2.22; p<.001).\nPatients with PD had a significantly increased risk of postoperative complications following spinal surgery. Postoperative delirium was the most frequently observed complication.",

    "abstract": "The pathological features of Parkinson's disease (PD) include an abnormal accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in the surviving dopaminergic neurons. Though PD is multifactorial, several epidemiological reports show an increased incidence of PD with co-exposure to pesticides such as Maneb and paraquat (MP). In pesticide-related PD, mitochondrial dysfunction and \u03b1-synuclein oligomers have been strongly implicated, but the link between the two has not yet been understood. Similarly, the biological effects of \u03b1-synuclein or its radical chemistry in PD is largely unknown. Mitochondrial dysfunction during PD pathogenesis leads to release of cytochrome c in the cytosol. Once in the cytosol, cytochrome c has one of two fates: It either binds to apaf1 and initiates apoptosis or can act as a peroxidase. We hypothesized that as a peroxidase, cytochrome c leaked out from mitochondria can form radicals on \u03b1-synuclein and initiate its oligomerization.\nSamples from controls, and MP co-exposed wild-type and \u03b1-synuclein knockout mice were studied using immuno-spin trapping, confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and microarray experiments.\nExperiments with MP co-exposed mice showed cytochrome c release in cytosol and its co-localization with \u03b1-synuclein. Subsequently, we used immuno-spin trapping method to detect the formation of \u03b1-synuclein radical in samples from an in vitro reaction mixture consisting of cytochrome c, \u03b1-synuclein, and hydrogen peroxide. These experiments indicated that cytochrome c plays a role in \u03b1-synuclein radical formation and oligomerization. Experiments with MP co-exposed \u03b1-synuclein knockout mice, in which cytochrome c-\u03b1 synuclein co-localization and interaction cannot occur, mice showed diminished protein radical formation and neuronal death, compared to wild-type MP co-exposed mice. Microarray data from MP co-exposed wild-type and \u03b1-synuclein knockout mice further showed that the absence of \u03b1-synuclein per se or its co-localization with cytochrome c confers protection from MP co-exposure, as several important pathways were unaffected in \u03b1-synuclein knockout mice.\nAltogether, these results show that peroxidase activity of cytochrome c contributes to \u03b1-synuclein radical formation and oligomerization, and that \u03b1-synuclein, through its co-localization with cytochrome c or on its own, affects several biological pathways which contribute to increased neuronal death in an MP-induced model of PD.",

Microarray data from MP co-exposed wild-type and \u03b1-synuclein knockout mice further showed that the absence of \u03b1-synuclein per se or its co-localization with cytochrome c confers protection from MP co-exposure, as several important pathways were unaffected in \u03b1-synuclein knockout mice.",

    "abstract": "Postural abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD) are considered the rule more than the exception and are disabling complications of the disease. These deformities include camptocormia, antecollis, Pisa syndrome, and scoliosis. Evidence to date suggests that postural deformities have a multifactorial pathophysiology, including muscular rigidity, axial dystonia, weakness due to myopathy, body scheme defects due to centrally impaired proprioception, and structural changes in the spine. Antecollis in parkinsonian disorders refers to a forward flexion of the head and neck. It is usually mild in severity and may be considered part of the stooped posture in patients with PD. Some authors that suggest the term antecollis should only be used in patients with at least a minimum of 45 degrees of thoracolumbar flexion. Neither camptocormia nor Pisa syndrome can be evaluated without taking into account the presence or absence of scoliosis. In this regard, the rotating component of the spine and its behavior in the supine position give important clues for a correct diagnosis. In some cases, X-rays in the standing and supine positions are necessary. The presence of marked camptocormia requires a minimum of flexion in the sagittal plane originating in the thoracolumbar spine greater than 45 degrees, with an almost complete resolution in the supine position. Pisa syndrome requires a minimum of 10 degrees of lateral flexion and is almost completely alleviated by passive mobilization or supine positioning. A certain degree of scoliosis is expected in most parkinsonian patients; therefore, both camptocormia and Pisa syndrome do not generally present as pure syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Gait is a marker of global health, cognition and falls risk. Gait is complex, comprised of multiple characteristics sensitive to survival, age and pathology. Due to covariance amongst characteristics, conceptual gait models have been established to reduce redundancy and aid interpretation. Previous models have been derived from laboratory gait assessments which are costly in equipment and time. Body-worn monitors (BWM) allow for free-living, low-cost and continuous gait measurement and produce similar covariant gait characteristics. A BWM gait model from both controlled and free-living measurement has not yet been established, limiting utility.\n103 control and 67 PD participants completed a controlled laboratory assessment; walking for two minutes around a circuit wearing a BWM. 89 control and 58 PD participants were assessed in free-living, completing normal activities for 7 days wearing a BWM. Fourteen gait characteristics were derived from the BWM, selected according to a previous model. Principle component analysis derived factor loadings of gait characteristics.\nFour gait domains were derived for both groups and conditions; pace, rhythm, variability and asymmetry. Domains totalled 84.84% and 88.43% of variance for controlled and 90.00% and 93.03% of variance in free-living environments for control and PD participants respectively. Gait characteristic loading was unambiguous for all characteristics apart from gait variability which demonstrated cross-loading for both groups and environments. The model was highly congruent with the original model.\nThe conceptual gait models remained stable using a BWM in controlled and free-living environments. The model became more discrete supporting utility of the gait model for free-living gait.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated pain as perceived by the patients (subjective characterization), and how this may change following initiation of rotigotine transdermal patch.\nSP1058 was a non-interventional study conducted in routine clinical practice in Germany and Austria in patients experiencing PD-associated pain (per the physician's assessment). Data were collected at baseline (ie, before rotigotine initiation) and at a routine visit after \u226525\u00a0days (-3\u00a0days allowed) of treatment on a maintenance dose of rotigotine (end of study [EoS]). Pain perception was assessed using the 12-item Pain Description List of the validated German Pain Questionnaire (each item ranked 0\u00a0=\u00a0'not true' to 3\u00a0=\u00a0'very true'). Primary effectiveness variable: change from baseline to EoS in the sum score of the 4 'affective dimension' items of the Pain Description List. Secondary effectiveness variables: change from baseline to EoS in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II, III, and II+III scores, and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) total score (PD-related quality-of-life). Other variables included scores of the eight 'sensory dimension' items of the Pain Description List.\nOf 93 enrolled patients (mean [SD] age: 71.1 [9.0] years; male: 48 [52%]), 77 (83%) completed the study, and 70 comprised the full analysis set. The mean (SD) change from baseline in the sum score of the four 'affective dimension' items was -1.3 (2.8) indicating a numerical improvement (baseline: 3.9 [3.4]). In the 'sensory dimension', pain was mostly perceived as 'pulling' at baseline (49/70 [70%]); 'largely true'/'very true'). Numerical improvements were observed in all UPDRS scores (mean [SD] change in UPDRS II+III: -5.3 [10.5]; baseline: 36.0 [15.9]), and in PDQ-8 total score (-2.0 [4.8]; baseline: 10.7 [5.9]). Adverse drug reactions were consistent with dopaminergic stimulation and transdermal administration.\nThe perception of the 'affective dimension' of PD-associated pain numerically improved in patients treated with rotigotine.

    "abstract": "To investigate the differences in spontaneous brain activity between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), PD patients without RBD, and normal controls, which may shed new light on the neural mechanism of RBD.\nEighteen PD patients with RBD, 16 patients without RBD, and 19 age- and gender-matched normal controls underwent clinical assessment and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a 3.0T scanner. Resting-state fMRI scans were collected using an echo planar imaging sequence. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) were calculated to measure spontaneous brain activity in each subject.\nCompared with PD patients without RBD, patients with RBD exhibited significantly decreased ALFF values (P < 0.001, cluster level) in primary motor cortex extending to premotor cortex. Compared with normal controls, PD patients exhibited decreased ALFF values (P < 0.001, cluster level) in caudate and putamen (P < 0.001, cluster level), and increased ALFF values (P\u2009=\u20090.03, cluster level) in prefrontal cortex.\nThe altered spontaneous brain activity in motor cortex may contribute to the pathogenesis of RBD in PD patients, which further supports the idea that the pathophysiology of RBD involves not only midbrain dysfunction but also cerebral cortex abnormalities. Our findings provide additional insight into the neural mechanism of RBD and may drive future research to develop better treatment.\n3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J. MAGN. RESON.

    "abstract": "Evidences have shown that physiotherapy programs may improve the balance of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), although it is not clear which specific exercise program is better.\nThe aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of balance versus resistance training on postural control measures in PD patients.\nRandomized controlled trial.\nThe study was conducted in a physiotherapy outpatient clinic of a university hospital.\nA total of 40 PD participants were randomly divided into two groups: balance training (BT) and resistance training (RT).\nThe BT group focused on balance training, functional independence and gait while the RT group performed resistance exercises emphasizing the lower limbs and trunk, both supervised by trained physiotherapists. Therapy sessions were held twice a week (at 60 minutes), totaling 24 sessions. The primary outcome was evaluated by force platform with center of pressure sway measures in different balance conditions and the secondary outcome was evaluated by Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) scale to determine the effects of the intervention on postural control.\nSignificant improvement of postural control (pre vs. post 15.1 vs. 9.6 cm2) was only reported in favor of BT group (d=1.17) for one-legged stand condition on force platform. The standardized mean difference between groups was significantly (P<0.02), with 36% of improvement for BT vs. 0.07% for RT on this condition. Significant improvement (P<0.05) was also observed in favor of BT (in mean 3.2%) for balance gains in some BESTest scores, when compared to RT group (-0.98%).\nPostural control in Parkinson's disease is improved when training by a directional and specific balance program than a resistance training program.\nBalance training is superior to resistance training in regard to improving postural control of individuals with PD. Gold standard instruments (high in cost and difficult to access) were used to assess balance, as well as scales with clinical applicability (low cost, easily acceptable, applicable and valid), which can guide the management of physiotherapists both in their decision-making and in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety is a serious and frequent complication in Parkinson's disease (PD) that significantly affects the quality of life of patients. Multiple neuroanatomical, experimental, and clinical studies suggest its close association with axial disturbances. However, whether this relation applies for PD patients (commonly suffering from axial difficulties, such as balance and gait disturbance) has not been properly tested yet. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PD patients suffering from axial symptoms have higher levels of anxiety than others and to identify other factors associated with anxiety-axial connections. In this questionnaire study, 212 patients with PD were assessed by standardized scales, such as Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, examining their mood and cognitive status. These data were correlated to dominant motor symptoms of these patients, such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and axial symptoms. Unlike other motor symptoms, only axial symptoms showed to be significantly related to higher levels of anxiety. The patients suffering from anxiety and axial problems have also shown significantly higher depression levels. Axial disturbances are related to higher anxiety levels in PD patients. It is crucial to pay high attention to symptoms of anxiety in patients having postural instability or gait disorder. Further clinical studies are desirable to investigate new, practical implications of anxiety-axial connection to provide complex management options of these serious symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate the correlation between Parkinson's disease (PD) and serum levels of uric acid (UA), albumin and their interaction. A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the relationship of serum UA, albumin with PD. A total of 96 PD patients and 108 healthy controls were recruited at Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University. Baseline data included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr scale (H&Y) stage, serum UA and albumin levels. The levels of serum UA and albumin were significantly lower in PD patients than those in controls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001; P\u00a0=\u00a00.000). Serum albumin levels were strikingly different in H&Y group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Multivariable logistic regression showed that the levels of serum UA (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001, adjusted OR 0.993, 95% CI 0.988-0.997) and albumin (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000, adjusted OR 0.513, 95% CI 0.425-0.620) were independent risk factors in PD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses showed that the area under curve (AUC) for serum UA and albumin was 0.669 (95% CI 0.594-0.744) and 0.883 (95% CI 0.835-0.931), respectively. The combination of serum albumin and UA improved the AUC to 0.898 (95% CI 0.854-0.942). Serum UA and albumin levels significantly decreased in PD patients and were independent risk factors for PD. More studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

Patients with AVRT typically present with palpitations, an on-off characteristic, anxiety, dyspnea, and polyuria. This type of tachycardia may often be terminated by vagal maneuvers. Although the clinical presentation of AVRT is quite similar to AV-nodal reentrant tachycardias, the correct diagnosis is often facilitated by analyzing a\u00a0standard 12-lead ECG at normal heart rate showing ventricular preexcitation. Curative catheter ablation of the AP represents the therapy of choice in symptomatic patients. This article is the fourth part of a\u00a0series written to improve the professional education of young electrophysiologists. It explains pathophysiology, symptoms, and electrophysiological findings of an invasive EP study. It focusses on mapping and ablation of accessory pathways.",

    "abstract": "Subcutaneous administration of rotenone has recently attracted attention because of its convenience, simplicity and efficacy in replicating features of Parkinson's disease (PD) in animal models. However, the wide range of doses reported in the literature makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique objectively. The aim of the present study was to identify the optimum dose of subcutaneous rotenone for establishing a model of PD. We injected male Wistar rats subcutaneously with one of three doses of rotenone (1.5, 2, or 2.5mg/kg) daily for 5 weeks. Rotenone caused a dose-dependent increase in \u03b1-synuclein in the substantia nigra. Furthermore, at 2 and 2.5mg/kg, rotenone caused a significant decrease in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra, and dopamine in the striatum. However, mortality at 2.5mg/kg was 46.7%, compared with just 6.7% at 2mg/kg; the high mortality observed at 2.5mg/kg would limit its application. The 2mg/kg dose showed no detrimental effect on body weight after 5 weeks of daily injections. Furthermore, rats in the 2mg/kg group showed a longer latency to descend from a horizontal bar and a grid wall, decreased rearing, and shorter latency to fall from a rotarod than rats that received vehicle or saline. Mitochondrial damage, observed by transmission electron microscopy, was also evident at this dose. Together, our data indicate that daily subcutaneous injection of 2mg/kg rotenone in rats facilitates the formation of \u03b1-synuclein and reproduces the typical features of PD, while maintaining low mortality.",

    "abstract": "Increased somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutagenesis causes premature aging in mice, and mtDNA damage accumulates in the human brain with aging and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease (PD). Here, we study the complete spectrum of mtDNA changes, including deletions, copy-number variation and point mutations, in single neurons from the dopaminergic substantia nigra and other brain areas of individuals with Parkinson disease and neurologically healthy controls. We show that in dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons of healthy individuals, mtDNA copy number increases with age, maintaining the pool of wild-type mtDNA population in spite of accumulating deletions. This upregulation fails to occur in individuals with Parkinson disease, however, resulting in depletion of the wild-type mtDNA population. By contrast, neuronal mtDNA point mutational load is not increased in Parkinson disease. Our findings suggest that dysregulation of mtDNA homeostasis is a key process in the pathogenesis of neuronal loss in Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Constipation is among the first nonmotor symptoms to develop in the prodromal phase of PD. Pathological alpha-synuclein deposition is present throughout the gastrointestinal tract up to 20 years preceding diagnosis. Nevertheless, constipation in the context of PD remains ill defined and poorly understood. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of subjective symptoms and objective measures of constipation in PD. More than 10 different definitions of constipation have been used in the PD literature, making generalizations difficult. When pooling results from the most homogeneous studies in PD, a median constipation prevalence of 40% to 50% emerges, but with large variation across individual studies. Also, constipation prevalence tends to increase with disease progression. A similar prevalence is observed among patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. Interestingly, we detected a correlation between constipation prevalence in PD patients and healthy control groups in individual studies, raising concerns about how various constipation questionnaires are implemented across study populations. More than 80% of PD patients exhibit prolonged colonic transit time, and the same is probably true for de novo PD patients. Thus, the prevalence of objective colonic dysfunction exceeds the prevalence of subjective constipation. Colonic transit time measures are simple, widely available, and hold promise as a useful biomarker in manifest PD. More research is needed to elucidate the role of gastrointestinal dysfunction in disease progression of PD. Moreover, colonic transit measures may have utility as a more accurate risk factor for predicting PD in the prodromal phase. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

It is marked by progressive neurodegeneration that has long been known to impact dopaminergic cells and circuits, but more recently the acetylcholine system has also been implicated in the complex aetiology and symptomatology of the disease. While broad changes in cholinergic markers have been described, insight into the contribution of specific acetylcholine receptors is less clear.

    "abstract": "Mutations in six genes are known to cause Parkinson's disease (PD) (autosomal dominant: alpha-synuclein, LRRK2, VPS35 and autosomal recessive: Parkin, PINK1 and DJ1) and number of other genes are implicated. In a recent article Deng and colleagues studied a large four generation American family of European descent and linked mutations in a novel gene, transmembrane-protein 230 gene (TMEM230) with lewy body confirmed PD. The authors demonstrated that pathogenic TMEM230 variants in primary mouse neurons affected movement of synaptic vesicles suggesting that TMEM230 may slow vesicular transport. Further experiments in HEK293 cells (carrying the pathogenic TMEM230 variants) showed increased alpha-synuclein levels. This study indicated that the impaired vesicular trafficking may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Understanding the various cellular mechanisms leading to PD may lead to the development of novel, much needed therapeutic options. These mechanisms could include: enhanced clearance of damaged mitochondria, development of kinase inhibitors, VPS35/retromer function enhancers or now the possibility of vesicular transport modification.",

    "abstract": "Recently published studies show that the prevalence of polyneuropathy (PNP) is higher in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) than in age-matched controls. Its pathogenesis, however is a matter of controversy. The major hypothesis is the toxicity of high concentrations of homocysteine (Hcy) possibly related to levodopa (LD) therapy. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of PNP, independent of other etiologies, and to determine the relationship to demographic and clinical factors in LD-treated Parkinson's patients. A total of 102 patients (51 patients with PD and 51 sex- and age-matched healthy controls) were enrolled in the study. The presence of any risk factors for PNP, ascertained from the history and laboratory tests, was an exclusion criterion. The Toronto Clinical Scoring System (TCSS) was used for clinical assessment of PNP. The objective assessment was based on electroneurography (ENG) studies in which motor nerves (peroneal and tibial nerves) as well as sensory nerves (sural and superficial peroneal nerves) were bilaterally examined. The severity of the disease was determined using the UPDRS scale (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) and the Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) scale. In the PD group, the clinical and neurophysiological indicators of PNP, manifested as a symmetrical and predominantly sensory axonal neuropathy, were more frequent then in the control group and observed in 43.1% vs. 13.7% and 15.7% vs. 2% of subjects respectively. The presence of PNP correlated with age and the severity of PD. Patients with PD and PNP had a higher level of Hcy as compared to PD patients without PNP, however the difference was not statistically significant. The frequency of PNP in PD patients is higher than in controls. The characteristics and discrepancy between the number of patients with clinical and ENG detected PNP may suggest the small fiber neuropathy (SFN) as the dominant form of neuropathy in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies showed that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) plays a crucial role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology. During rest, PD phenotypes exhibit different STN functional connectivity. STN functional connectivity was examined in 31 PD patients [12 tremor-dominant (TD) and 19 posture instability gait difficulty (PIGD)] and 22 healthy controls (HC). Compared with controls and PIGD patients, the TD patients exhibited higher functional connectivity between the bilateral STN and the left cerebellar anterior lobe. Compared with the TD and HC groups, in the PIGD subgroup functional connectivity was lower between the left putamen and the STN, as well as between the pons and the STN. In the PIGD subgroup, functional connectivity was greater between the STN and bilateral occipital lobe, which positively correlated with PIGD scores in PD patients. Additionally, STN-cerebellum connectivity positively correlated with the tremor score, and STN-putamen connectivity negatively correlated with the PIGD score in PD patients. PD subtypes with distinguished STN functional connectivity might explain the various pathophysiological mechanisms in tremor and gait disorders. Increased coupling between the STN and cerebellum might underlie the neural substrate of PD tremors. Lower functional connectivity between the STN and putamen might underpin PD gait and posture disturbances, while higher functional connectivity between the STN and visual cortex might play a compensatory role.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety is prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and may affect patients' quality of life. Yet, little is known about the neural basis of anxiety in PD, and none have used a longitudinal design.\n73 patients with mild PD were recruited and followed up for 18months. A whole-brain analysis was first used to identify brain regions associated with anxiety symptoms, followed by a regional analysis focusing on a priori hypothesised regions at baseline. A multivariate generalized estimating equations analysis was then conducted to determine the longitudinal association between grey matter (GM) volumetric changes of these significant regions and changes of anxiety symptoms.\nAt baseline, anxiety symptom severity was associated with decreased GM volumes in the bilateral precuneus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Over 18months, increased severity of anxiety symptoms was associated with decreased GM volume in the left precuneus and ACC, independent of age, gender, education, depressive symptom severity or use of psychiatric medication.\nThese results mainly implicate the precuneus and ACC in the pathogenesis of anxiety in PD. We speculate that these structural changes could reflect the disrupted default mode network due to PD pathology, contributing to spontaneous anxiety-related self-focused thoughts.",

    "abstract": "Novel single nucleotide polymorphisms within Parkinson's disease (PD) can predict disease risk, but their influence on clinical, cognitive, and neurobiological indices remains unexplored. We investigated differences between functional polymorphisms at RS11158026 coding for guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1 (GCH1), an essential enzyme for dopamine production in nigrostriatal cells. Among newly diagnosed, untreated PD subjects and age-matched controls from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, T allele carriers showed higher PD risk (odds ratio\u00a0= 1.23, p\u00a0= 0.048), earlier age of onset by 5\u00a0years (p\u00a0= 0.003), and lower striatal dopamine reuptake transporter uptake (p\u00a0= 0.003). Carriers also had increased cerebrospinal fluid \u03b1-synuclein (p\u00a0= 0.016), worse motor function (p\u00a0= 0.041), anxiety (p\u00a0=\u00a00.038), and executive function (p < 0.001). Strikingly, these effects were only in younger T carriers (<50\u00a0years), where aging quells the effects of these genetic factors. This suggests GCH1 variants affect early PD risk through altered dopamine uptake, and aging alters how genetic factors contribute to disease development. Future studies should investigate how aging modifies genotypes' contributions on PD risk and sequelae.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) affects around 100,000 people in England. A number of non-oral therapies can improve both the quality of life and reduce patient needs for health and social care. However, these can be relatively expensive at \u00a32000-\u00a310,000 per year per patient. Our aim was to examine how prescribing of these agents relates to secondary care costs.\nUsing practice level primary care prescribing data and hospital episode statistical data in England, we investigated the relation between general practitioner prescriptions of apomorphine injections/rotigotine patches and the secondary care costs accrued for their diagnosed PD patients for 2011-2014. The median age of the PD patients was 78\u00a0years.\nIn the period 2011-2014, 58% of the average annual \u00a3437 million secondary care costs for PD patients came from non-elective admissions. 80% of this came from seven Healthcare Resource Group Chapters linked to PD comorbidities. Compared with practices not using non-oral therapies, practices prescribing Apomorphine saved \u00a3897 per year per patient of secondary care costs to offset the average additional prescribing cost of \u00a3475 per overall patient per year. For Rotigotine, saving was \u00a3718 per year per patient of secondary care costs offsetting \u00a3137 prescribing cost. Practices in the highest quartile of non-oral prescribing were using non-oral agents in up to 28% of their PD patients.\nThose practices which used more non-oral therapies appear to incur less secondary care costs. A total of 70% of the advanced PD patients are not being given access to non-oral treatment. This is a challenge for all physicians looking after the older patient.",

    "abstract": "Although dopaminergic medication improves functional mobility in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), its effects on walking turns are uncertain. Our goals was to determine whether dopaminergic medication improves preplanned and unplanned walking turns in individuals with PD, compared to healthy controls. Nineteen older adults with mild-to-moderate PD and 17 healthy controls performed one of the following three tasks, presented randomly: walking straight, or walking and turning 180\u00b0 to the right or left. The walking direction was visually cued before starting to walk (preplanned) or after (unplanned, i.e., 0.6m before reaching the turning point). Subjects with PD were assessed off dopaminergic medication (OFF) and on dopaminergic medication (ON) medication. Turning strategy (step and spin turns), turning performance (turning distance and body rotation) and walking pattern were analyzed for three turning steps. Irrespective of medication state and turning condition, step and spin turns followed a nearly 50:50 distribution. After intake of dopaminergic medication, subjects with PD increased their turning distance but not the amount of body rotation or their walking pattern. Compared to controls, turning impairments in subjects with PD remained while ON medication and problems regulating step width were the most prominent features of their walking pattern. Specifically, subjects with PD turned with narrower cross-over steps, i.e. when the external foot crossed over the line of progression of the internal leg. We conclude that turning impairments remained even after dopaminergic medication and problems modulating step width appears to be a critical feature for turning in PD.",

    "abstract": "The pesticide rotenone is widely used to produce Parkinson's disease (PD)-like symptoms in rodents, but few studies have examined whether rotenone-treated zebrafish can serve as an animal model of PD. Here, we report that 4 weeks of rotenone treatment induced motor and non-motor PD-like symptoms in adult zebrafish. Compared with control fish, rotenone-treated fish spent less time swimming at a fast speed, indicating a deficit in motor function. In the light-dark box test, rotenone-treated fish exhibited longer latencies to enter the dark compartment and spent more time in the light compartment, reflecting anxiety- and depression-like behavior. Furthermore, rotenone-treated fish showed less of an olfactory preference for amino acid, indicating olfactory dysfunction. These behavioral symptoms were associated with decreased levels of dopamine in the brains of rotenone-treated fish. Taken together, these results suggest that rotenone-treated zebrafish are a suitable model of PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether mutation in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) subunit genes (PRKAG3-230) is associated with sporadic, isolated Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.\nThis study consisted of 87 patients with symptomatic WPW syndrome and 93 healthy controls. PRKAG3-230 genotypes were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Genotype and allele frequencies of PRKAG3-230 between patients with WPW syndrome and healthy controls were ascertained using chi-square test or Fisher exact test when appropriate.\nPRKAG3-230 were genotyped in 87 patients (53 men and 34 women; age=24.4\u00b118.0 years) with WPW syndrome and 93 healthy controls (57 men and 36 women; age=16.8\u00b14.2 years). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age and sex. The patients with CG and CG+CC genotypes had a significantly increased risk of WPW syndrome compared with those with GG genotype [odds ratio (OR)=1.99, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-3.89, p=0.045; OR=1.99, 95% CI=1.04-3.78, p=0.037, respectively]. The allelic types were not associated with the risk of WPW syndrome. The patients with manifest type with CG and CG+CC genotypes had a significantly increased risk of WPW syndrome compared with those with GG genotype (OR=2.86, 95% CI=1.16-7.05, p=0.022; OR=2.84, 95% CI=1.19-6.80, p=0.019, respectively). The patients with right-side accessory pathways with CG and CG+CC genotypes had a significantly increased risk of WPW syndrome compared with those with GG genotype (OR=3.07, 95% CI=1.25-7.51, p=0.014; OR=2.84, 95% CI=1.19-6.80, p=0.019, respectively). The allelic types were not associated with the risk of WPW types and locations.\nThis study shows that PRKAG3-230 may be associated with sporadic WPW syndrome among a Taiwanese population. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the role of mutations in AMPK subunit genes other than PRKAG3-230 in sporadic WPW syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is associated with an increased incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia. Predicting who is at risk of cognitive decline early in the disease course has implications for clinical prognosis and for stratification of participants in clinical trials. We assessed the use of clinical information and biomarkers as predictive factors for cognitive decline in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease.\nThe Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study is a cohort study in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease. We evaluated cognitive performance (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] scores), demographic and clinical data, APOE status, and biomarkers (CSF and dopamine transporter [DAT] imaging results). Using change in MoCA scores over 2 years, MoCA scores at 2 years' follow-up, and a diagnosis of cognitive impairment (combined mild cognitive impairment or dementia) at 2 years as outcome measures, we assessed the predictive values of baseline clinical variables and separate or combined additions of APOE status, DAT imaging, and CSF biomarkers. We did univariate and multivariate linear analyses with MoCA change scores between baseline and 2 years, and with MoCA scores at 2 years as dependent variables, using backwards linear regression analysis. Additionally, we constructed a prediction model for diagnosis of cognitive impairment using logistic regression analysis.\n390 patients with Parkinson's disease recruited between July 1, 2010, and May 31, 2013, and for whom data on MoCA scores at baseline and 2 years were available.

    "abstract": "Both patients with non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease (GD) and heterozygous GBA mutation carrier are at increased risk for Parkinson disease (PD). The risk for PD in these groups does not linearly increase with glucosylceramide (GC) accumulation or with acid \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. This observation, together with other clinical systemic observations raises the possibility that extra-cellular GC actually has beneficial, anti-inflammatory, properties. Based on this hypothesis, we suggest here that the administration of supplementary oral GC to GBA carriers at risk for PD may slow inflammatory-driven secondary neuronal death. Such a treatment may act synergistically in GBA carriers once given in combination with an agent that prevent the primary pathologic process that leads to cell death. Ambroxol hydrochloride, a pharmacological chaperone, which reduces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by accumulation of mutant misfolded GCase could serve as such an agent. The efficacy of this combined therapy, derived from clinical observations, in vivo and in vitro studies, should be evaluated in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The formation of oligomers and aggregates of overexpressed or mutant \u03b1-synuclein play a role in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease by causing dysfunction of mitochondria, reflected in their disturbed mobility and production of ROS. The mode of action and mechanisms underlying this mitochondrial impairment is still unclear. We have induced stable expression of wild-type, A30P or A53T \u03b1-synuclein in neuronally differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and studied anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial trafficking in this cell model for Parkinson's disease. In contrast to wild-type and A30P, A53T \u03b1-synuclein significantly inhibited mitochondrial trafficking, at first retrogradely and in a later stage anterogradely. Accordingly, A53T \u03b1-synuclein also caused the highest increase in ROS production in the dysmobilized mitochondria in comparison to wild-type or A30P \u03b1-synuclein. Treatment with NAP, the eight amino acid peptide identified as the active component of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), completely annihilated the adverse effects of A53T on mitochondrial dynamics. Our results reveal that A53T \u03b1-synuclein (oligomers or aggregates) leads to the inhibition of mitochondrial trafficking, which can be rescued by NAP, suggesting the involvement of microtubule disruption in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by \u03b1-synuclein accumulation, dopaminergic neuron loss and inflammation. \u03b1-Synuclein can be secreted by neurons and activate microglia to different degrees. Excessive microglial activation can increase the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1-\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-\u03b3 (INF-\u03b3), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), and can also enhance microglial phagocytosis and migration as well as lymphocyte infiltration. Pathological \u03b1-synuclein and microglial activation can potentiate each other, leading to the loss of dopaminergic neurons and accelerated PD degeneration. This review will mainly describe the profiles of \u03b1-synuclein-activated microglia, with particular emphasis on the signaling cascades involved in this process.",

    "abstract": "This article discusses recent evidence supporting the use of action observation therapy and motor imagery practice for rehabilitation of Parkinson's disease. A main question that emerges from the review regards the different effectiveness of these approaches and the possibility of integrating them into a single method to enhance motor behaviour in subjects with Parkinson's disease. In particular, the reviewed studies suggest that action observation therapy can have a positive effect on motor facilitation of patients and that a long-term rehabilitation program based on action observation therapy or motor imagery practice can bring some benefit on their motor recovery. Moreover, the paper discusses how the research on the combined use of action observation and motor imagery for motor improvements in healthy subjects may encourage the combined use of action observation therapy and motor imagery practice for therapeutic aims in Parkinson's disease. To date, this hypothesis has never been experimented.",

    "abstract": "Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), effecting 27-85% of patients with PD. Irritative symptoms predominate and urodynamic studies confirm high prevalence of detrusor overactivity in PD. LUTS are present early in PD and are more common in PD than in age matched controls. The assessment of LUTS in PD is complicated by coexisting bradykinesia and cognitive impairment. Although LUTS become more troublesome as PD progresses it remains unclear if LUTS severity correlates with motor symptoms and/or duration of PD. The underlying cause of LUTS in PD remains to be fully elucidated. Animal and human studies suggest the net effect of the basal ganglia is to supress micturition. Although LUTS are a common in PD, few studies have examined the assessment and management of LUTS specifically in patients with PD. Pilot studies have suggested that bladder training, antimuscarinic drugs and intravesical botulinum toxin maybe helpful but these trials have been small and frequently lacked a suitable control group making them vulnerable to the placebo effect. Furthermore the adverse effects of antimuscarinic drugs on cognitive and gastrointestinal function may limit the use of these drugs in PD. In this review we summarise the literature describing the prevalence of LUTS in PD, discuss the emerging data delineating the underlying pathophysiology of LUTS and examine interventions helpful in the management of LUTS in people with PD.",

Patients and caregivers also completed the Memory Assessment Clinics Self-Rating or Family Scale (MAC-S/MAC-F), and patients were divided into two groups, those with PD-MCI and those without.\nFor patients diagnosed with PD-MCI, both patients and caregivers reported significantly more memory changes compared with patients without PD-MCI on the MAC-S and MAC-F. In contrast, for patients without PD-MCI, patients and caregivers differed significantly in their reporting of memory changes, with scores indicating that patients without PD-MCI felt their memory functioning was worse than what caregivers were reporting.\nPatients with PD without MCI might be more sensitive to memory changes than their caregivers. Whether the self-appraisal of memory problems is predictive of future cognitive difficulties, including progression to PD-MCI or PD dementia, should be the focus of future research.",

    "abstract": "We recently reported that convergence insufficiency (CI)-type visual symptomatology was more prevalent in participants with Parkinson's disease (PD), compared to controls. The objective of this work was to determine the prevalence of a confirmed clinical diagnosis of CI in PD, compared to controls.\nParticipants with (n = 80) and without (n = 80) PD were recruited and received an eye exam. Published criteria were used to arrive at a clinical diagnosis of CI. The Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS-15) questionnaire was administered to each participant, with a score of \u226521 being considered positive for CI symptomatology. Student \nA total of 43.8% of participants with versus 16.3% without PD had a clinical diagnosis of CI (\nThese results indicate that individuals with PD have a higher prevalence of CI and CI symptomatology than controls. These data provide evidence supporting the notion that treatment for symptomatic CI should be investigated in individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "Although intrastriatal transplantation of fetal cells for the treatment of Parkinson's disease had shown encouraging results in initial open-label clinical trials, subsequent double-blind studies reported more debatable outcomes. These studies highlighted the need for greater preclinical analysis of the parameters that may influence the success of cell therapy. While much of this has focused on the cells and location of the transplants, few have attempted to replicate potentially critical patient centered factors. Of particular relevance is that patients will be under continued L-DOPA treatment prior to and following transplantation, and that typically the grafts will not be immunologically compatible with the host. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the effect of chronic L-DOPA administered during different phases of the transplantation process on the survival and function of grafts with differing degrees of immunological compatibility. To that end, unilaterally 6-OHDA lesioned rats received sham surgery, allogeneic or xenogeneic transplants, while being treated with L-DOPA before and/or after transplantation. Irrespective of the L-DOPA treatment, dopaminergic grafts improved function and reduced the onset of L-DOPA induced dyskinesia. Importantly, although L-DOPA administered post transplantation was found to have no detrimental effect on graft survival, it did significantly promote the immune response around xenogeneic transplants, despite the administration of immunosuppressive treatment (cyclosporine). This study is the first to systematically examine the effect of L-DOPA on graft tolerance, which is dependent on the donor-host compatibility. These findings emphasize the importance of using animal models that adequately represent the patient paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders are among the most common non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease (PD) and have a significant negative impact on quality of life. While sleep disorders in PD share most characteristics with those that occur in the general population, there are several considerations specific to this patient population regarding diagnosis, management, and implications. The available research on these disorders is expanding rapidly, but many questions remain unanswered. We thus conducted a systematic review of the literature published from 2005 to 2015 on the following disorders of sleep and wakefulness in PD: REM sleep behavior disorder, insomnia, nocturia, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements, sleep disordered breathing, excessive daytime sleepiness, and circadian rhythm disorders. We discuss the epidemiology, etiology, clinical implications, associated features, evaluation measures, and management of these disorders. The influence on sleep of medications used in the treatment of motor and non-motor symptoms of PD is detailed. Additionally, we suggest areas in need of further research.",

    "abstract": "Stair ambulation is a challenging activity of daily life that requires larger joint moments than walking. Stabilisation of the body and prevention of lower limb collapse during this task depends upon adequately-sized hip, knee and ankle extensor moments. However, people with Parkinson's disease (PD) often present with strength deficits that may impair their capacity to control the lower limbs and ultimately increase their falls risk.\nTo investigate hip, knee and ankle joint moments during stair ascent and descent and determine the contribution of these joints to the body's support in people with PD.\nTwelve PD patients and twelve age-matched controls performed stair ascent and descent trials. Data from an instrumented staircase and a three-dimensional motion analysis system were used to derive sagittal hip, knee and ankle moments. Support moment impulses were calculated by summing all extensor moment impulses and the relative contribution of each joint was calculated.\nLinear mixed model analyses indicated that PD patients walked slower and had a reduced cadence relative to controls. Although support moment impulses were typically not different between groups during stair ascent or descent, a reduced contribution by the ankle joint required an increased knee joint contribution for the PD patients.\nDespite having poorer knee extensor strength, people with PD rely more heavily on these muscles during stair walking. This adaptation could possibly be driven by the somewhat restricted mobility of this joint, which may provide these individuals with an increased sense of stability during these tasks.",

    "abstract": "Familial aggregation has been described in PD of both early and late onset, but has not been studied in a true population-based sample. Moreover, little is known about its association with disease progression and endophenotypes.\nThe objectives of this work were to determine familial aggregation of idiopathic PD in a population-based cohort and study the association with clinical endophenotypes and disease progression.\nWe examined family history data from the Norwegian ParkWest study, a well-characterized, population-based cohort of incident PD patients and age-matched healthy controls. Family data were collected at baseline with a simplified questionnaire (192 cases and 193 controls) and after 3 years of longitudinal follow-up using an extended questionnaire (172 cases and 171 controls).\nCompared to the controls, the PD patients had an increased relative risk of having a first-degree relative with PD when using the extended questionnaire (relative risk = 1.988; P = 0.036), but not when using the simplified questionnaire (relative risk = 1.453; P = 0.224). There was no significant difference in age of onset or motor subtype (P = 0.801). However, cases with a family history of PD had reduced progression over 7 years as measured by UPDRS II (P = 0.008) and smaller rate of decrease of MMSE (P = 0.046).\nOur findings confirm familial aggregation in a population-based cohort of idiopathic PD. Moreover, we show that positive family history of PD in patients is associated with a slower progression of PD symptoms and cognitive decline. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

Timed-Up-GO and 20-meter-walk tests, UPDRS III, freezing of gait questionnaire, and quality-of-life scores were measured at 6 months and compared to baseline values. Blinded assessments to measure performance in the Timed-Up-GO and 20-meter-walk tests were carried out during sham stimulation at 300\u2009Hz and 60\u2009Hz.\nPatients treated with spinal cord stimulation had approximately 50% to 65% improvement in gait measurements and 35% to 45% in UPDRS III and quality-of-life scores. During blinded evaluations, significant improvements in the Timed-Up-GO and 20-meter-walk tests were only recorded at 300\u2009Hz.\nSpinal cord stimulation at 300\u2009Hz was well tolerated and led to a significant improvement in gait. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the clinical value of the bulbocavernosus reflex (BCR) and pudendal nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (PSEPs) in the differential diagnosis between multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD) in early stage.\nA total of 31 patients with MSA, 45 patients with PD, and 60 healthy participants were included in this study. A Keypoint EMG/EP system was used for BCR and PSEP measurements. Electrophysiological parameters were collected for statistical analysis.\nThe BCR elicitation rates were significantly lower in the patients with MSA than in the patients with PD (P<.05). Prolonged BCR latencies were found in the MSA group compared to the PD and control groups (P<.05). Bulbocavernosus reflex latencies were significantly prolonged in patients with MSA compared with PD patients showing early urogenital symptoms (P<.05). There was no significant difference in PSEP P41 latencies among the three groups (P=.434 in males, P=.948 in females). Both BCR and PSEP amplitudes were significantly lower in the MSA/PD group than in the control group (P<.001).\nPudendal nerve damage is more severe in MSA than in PD. Prolonged BCR latency may be valuable for distinguishing between MSA and PD in the early stages. BCR and PSEP testing may also contribute to localized and qualitative diagnosis of the distribution of neurodegenerative pathologies in these two disorders.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a form of biotechnological surgery which has had considerable success for the motor improvement of Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Paradoxically, this observed motor improvement is not matched with improved psychosocial adjustment. This study contributes to a small but growing body of research aiming to understand this paradox. We conclude by discussing these aspects from a phenomenological and health psychology understanding of decision-making, human affectivity, and embodiment.\nA hermeneutic phenomenological case study.\nSemi-structured interviews with one woman with Parkinson's disease were carried out paying particular attention to (1) how the decision to have the procedure was made and (2) the affective experience in the time periods immediately prior to the procedure, shortly after and 1\u00a0month later.\nThe thematic structure derived from the hermeneutic phenomenological analysis comprises the following experiential aspects: Making the decision: 'I was feeling rather at a dead end with my Parkinson's'; Shifting emotions and feelings: 'Terrified, excited, disappointed, overjoyed'; Embodied meaning: 'This extraordinary procedure where they were going to drill holes in my head'.\nThis research has elucidated the complexity of decision-making, the emotional landscape, and specific bodily nature of the experience of DBS. It has suggested implications for practice informed by both existential-phenomenological theory and health psychology. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a newly developed form of biotechnological surgery and research indicates a mismatch between motor success and psychosocial adjustment. Most studies focuses on life post-DBS and there is relatively little research on how people make the decision to have the procedure, what their experience is of undergoing it including its emotional aspects. What does this study add? This study demonstrates that making decisions with respect to health and illness is complex and best understood as a form of embodied cognition. Findings indicate that the experience of undergoing DBS surgery is one of multiple emotions, especially fear and feelings of 'unhomelikeness'. This study highlights the relevance of a lifeworld, people-centered and humanizing approach to helping health care professionals support people through an illness/treatment trajectory.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits are common in Parkinson's disease and we suspect that dysfunctions of connected brain regions can be the source of these deficits. The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity according to differences in cognitive profiles in Parkinson's disease. 119 participants were enrolled and divided into four groups according to their cognitive phenotypes (determined by a cluster analysis): (i) 31 cognitively intact patients (G1), (ii) 31 patients with only slight mental slowing (G2), (iii) 43 patients with mild to moderate deficits mainly in executive functions (G3), (iv) 14 patients with severe deficits in all cognitive domains (G4-5). Rs-fMRI whole-brain connectivity was examined by two complementary approaches: graph theory for studying network functional organization and network-based statistics (NBS) for exploring functional connectivity amongst brain regions. After adjustment for age, duration of formal education and center of acquisition, there were significant group differences for all functional organization indexes: functional organization decreased (G1\u2009>\u2009G2\u2009>\u2009G3\u2009>\u2009G4-5) as cognitive impairment worsened. Between-group differences in functional connectivity (NBS corrected, P\u2009<\u20090.01) mainly concerned the ventral prefrontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices as well as the basal ganglia. In Parkinson's disease, brain network organization is progressively disrupted as cognitive impairment worsens, with an increasing number of altered connections between brain regions. We observed reduced connectivity in highly associative areas, even in patients with only slight mental slowing. The association of slowed mental processing with loss of connectivity between highly associative areas could be an early marker of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and may contribute to the detection of prodromal forms of Parkinson's disease dementia.

    "abstract": "Fifty-five years after the concept of dopamine replacement therapy was introduced, Parkinson disease (PD) remains an incurable neurological disorder. To date, no disease-modifying therapeutic has been approved. The inability to predict PD incidence risk in healthy adults is seen as a limitation in drug development, because by the time of clinical diagnosis \u2265\u00a060% of dopamine neurons have been lost. We have designed an incidence prediction model founded on the concept that the pathogenesis of PD is similar to that of many disorders observed in ageing humans, i.e. a complex, multifactorial disease. Our model considers five factors to determine cumulative incidence rates for PD in healthy adults: (i) DNA variants that alter susceptibility (D), e.g. carrying a LRRK2 or GBA risk allele; (ii) Exposure history to select environmental factors including xenobiotics (E); (iii) Gene-environment interactions that initiate pathological tissue responses (I), e.g. a rise in ROS levels, misprocessing of amyloidogenic proteins (foremost, \u03b1-synuclein) and dysregulated inflammation; (iv) sex (or gender; G); and importantly, (v) time (T) encompassing ageing-related changes, latency of illness and propagation of disease. We propose that cumulative incidence rates for PD (P",

    "abstract": "Affective touch sensation is conducted by a sub-class of C-fibres in hairy skin known as C-Tactile (CT) afferents. CT afferents respond maximally to gentle skin stroking at velocities between 1 and 10\u00a0cm/s. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by markedly reduced cutaneous C-fibres. It is not known if affective touch perception is influenced by C-fibre density and if affective touch is impaired in PD compared to healthy controls. We predicted that perceived pleasantness to gentle stroking in PD would correlate with C-afferent density and that affective touch perception would be impaired in PD compared to healthy controls. Twenty-four PD patients and 27 control subjects rated the pleasantness of brush stroking at an optimum CT stimulation velocity (3\u00a0cm/s) and two sub-optimal velocities (0.3 and 30\u00a0cm/s). PD patients underwent quantification of C-fibre density using skin biopsies and corneal confocal microscopy. All participants rated a stroking velocity of 3\u00a0cm/s as the most pleasant with significantly lower ratings for 0.3 and 30\u00a0cm/s. There was a significant positive correlation between C-fibre density and pleasantness ratings at 3 and 30\u00a0cm/s but not 0.3\u00a0cm/s. Mean pleasantness ratings were consistently higher in PD patients compared to control subjects across all three velocities. This study shows that perceived pleasantness to gentle touch correlates significantly with C-fibre density in PD. The higher perceived pleasantness in PD patients compared to controls suggests central sensitisation to peripheral inputs, which may have been enhanced by dopamine therapy.",

    "abstract": "Alterations of circadian rhythms are among the most debilitating non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Although a growing awareness towards these symptoms has occurred during the last decade, their underlying neuropathophysiology remains poorly understood and consequently no effective therapeutic strategies are available to alleviate these problems. Recent studies have investigated multiple circadian rhythms at different stages of PD. The advances made have allowed an accurate evaluation of the affected underlying pathways and mechanisms. Here I dissect, over disease progression, the relative causal contribution to health impairments in PD patients of dysfunctions in the different components of the neural network governing circadian rhythms. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms will provide not only a greater understanding of disease neuropathology, but also hold the promise for effective therapies. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "We previously showed that the protein pattern of lenses removed in cataract surgery differs between patients with Parkinson's disease and age-matched controls. In this study, we identified the protein reduced in abundance in the 34- to 37-kDa gel band.\nDuring cataract surgery (phacoemulsification), we collected the rinsing fluid and lens particles from the eyes of PD patients and controls. Residual lens fragments in the supernatant of 3 PD patients and aged-matched controls were studied for protein profiles using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and Western blots.\nWe identified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by mass spectrometry as the protein reduced in abundance and verified this finding in Western blots.\nGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase has been implicated in PD development. The reduction of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the lenses of PD patients may be a new biomarker for PD and might also indicate an important role for this protein in PD development. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Cell therapy is a promising approach for Parkinson's disease (PD). Others and we have previously shown that transplantation of ventral mesencephalic fetal cells into substantia nigra (SN) in an animal model of PD enables anatomical and functional repair of the degenerated pathway. However, the molecular basis of this repair is still largely unknown.\nIn this work, we studied the expression of several axon guidance molecules that may be implicated in the repair of the degenerated nigrostriatal pathway.\nThe expression of axon guidance molecules was analyzed using qRT-PCR on five specific regions surrounding the nigrostriatal pathway (ventral mesencephalon (VM), thalamus (Thal), medial forebrain bundle (MFB), nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and caudate putamen (CPu)), one and seven days after lesion and transplantation.\nWe showed that mRNA expression of specific axon guidance molecules and their receptors is modified in structures surrounding the nigrostriatal pathway, suggesting their involvement in the axon guidance of grafted neurons. Moreover, we highlight a possible new role for semaphorin 7A in this repair.\nOverall, our data provide a reliable basis to understand how axons of grafted neurons are able to navigate towards their targets and interact with the molecular environment in the adult brain. This should help to improve the efficiency of cell replacement approaches in PD.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) have to deal with several aspects of voice and speech decline and thus alteration of communication ability during the course of the disease. Among these communication impairments, 3 major challenges include: (1) dysarthria, consisting of orofacial motor dysfunction and dysprosody, which is linked to the neurodegenerative processes; (2) effects of the pharmacological treatment, which vary according to the disease stage; and (3) particular speech modifications that may be language-specific, that is, dependent on the language spoken by the patients. The main objective of the FraLusoPark project is to provide a thorough evaluation of changes in PD speech as a result of pharmacological treatment and disease duration in 2 different languages (French vs European Portuguese).\nIndividuals with PD are enrolled in the study in France (N=60) and Portugal (N=60). Their global motor disability and orofacial motor functions is assessed with specific clinical rating scales, without (OFF) and with (ON) pharmacological treatment. 2 groups of 60 healthy age-matched volunteers provide the reference for between-group comparisons. Along with the clinical examinations, several speech tasks are recorded to obtain acoustic and perceptual measures. Patient-reported outcome measures are used to assess the psychosocial impact of dysarthria on quality of life.\nThe study has been approved by the local responsible committees on human experimentation and is conducted in accordance with the ethical standards. A valuable large-scale database of speech recordings and metadata from patients with PD in France and Portugal will be constructed. Results will be disseminated in several articles in peer-reviewed journals and in conference presentations. Recommendations on how to assess speech and voice disorders in individuals with PD to monitor the progression and management of symptoms will be provided.\nNCT02753192, Pre-results.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has suggested that balance impairments may be linked to anxiety in PD, yet there is little empirical evidence to support this link in PD. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of anxiety on balance, and also examine whether dopaminergic treatment modulates the influence of anxiety on balance. Forty-two participants (10 high anxious PD [HA-PD]; 11 low anxious PD [LA-PD], 21 controls [HC]) performed 10 quiet standing trials on a force platform in two virtual environments: LOW threat; on a plank located on the ground; HIGH threat; on an elevated plank. After each 30-s trial, participants rated their anxiety. PD participants were tested both ON and OFF dopaminergic medication, and center of gravity (COG) deviations in anterior-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions were recorded. Results showed that all groups reported significantly greater levels of anxiety when standing in the HIGH condition compared to the LOW and HA-PD reported greater levels of anxiety compared to both other groups. All participants significantly reduced their COG position to be closer to center in the ML plane during the HIGH compared to LOW threat condition. HA-PD participants were the only group to reduce their lean significantly in the AP plane while standing in the HIGH compared to the LOW condition. HA-PD participants also had significantly greater variability in the COG displacement in both the AP and ML planes compared to LA-PD participants. Although dopaminergic medication significantly reduced self-reported anxiety, it had limited effects on balance. In conclusion, this study provides strong evidence that anxiety does influence balance control in PD, especially those who are highly anxious. Dopamine appears to modulate anxiety, but further research is needed to evaluate whether dopaminergic treatment is optimal for anxiety induced balance deficits.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 5% of the elderly population. PD diagnosis is still based on the identification of neuromotor symptoms although nonmotor manifestations emerge years prior to diagnosis. The discovery of biomarkers at the earliest stages of PD is of extreme interest. miRNAs have been considered potential biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, but only a limited number have been found to be PD related. This review focuses on the current findings in the field of circulating miRNAs in PD and the challenges surrounding clinical utility and validation. We briefly describe the more established circulating biomarkers in PD and provide a more thorough review of miRNAs differentially expressed in PD. We highlight their potential for being considered as biomarkers for diagnosis while emphasizing the challenges for adequate validation of the findings and how miRNAs can be envisioned in a clinical setting satisfying regulatory bodies.",

    "abstract": "REM (rapid eye movement) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by increased muscle tone and violent limb movements and is a usual symptom of the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients with RBD represent faster motor and cognitive dysfunction progression. However, there are limited studies on possible structural brain changes underpinning this disorder.\nDiffusion magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) was used to assess whether microstructural abnormalities in the brain of 23 RBD positive PD are detectable compared to 31 RBD negative PD. DMRI scans were analyzed without a prior hypothesis. Diffusion MRI connectometry was used to carry out group analysis between age and gender matched PD patients with and without RBD. Diffusion MRI connectometry is based on spin distribution function (SDF) which quantifies the density of diffusing water and is more sensitive to psychological differences between groups.\nPatients with RBD positive showed microstructural white matter changes in the left and right cingulum, inferior front occipital fasciculus (IFOF), bilateral corticospinal tracts (CST), and middle cerebellar peduncles (MCPs), compared to patients without RBD.\nWhite matter alterations in the cingulum, IFOF regions, and corpus callosum might explain faster cognitive deterioration in PD patients with RBD, in terms of visual recognition and visuospatial dysfunction and executive function. Disturbed brain structural tissue markers in CST in PD + RBD patients, could be justified in the light of faster motor progression in these patients.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed at examining the impact of Parkinson disease (PD) on patients' sexuality and relationship and to evaluate gender-specific differences. Using a standardized questionnaire on sexual functioning in chronic diseases (SFCE), the impact of PD diagnosis on 38 domains of sexuality before and since PD diagnosis was evaluated retrospectively in 53 consecutive patients in a relationship. Changes in self-assessed ratings on a four-point Likert scale were determined for all patients. In addition, gender-specific differences and the influence of age, depression (BDI-II), medication, disease severity and disease duration on domains of the SFCE were calculated. The importance of non-sexual relational aspects, such as talking about feelings or tenderness increased for both genders after PD diagnosis, especially in women. Sexual function, such as frequency of intercourse, sexual arousal, subjective abnormal sexual fantasies or sexual satisfaction deteriorated in both genders, especially in men. Some sexual aspects improved in women but worsened in men after PD diagnosis. This includes frequency of orgasm dysfunction, fear not to fulfill sexual expectations of the partner, avoidance of sexual acts, withdrawal from relationship, increase of thoughts about divorce, or increase of dissatisfaction with sexuality and relationship. With age, thoughts about divorce declined. With disease duration, frequency of tenderness with the partner increased. Depression unexpectedly correlated with higher frequency of intercourse. Dopaminergic dosage influenced stability of the relationship negatively. PD influences patients' sexuality negatively, independently of age, disease duration or disease severity and men show greater sexual dysfunction and impairment of their sexual relationship than women.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetics is a rapidly developing field focused on deciphering chemical fingerprints that accumulate on human genomes over time. As the nascent idea of precision medicine expands to encompass epigenetic signatures of diagnostic and prognostic relevance, there is a need for methodologies that provide high-throughput DNA methylation profiling measurements. Here we report a novel quantification methodology for computationally reconstructing site-specific CpG methylation status from next generation sequencing (NGS) data using methyl-sensitive restriction endonucleases (MSRE). An integrated pipeline efficiently incorporates raw NGS metrics into a statistical discrimination platform to identify functional linkages between shifts in epigenetic DNA methylation and disease phenotypes in samples being analyzed. In this pilot proof-of-concept study we quantify and compare DNA methylation in blood serum of individuals with Parkinson's Disease relative to matched healthy blood profiles. Even with a small study of only six samples, a high degree of statistical discrimination was achieved based on CpG methylation profiles between groups, with 1008 statistically different CpG sites (",

    "abstract": "Life-long experiences of cognitive activity could enhance cognitive reserve, which may lead individuals to show less cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease, despite similar pathological changes. We performed this study to test whether premorbid physical activity may enhance motor reserve in Parkinson's disease (PD) (i.e., less motor deficits despite similar degrees of dopamine depletion).\nWe assessed engagement in premorbid leisure-time exercise among 102 drug naive PD patients who had been initially diagnosed at our hospital by dopamine transporter scanning. Patients were classified into tertile groups based on the frequency, duration, and intensity of the exercises in which they participated.\nAmong patients with mild to moderate reductions in striatal dopaminergic activity (above the median dopaminergic activity), the exercise group of the highest tertile showed significantly lower motor scores (i.e., fewer motor deficits, 15.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.25), despite similar degrees of dopamine reduction, compared to the combined group of the middle and the lowest tertiles (21.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Nonetheless, the highest tertile group showed a more rapid decline in motor function related to reductions in striatal dopaminergic activity than the other two groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002 with the middle tertile group and p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 with the lowest tertile group).\nThese results suggest that engagement in premorbid exercise acts as a proxy for an active reserve in the motor domain (i.e., motor reserve) in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "The use of speech based data in the classification of Parkinson disease (PD) has been shown to provide an effect, non-invasive mode of classification in recent years. Thus, there has been an increased interest in speech pattern analysis methods applicable to Parkinsonism for building predictive tele-diagnosis and tele-monitoring models. One of the obstacles in optimizing classifications is to reduce noise within the collected speech samples, thus ensuring better classification accuracy and stability. While the currently used methods are effect, the ability to invoke instance selection has been seldomly examined.\nIn this study, a PD classification algorithm was proposed and examined that combines a multi-edit-nearest-neighbor (MENN) algorithm and an ensemble learning algorithm. First, the MENN algorithm is applied for selecting optimal training speech samples iteratively, thereby obtaining samples with high separability. Next, an ensemble learning algorithm, random forest (RF) or decorrelated neural network ensembles (DNNE), is used to generate trained samples from the collected training samples. Lastly, the trained ensemble learning algorithms are applied to the test samples for PD classification. This proposed method was examined using a more recently deposited public datasets and compared against other currently used algorithms for validation.\nExperimental results showed that the proposed algorithm obtained the highest degree of improved classification accuracy (29.44%) compared with the other algorithm that was examined. Furthermore, the MENN algorithm alone was found to improve classification accuracy by as much as 45.72%. Moreover, the proposed algorithm was found to exhibit a higher stability, particularly when combining the MENN and RF algorithms.\nThis study showed that the proposed method could improve PD classification when using speech data and can be applied to future studies seeking to improve PD classification methods.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI) is associated with diminished norepinephrine from the locus coeruleus to the prefrontal cortex. Atomoxetine is a specific norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults. The authors hypothesized that atomoxetine would improve attention and executive functioning in patients with PD-MCI.\nThirty participants who met Movement Disorder Society Task Force Level I criteria for PD-MCI were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of atomoxetine. Cognitive evaluations were performed at baseline and after 10 weeks of treatment or placebo. A safety visit was performed at Week 12. A global statistical test was used to examine treatment effects on standardized tests of attention, working memory, processing speed, and set shifting (primary outcome measure). Secondary outcomes included cognitive measures hypothesized to be insensitive to atomoxetine, the Conners Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale, and safety measures.\nFifteen participants were randomized to each arm. Groups were similar on medical and demographic variables and baseline cognition. Three serious adverse events occurred; 2 on atomoxetine (syncope, isolated episode of atrial fibrillation) and 1 on placebo (atrial fibrillation). The global statistical test of primary outcome measures did not reveal a significant difference between groups. However, significant improvements were observed for atomoxetine but not placebo on subjective measures of attention and impulsivity (Conners Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale).\nAtomoxetine treatment produced subjective, but not objective, improvements in PD-MCI. Failure to detect objective differences may be due to insensitivity of cognitive tests or severity of cognitive deficits in the study participants.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in High temperature requirement A2 (HtrA2), also designated PARK13, which lead to the loss of its protease activity, have been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). HtrA2 is a mitochondrial protease that translocates to the cytosol upon the initiation of apoptosis where it participates in the abrogation of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) inhibition of caspases. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of the HtrA2 function in the dopaminergic neurons of Drosophila melanogaster results in PD-like phenotypes, and we attempt to restore the age-dependent loss in locomotor ability by co-expressing the sole pro-survival Bcl-2 homologue Buffy. The inhibition of HtrA2 in the dopaminergic neurons of Drosophila resulted in shortened lifespan and impaired climbing ability, and the overexpression of Buffy rescued the reduction in lifespan and the age-dependent loss of locomotor ability. In supportive experiments, the inhibition of HtrA2 in the Drosophila eye results in eye defects, marked by reduction in ommatidia number and increased disruption of the ommatidial array; phenotypes that are suppressed by the overexpression of Buffy.",

    "abstract": "The Capgras syndrome (CS) is a rare psychiatric disorder. CS is classified as a delusional misidentification syndrome. Initially, CS was described in paranoid schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. CS has also been reported in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. To date, there are very few descriptions of the occurrence of CS in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), with or without dementia. Considering the recent observation of two new cases in PD patients, a systematic overview of the literature published between 1976 and 2016 reporting CS in PD was conducted. The purpose of this article is to examine the phenomenon in people with PD with and without dementia, the psychopathologic context in which it happened, the role played by the dopaminergic medications and to define useful therapeutic strategies. Our CS cases occurred in two elderly patients with advanced PD and cognitive impairment, respectively, after an acute stressor event and after an increase of the total daily dose of levodopa. In light of our observations and the cases reported in the literature, we argue that CS is an acute or subacute psychotic disorder occurring mostly in PD with dementia. Besides, the increase in brain dopamine levels induced by acute stressful events and/or dopamine-enhancing medications should be considered as a possible causal mechanism of CS in patients with advanced stages of PD and cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "While the distinctive motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) have been described for centuries, cognitive impairment has only recently been recognized as a central feature. Studies have yielded clues to the etiology and natural history of cognitive impairment in PD, but much remains unclear and effective therapies are needed.\nLongitudinal cohort studies demonstrate that almost all patients with PD will develop dementia if they live long enough. New CSF biomarker and genetic studies suggest that it may soon be possible to forecast and track the progression of dementia in PD. Sleep and sleep disturbance appear to be intrinsically linked with PD, although the implications for individual outcomes and opportunities for intervention are unclear. Multidisciplinary treatment approaches incorporating cognitive training may help to improve outcomes.\nWe review several recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology, genetics, and management of cognitive impairment in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients frequently have several spinal deformities leading to postural instabilities including camptocormia, myopathy-induced postural deformity, Pisa syndrome, and progressive degeneration, all of which adversely affect daily life activities. To improve these postural deformities and relieve the related neurologic symptoms, patients often undergo spinal instrumentation surgery. Due to progressive degenerative changes related to PD itself and other complicating factors, patients and surgeons are faced with instrument failure-related complications, which can ultimately result in multiple revision surgeries yielding various postoperative complications and morbidities. Here, we report a representative case of a 70-year-old PD patient with flat back syndrome who had undergone several revision surgeries, including anterior and posterior decompression and fusion for a lumbosacral spinal deformity. The patient ultimately benefitted from a relatively short segment fixation and corrective fusion surgery.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is neurodegenerative and requires ongoing therapy. The purpose of the current study was two-fold: to (a) describe the prevalence, types, and associated factors of complementary health approaches (CHA) used in individuals with PD; and (b) explore reasons for CHA use. A self-administered, cross-sectional survey was used. The response rate was 61.9% (N = 135), and 74.1% of participants used CHA for either PD or general health. The most widely used CHA included exercise, yoga, massage, vitamins, coenzyme Q10, and coconut oil. Higher levels of education and treatment by a movement disorder specialist were significantly related to CHA use. Nurses and other health care professionals may have a role in providing safe care for individuals with PD. Further studies on effectiveness and safety of commonly used CHA are warranted.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are both part of the spectrum of neurodegenerative movement disorders and \u03b1-synucleinopathies with overlap of symptoms especially at early stages of the disease but with distinct disease progression and responses to dopaminergic treatment. Therefore, having biomarkers that specifically classify patients, which could discriminate PD from MSA, would be very useful. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate protein translation and are observed in biological fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and may therefore have potential as biomarkers of disease. The aim of our study was to determine if miRNAs in CSF could be used as biomarkers for either PD or MSA. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we evaluated expression levels of 10 miRNAs in CSF patient samples from PD (n\u00a0=\u00a028), MSA (n\u00a0=\u00a017), and non-neurological controls (n\u00a0=\u00a028). We identified two miRNAs (miR-24 and miR-205) that distinguished PD from controls and four miRNAs that differentiated MSA from controls (miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-24, and miR-34c). Combinations of miRNAs accurately discriminated either PD (area under the curve (AUC)\u00a0=\u00a00.96) or MSA (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.86) from controls. In MSA, we also observed that miR-24 and miR-148b correlated with cerebellar ataxia symptoms, suggesting that these miRNAs are involved in cerebellar degeneration in MSA. Our findings support the potential of miRNA panels as biomarkers for movement disorders and may provide more insights into the pathological mechanisms related to these disorders.",

    "abstract": "The unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion of medial forebrain bundle (MFB) in rats affords us to study the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). Numerous evidences suggest synergic effects when various neurotrophic factors are administered in experimental models of PD. The aim of the present work was to assess the morphological changes along the rostro-caudal axis of caudo-putamen complex and substantia nigra (SN) in the referred model in order to test the suitability of a severe model to evaluate new neurorestorative therapies. Administration of 6-OHDA into MFB in addition to a remarkable depletion of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system induced an increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells in SN and an intense immunoreactivity for OX-42, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Lycopersycum esculentum agglutinin (LEA) in striatum and SN. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunostaining revealed a significant decrease of the TH-immunopositive striatal volume in 6-OHDA group from rostral to caudal one. The loss of TH-immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons and axodendritic network (ADN) was higher in caudal sections. Morphological recovery after the implantation of microspheres loaded with VEGF and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in parkinsonized rats was related to the preservation of the TH-ir cell number and ADN in the caudal region of the SN. In addition, these findings support the neurorestorative role of VEGF+GDNF in the dopaminergic system and the synergistic effect between both factors. On the other hand, a topological distribution of the dopaminergic system was noticeable in the severe model, showing a selective vulnerability to 6-OHDA and recovering after treatment.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture has shown the therapeutic effect on various neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD). While investigating the neuroprotective mechanism of acupuncture, we firstly found the novel function of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) as a potent neuroprotective candidate. Here, we explored whether hypothalamic MCH mediates the neuroprotective action of acupuncture. In addition, we aimed at evaluating the neuroprotective effects of MCH and elucidating underlying mechanism in vitro and in vivo PD models. First, we tested whether hypothalamic MCH mediates the neuroprotective effects of acupuncture by challenging MCH-R1 antagonist (i.p.) in mice PD model. We also investigated whether MCH has a beneficial role in dopaminergic neuronal protection in vitro primary midbrain and human neuronal cultures and in vivo MPTP-induced, Pitx3",

It is unknown whether unilateral STN DBS improves oculomotor function and whether bilateral STN DBS improves it to a greater extent. Further, it has also been shown that bilateral, but not unilateral, STN DBS is associated with some impaired cognitive-motor functions. The current study compared the effect of unilateral and bilateral STN DBS on sensorimotor and cognitive aspects of oculomotor control. Patients performed prosaccade and antisaccade tasks during no stimulation, unilateral stimulation, and bilateral stimulation. There were three sets of findings. First, for the prosaccade task, unilateral STN DBS had no effect on prosaccade latency and it reduced prosaccade gain; bilateral STN DBS reduced prosaccade latency and increased prosaccade gain. Second, for the antisaccade task, neither unilateral nor bilateral stimulation had an effect on antisaccade latency, unilateral STN DBS increased antisaccade gain, and bilateral STN DBS increased antisaccade gain to a greater extent. Third, bilateral STN DBS induced an increase in prosaccade errors in the antisaccade task. These findings suggest that while bilateral STN DBS benefits spatiotemporal aspects of oculomotor control, it may not be as beneficial for more complex cognitive aspects of oculomotor control. Our findings are discussed considering the strategic role the STN plays in modulating information in the basal ganglia oculomotor circuit.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) nowadays is a well-established treatment of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a common target for DBS, because motor improvements have been shown to be superior to best medical therapy, if DBS electrodes have been appropriately positioned. DBS target identification can be assisted by MRI beyond structural imaging by spatially resolved measurement of T2-relaxation times (T2r).\nWe pose the question, whether T2r of the STN is linked to the severity of the disease and whether outcome of DBS may be correlated to an asymmetric manifestation of the disease. Further, we investigated if abnormal T2r in the STN may be predictive for outcome of DBS.\nTwelve patients underwent preoperative MR imaging including a multi echo relaxometry sequence (3\u00a0Tesla, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) ahead of DBS. T2r were determined for STN, substantia nigra (SN), red nucleus (RN) and centrum semiovale (CSO). Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores were tested before and after DBS. Patients' T2r and deduced values representing left-right asymmetry of measurements were correlated with UPDRS scores and measures for outcome of DBS. Furthermore, patients' T2r were compared with T2r measurements in 12 healthy controls (HC).\nPatients' T2r for SN (mean 45.4\u00a0ms\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4\u00a0ms) and STN (mean 56.4\u00a0ms\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8\u00a0ms) were significantly shorter than T2r in HCs for SN (mean 60.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6) and STN (mean 66.1\u00a0ms\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0\u00a0ms). While no mean T2r asymmetry was found in the SN, patients' mean T2r for STN showed a weakened left-right correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.19 versus 0.72 in HC) indicating asymmetric degeneration. T2r asymmetry was not linked to the more severely affected hemisphere. The respective lower T2r within the left or right target region was significantly correlated to the outcome in terms of UPDRS III improvement in \"off\" state (Pearson correlation 0.82 corresponding to p\u00a0\u226a\u00a00.01). Patients with T2r of STN lower than 50\u00a0ms showed no response to DBS in the UPDRS. The maximum T2r for SN correlated to the improvement between UPDRS \"off\" minus and \"on\" (Dopamine response) but failed to predict DBS outcome.\nThe lower boundaries of T2r in the STN predict motor outcome in DBS. T2r asymmetry in the STN is not associated with increased clinical symptoms, but with response to therapy. Thus, patients with very low T2r may be inappropriate candidates for DBS.",

    "abstract": "The aetiology of constipation in Parkinson's disease remains poorly understood. Defaecatory dyssynergia, anal sphincter spasticity and slow transit constipation may, individually or collectively, play a role.\nIn this retrospective cohort analysis of patients with Parkinson's disease and chronic constipation, we determined the utility of high-resolution anorectal manometry, balloon expulsion and wireless motility capsule testing in defining the underlying aetiology for constipation.\nIn this retrospective cohort study, consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease and chronic constipation underwent clinical assessment, manometry with balloon expulsion and wireless motility capsule testing using standard protocols.\nWe studied 66 patients fulfilling Rome IV criteria for functional constipation. Most patients (89%) had abnormal manometry, exhibiting various types of defaecatory dyssynergia (mostly types II and IV), abnormal balloon expulsion, diminished rectal sensation and, in some, lacking rectoanal inhibitory reflex. 62% exhibited colonic transit delay by wireless motility capsule study, while 57% had combined manometric and transit abnormalities, suggesting of overlap constipation. Symptoms of infrequent defaecation, straining and incomplete evacuation were not discriminatory. There was a relationship between constipation scores and colonic transit times (p=0.01); Parkinson's disease scores and duration were not correlated with either the manometric or transit findings. Faecal incontinence was seen in 26% of the patients.\nChronic constipation in patients with Parkinson's disease may reflect pelvic floor dyssynergia, slow transit constipation or both, and may be associated with faecal incontinence, suggesting both motor and autonomic dysfunction. Anorectal manometry and wireless motility capsule testing are useful in the assessment of these patients.",

Most patients (89%) had abnormal manometry, exhibiting various types of defaecatory dyssynergia (mostly types II and IV), abnormal balloon expulsion, diminished rectal sensation and, in some, lacking rectoanal inhibitory reflex. 62% exhibited colonic transit delay by wireless motility capsule study, while 57% had combined manometric and transit abnormalities, suggesting of overlap constipation. Symptoms of infrequent defaecation, straining and incomplete evacuation were not discriminatory. There was a relationship between constipation scores and colonic transit times (p=0.01); Parkinson's disease scores and duration were not correlated with either the manometric or transit findings. Faecal incontinence was seen in 26% of the patients.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been shown to be effective for parkinsonian symptoms poorly responsive to medications. DBS is typically well-tolerated, as are the maintenance battery changes. Here we describe an adverse event during a battery replacement procedure that caused rapid onset of severe depression.\nThe patient is a 58-year-old woman who was in a serious motor vehicle accident and sustained a concussion with loss of consciousness. Within weeks of the accident she began developing parkinsonian symptoms that progressively worsened over the subsequent 10\u00a0years. Responding poorly to medications, she received DBS, which controlled her movement symptoms. Five years after initiating DBS, during a routine battery change, an apparent electrical event occurred that triggered the rapid onset of severe depression. Anti-seizure and antidepressant medications were ineffective, and the patient was offered a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which resulted in complete reversal of her depressive episode.\nParkinson's syndrome can be seen after a single closed head injury event. Post-traumatic parkinsonism is responsive to DBS; however, DBS has been associated with an infrequent occurrence of dramatic disruption in mood. ECT is a therapeutic option for patients who develop intractable depressive illness associated with DBS.",

    "abstract": "Development of effective therapeutic drugs for Parkinson's disease is in great need. During the progression of Parkinson's disease, Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) is activated to promote neurodegeneration. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has a neuroprotective effect during the neural injury of Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanisms that underlie the effects of ROCK2 and H2S remain ill-defined. In the current study, we addressed these questions.\nWe used a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse subacute model of Parkinson's disease to study the effects of H2S on astrocytic activation in the mouse striatum, on the levels of tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH)-positive neuron loss, on the apomorphine-induced rotational behavior of the mice, and on the changes in ROCK2 and miR-135a-5p expression. Plasmid transfection was applied to modify miR-135a-5p levels in a neuronal cell line HCN-1A. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to predict the relationship between ROCK2 and miR-135a-5p in neuronal cells, and then was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay.\nH2S alleviated MPTP-induced astrocytic activation in the mouse striatum, alleviated the increases in TH-positive neuron loss, and improved the apomorphine-induced rotational behavior of the mice. H2S significantly attenuated the increases in ROCK2 and the decreases in miR-135a-5p by MPTP. MiR-135a-5p targeted the 3'-UTR of ROCK2 mRNA to inhibit its translation in neuronal cells.\nMiR-135a-5p-regulated ROCK2 may play a role in the protective effects of hydrogen sulfide against Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease has yet to be characterized. Although stimulus-driven (\"bottom-up\") processes are known to be impaired, the role of \"top-down\" processes remains to be determined. Distinguishing between conscious and non-conscious detections (i.e. access to consciousness) may be a valuable way of monitoring top-down processes. Conscious access to visual inputs was investigated to identify the neural substrates underlying susceptibility to hallucinations in Parkinson's disease. Seventeen healthy controls, 18 Parkinson's disease patients with minor visual hallucinations and 16 without were enrolled in the study. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, the participants performed a visual detection task. The detection threshold was significantly higher in each patient group than in healthy controls while the two groups of patients did not differ significantly. Compared with hallucination-free patients, patients with minor hallucinations displayed hyperactivation of prefrontal and right occipital cortices, and hypoactivation of the left cingulate, temporal and occipital cortices. During conscious access to visual inputs, the functional network in patients with visual hallucinations differed from that seen in patients without visual hallucinations. This suggests that the supremacy of top-down processes in visual information processing may enhance susceptibility to hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. It is generally believed that it is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, but the precise pathogenesis of PD is unknown to date. In this study, we performed a pathway analysis based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) to detect risk pathways of PD in three GWAS datasets. We first mapped all SNP markers to autosomal genes in each GWAS dataset. Then, we evaluated gene risk values using the minimum P-value of the tagSNPs. We took a pathway as a unit to identify the risk pathways based on the cumulative risks of the genes in the pathway. Finally, we combine the analysis results of the three datasets to detect the high risk pathways associated with PD. We found there were five same pathways in the three datasets. Besides, we also found there were five pathways which were shared in two datasets. Most of these pathways are associated with nervoussystem. Five pathways had been reported to be PD-related pathways in the previous literature. Our findings also implied that there was a close association between immune response and PD. Continued investigation of these pathways will further help us explain the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Although several lines of evidence suggest that low levels of hemoglobin are a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), few studies have examined changes in hemoglobin after PD onset. In this study, we quantify alterations in hemoglobin after the onset of PD and explore possible mechanisms for changes in hemoglobin. We enrolled 213 PD and 219 control subjects between 2013 and 2014 at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University. We collected data from routine blood tests (including markers of iron metabolism) and measured basic clinical parameters. The hemoglobin levels were lower in PD patients relative to control subjects (125.1\u00b115.68g/L and 139.9\u00b111.83g/L, respectively; p\uff1c0.001). Serum iron levels did not change in PD patients compared to control subjects (14.92\u00b14.88\u03bcmol/L and 15.73\u00b14.40\u03bcmol/L, respectively; p=0.35). Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) was also unaltered (PD group: 48.29\u00b19.13\u03bcmol/L; control group: 49.74\u00b18.35 \u03bcmol/L; p=0.43). The level of ferritin in PD and control subjects was 174.07\u00b174.04ng/mL and 191.82\u00b191.49ng/mL (p=0.04), respectively. We further analyzed the relationship between iron metabolism and PD by stratifying the data by disease severity and found that late-stage PD patients have lower levels of iron, ferritin, and TIBC (14.36\u00b14.95\u03bcmol/L, 162.24\u00b171.25\u03bcmol/L and 46.84\u00b110.15ng/mL) compared to age-matched controls. Significant correlations were observed between hemoglobin levels and iron metablism. Our results suggest that hemoglobin levels are lower in PD patients compared to controls and are associated with the severity of PD and iron metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinemia has been associated with cognitive disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Previous studies showed that levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease (PD) patients were likely to have elevated homocysteine levels. In addition, epidemiological evidence found that cognitive impairment presented in the vast majority of PD patients. However, what role homocysteine played in cognitive function of PD patients remained debated. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to investigate the possible correlations among cognitive function, homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 levels in PD patients. A structured literature search was carried out on Pubmed, Springer, EMbase, Cochrane library, CNKI, VP and Wanfang database up to April 2016 using strict inclusion criteria. Data on demographic information, levodopa equivalent dosage, homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 levels and Mini Mental Scale Examination scores were collected and pooled. The mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was used as the effect size. Of 75 articles identified, 15 were eligible for inclusion. The results suggested that PD patients with cognitive dysfunction were likely to have higher homocysteine levels(MD=5.05, 95%CI [4.03, 6.07]), lower folate(MD=-0.21, 95%CI [-0.34, -0.08]) and vitamin B12 levels(MD=-47.58, 95%CI [-72.07, -23.09]). We again verified a close relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and PD (MD=5.67, 95%CI [4.40, 6.94]). We concluded that hyperhomocysteinemia was related to cognitive impairment of PD patients, and further studies should focus on the intervention to lower homocysteine level, hopefully to provide useful advice for clinical practice.",
