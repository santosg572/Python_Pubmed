    "abstract": "The delicate balance of the oral cavity is disrupted by changes in hygiene and diet, leading to caries. The virulence of Streptococcus mutans, a key caries pathogen, is partly explained by its rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide (RGP) and its sucrose-dependent and -independent adhesion mechanisms. Given their role in comorbidities, this study investigates the diversity of S. mutans through analysis of RGP and sucrose-independent adhesion proteins (SpaP, WapA, Cnm, Cbm) in Parkinson's disease patients. In the PARKIDENT clinical trial, strains were isolated from saliva samples of Parkinson's patients at baseline and during a follow-up visit. Strains were preanalyzed by multiplex PCR for serotype and collagen-binding proteins, followed by high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis using RAST\u00ae and BLAST\u00ae. Phylogenetic analyses and protein modeling were also conducted. Of 40 patients in the Parkident clinical trial, only 24 had Streptococcus mutans strains isolable from salivary swabs. Serotyping revealed that over 80% of the 44 strains isolated were serotype c, in line with prevalence data in the literature. Furthermore, only SpaP types A and B were identified in the strains. The low variability observed for the WapA protein underlines its functional importance. Finally, the cbm gene was not found in any strain, and only 5 strains possessed the cnm gene, all of them serotype c. The study of these 44 Streptococcus mutans strains showed characteristics similar to other populations. Serotype c predominates, with minimal peptide sequence variability in adhesion proteins (SpaP, WapA). Collagen-binding proteins Cnm and Cbm are rare or absent. Further research is essential to better characterize strain distribution in the Parkinson's-affected population due to S. mutans' growing role in extra-oral pathologies.

    "abstract": "Capgras syndrome (CS) is a delusional misidentification phenomenon increasingly reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy Body Dementia (LBD). Aim of the present scoping review was to provide an overview on current evidence on the pharmacological treatment of CS in PD and LBD, identifying knowledge gaps in the literature.\nThe following databases were consulted: PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Database and Web of Science.\nThe search query covered a time period from 1976 until 2022. Fourteen studies on PD (11 single case reports, 3 case series) and five on LBD (all single case reports) met the inclusion criteria. Most PD patients with CS had cognitive decline and visual hallucinations, and were managed by reducing dopaminergic therapy and prescribing neuroleptics (quetiapine, clozapine or pimavanserin), which often resulted in improvement. Neuroleptics have also been used in LBD, but with variable efficacy.\nAlthough neuroleptics and dopaminergic dose adjustments appear to be beneficial for CS in PD and LBD, robust evidence is lacking. Future prospective studies are essential to establish evidence-based guidelines for this challenging syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), yet therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial function remain limited. Exercise has shown neuroprotective benefits in PD, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate how exercise affects MPTP-induced excessive apoptosis, mitochondrial fission, and mitochondrial function in PD mice, with a focus on the Irisin/AMPK/SIRT1 pathway. Thirty-two male C57BL/6\u00a0J mice, aged 7-8\u00a0weeks, were randomly assigned to control (n\u2009=\u20098) and experimental groups (n\u2009=\u200924). Mice in the experimental groups were administered intraperitoneal injections of MPTP to induce the PD model. Subsequently, the experimental mice were divided into three groups (8 mice in each group):\u00a0the sedentary group (PD), the group subjected to 10\u00a0weeks of treadmill exercise (PDEX), and the group receiving both treadmill exercise and Irisin antagonist injections (EXRG). Upon completion of the 10-week intervention, behavioral assessments were performed. Following this, the mice were euthanized to collect brain samples and subjected to immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, ELISA, citrate synthase assay, and Western blot analyses. MPTP-treated mice exhibited significant motor dysfunction and dopaminergic neuron loss in the nigrostriatal regions, which were alleviated after a 10-week exercise intervention. Exercise significantly reduced MPTP-induced neuronal apoptosis, as evidenced by decreased cellular debris and abnormal nuclear morphology, increased Bcl-2 protein levels, and decreased BAX expression. Furthermore, exercise mitigated abnormal mitochondrial fission in PD mice and improved mitochondrial function-related markers. This was reflected by reduced immunohistochemical signals and protein expression levels of Drp1, Fis1, and MFF, as well as increased citrate synthase activity and elevated expression levels of COX-I and COX-IV. In the substantia nigra of PD mice, the expression levels of Irisin, p-AMPK, and SIRT1 were reduced but were notably elevated after the 10-week exercise intervention. However, chronic treatment with Cyclo RGDyk to block Irisin signaling potentially counteracted the exercise-induced increases in p-AMPK and Sirt1 expression. Moreover, blocking the Irisin signaling pathway reversed the beneficial effects of exercise on mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial function, and neuronal apoptosis. Exercise is an effective approach for alleviating PD pathology by reducing excessive mitochondrial fission, dysregulated mitochondrial respiration and metabolism, and neuronal loss. The neuroprotective effects of exercise are achieved, in part, by regulating the Irisin/AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway. This study underscores the potential of targeting Irisin signaling as a therapeutic strategy of exercise to enhance mitochondrial function and promote neuronal survival in PD.",

    "abstract": "Several factors have been shown to modify the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD), including commonly prescribed medications. However, there is little data describing their correlation with age at onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of treatment with anti-hypertensives, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), statins, as well as smoking and family history of PD with AAO in a large clinical cohort.\nA retrospective review of 1201 initial encounters collected information on known risk-modulating factors for PD, including smoking status and family history, anti-hypertensives, statins, NSAIDs, anti-diabetic medications, and beta-agonists. In addition to general exposure, we determined whether medications of interest were started before or after onset of symptoms. Mean AAO was calculated for each set of variables. T-test and multiple regression analyses were used to evaluate association with AAO.\nExposure to all studied medications showed a strong correlation with older PD AAO, except for smoking and family history, which correlated with younger AAO. Multiple regression analysis identified exposure to adrenergic blockers (AB) (\u03b2\u2009=\u20095.7), statins (\u03b2\u2009=\u20095.6), and NSAIDs (\u03b2\u2009=\u20094.1) as the strongest independent predictors of older PD AAO (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Patients who were started on AB prior to onset of PD symptoms showed the largest average delay of PD AAO (at 72.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.1\u00a0years), almost 10\u00a0years later as compared with those not on AB (62.7\u2009\u00b1\u200910.7\u00a0years) or those who started taking AB after onset of symptoms (63.0\u2009\u00b1\u200910.6\u00a0years).\nMultiple common medications are associated with a considerable delay of PD onset.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to review clinical trials investigating dietary or nutritional interventions for Parkinson's Disease (PD) and identify potential research gaps. A PubMed search yielded 3378 results, and after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 38 studies were selected. Of these, 13 focused on interventions with potential neuroprotective effects against PD, 18 examined symptom improvement, and 7 explored their relationship to antiparkinsonian medication. Most studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and demonstrated promising results. However, they were often limited by small sample sizes and short durations. Large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs are necessary to further investigate the effects of dietary and nutritional interventions in PD. Other nutrients with promising results in preclinical research should be further evaluated in clinical trials. Moreover, research should prioritize dietary pattern interventions, like the Mediterranean and ketogenic diets, while closely monitoring patient adherence to these approaches. Lastly, future research should further explore the role of gut microbiota and its potential pathogenic involvement in PD.",

According to this indicator, patients did not reach the preoperative level. During the inclusion period in this group, the improvement was 40%, the indicator remained stable for 3 years, however, due to the progression of the disease, by the 15\nDBS STN changes the clinical pathomorphosis of Parkinson's disease, leading to less severity of parkinsonian symptoms and greater survival of this group of patients.\n\u0418\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0444\u043e\u0437 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f) \u043d\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u0443\u0431\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0434\u0440\u0430 (DBS STN).\n\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430 15-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430 401 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441 \u0411\u041f; 1-\u044e \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0443 (\nDBS STN \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0442\u043e\u043c\u044b \u0443 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0411\u041f \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f: \u043d\u0430 57,3% \u043a 1-\u043c\u0443 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443, \u043d\u0430 23,7% \u043a 15-\u043c\u0443 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u041f\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044e \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0433\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f. \u0412 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0435 \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e 40%, \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 3 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0438 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a 15-\u043c\u0443 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0443\u0445\u0443\u0434\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e 20,9%. \u0412\u043e 2-\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0443\u0445\u0443\u0434\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0439 \u043a 15-\u043c\u0443 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f: \u043d\u0430 67,5% \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043d\u0430 64,5% \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f (\nDBS STN \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0444\u043e\u0437 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043a \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430 \u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438.",

We also looked through the references in the articles. The improvement of overall cognition in patients with Parkinson's disease with tDCS was the primary outcome indicator. The improvement of executive function, memory, attention, language, quality of life, and depression with tDCS were the secondary outcome indicators. Two researchers extracted data independently, with a third researcher mediating in the event of a dispute. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the quality of the included literature.\nA total of 23 articles encompassing 874 subjects were included. tDCS has shown significant efficacy on overall cognition (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.57 to 0.89, I\ntDCS demonstrated substantial efficacy in enhancing overall cognition in patients with PD. The efficacy of tDCS was obvious in executive function, language, and depressive mood.

    "abstract": "Cognitive decline is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliance on neuropsychological testing alone can lead to delayed identification, and an objective and comprehensive approach is needed in clinical practice. We assessed brain functional connectivity during PD-MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and PD-NC (normal cognition) patients, and healthy controls (HC) completing the Stroop color-word test (SCWT) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and explored the predictive value of combining relevant brain function and behavioral information for general cognitive decline in PD.\nNineteen patients with PD-MCI, 21 with PD-NC and 33 age-matched HC were recruited. Group differences in executive performance and prefrontal functional connectivity were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to measure the value of combining brain functional connectivity with executive and motor function in predicting PD-MCI.\nDuring the color-word incongruent test, PD-MCI patients had significantly lower correct rate than HC and PD-NC patients. Meanwhile, PD-MCI patients exhibited significantly increased regional strength of the left and right prefrontal cortex (RS\nWe proposed a signature combining brain functional connectivity with executive and motor function for general cognitive decline in PD, which could provide new insights into early detection and intervention of this problem.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to explore the relationship between retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and cognition in Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients without visual symptoms or diagnosis of dementia.\nGroups of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and healthy controls were compared ophthalmologically using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and cognitively through neuropsychological tests.\nThe findings highlighted a pronounced RNFL thinning, especially in the right nasal inferior quadrant of IPD patients compared to the control group. Almost half (47%) of the subjects in the IPD group exhibited issues in one or multiple subcomponents of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R). At the same time, the study suggested that effects in the visuospatial domain may be associated with disease severity in IPD patients. However, the investigation could not establish a direct association between the severity or duration of the disease and OCT measurements. A correlation was observed between certain ACE-R scores and some RNFL quadrants.\nIn conclusion, the inception phases of IPD are characterized by discernable visual pathologies and cognitive anomalies. The thinning of the RNFL, which can be identified through OCT, might serve as a pivotal tool for tracking the early progression of IPD and formulating intervention strategies. That being said, more comprehensive studies are essential to wholly understand OCT's role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of IPD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with a distinct loss of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. Despite the multiplicity in etiology, alterations that disrupt neuronal integrity can be traced back to defects in fundamental processes that typically run under mitochondrial inputs. Evidence indicates that mitochondrial activities are hierarchically integrated with the energetic performance of these organelles, so that an interesting perspective holds that interventions aimed at improving mitochondrial bioenergetics can potentially mitigate the severity of PD phenotype expression. In this mechanistic framework, approaches that facilitate the mitochondrial anaplerotic use of glutamate (Glut) might counteract the detrimental shift from Glut metabolism, which is typically altered in PD, to excessive Glut transmission that feeds excitotoxicity and the neurodegenerative spiral. In this study, we investigated whether the enhancement of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity, by using the GDH activator 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), has neuroprotective potential against PD injury. In both retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and primary rat mesencephalic neurons challenged with \u03b1-synuclein plus rotenone to mimic PD, BCH-dependent GDH activation significantly ameliorated cell viability, improved mitochondrial ATP synthesis and lessened to control levels the cellular redox burden. Strikingly, we collected evidence for the existence of a functional axis connecting GDH activity to a specific intracellular pool of the Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs), namely the EAAT3. Overall, our results reveal a novel and non-redundant role of EAAT3 for GDH-dependent protection against PD injury, which may inspire new pharmacological approaches against PD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Falling is one of the possible complications of Parkinson's disease (PD). Also, Parkinson's patients become disabled due to the gradual progression of the disease; however, acceptance of the disability (AOD) can help in managing the illness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a\u00a0nurse-led intervention on the prevention of falls and AOD in patients with PD.\nIn this study 240 patients over 60\u00a0years of age were selected from specialized clinics and randomly divided into 2\u00a0experimental and control groups. Both groups received their usual care; however, the experimental group also received a\u00a0separate nurse-led intervention twice a\u00a0month for 6\u00a0months. The number of falls and the AOD were measured (using a\u00a0modified Chinese version of the AOD scale).\nDuring the 6\u2011month follow-up, falls in the control group were more than the experimental group (165 vs.\u00a092 falls). The AOD of the experimental group had increased significantly in the postintervention period and the 6\u2011month follow-up compared to the preintervention (from 60.4\u202f\u00b1\u200919.25 preintervention to 65.125\u202f\u00b1\u200918.52 postintervention and 65.433\u202f\u00b1\u200918.30 in follow-up, p\u202f<\u20090.05). Also, the AOD of the experimental group was significantly higher than the control group in the two time periods of postintervention and follow-up (postintervention: 65.125\u202f\u00b1\u200918.52 in experimental group and 58.78\u202f\u00b1\u200919.32 in control group; follow up: 65.433\u202f\u00b1\u200918.30 in experimental group and 57.52\u202f\u00b1\u200918.97 in control group, p\u202f<\u20090.05).\nThe nurse-led intervention can be an effective noninvasive method to reduce the number of falls and increase the AOD in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium species that contaminates various food and feed products, presenting potential risks to human health. While OTA is well-known for its nephrotoxic effects, emerging evidence highlights its neurotoxic potential. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with both genetic and environmental aetiologies. Emerging lines of investigation have focused their research on the role of environmental toxins, including mycotoxins, in PD pathogenesis. However, the specific involvement of OTA in PD-related pathways still needs to be unravelled. This systematic review compiles and evaluates OTA neurotoxicity studies according to the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) for PD, established by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The AOP framework outlines a series of key event (KEs) beginning with mitochondrial Complex I (CI) inhibition and progressing through mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired proteostasis, dopaminergic neuron degeneration, neuroinflammation, and resulting in parkinsonian motor deficits. In this systematic review, a comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, to identify studies evaluating OTA neurotoxic effects. Using a search strategy of 19 terms and following a two-phased study selection, 30 relevant studies were retrieved, of which 16 dealt with in vitro adult neurotoxicity (ANT), 13 focused on in vivo ANT, and 1 gave both in vitro and in vivo approaches. Authors agree that in vitro and in vivo exposure to OTA causes mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired proteostasis, degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, and neuroinflammation. However, a notable absence of research\u00a0remains on the molecular initiating event (MIE), binding to CI, and on\u00a0KE1, inhibition of CI. This review identifies critical research gaps and highlights the need for further mechanistic studies on the impact of OTA on neurodegenerative pathways, particularly its binding and inhibition of CI, as well as mechanisms related to KE3: impaired proteostasis. Addressing these gaps may provide valuable insights into OTA neurotoxic potential and its relevance in PD-like neurodegeneration.",

Population ageing (89%) was predicted to be the primary contributor to the growth in cases from 2021 to 2050, followed by population growth (20%) and changes in prevalence (3%). The prevalence of Parkinson's disease was forecasted to be 267 (230 to 320) cases per 100\u2009000 in 2050, indicating a significant increase of 76% (56% to 125%) from 2021, whereas the age standardised prevalence was predicted to be 216 (168 to 281) per 100\u2009000, with an increase of 55% (50% to 60%) from 2021. Countries in the middle fifth of Socio-demographic Index were projected to have the highest percentage increase in the all age prevalence (144%, 87% to 183%) and age standardised prevalence (91%, 82% to 101%) of Parkinson's disease between 2021 and 2050. Among Global Burden of Disease regions, East Asia (10.9 (9.0 to 13.3) million) was projected to have the highest number of Parkinson's disease cases in 2050, with western Sub-Saharan Africa (292%, 266% to 362%) experiencing the most significant increase from 2021. The \u226580 years age group was projected to have the greatest increase in the number of Parkinson's disease cases (196%, 143% to 235%) from 2021 to 2050. The male-to-female ratios of age standardised prevalence of Parkinson's disease were projected to increase from 1.46 in 2021 to 1.64 in 2050 globally.\nBy 2050 Parkinson's disease will have become a greater public health challenge for patients, their families, care givers, communities, and society. The upward trend is expected to be more pronounced among countries with middle Socio-demographic Index, in the Global Burden of Disease East Asia region, and among men. This projection could serve as an aid in promoting health research, informing policy decisions, and allocating resources.",

    "abstract": "Disordered airway protection, including both disordered swallowing (dysphagia) and disordered cough (dystussia), is highly prevalent among persons with Parkinson's disease (pwPD). A comprehensive understanding of the perspectives of pwPD as it relates to airway protection is currently lacking and is necessary to provide relevant, person-centered care. Therefore, this study used a parallel-convergent mixed methods design to quantitatively and qualitatively investigate pwPD's perspectives on airway protection.\nThirteen pwPD were consecutively recruited from a cough training trial. Quantitative data (obtained from the Swallowing Quality of Life questionnaire [SWAL-QOL] and the modified Canadian Occupational Performance Measure [mCOPM]) and qualitative data (obtained from semistructured interviews) were integrated to define participant knowledge, perceived importance, perceived performance, and psychosocial implications of airway protective deficits.\nAll participants reported basic knowledge about airway protection, which centered around four themes-physiology, the interconnectedness between bulbar functions, danger, and impaired airway protection as a consequence of PD. All participants believed that airway protection was important (median mCOPM score = 10), with three primary themes related to importance-survival, anticipated future decline, and maintaining oral intake. We identified a split between participants who perceived themselves to have \"a swallowing problem\" and those who did not, with three themes relating to perceived impairment-use of eating strategies, unpredictable and inconsistent symptom experience, and vigilance required to mitigate symptoms. Psychosocial ramifications centered on three key themes that aligned with three SWAL-QOL domains-overall burden, fear of future decline, and social embarrassment.\nThe integration of quantitative and qualitative data in this study highlights the importance of considering unique patient perspectives to develop personalized and relevant management plans for each unique pwPD that integrate objective and clinical findings with patient priorities and needs.\nhttps://doi.org/10.23641/asha.28489280.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are frequent and particularly distressing neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) which are related to impaired behavioural inhibition. Multiple PET imaging studies indicate that striatal dopaminergic abnormalities contribute to hyperdopaminergic functioning in PD patients with ICD (PDICD+) and to the dysregulation of the limbic fronto-striatal networks which are critical for reward-related decision impulsivity. However, the serotonergic system is central to response inhibition and plays a critical role in neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD, but its role remains undetermined in PDICD. We hypothesized that PDICD+ patients exhibit serotonergic dysfunction within the cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic circuits involved in the inhibitory control of behaviour and decided to investigate the pre- and post-synaptic serotonergic innervation using two highly-specific PET tracers for the serotonin transporter (SERT) using [11C]DASB and the 5-HT2A receptor using [18F]altanserin. In this prospective, case-control, double-tracer PET study, we recruited 15 PDICD+ patients, 15 PDICD- patients and 15 healthy controls, matched for age and sex, and compared the availability of [11C]DASB and [18F]altanserin using permutation-based analysis. PDICD+ patients had one (n=9) or multiple ICDs (n=6), consisting in hypersexuality (n=8), compulsive eating (n=6), compulsive shopping (n=5) and pathological gambling (n=4) and were characterized by greater choice impulsivity (impaired delay discounting for monetary rewards) and greater urgency with more severe depressive and anxious symptoms. We demonstrate that PDICD+ patients had greater [11C]DASB binding in the posterior putamen and pallidum in comparison to PDICD- patients, corresponding to relatively preserved presynaptic SERT availability within the subcortical sensorimotor network involved in response inhibition. In addition, cortical [18F]altanserin binding was greater in PDICD+ patients in the bilateral supplementary motor area, precentral gyrus and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, involving the sensorimotor and associative networks which regulate behavioural inhibition. Furthermore, we show that pre- and post-synaptic serotonergic dysfunction subserving action versus decision impulsivity in PD patients specifically followed the distinctive functional organization of the sensorimotor and associative fronto-striatal networks. Altogether, we demonstrate that serotonergic dysfunction related to ICDs in PD specifically involve the sensorimotor and associative cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic circuits involved in inhibitory control. Thus, serotonergic dysfunction contributes to the mechanisms related to the vulnerability and development of ICDs in PD patients, beyond the known dopaminergic abnormalities in the limbic fronto-striatal circuit.",

    "abstract": "Atypical wild-type superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein misfolding and deposition occurs specifically within the degenerating substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in Parkinson disease. Mechanisms driving the formation of this pathology and relationship with SNc dopamine neuron health are yet to be fully understood. We applied proteomic mass spectrometry and synchrotron-based biometal quantification to post-mortem brain tissues from the SNc of Parkinson disease patients and age-matched controls to uncover key factors underlying the formation of wild-type SOD1 pathology in this disorder. We also engineered two of these factors -\u00a0brain copper deficiency and upregulated SOD1 protein levels\u00a0- into a novel mouse strain, termed the SOCK mouse, to verify their involvement in the development of Parkinson-like wild-type SOD1 pathology and their impact on dopamine neuron health. Soluble SOD1 protein in the degenerating Parkinson disease SNc exhibited altered post-translational modifications, which may underlie changes to the enzymatic activity and aggregation of the protein in this region. These include decreased copper binding, dysregulation of physiological glycosylation, and atypical oxidation and glycation of key SOD1 amino acid residues. We demonstrated that the biochemical profile introduced in SOCK mice promotes the same post-translational modifications and the development of Parkinson-like wild-type SOD1 pathology in the midbrain and cortex. This pathology accumulates progressively with age and is accompanied by nigrostriatal degeneration and dysfunction, which occur in the absence of \u03b1-synuclein deposition. These mice do not exhibit weight loss nor spinal cord motor neuron degeneration, distinguishing them from transgenic mutant SOD1 mouse models. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that mismetallation and altered post-translational modifications precipitates wild-type SOD1 misfolding, dysfunction, and deposition in the Parkinson disease brain, which may contribute to SNc dopamine neuron degeneration. Our data position this pathology as a novel drug target for this disorder, with a particular focus on therapies capable of correcting alterations to SOD1 post-translational modifications.",

    "abstract": "Despite being recognised for a long time as a non-motor characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD), pain is still a symptom that is underdiagnosed and undertreated. This study aimed to assess the relationship between PD patients' pain and sleep disturbances, depression, cognitive functions, fatigue and quality of life.\nA total of 100 patients with primary PD were recruited for this study. Their demographic and clinical features, including age, gender distribution, educational level, smoking, lateralization and duration of PD, and comorbid diseases were recorded. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with and without pain. The scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), Fatigue Severity Scale, Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale were compared between the two groups.\nStatistical analyses regarding questionnaires revealed higher scores in various domains for PD patients with pain, although significance was not found in all measures (p > 0.05). However, PDQ-39 test scores were significantly higher in PD patients with pain compared to those without pain (p = 0.036). Patients with pain presented significantly higher scores than those without pain for all domains of the UPDRS and Hoehn-Yahr Scale (p < 0.05).

    "abstract": "The ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus (Vim) is the preferred target in magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) for tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (TdPD), but some patients with TdPD have persistent tremor after Vim thalamotomy. Basal ganglia outflow through the ventralis oralis anterior and posterior (Voa/p) may be responsible. We present 6 cases with dual Vim and Voa/p MRgFUS thalamotomies for TdPD resistant to Vim treatment.\nSix patients with TdPD underwent Vim MRgFUS thalamotomy with persistent intraprocedural tremors (resting 5 patients and/or action tremors 1 patient), who then underwent Voa/p thalamotomy during the same procedure. Demographic and treatment information was collected. Tremor was evaluated using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST)-A and CRST-B.\nSix patients were included in the study. The mean age was 71.5 years (SD = 2.7), 5 were male (83.3%), 4 had right-sided treatments (66.7%), and 1 had a repeat treatment (16.7%). The mean follow-up was 11 months (range 6-18 months). Mean Vim lesion coordinates from the posterior commissure were X = 13.9 mm, Y = 7.5 mm, and Z = 2 mm. Voa/p were targeted by moving approximately 3 to 5 mm anterior and 3 mm medial to the initial Vim lesion. Mean Voa/p lesion coordinates were X = 11.7 mm, Y = 11.3 mm, and Z = 2.3 mm. Five patients with resting tremor had improved postural/action tremor after Vim thalamotomy (mean CRST-B 8.8 improved to 0.4) but unsatisfactory control of resting tremor. After Voa/p thalamotomy, resting tremor improved in all 5 patients (mean CRST-A hand score 3.6 improved to 0.0). For the patient without resting tremor, postural/action tremor improved after Voa/p thalamotomy (CRST 3 improved to 1). All improvements were sustained at last follow-up except for 1 patient, who regressed to preoperative postural/action and resting tremor by 6 months. At last follow-up, 2 patients reported speech (33.3%) and 3 patients reported balance/gait (50%) changes.\nPatients with TdPD with tremor refractory to Vim MRgFUS thalamotomy may benefit from a secondary lesion in Voa/p although incidence of adverse effects may be increased.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from previous research demonstrates a relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and Parkinson's disease (PD). T2DM is associated with chronic glucose dysregulation, as an etiological factor. It inhibits neuronal function through disrupted insulin signaling and oxidative stress, which ultimately lead to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Interactions between T2DM and PD were analyzed by gene expression, coexpression, and gene set enrichment via NCBI and STRING databases following pathways like KEGG and Reactome. The study identified nine key gene interactions through published literature on different databases and search engines that are involved in the progression of these chronic diseases. Furthermore, some genetic and nongenetic risk factors, gene mutations and environmental factors, are also involved in the progression of T2DM and PD. This review highlights the limitations of currently available drug treatments for these diseases and examines modern therapeutic approaches to address neurodegenerative and metabolic abnormalities. We critically assess the current experimental methodologies aimed at unraveling the pathophysiological mechanisms linking PD and T2DM while addressing the key challenges impeding a comprehensive understanding of the concurrent emergence of these debilitating age-related conditions.",

However, the long-term trajectory of Quality of Life (QoL) following STN-DBS remains underexplored.\nWe aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess QoL trends up to five years after STN-DBS.\nWe systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases from inception to August 2024 for studies involving PD patients treated with bilateral STN-DBS, evaluating QoL using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ), with a minimum follow-up of 12\u2009months post-surgery. Continuous outcomes were pooled using standardized mean differences (SMD), and statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.3.2.\nOut of 4106 screened articles, 42 studies with a total of 2767 patients were included in the meta-analysis. QoL improvements were observed up to 36\u2009months post-surgery (SMD 0.83; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.37), followed by a decline to pre-operative levels at 60\u2009months (SMD -0.06; 95% CI -0.26 to 0.15). Subdomain analysis at 60\u2009months revealed significant deterioration in cognitive function and communication. Meta-regression indicated that QoL improvements were independent of clinical and sociodemographic factors such as age, sex, and disease duration; however, there was a correlation with mean baseline PDQ (P\u2009=\u20090.01).\nThis meta-analysis provides long-term QoL trends following STN-DBS, highlighting a further need to explore the factors driving the decline in QoL and develop strategies to mitigate this deterioration.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the bilateral subthalamic nuclei (STN) or globus pallidus internus (GPi) for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia is known for its efficacy despite potential complications. Although acute complications such as intracranial hemorrhage and infections are documented, delayed occurrences like normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) post-DBS has not been reported so far.\nWe present a case series of seven PD patients (from 974) who developed NPH, an average of 10.9\u2009+\u20093.1\u2009years after DBS (6 STN, 1 GPi) with symptoms of cognitive decline and gait disturbances. Imaging confirmed hydrocephalus meeting NPH criteria (Radscale >4), which was further confirmed by the cerebrospinal fluid tap trial. Treatment with ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement showed significant symptom improvement.\nRecognizing NPH in PD patients even after DBS is crucial for early intervention and improved outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Laterality of motor deficits is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is strongly correlated with disease progression. The cerebellum is an important node in the motor-related network in PD. However, the role of the cerebellum in PD lateralization remains unclear. This study enrolled 48 left-dominant-affected PD patients (LPD), 60 right-dominant-affected PD patients (RPD) and 92 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We utilized dynamic functional connectivity and co-activation pattern analysis to investigate dynamic alterations of the cerebellum between PD patients and HCs by resting-state fMRI. Pearson partial correlation was used to measure brain-clinical correlations. We revealed two states and five co-activation patterns during the scans. Compared to HCs and RPD, LPD patients more frequently displayed State II and persisted in this state for a more extended period. The mean dwell time (MDT) in State II rose from HCs to RPD and to LPD. The MDT in State II was positively correlated with sleep disturbance in LPD patients. Regarding co-activation patterns (CAPs), LPD and RPD patients were less likely to exhibit CAP2. LPD patients were less likely to demonstrate CAP1 compared to HCs. The CAP1 metrics were positively associated with motor deficits in LPD patients. These results revealed the dynamic alterations of the cerebellum in different dominant-affected PD patients, which were related to motor deficits and sleep disturbances in PD patients. Our findings suggest that the dynamic cerebellar features may be significant factors in the lateralization of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. Iron metabolism abnormalities have been reported in PD patients and may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Our study aimed to explore key genes associated with iron metabolism in PD patients.\nThree datasets and iron metabolism-related genes (IMRGs) were collected from the public database, and the datasets were merged into a combined dataset. PD-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained and intersected with IMRGs to acquire iron metabolism-related DEGs (IMRDEGs). Subsequently, the IMRDEGs were subjected to functional enrichment and ROC analyses. Finally, key genes were identified, followed by the construction and evaluation of a risk score model, drug prediction, and RT-qPCR analysis.\nA total of 24 IMRDEGs were obtained. The AUC values of the 24 IMRDEGs ranged from 0.599 to 0.781. After logistic regression and the SVM analyses, a total of 10 key genes were identified, followed by the construction of the risk score model. The AUC value of the risk score model was 0.953, demonstrating good diagnostic value. The calibration curve and decision curve analysis showed that the risk score model has good predictive performance and clinical benefit for PD patients. Additionally, a total of 49 drugs were predicted.\nA total of 10 key genes were identified as potential biomarkers, and the risk score model was constructed for PD patients, exhibiting good diagnostic. This study may provide potential biomarkers for PD patients, promoting an understanding of the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with increasing global prevalence. This study investigated the association between the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 (LE8) and PD prevalence using a large, nationally representative database.\nWe analyzed data from 18,277 participants aged 40\u202fyears and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2018. LE8 scores were calculated based on diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep, body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure. PD cases were identified through self-reported anti-PD medication use. Multivariate logistic regression models were employed to examine the association between LE8 and PD prevalence, adjusting for various demographic and clinical factors. In addition, we performed restricted cubic splines (RCS), subgroup analyses, and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to verify the robustness of the study results.\nThe prevalence of PD was 1.3% in the study population. After full adjustment, individuals with moderate (50-79) and high (80-100) LE8 scores showed lower odds of PD compared to those with low (0-49) scores (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.97 and OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17-1.04, respectively; \nOur findings suggest a significant inverse association between Life's Essential 8 (LE8) and PD prevalence, with dietary factors and glycemic health emerging as the most influential components.",

    "abstract": "Device-assisted therapies for Parkinson disease include apomorphine continuous subcutaneous infusion, levodopa continuous intestinal gel infusion, levodopa continuous subcutaneous infusion and deep brain stimulation. These therapies have a role in managing motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in people with advanced Parkinson disease when symptoms are inadequately controlled with oral and transdermal treatments. Subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine or levodopa are the least invasive device-assisted therapies. Levodopa intestinal infusion is delivered via a surgically placed intestinal tube. Deep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes into specific target regions of the basal ganglia to modulate brain activity. Selecting an appropriate device-assisted therapy depends on individual factors such as age, comorbidities, symptom severity and patient preferences. Initiation and management require neurologist and multidisciplinary involvement, typically in a specialist movement disorder centre. Primary care clinicians play a crucial role in ongoing support and management for people using these therapies, including monitoring and managing adverse effects and communicating with movement disorder services.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms can severely affect the quality of life of Parkinson's disease-afflicted patients, with the most common ones being pain, sleep impairments, and neuropsychiatric manifestations. In advanced cases, complex fluctuations of motor and non-motor symptoms can occur despite optimal medication. Research on deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus suggests that it may provide benefits for treating non-motor symptoms in addition to improving motor symptoms. With recent advancements in deep brain stimulation technology, simultaneous recording of local field potentials and delivery of therapeutic stimulation is possible. This opens new possibilities for better understanding the pathophysiology of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease and for identifying potential electrophysiological biomarkers that accurately represent these symptoms. Specifically, this review aims to highlight potential local field potential biomarkers of non-motor symptoms in the subthalamic nucleus. The main findings indicate that activities in the beta frequency band are associated with nociception and sleep impairments such as insomnia and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. Additionally, activities in the theta and alpha frequency bands seem to reflect neurocognitive manifestations, including depression and impulse control disorders. A better understanding of these biomarkers could improve the clinical management of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. They hold promise for adjusting deep brain stimulation parameters in open-loop settings and might eventually be applied in closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems, though their true impact remains uncertain.",

    "abstract": "Allied health interventions have been shown to improve impairments and quality of life in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). However, globally allied health is underutilised, and referrals tend to be reactive and occur in moderate to advanced disease. Currently little is known about the referral patterns of PwPD to allied health in Australia.\nThis study examined the allied health referral patterns of neurologists, general practice physicians (GP) and Parkinson's disease nurse specialists (PDNS) treating PwPD in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.\nFour neurologists, three GPs and four PDNSs each completed a demographic questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. Interview data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.\nAll clinicians experienced difficulties locating approachable, available, affordable, and appropriate allied health services. Clinicians also perceived that patient ability to interact impacted their involvement in allied health therapies. Referrals were typically made in response to symptom progression. The most common individual disciplines referred to were physiotherapy and/or exercise physiology, followed by speech pathology and occupational therapy. Multidisciplinary teams (MDT) were generally not available, so referrals to MDTs occurred less frequently.\nClearer guidelines regarding when to refer to individual allied health disciplines and to MDTs are needed to facilitate more proactive referrals by clinicians treating PwPD. Establishing an MDT model for PwPD throughout Australia would improve the approachability, availability and appropriateness barriers, and could improve quality of life for PwPD.",

    "abstract": "Neural biomarkers that can classify or predict disease are of broad interest to the neurological and psychiatric communities. Such biomarkers can be informative of disease state or treatment efficacy, even before there are changes in symptoms and/or behavior. This work investigates EEG-estimated functional connectivity (FC) as a Parkinson's Disease (PD) biomarker. Specifically, we investigate FC mediated via neural oscillations and consider such activity during the Simons conflict task. This task yields sensory-motor conflict, and one might expect differences in behavior between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs). In addition to considering spatially focused approaches, such as FC, as a biomarker, we also consider temporal biomarkers, which are more sensitive to ongoing changes in neural activity. We find that FC, estimated from delta (1-4Hz) and theta (4-7Hz) oscillations, yields spatial FC patterns significantly better at distinguishing PD from HC than temporal features or behavior. This study reinforces that FC in spectral bands is informative of differences in brain-wide processes and can serve as a biomarker distinguishing normal brain function from that seen in disease.",

    "abstract": "Dysarthria is a common speech disorder in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The Dysarthria Analyzer software has emerged as a viable tool for automatic speech analysis in PD and quantification of dysarthria severity. However, most studies use the Dysarthria Analyzer with recordings obtained under tightly controlled conditions and high-quality microphones, and the utility of the Dysarthria Analyzer when used with recordings acquired under non-ideal conditions, such as in busy clinical settings, remains unexplored. This study investigates the Dysarthria Analyzer's performance in a setting more akin to a clinical environment using a smartphone. We obtained data from three groups, including healthy controls (HC), PD patients with their deep brain stimulation on (ON-DBS), and PD patients with their DBS off (OFF-DBS). We found a significant decrease in pitch variability and an increase in speech rate for the OFF-DBS group compared to the HC. Furthermore, most of the estimated values for the speech markers fall within the reported values in the literature. Our findings demonstrate that the Dysarthria Analyzer effectively extracts relevant speech markers even when used with recordings obtained under non-ideal conditions, emphasizing its potential for widespread clinical adoption.Clinical Relevance- Our findings demonstrate the potential of using smartphone recordings obtained in clinical environments for automatic objective speech analysis. These findings are relevant for developing a clinical tool that can be widely accessible and easily implemented during routine clinical visits of PD to improve the assessment of dysarthria in PD.",

    "abstract": "Wearable technologies have been demonstrated to have value in the objective assessment of Parkinson's disease. However, certain symptoms such as freezing of gait are challenging to monitor using current approaches. Data augmentation, wherein synthetic or simulated data is added to real world training sets to increase their size and diversity, has emerged as an approach to bolster the accuracy of machine learning models in other healthcare domains such as medical imaging. In this paper, we evaluate the use of generative adversarial networks to create synthetic accelerometry data representing both typical and freezing gait patterns. Our preliminary results suggest that these synthetic datasets can mimic realistic movement patterns of individuals with Parkinson's disease. In the future, we will assess the impact that integrating these synthetic data into training sets has on the accuracy of freezing of gait detection algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Dysarthria is a very common motor speech symptom in Parkinson's disease impairing normal communications of patients. Detection of dysarthria could assist clinical diagnosis and intervention of Parkinson's disease, provide monitoring approach for treatment-related side effects, and lead to effective speech therapy to prevent further communication and social deficits. Applying machine learning techniques to speech analysis for patients offers more resource-efficient, accessible and objective tools for screening and assessment of dysarthria. In this study, we constructed a multi-task speech dataset recorded from 600 participants with high data diversity to facilitate the development of detection models. We established a remote data acquisition and end-to-end prediction pipeline with deep representation learning, compared the performance with different feature-based learning and classification methods, and achieved a superior accuracy of over 90%. Different affecting factors were analyzed for model performance. Our proposed framework demonstrates the potential of developing and deploying an automated self-monitoring approach of dysarthria for patients with Parkinson's disease, which could benefit a large-scale population and their disease managements.",

    "abstract": "Postural control during quiet stance is characterized by the center of pressure (CoP) time series. Recently, we showed that CoP data from healthy young (HY) and elderly (HE) individuals, and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can be well fitted by the intermittent control model with different parameter values representing the degree of intermittency in the feedback control. We performed a model-based classification (MBC) to show that the subjects could be classified into intermittent control (INT) group including all HYs, active (CONT) and passive continuous control (STIFF) groups including HE and PD. Here, we showed first that the sum of gait-posture-related UPDRS scores for the CONT and STIFF was significantly higher than that for the INT, indicating that the MBC is a good biomarker for assessing the balance impairment in PD. We then quantified CoP data from each individual using a variety of sway metrics, and explored metrics that have a classification capability equivalent to the MBC. Multiple metrics were identified as such metrics, suggesting that the MBC-based assessment can be achieved using those metrics without performing the computationally heavy model fitting.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a non-motor symptom inherent to Parkinson's disease (PD). As an early manifestation of PD, PD-related depression is hard to diagnose, thereby contributing to morbidity. Recent endeavors have employed deep learning networks to assist in the diagnosis of PD and depression, achieving commendable levels of accuracy. However, little attention has been directed toward PD-related depression, and the decision process of the network lacks transparency and explainability. What has been learned by the network and whether pathological mechanisms contribute to the classifier's result remain mysterious. In this study, we propose an explainable functional connectivity framework to recognize depression in PD. Specifically, the diagnosis feature extraction module learns high-dimensional information from functional connectivity features, followed by the diagnosis module making decisions. Furthermore, the explainable module provides interpretation and validation for the decisions on functional connectivity. Evaluation of the dataset demonstrates superb subject-wise predictive performance and provides visual evidence of the underlying pathology in EEG. The interpretation results bridge the gap between pathophysiological mechanisms and computer-aided diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Smartwatches play an increasingly vital role in health monitoring, offering practical solutions for patients to manage their conditions in daily life. This is particularly significant for Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, as tremors, a notable symptom, significantly impact their quality of life. Our research addresses unanswered questions about the optimal configurations for these devices, considering factors such as the placement of the smartwatch, the type of sensor used (accelerometer vs. gyroscope), and the sampling frequency. Employing a gradient tree-boosting approach, we analyze data from the wrist and ankle sensors of 24 PD subjects engaged in daily living activities. The findings highlight a cost-effective, practical, and resource-friendly configuration: utilizing accelerometer wrist data sampled at 32 Hz demonstrates a robust correlation between the estimations of total tremors (0.82) and rest tremors (0.84) compared to their clinical ground-truth values. This underlines the significant potential of employing smartwatches in a natural environment for clinicians to monitor their patients efficiently, minimizing the necessity for costly, inconvenient in-clinic assessments.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a portable and programmable system, the Virtual Upper Arm Rehabilitation Simulation (VUARS), to address upper limb movement difficulties in Parkinson's Disease (PD). VUARS uses a mixed reality headset (Microsoft HoloLens 2) and a haptic stylus (Geomagic Touch), building on an existing tabletop system. It offers personalized features such as customizable button design, size, and arrangement. Additionally, it provides multimodal feedback capabilities, developed through a thorough calibration process, via synchronized mixed reality button graphics and haptic feedback rendering in the Unity 3D game engine. To evaluate the developed system, a user study was conducted with 22 healthy individuals and 9 PD individuals. The efficacy of the VUARS was validated through both collected quantitative and qualitative data, such as trial and total task completion time, hand motion tracking data, and NASA TLX data. The results indicated that haptic feedback and personalized features improved task completion times and user experience, with 67% of the target demographic (PD individuals) showing statistical differences. However, further research is needed before complete adoption of VUARS in clinical settings due to a lack of statistically significant differences between traditional and VUARS systems currently.",

    "abstract": "Gait can be significantly impaired by neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Gait impairments can be quantified by using instrumented gait analysis techniques, but these instrumented techniques are expensive and suffer from limited accessibility in clinical practice. This paper introduces a method utilizing machine learning algorithms for video-based clinical gait analysis of frontal plane videos recorded with readily available devices. Our approach leverages open-source body pose (Google's MediaPipe) and metric depth (ZoeDepth) estimators to calculate spatiotemporal parameters (STP) of gait from videos and demonstrated high agreement and correlation with traditional marker-based motion capture (MoCap). We applied our proposed methodology to gait videos of healthy controls and people with PD (PWP). Our results agree with those obtained with high-end instrumental gait analysis techniques and support the detection of PD from gait videos.Clinical Relevance- This study presents an innovative, user-friendly, and cost-effective solution for clinical gait analysis. It will enable automated gait analysis via videos in gait-impaired individuals such as PWP, paving the way for telemedicine evaluation for movement decline. The future impact is early detection, effective remote monitoring, and new treatments for increased fall risk in an already mobility-challenged population.",

However, the effects of motor and cognitive task complexity on early PD identification have not been systematically investigated. 25 idiopathic early PD patients and 14 age-matched healthy elders were recruited and required to perform a complex motor task with/ without three different cognitive tasks. Complex task interference features were respectively calculated based on gait spatiotemporal parameters and joint kinematics. The effects of task complexity and group on CTIs were firstly investigated using a repeated measures analysis of variance. A support vector machine-based PD classifiers were built based on distinguished CTI features. The results demonstrated that the motor task complexity had a more significant effect on gait performance which contributed to significantly improved accuracy in PD classification. The best classification was achieved at turns with backward recall task (accuracy: 97.7%; precision: 98.9%; recall: 97.7%). The study proved the great potential application of a turning-based dual-task test paradigm in clinic for identifying early-stage PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is associated with the progressive death of dopaminergic neurons producing motor disorders at advanced stages. Today, there is no definitive biomarker to early detect and diagnose the disease (80% of the dopaminergic neurons are lost at first diagnosis). Recently, neuroimages have allowed to discover radiological markers associated with structural alterations from routine T1-MRI, and even measure dopamine activations in specialized SPECT sequences. Nonetheless, SPECT sequences are highly specialized, with low availability in clinical centers, and the respective analysis and quantification remain subjective and poorly explored. This work introduces a self-supervised deep representation able to capture dopaminergic levels from an MRI-to-SPECT transformation, learning an embedding representation with the capability to classify between Parkinson's and control subjects. From a retrospective study with a set of 73 Parkinson's and 73 control patients, the proposed approach achieved a notable discrimination of 79% in the precision metric.Clinical relevance- A self-supervised representation that under a translation MRI-to-SPECT task, can code dopaminergic levels to discriminate between control and Parkinson's subjects.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates usability aspects of a mobile application aimed at monitoring symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Thirty PD patients collected data through mobile-based questionnaires and activity tasks aimed at measuring motor and non-motor symptoms for a duration of two months. We report the results about usability conducted within this study. A combination of methods consisting of the uMARS questionnaire and interviews with PD patients inform the usability aspects of the mobile application. Results indicate that the app is overall received well and is usable (median uMARS score=4). Interviews reveal usability issues related to the size of textual instructions and buttons, and to the context of use of the app, particularly when the phone is used as a sensor. These findings highlight the need of co-design and preliminary testing when developing apps for PD.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning in Parkinson's disease assessment uses data from clinically-coded movements, such as finger tapping, to objectively measure motor impairment. Video-based models showed promise in several experiments, but the lack of a unified test benchmark hinders proving generalizability. Additionally, new telemedicine systems may easily collect large amounts of unsupervised data, while obtaining ground truth labels for supervised learning remains time-consuming and requires specialized clinicians. This study explores semi-supervised learning to enhance the generalizability of a Light Gradient Boosting model for video-based finger tapping staging, while reducing its need for supervised data labelling. Specifically, this work employs the Self-training schema in two trials using openly-available finger tapping datasets from three independent experiments. This method significantly improves model performance across various metrics, achieving notable accuracy gains (e.g., from 87.62% to 92.05%) when tested on unseen data from a different experiment. Semi-supervision proves valuable when limited labelled data (less than 10%) from the test distribution are available during training.",

    "abstract": "Several commercially available instrumented insole systems have been examined for validity and repeatability, but very few studies have focused on validation of the Moticon OpenGo sensor insoles in measuring gait and balance parameters in a clinical population. Given the paucity of studies examining the validity of these novel technologies in PD, there were two main goals of this research: (1) assess the concurrent validity of the Moticon OpenGo sensor insoles for gait and balance assessment in people with PD using a pressure-sensitive electronic walkway (Protokinetics Zeno\u2122 walkway) as a reference system and (2) compare the gait metrics derived from the insole and walkway systems during a walking and turning task in order to assess the output of the systems under more real-world conditions. Twelve participants (5F/7M; mean age 71.3 \u00b1 6.8 years) with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and a score of 2.5 or 3 on the Modified Hoehn & Yahr score performing straight-line walking, walking with turning, and balance tasks were included in this analysis. Differences in the estimated gait metrics from each system were evaluated through Bland-Altman analysis and calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Results showed strong agreement between the insoles and the reference walkway system during both self-selected pace and hurried pace walking tasks. Although agreement is not as strong when estimating spatial metrics, the limits of agreement (LOA) still indicate that clinically important differences can be seen. Additional investigation into the insole derived center of pressure metrics from the insole sensor systems may be necessary as well as investigation into improved algorithms for capturing gait metrics during more real-world conditions in both types of systems.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by decreased dopamine in the basal ganglia, which causes excessive tonic inhibition of the thalamus. This excessive inhibition seems to explain decreased motor vigor in Parkinson's disease, but whether it causes tremor remains unclear. This paper explores how inhibition may change closed-loop characteristics to determine how this established pathophysiology could produce tremor. First, single-neuron simulations establish the rate and time characteristics of increased tonic inhibition by adjusting the membrane time constant. These characteristics point towards two possible mechanisms for unstable feedback: information delay and decreased signal. Both cases create a mismatch between the closed-loop dynamics and the forward model that overcomes proprioceptive feedback delays. Overall, unstable feedback stemming from excessive tonic inhibition represents a unifying pathophysiology for the movement inhibiting and excitatory motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "We developed a 3D virtual reality (VR) game with haptic feedback for upper-limb rehabilitation in individuals Parkinson's Disease (PD) and evaluated the usability of the haptic feedback during gameplay. A fishing game was created, incorporating force feedback on the grip of a fishing rod simulated with a haptic stylus device. This game serves as a more engaging way to encourage individuals with PD to perform hand motor tasks such as dropping, pulling up, and moving left or right. The device provided resisting force during the tasks, and a VR headset enhanced the game experience, making it more engaging and immersive. We examined the usability and efficacy of the VR game system with haptic feedback for upper-limb rehabilitation by collecting data from healthy and PD participants. Participants were asked to complete predefined task sessions and provide workload ratings using a NASA Task Load Index. Participants' skills and efficacy were also quantitatively assessed using task specific data. Haptic feedback, which controlled resistance, influenced user performance in movement trajectory, completion time, and task score significantly. These results are helpful in the development of personalized rehabilitation in this population.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a leading neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, contributing to considerable disability worldwide. Current treatments offer only symptomatic relief, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies targeting disease progression. Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in PD pathogenesis, with the NLRP3 inflammasome emerging as a key contributor.\nThe virtual screening of a natural product library comprising 5,088 compounds was applied to identify five potential NLRP3 inhibitors through molecular docking scores. Then surface plasmon resonance assays were used to detect their binding affinities to the NLRP3 protein. Functional studies in macrophages and glial cells were used to demonstrate the effect of Psoralen on NLRP3 phosphorylation and inflammasome activation.\nPsoralen treatment improved PD-like symptoms and reduced dopaminergic neuronal death by targeting glial NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the MPTP/p mouse model. By performing 4D label-free quantitative phosphorylation proteomics and site mutation assays, we identified that Psoralen prevents NLRP3 phosphorylation at Serine 658 by binding to its NACHT and LRR domains.\nThese findings position Psoralen as a promising NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, offering a potential therapeutic avenue for PD and other NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases. Additionally, this research highlights the innovative approach of targeting specific phosphorylation sites on the NLRP3 protein to reduce neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Reduced arm swing movements during gait are an early motor manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD). The clinical evolution, response to L-Dopa and pathophysiological underpinning of abnormal arm swing movements in PD remain largely unclear. By using a network of wearable sensors, this study objectively assesses arm swing movements during gait in PD patients across different disease stages and therapeutic conditions.\nTwenty healthy subjects (HS) and 40 PD patients, including 20 early-stage and 20 mid-advanced subjects, underwent a 6-m Timed Up and Go test while monitored through a network of wearable inertial sensors. Arm swing movements were objectively evaluated in both hemibodies and different upper limb joints (shoulder and elbow), using specific time-domain (range of motion and velocity) and frequency-domain measures (harmonics and total harmonic distortion). To assess the effects of L-Dopa, patients under chronic dopaminergic therapy were randomly examined when OFF and ON therapy. Finally, clinical-behavioral correlations were investigated, primarily focusing on the relationship between arm swing movements and cardinal L-Dopa-responsive motor signs, including bradykinesia and rigidity.\nCompared to HS, the whole group of PD patients showed reduced range of motion and velocity, alongside increased asymmetry of arm swing movements during gait. Additionally, a distinct increase in total harmonic distortion was found in patients. The kinematic changes were prominent in the early stage of the disease and progressively worsened owing to the involvement of the less affected hemibody. The time- and frequency-domain abnormalities were comparable in the two joints (i.e., shoulder and elbow). In the subgroup of patients under chronic dopaminergic treatment, L-Dopa restored patterns of arm swing movements. Finally, the kinematic alterations in arm swing movements during gait correlated with the clinical severity of bradykinesia and rigidity.\nArm swing movements during gait in PD are characterized by narrow, slow, and irregular patterns. As the disease progresses, arm swing movements deteriorate also in the less affected hemibody, without any joint specificity. The positive response to L-Dopa along with the significant correlation between kinematics and bradykinesia/rigidity scores points to the involvement of dopaminergic pathways in the pathophysiology of abnormal arm swing movements in PD.",

Baseline clinical features and dopaminergic activity were assessed, together with clinical follow-up (6.87\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2 years). Survival analyses assessed the independent and interactive effects of sex and GBA1 mutations on cognitive decline. At baseline, GBA-PD males showed severe motor impairment, sleep disorders and memory deficits. Despite milder motor deficit, compared to GBA-PD males, GBA-PD females showed greater dopaminergic denervation, suggesting the effect of neural reserve. In longitudinal assessment, GBA-PD males showed greater MoCA rate of change per year and greater risk of cognitive impairment than GBA-PD females and nonGBA-PD. In GBA-PD males, both late age at onset and \"severe/mild\" GBA variants were associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment. Male sex and GBA1 carrier status have an additive value in increasing the risk of cognitive decline in PD. The effect of sex on GBA1-related pathology warrants further examination to address future trials design and patients' selection.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies on the genetic pathogenesis of familial Parkinson's Disease (PD) have explained the etiology of only a limited percentage of cases. In this study, we aimed to identify copy number variations (CNVs) in patients with familial PD compared to their healthy siblings.\nGenomic microarray analysis was performed using the CytoScan HD array platform, and paired copy number variation analysis was performed using Partek Genomics Suite.\nA total of 211 CNVs were detected in patients (genomic markers per CNV>10, markers per base pair >0.0005). Genes localized in CNV regions were enriched in the 'Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450' pathway. Subsequently, CNVs located in regions with segmental duplication, large genomic gap or 'dosage sensitivity unlikely ', with a frequency higher than 0.01%, and found to be 'both amplified and deleted' in patients were excluded. Genes potentially affected by exonic copy number losses were HPGDS, TUBB8, ZMYND11, FLI-1, THADA, FAM47E, FAM47E-STBD1, AGMO, CYRIB, and MIR5194, while the detected copy number gains included the exons of the PCSK6, MIR4522, WSB1, C8orf44-SGK3, SGK3, and MCMDC2. No copy number variation was detected in chromosomes 13 and 18.\nHere, we report the results of the first paired CNV analysis in siblings discordant for Familial Parkinson's Disease. Validation and frequency determination of rare and novel CNVs identified in larger familial PD cohorts may reveal novel PH risk genes. The metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 pathway deserves further functional and translational studies in familial Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Motor diagnosis, monitoring and management of Parkinson's disease (PD) focuses mainly on observational methods and, clinical scales, resulting in a subjective evaluation. Inertial sensors combined with artificial intelligence have emerged as a promising solution to help physicians perform early, differential, and objective quantification of motor symptoms over time. We hypothesize that a long short-term memory-deep neural network (LSTM) architecture could be an appropriate solution for producing three models to provide a holistic assessment of patients with PD from a single inertial sensor.\nA custom dataset with 40 patients was created to train and test three deep learning models to classify PD disease stages, motor conditions and quality of life (QoL).\nWe verified an accuracy of 89\u00a0% for the disease stage classifier, 91.7\u00a0% for the motor condition classifier, and an accuracy of 87.8\u00a0% for the QoL classifier.\nWe confirmed that an LSTM architecture could produce three models to improve PD management.",

    "abstract": "Depression is common as non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Evidence of antidepressants for PD with depression remain unclear. This meta-analysis examines the efficacy and tolerability of newer-generation antidepressants for PD with depression.\nSix international electronic databases (Cochrane, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) and four Chinese electronic databases (CBM, CNKI, WanFang Data, and VIP) were systematically searched up to October 31, 2023. The primary outcomes were efficacy (change in depressive symptoms) and tolerability (all-cause discontinuations). Secondary outcomes contained improvement in motor symptoms, change score of anxiety rating scales, improvement in cognitive function, and adverse events. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42020198364.\nA total of 11 trials with 713 participants were included. Newer-generation antidepressants significantly improved depressive symptoms (standardized mean differences (SMD)\u00a0=\u00a0-1.12 [-1.72; -0.52]), anxiety scores (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.60 [-1.04; -0.17]). However, there was insufficient evidence in improving motor function in PD (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.19 [-2.74; 0.36]) and the cognitive function (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.57 [-0.33; 1.47]). Newer-generation antidepressants were associated with increased diminished sexual desire (RR\u00a0=\u00a02.34 [1.13; 4.86]) and insomnia (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.42 [0.22; 0.82]), but similar risk of all-cause discontinuations when compared with the control group (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.25 [0.85; 1.85]).\nNewer-generation antidepressants appear to be beneficial and safe in treating depression in PD.",

    "abstract": "Recent quantification research on Parkinson's disease (PD) integrates wearable technology with machine learning methods, indicating a strong potential for practical applications. However, the effectiveness of these techniques is influenced by environmental settings and is hardly applied in real-world situations. This paper aims to propose an effective feature assessment framework to automatically rate the severity of PD motor symptoms from short-term motor tasks, and then classify different PD severity levels in the real world.\nThis paper identified specific PD motor symptoms using a novel feature-assessment framework at both segment-level and sample-level. Features were selected after calculating SHapley Additive exPlanation(SHAP) value, and verified by different machine learning methods with appropriate parameters. This framework has been verified on real-world data from 100 PD patients performing Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale(UPDRS)-recommended short motor tasks, each task lasting 20-50 seconds.\nThe sensitivity for recognizing motor fluctuations reached 88% in tremor recognition. Additionally, LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy for early detection(92.59%) and achieved 71.58% in fine-grained severity classification using 31 selected features.\nThis paper reports the first effort to assess multi-level and multi-scale features for automatic quantification of motor symptoms and PD severity levels. The proposed framework has been proven effective in assessing key PD information for recognition during short-term tasks.\nThe explanatory analysis of digital features in this study provides more prior knowledge for PD self-assessment in a free-living environment.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) is a primary pathological indicator for Parkinson's disease (PD). The \u03b1-Syn oligomer is even more toxic and is responsible for PD. Hence, identifying \u03b1-Syn and its oligomers is an interesting approach to diagnosing PD. The prevention strategies for oligomer formation could be therapeutic in treating PD. Various conventional strategies have been developed for the management of PD. However, their clinical applications are limited due to toxicity, off-targeting, side effects, and poor bioavailability. Recently, nanomaterials have gained significant attention due to unique physicochemical characteristics such as nanoscale size, large surface area, flexibility of functionalization, and ability to protect and control a loaded payload. Functionalizing the surface of nanoparticles with a desired targeting agent could offer targeted delivery of the payload at the site of action due to specificity and selectivity against complementary molecules. Among various functionalization approaches, biomolecule-functionalized nanomaterials offer benefits such as enhanced bioavailability, improved internalization into target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, and delivery of therapeutics across the BBB (blood-brain barrier). In this review, we initially discussed the major milestones related to PD and highlighted the therapeutic strategies focused on clinical trials. The strategies of biomolecule functionalization of nanomaterials and their application in detecting and preventing \u03b1-Syn oligomer for the diagnosis and therapy of PD, respectively, have been reviewed comprehensively. Ultimately, we have outlined the conclusions, highlighted the limitations and challenges, and provided insight into future perspectives and alternative approaches that must be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders are now the most common reason that Medicare beneficiaries enroll in hospice for end-of-life care. People with all-cause dementia have high rates of suboptimal hospice use, but little is known about hospice use patterns in Lewy body disease, which includes both Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).\nTo compare patient characteristics, hospice agency characteristics, and patterns of use for beneficiaries with PD and DLB vs Alzheimer disease (AD).\nA retrospective cohort study including a 100% sample of national 2010-2020 calendar year Medicare data on hospice enrollees was performed. Data analysis was conducted from November 2023 to May 2024.\nA diagnosis of PD or DLB, compared with AD as the reference group.\nProportion of enrollees with short stays (<7 days), proportion with long stays (>180 days), proportion disenrolled for any reason before death, and disenrollment by type.\nOf 11\u202f327\u202f324 Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in hospice between 2010 and 2020 who met eligibility criteria (mean [SD] age, 85.2 [7.5] years; 781\u202f763 [63.0%] female), there were 958\u202f182 (8.4%) with a primary diagnosis of AD, 232\u202f864 (2.1%) with PD, and 49\u202f340 (0.4%) with DLB. People with PD were more likely to experience a long stay (odds ratio [OR], 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13-1.16) compared with AD, whereas the odds for those with DLB were not increased. However, people with either PD or DLB were less likely to be disenrolled for extended prognosis compared with AD (OR for DLB, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.85; OR for PD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.85-0.88). People with PD were more likely to revoke hospice (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.27-1.32) compared with AD.\nIn this cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries, hospice use patterns differed by dementia subtype. Higher likelihood of hospice revocation in PD raises important questions about unmet needs and highlights the need for more research around the experience of the end of life in this growing population.",

    "abstract": "N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism in the central nervous system has been described. More data are needed regarding its clinical impact on the cardiovascular system. In this study, we assess the cardiovascular impact of NMDA receptor antagonism with amantadine on patients with primary or secondary parkinsonism.\nTo conduct this retrospective cohort analysis, we queried the TriNetX Global database on January 13, 2024 to identify patients 18 years old or older with Parkinsonism between January 2003 and December 2023 and divided them into 2 groups based on amantadine use. We conducted propensity score matched (PSM) analysis for sociodemographics, cardiovascular comorbidities and medications, and antiparkinsonian agents.\nAfter PSM, relative risks (RRs) were used to compare outcomes over a 5-year follow-up period. After PSM, both groups had 28,461 patients each. Amantadine use in patients with parkinsonism was associated with a 13% reduction in 3-point major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (RR: 0.867, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.836-0.900, P < 0.0001), as well as a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR: 0.877, 95% CI: 0.844-0.912, P < 0.0001), AMI (RR: 0.790, 95% CI: 0.709-0.881, P < 0.0001), and cerebral infarction (RR: 0.868, 95% CI: 0.791-0.952, P = 0.0026). It was also associated with lower rates of heart failure, atrial arrhythmias, bradycardia, atrioventricular blocks, ventricular tachycardia, syncope and collapse, and peripheral edema. Amantadine use was however associated with a higher risk of orthostatic hypotension.\nNMDA antagonism with amantadine in patients with primary or secondary parkinsonism is associated with a significantly reduced risk of all-cause mortality, AMI, cerebral infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.",

    "abstract": "PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to gradual motor impairments. Early detection is critical for slowing the disease's progression and providing patients access to timely therapies. However, accurately detecting PD in its early stages remains challenging. This study aims to develop an optimized deep learning model for PD classification using voice signals and hand-drawn spiral images, leveraging a ZFNet-LHO-DRN. The proposed model first preprocesses the input voice signal using a Gaussian filter to remove noise. Features are then extracted from the preprocessed signal and passed to ZFNet to generate output-1. For the hand-drawn spiral image, preprocessing is performed with a bilateral filter, followed by image augmentation. Here also, the features are extracted and forwarded to DRN to form output-2. Both classifiers are trained using the LHO algorithm. Finally, from the output-1 and output-2, the best one is selected based on the majority voting. The ZFNet-LHO-DRN model demonstrated excellent performance by achieving a premium accuracy of 89.8%, a NPV of 89.7%, a PPV of 89.7%, a TNR of 89.3%, and a TPR of 90.1%. The model's high accuracy and performance indicate its potential as a valuable tool for assisting in the early diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Environmental enrichment is the provision of different substrates to mimic an animal's natural environment and encourage natural, species-specific behavior. However, the use of enrichment to improve breeding efficiency in mouse models for neurologic conditions is not well described. There are reports that diminished environmental stimuli and chronic isolation can result in the early expression of the Parkinson phenotype in mice with a genetic predisposition to the disease. In this study, we compared the provision of crinkle paper, DietGel, and their combination on reproductive parameters in B6.Cg-Tg(THY1-SNCA*A53T)M53Sud mice. We found that enhanced enrichment combined with enhanced nutrition increased dam weight and decreased the interlitter intervals. In addition, enhanced enrichment increased the production index, number of pups born, pups weaned, and the percent survival of pups. This study underscores the importance of incorporating enrichment to enhance the reproductive parameters in mice that are models of Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "To identify factors contributing to the long-term sustainability of community-based dance programs for people living with Parkinson's disease in order to inform the design and development of sustainable programs.\nMulti-site ethnographic fieldwork was conducted at four different preexisting dance programs for people living with Parkinson's disease. Dancer, facilitator, and community stakeholder perspectives were gathered via semi-structured interviews in order to create a deeper understanding of how existing programs navigate challenges and maintain stability. Transcripts and field notes were analyzed via reflexive thematic analysis.\nInterviews were conducted with 18 participants (eight dancers with Parkinson's disease, seven dance facilitators, one classroom assistant, and two community stakeholders). Four key areas for supporting program sustainability were identified: (1) finding an organizational structure that works, (2) balancing funding, fundraisers, and fees, (3) prioritizing dancer experience and satisfaction, and (4) recruiting and retaining committed, high-quality facilitators.\nCultivating multiple funding sources; forging strategic connections with local Parkinson's organizations and arts institutions; building a critical mass of facilitators and administrators with diverse skillsets; offering hybrid online delivery where possible; and ensuring that the dancer experience is low-pressure, varied, and enjoyable can support the long-term sustainability of dance programs for people living with Parkinson's disease.\nDance is a creative form of physical activity that can improve cognitive and motor function as well as quality of life in people living with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).Community-based dance programs for people living with PD must be sustainable so that people can continue to benefit from participation over time.Dance programs for people with PD that have multiple funding sources, facilitators, community partners, and modes of delivery are more likely to be sustainable.Dancers value quality facilitators and enjoy learning in fun, low-pressure environments with a community feel.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder affecting more than 10 million people worldwide. The actual prevalence and relative risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in PD have not been systematically examined, especially in various study designs and surgical settings. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a meta-analysis on the risk of VTE and in PD.\nWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane from inception to 22 June 2024 to identify cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies comparing the frequency of VTE, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) events in PD and non-PD patients. We computed risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each study and pooled results using a random-effects meta-analysis. Quality assessment was performed using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools.\nOut of 758 studies screened initially, 13 studies involving 775,144 patients were included. VTE risk was elevated (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.47-2.04) when comparing PD patients to non-PD patients. In subgroup analysis comparing neurological and non-neurological surgeries, there was no significant (p\u2009=\u20090.11) difference in VTE risk. Cross-sectional studies had a higher elevated VTE risk (RR 5.43, 95% CI 3.40-8.67) when compared to case-control (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.14-2.20) and cohort (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.22-1.84) studies (p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nOur meta-analysis showed an elevated risk of VTE events in PD patients. There was no significant difference between neurological and non-neurological surgeries in the incidence of VTE. Greater vigilance should be exercised to detect VTE events early in PD patients due to impaired mobility.",

    "abstract": "The genomic landscape of the Indian population, particularly for age-related disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD) remains underrepresented in global research. Genetic variability in PD has been studied predominantly in European populations, offering limited insights into its role within the Indian population. To address this gap, we conducted the first pan-India genomic survey of PD involving 4,806 cases and 6,364 controls, complemented by a meta-analysis integrating summary statistics from a multi-ancestry PD meta-analysis (N=611,485). We further leveraged RNA-sequencing data from lymphoblastoid cell lines of 731 individuals from the 1000 Genomes project to evaluate the expression of key loci across global populations. Our findings reveal a higher genetic burden of PD in the Indian population compared to Europeans, accounting for \u223c30% of the previously unexplained heritability. Thirteen genome-wide significant loci were identified, including two novel loci, with an additional three loci uncovered through meta-analysis. Polygenic risk score analysis showed moderate transferability from European populations. Our results highlight the importance of genetic loci in immune function, lipid metabolism and ",

    "abstract": "Frontostriatal degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with language deficits, which can be identified using natural language processing, a remarkable tool for digital phenotyping. Current evidence is limited in linguistic coverage and mostly blind to the disorder's cognitive phenotypes. We validated an AI-driven approach to capture digital language markers of PD with and without mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, PD-nMCI) relative to healthy controls (HCs). Analyzing the connected speech samples of participants, we extracted linguistic features with CLAN software. Classification was performed using Support Vector Machine and Recursive Feature Elimination. Discrimination between PD and HCs reached an AUC of 77%, with even better results for subgroup analyses (AUC 85% PD-nMCI vs. HCs; 83% PD-MCI vs. HCs; 75% PD-nMCI vs. PD-MCI). Key linguistic features included retracing ratio, action verb ratio, utterance error ratio, and verbless-utterance ratio, highlighting the foundational capabilities of linguistic digital markers for early diagnosis and phenotyping of PD.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship of early BMI change with subsequent cognitive decline, CSF AD biomarkers alterations, and progression to dementia in patients with PD.\nStudy data were prospectively collected from the PPMI cohort. Weight/height data at enrollment and second-year clinical visit were utilized to calculate BMI change. Cognitive tests and CSF AD biomarkers were measured at enrollment and each visit during the 5-year follow-up. Generalized linear mixed analyses were employed to identify the impact of BMI change on the deterioration of cognitive performance and CSF AD biomarkers alterations. Cox regression analyses were employed to assess the relationship of BMI change with dementia conversion.\nBMI loss predicted a more rapid deterioration in global cognitive performance over time. Regarding specific cognitive domains, participants in the BMI loss group experienced a significantly more rapid decline in verbal episodic memory, language, and processing speed/attention compared with those in the stable BMI group. Additionally, patients in the BMI gain group showed a slower decline in verbal episodic memory than those in the stable BMI group. BMI loss predicted a more rapid longitudinal decrease of CSF A\u03b242 over time. BMI change was not associated with the risk of progression to dementia.\nEarly BMI loss is a risk factor for faster decline in cognition and longitudinal decrease of CSF A\u03b242. These findings emphasize the need to monitor early BMI change in PD patients. Attention to early BMI change may help identify those at greater risk of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to impairments in cortical structures, resulting in motor and cognitive symptoms. Given the connection between brain structure deficits and physical symptoms in PD, assessing objective brain activity and body motion could provide valuable insights for PD assessment and understanding its underlying mechanisms. This study aimed to explore the connection between brain activity and body movement metrics in a group of individuals with PD and an age-matched healthy control (HC) group. The goal was to evaluate the feasibility of using brain and body motion measures for assessing PD. Participants from both groups underwent the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test under three conditions: simple TUG, cognitive dual-task TUG (CDTUG), and motor dual-task TUG (MDTUG). Key findings include: Both groups exhibited similar activation patterns in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the simple TUG, with motor performance differences observed in cadence. During CDTUG, both groups showed the highest PFC activation with more pronounced motor impairments, such as higher stride and step time. During MDTUG, the HC group exhibited significantly higher PFC activity compared to the PD group. While both groups had similar patterns of activation in PFC area while TUG and CDTUG, they showed distinct behaviour during MDTUG. These results suggest that motor and cognitive impairments in PD are more pronounced during complex activities. While MDTUG effectively differentiated between PD and HC groups, the findings indicate that both cognitive and motor dual-tasks are essential for comprehensive PD assessment.",

This method combines information from multiple channels to prepare input signals for the model, enabling the deep learning architecture to capture information across all channels efficiently. For classification, a ResNet18 network is employed. Notably, the model achieves an accuracy of 96.43% with just 90 seconds of data per subject. This performance is validated through Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation, effectively simulating real-world scenarios. The experimental results highlight the robust detection performance of the proposed method on clinical datasets.",

    "abstract": "As one of the main motor indicators of Parkinson's disease (PD), postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) might manifest in various but subtle symptoms at early stage resulting in relatively high misdiagnosis rate. Quantitative gait assessment under dual task or complex motor task (i.e., turning) may contribute to better understanding of PIGD and provide a better diagnostic indicator of early-stage PD. However, few studies have explored gait deviation evaluation algorithms under a complex dual task that reflect disease specificity. In this work, we proposed a novel inertial-based gait normalcy index (GNI) based on inertial-based quantitative gait assessment model to characterize the overall gait performance during both straight walking and turning with or without serial-3 subtraction task. The factor of group and task on the GNI variable was investigated and the feasibility of GNI to improve early-stage PD diagnostic performance was validated. The experimental results showed that the task paradigm is a significant factor on GNI performance where the dual-task GNI at turn had the best discriminating ability between early PD and HC (AUC = 0.992) and was significantly correlated with UPDRS III (r = 0.81), MMSE(r = 0.57) and Mini-BEST(r = 0.65). We also observed that the turning-based GNI has larger effect size compared to clinical scales, demonstrating that GNI during turning can reflect the changes of functional mobility in rehabilitation for the early PD. Our work offers an innovative and potential gait biomarker for early-stage PD diagnostics and provides a new perspective into gait performance of complex dual task and its application in early PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most critical neurodegenerative diseases, yet there is no cure for it, and the state-of-the-art treatment is to slow its progression. Thus, the earlier a patient with PD is recognized, the better he can be treated. Our project joins the research effort that aims to support early PD diagnosis by designing a Virtual Reality (VR)-based system to monitor pupil diameter patterns as new biomarkers (e.g., Pupil Light Reflex and Task-evoked Pupil Response) and provide early warning of potential PD onset. A follow-up experiment with 55 participants shows that the accuracy of recognizing early PD from healthy controls could reach 0.8942. Our study shows early results of a promising research direction that leverages VR-based technology to non-intrusively recognize patterns and provide alerts to early PD patients who would otherwise not know their symptoms until much later.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by enhanced beta-band activity (13-30 Hz) in the motor control regions. Simultaneously, cortico-muscular (CM) connectivity in the beta-band during iso-metric contractions tends to decline with age, in various diseases, and under dual-task conditions.\nThis study aimed to characterize electroencephalograph (EEG) and electromyograph (EMG) power spectra during a motor task, assess CM phase connectivity, and explore how these measures are modulated by an additional cognitive task. Specifically, we focused on the beta-band to explore the relationship between heightened beta amplitude and reduced beta CM connectivity.\nEarly-stage people with PD and age-matched controls performed an isometric knee extension task, a cognitive task, and a combined dual task, while EEG (128ch) and EMG (2x32ch) were recorded. CM phase connectivity was assessed through phase coherence and a phase dynamics model.\nThe EEG power spectrum revealed no cohort differences in the beta-band. EMG also showed no differences up to 80 Hz. However, the combined EEG-EMG analysis uncovered reduced beta phase coherence in people with early PD during the motor task. CM phase coherence exhibited distinct scalp topography and frequency ranges compared to the EEG power spectrum, suggesting different mechanisms for pathological beta increase and CM connectivity. Additionally, phase dynamics modelling indicated stronger directional coupling from the cortex to the active muscle and less prominent phase coupling across people with PD. Despite high inter-individual variability, these metrics may prove useful for personalized assessments, particularly in people with heightened CM connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of Gait (FOG) significantly impacts daily activities of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Despite the potential of wearable sensors in predicting FOG, challenges persist, including the brief prediction interval before FOG onset, limited generalization across patients, and the inconvenience of multiple sensors. Addressing one issue often aggravates others, making it difficult to achieve suitable concurrent solutions to all these challenges.\nWe introduce the PhysioGait Predictive Network (PhysioGPN), a deep learning framework designed to predict FOG events in PD patients at least 2 seconds prior to onset. The model architecture incorporates four key strategies: (1) Detection of progressive motion changes using large convolutional kernels; (2) Unraveling the complexity of motion coordination and gait dynamics using multi-dimensional and multi-scale convolution; (3) Capture gait self-similarity and asymmetry with twin-tower structure; (4) Promoting cross-domain information exchange with multi-domain attention. Furthermore, we propose a framework based on knowledge distillation (KD), reducing the model's dependence on multiple sensors while maintaining prediction accuracy.\nThe model achieves an 85.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC) in FOG prediction. When reducing the number of sensors, KD mitigates the decline in performance and increases the AUC by 5.1%, compared to scenarios without KD.\nOur research proposes a practical solution to the challenges of FOG prediction, demonstrating the effectiveness of the KD approach for lightweight wearable sensors in rehabilitation engineering.\nOur findings offer valuable insights for addressing multiple challenges in the practical application of wearable devices.",

    "abstract": "To develop and validate a deep neural network (DNN) model for diagnosing Parkinson's Disease (PD) using handwritten spiral and wave images, and to compare its performance with various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models.\nThe study utilized a dataset of 204 images (102 spiral and 102 wave) from PD patients and healthy subjects. The images were preprocessed using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor and augmented to increase dataset diversity. The DNN model was designed with an input layer, three convolutional layers, two max-pooling layers, two dropout layers, and two dense layers. The model was trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and loss. The DNN model was compared with nine ML models (random forest, logistic regression, AdaBoost, k-nearest neighbor, gradient boost, na\u00efve Bayes, support vector machine, decision tree) and two DL models (convolutional neural network, DenseNet-201).\nThe DNN model outperformed all other models in diagnosing PD from handwritten spiral and wave images. On spiral images, the DNN model achieved accuracies of 41.24% over na\u00efve Bayes, 31.24% over decision tree, and 27.9% over support vector machine. On wave images, the DNN model achieved accuracies of 40% over na\u00efve Bayes, 36.67% over decision tree, and 30% over support vector machine. The DNN model demonstrated significant improvements in sensitivity and specificity compared to other models.\nThe DNN model significantly improves the accuracy of PD diagnosis using handwritten spiral and wave images, outperforming several ML and DL models. This approach offers a promising diagnostic tool for early PD detection and provides a foundation for future work to incorporate additional features and enhance detection accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to both motor and non-motor symptoms that significantly impact quality of life. The prevalence of PD is expected to increase with the aging population, affecting millions globally. Current detection techniques, including clinical assays and neuroimaging, lack the sensitivity and specificity to sense PD in its earliest stages. Despite extensive research, there is no cure for PD, and available treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than halting disease progression. Conventional treatments, such as levodopa and dopamine agonists, provide limited and often temporary relief, with long-term use associated with significant side effects and diminished efficacy. Nanotechnology, particularly the use of metallic-based nanomaterials (MNMs), offers a promising approach to overcome these limitations. MNMs, due to their unique physicochemical properties, can be engineered to target specific cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in PD. These MNMs can improve drug delivery, enhance imaging and biosensing techniques, and provide neuroprotective effects. For example, gold and silver nanoparticles have shown potential in crossing the blood-brain barrier, providing real-time imaging for early diagnosis and delivering therapeutic agents directly to the affected neurons. This review aims to reveal the current advancements in the use of MNMs for the detection and treatment of PD. It will provide a comprehensive overview of the limitations of conventional detection techniques and therapies, followed by a detailed discussion on how nanotechnology can address these challenges. The review will also highlight recent preclinical research and examine the potential toxicity of MNMs. By emphasizing the potential of MNMs, this review article aims to underscore the transformative impact of nanotechnology in revolutionizing the detection and treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "The lived experience of Parkinson's disease (PD) includes motor and non-motor symptoms. There is a need to capture the earliest patient experiences in a sensitive and reliable manner for the successful development of interventions that may delay clinical progression in PD.\nOur aim was to synthesize published literature about patient-reported symptoms in prodromal and early motor stages of PD and develop a conceptual framework of the earliest lived experiences in PD.\nWe conducted a scoping review of the published literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and CINAHL databases and abstracted patient-reported symptoms from included studies reporting on prodromal or early motor stages of PD populations.\nWe included 59 articles with data from 64 cohorts (prodromal PD: n\u2009=\u200920/64; 31%, early motor PD: n\u2009=\u200944/64, 69%). Overall, the 10 most frequent symptoms (of 85 standardized reported symptoms [SRSs]) were non-motor. SRSs were grouped into symptom domains (behavioral, cognition, dysautonomia, motor, sensory, sleep, and others) and functional domains (activities of daily living, communication, sexual, and social impairment). The Movement Disorder Society sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts Ib and II (n\u2009=\u200913/64, 20%) and ad hoc questionnaires (n\u2009=\u200912/64, 19%) were the most frequently used measurement tools.\nAt prodromal and early motor stages of PD, individuals report symptoms of a diverse range of motor and non-motor domains and higher-level functional domains. There is a need to capture the full spectrum of this lived experience in a new patient-reported clinical outcome measure for clinical trials in the earliest clinical stages of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a highly heterogeneous entity in terms of clinical manifestations, progression, and treatment response. This variability has given rise to the hypothesis that different clinical subtypes of the disease exist.\nTo date, several clinical subtypes have been described, mostly based on different clinical features, and sometimes with the support of biomarkers, either fluid, neuroimaging, or neurophysiological. The most homogeneous subtypes detected are a 'benign subtype', characterised by younger age at onset, mild non-motor symptoms, and a slower rate of disease progression, and a 'malignant subtype', which features an older age at onset, a higher burden of non-motor symptoms, and faster disease progression.\nDespite extensive research, none of the subtypes identified so far seem to be biologically supported, so clinical subtyping does not elucidate PD aetiology and does not allow for the prediction of prognosis or treatment response. This study was aimed to review the literature on this topic and to examine the studies on PD subtyping. We also reviewed the proposed biomarkers for a biological classification of PD, and outlined the role of genetics and pathology within this context.\nIn light of the recent proposal of a biological classification of PD, which might overcome the limits of the clinical diagnosis, PD subtyping should hopefully shepherd researchers towards a biological approach, also aided by recent advances in the field of biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Unilateral focused ultrasound ventral intermediate thalamotomy (Vim-FUS) is effective in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) tremor. Ultrasound ablation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-FUS) has demonstrated efficacy in improving all cardinal motor features of PD, including tremor.\nTo compare the efficacy in parkinsonian tremor control between Vim-FUS and STN-FUS.\nRetrospective, two-center study including consecutive PD patients with medication-refractory tremor who underwent unilateral Vim-FUS or STN-FUS between June 2015 and August 2022. Patients scored \u22652 for postural and/or resting tremor on the most affected body side in the off-medication state. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in tremor improvement on the treated side at 12-month follow-up, including a responder's analysis. Data regarding safety, global motor status, and dopaminergic requirements were also collected. Group comparisons used repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction; statistical significance for P\u2009<\u20090.05.\nAmong 175 patients treated at the two sites, 63 were included (23 Vim-FUS, 40 STN-FUS). At baseline, both groups were equivalent in disease duration (6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8 vs. 6.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u2009years, P\u2009=\u20090.48) and tremor severity (5.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 vs. 5.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5, P\u2009=\u20090.7). While the benefit in tremor was equivalent between the groups at 4\u2009months (P\u2009=\u20090.15), tremor reduction was greater in STN- FUS patients at 12\u2009months (4.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0, 95% CI 3.7-5.0 compared with 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7, 95% CI 1.1-4.3 for Vim-FUS, P\u2009=\u20090.012). In 47.5% (19/40) of STN-FUS patients tremor was completely abolished versus 8.7% (2/23) in Vim-FUS patients (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Most adverse events were mild (91%) and resolved by 12\u2009months.\nSTN-FUS and Vim-FUS significantly improved medication-refractory PD tremor; however, subthalamotomy might have greater and more sustained effect. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Oral health plays a crucial role in maintaining the general health of an individual. Parkinson disease (PD) has known to disrupt the oral functions. Prosthetic rehabilitation can be done in these patients. However, there is scarcity of literature to assess the effectiveness or impact of rehabilitation with prosthesis either fixed or removable on various oral functions and quality of life (QoL) or satisfaction of PD patients. The purpose of this systematic study was to assess the effectiveness of prosthodontic rehabilitation in patients with PD.\nThe literature search was conducted in the PubMed and CINAHL database for the articles till 2024 in English language. An exploration of gray literature was also included through Google Scholar. Manual search in the references of the selected articles was also done for relevant articles. The methodological quality assessment of cohort studies was done using Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment form for Cohort Studies (NOS). Assessment of cross-sectional studies was done using the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (tool) and aassessment of case series was done using JBI critical appraisal tool for case series.\nA total of 6 articles were selected from PubMed, 1 from CINAHL, and 2 from Google Scholar. Four articles studied the masticatory efficiency. Oral perception and motor ability were analyzed in two articles. Oral Health QoL was assessed in four articles. One article studied the electromyographic activity.\nBased on this systematic review, it can be suggested that prosthetic rehabilitation using fixed or removable prosthesis offer potential benefits in PD patients improving the oral functions and QoL. However, there is a dearth of long-term research on evaluation of impact of prosthetic rehabilitation in improving the oral function and QoL of PD patients.",

The key signal transduction and regulatory networks that are involved during this degenerative process in PD are currently being investigated for novel neuro-protective strategies.

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to take a translational approach by developing a PKD1 activator and characterizing the protective function in pre-clinical models of PD.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorder, is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn)-rich inclusions. Despite advances in understanding PD pathophysiology, disease-modifying therapies remain elusive, underscoring gaps in our knowledge of its underlying mechanisms. Mitochondria are key targets of \u03b1Syn toxicity, and growing evidence suggests that \u03b1Syn-mitochondrial interactions contribute to PD progression. Our recent findings identify mitochondrial protease ClpP as a crucial regulator of \u03b1Syn pathology, with pathological \u03b1Syn binding to and impairing ClpP function, thereby exacerbating mitochondrial impairment and neurodegeneration. To disrupt this deleterious interaction, we developed a decoy peptide, CS2, which directly binds to the non-amyloid-\u03b2 component (NAC) domain of \u03b1Syn, preventing its association with ClpP. CS2 treatment effectively mitigated \u03b1Syn toxicity in an \u03b1Syn-stable neuronal cell line, primary cortical neurons inoculated with \u03b1Syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs), and DA neurons derived from PD patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Notably, subcutaneous administration of CS2 in transgenic mThy1-hSNCA PD mice rescued cognitive and motor deficits while reducing \u03b1Syn aggregation and neuropathology. These findings establish the ClpP-\u03b1Syn interaction as a druggable target in PD and position CS2 as a promising therapeutic candidate for PD and other \u03b1Syn-associated neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Historically, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have been investigated as two distinct disorders of the brain. However, a few similarities in neuropathology and clinical symptoms have been documented over the years. Traditional single gene-centric genetic studies, including GWAS and differential gene expression analyses, have struggled to unravel the molecular links between AD and PD. To address this, we tailor a pattern-learning framework to analyze synchronous gene co-expression at sub-cell-type resolution. Utilizing recently published single-nucleus AD (70,634 nuclei) and PD (340,902 nuclei) datasets from postmortem human brains, we systematically extract and juxtapose disease-critical gene modules. Our findings reveal extensive molecular similarities between AD and PD gene cliques. In neurons, disrupted cytoskeletal dynamics and mitochondrial stress highlight convergence in key processes; glial modules share roles in T-cell activation, myelin synthesis, and synapse pruning. This multi-module sub-cell-type approach offers insights into the molecular basis of shared neuropathology in AD and PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by degeneration of the dopaminergic (DA) neurons, is still lack of available treatments to completely block neurodegeneration. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a predominant active polyphenol generated from green tea, exerts multiple neuroprotective roles in the nervous system. However, the function role of EGCG in PD and the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated. In the current study, we used the rotenone injection to build the PD rat model, followed by the EGCG treatment and determined by the behavior tests, measurements of malondialdehyde, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase levels, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We revealed that, in PD rats, EGCG upregulates protein kinase D1 (PKD1) and inhibits Parthanatos to ameliorate the impaired motor function, reduce the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, suppress the oxidative stress, and suppress the inflammation in substantia nigra. These combined results suggest that EGCG can suppress oxidative stress and inflammation to prevent DA neuron degeneration to prevent rotenone-induced motor impairments, laying the foundation for EGCG to be a novel candidate for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Exercise is known to be beneficial for individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Rock climbing contains exercise characteristics highlighted in published clinical guidelines for PD (e.g., aerobic, resistance, balance training, cued-movements, community-based) and also has unique somatosensory and visuospatial experiences that may facilitate motor learning. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a climbing program on the physical function of individuals with PD.\nThis quasi-experimental observational pilot study used pre-to-post-test comparisons to assess participants with mild to moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr 1-3) who walked independently. The intervention was 12 weeks of community-based, twice weekly top-rope climbing sessions under one-on-one supervision and tailored to skill level. Wall angles, hand/foot holds, and routes varied from climb to climb and became progressively more difficult as skills increased. The primary outcome measure was the Community Balance & Mobility Scale (CBMS); secondary measures were the Agility T-Test (ATT), 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), upper extremity reaction time using BlazePods (UE-React), and grip strength (GS).\n28 participants completed the study: 8 women/20 men; mean age = 66.1 (sd = 7.4) years; average disease duration = 4.0 (sd = 3.6) years. \nRock climbing demonstrated medium-size effects on mobility/balance and small-size effects on agility and dexterity that could impact functioning in everyday activities.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptomatology in Parkinson's disease (PD) is related to patients' quality of life (QoL). The Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NNMS) assesses QoL by investigating numerous domains including nutritional status, which is represented by domain 6. Patients with PD commonly suffer from dysphagia, and consequently malnutrition, leading to sarcopenia and increasing motor deficits in relation to loss of muscle mass and energy deficit. The impact of dysphagia on PD patients' health status, makes it necessary to study the effectiveness of specific nutritional programs in addressing feeding needs, with the goal to improve clinical outcomes and the patient's perception of their QoL. The 'Weancare' Program was trialed on an 84-year-old PD patient suffering from dysphagia and the Tower of Pisa Syndrome. The first assessment of the patient showed an early overall deteriorating condition, particularly under a nutritional point of view. The patient was assessed before and after the intervention considering serological tests, and the QoL through the New Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NNMS). We found a beneficial impact of the 'Weancare' program on the patient significantly improving the non-motor symptomatology and QoL and the investigated outcomes, enhancing a better subjective experience of mealtime lived by the patient.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by heterogeneous clinical phenotypes that may be influenced by the asymmetry of striatal denervation. The alpha-Synuclein Origin site and Connectome (SOC) model proposes that different disease onset patterns-\"body first\" versus \"brain first\"-affect symptom development and cognitive decline.\nThis study aims to explore the relationship between striatal denervation asymmetry, ceramide metabolism, and cognitive performance in early-stage PD.\nWe analyzed data from 329 patients with PD at baseline, categorized by the type of putamen denervation asymmetry predominance at baseline, along with data from 167 healthy controls. We performed generalized linear mixed models introducing ceramides levels and cognitive performance as discriminating factors. Spearman correlations were used to highlight the relationship between cognition and ceramides.\nOur findings revealed that patients with asymmetric striatal denervation exhibited higher concentrations of C18:0 ceramides compared to both symmetric patients and healthy controls. Moreover, patients with symmetric denervation demonstrated greater cognitive impairment than those with right or left asymmetry.\nThe study highlights the importance of striatal denervation asymmetry in influencing ceramide metabolism and cognitive function in early-stage PD. These findings suggest that specific ceramide profiles may serve as metabolic markers to distinguish clinical phenotypes, providing insights into disease progression.\nParkinson's disease (PD) manifests as a diversity of symptoms that can vary according to the asymmetry of striatal denervation (a region of the brain). The SOC (alpha-Synuclein Origin site and Connectome) model suggests that the onset of symptoms may begin either in the body (\u2018body first\u2019) or in the brain (\u2018brain first\u2019), influencing the progression of symptoms and cognitive decline.In this study, we analyzed the relationship between striatal denervation asymmetry, ceramide metabolism (types of fat in the brain), and cognitive performance in patients with early-stage PD. We examined data from 329 PD patients, divided according to the type of asymmetry in the striatum, as well as from 167 healthy individuals. Our results show that patients with asymmetric denervation had higher levels of C18:0 ceramides compared to patients with symmetric denervation and healthy controls. In addition, patients with symmetric denervation showed more cognitive impairment. These results suggest the importance of considering striatal denervation asymmetry and that ceramides could be useful metabolic markers for differentiating types of PD and better understanding disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning approaches including deep learning models have shown promising performance in the automatic detection of Parkinson's disease. These approaches rely on different types of data with voice recordings being the most used due to the convenient and non-invasive nature of data acquisition. Our group has successfully developed a novel approach that uses convolutional neural network with transfer learning to analyze spectrogram images of the sustained vowel /a/ to identify people with Parkinson's disease. We tested this approach by collecting a dataset of voice recordings via analog telephone lines, which support limited bandwidth. The convolutional neural network with transfer learning approach showed superior performance against conventional machine learning methods that collapse measurements across time to generate feature vectors. This study builds upon our prior results and presents two novel contributions: First, we tested the performance of our approach on a larger voice dataset recorded using smartphones with wide bandwidth. Our results show comparable performance between two datasets generated using different recording platforms despite the differences in most important features resulting from the limited bandwidth of analog telephonic lines. Second, we compared the classification performance achieved using linear-scale and mel-scale spectrogram images and showed a small but statistically significant gain using mel-scale spectrograms.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are prevalent and debilitating conditions that lead to irreversible blindness and dyskinesia, respectively. Emerging evidences imply that retinal abnormalities may serve as early indicators for monitoring PD. This study endeavors to explore the complex interactions and focus on their shared molecular and pathological mechanisms. We employed a comprehensive approach by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, obtained from dry AMD retinas and PD brain tissues, along with Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)-related computational analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was conducted to analyze PD-related genes within retinal ganglion cells in dry AMD. Cell-cell chat was utilized to predict intercellular communication and signaling pathways. Module eigengenes (MEs) were calculated to identify specific gene modules. Dysregulation of PALLD, FYN and ZMZ1 may lead to cell structural abnormalities, impaired mitochondrial functions, and increased susceptibility to neuroinflammation, contributing to the AMD and PD progression. Additionally, this study highlighted an astrocyte-oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPCs) signaling axis mediated by Neuregulin (NRG), which is hypothesized to influence neuroinflammatory processes characteristic of dry AMD and PD pathogenesis. Notably, ME-salmon module associated with gene dysregulation exhibited a strong positive correlation with the ME-blue module, linked to neurodegenerative impairment, and the ME-yellow module, related to mitochondrial dysfunction. The comprehensive investigation on astrocytes-OPCs signaling axis, and the NRG signaling pathway advances our understanding of the intricate biological processes underpinning AMD and PD. This research underscores the critical importance about exploring glial-related cell interactions, providing valuable insights into potential novel therapeutic approaches for these complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a highly heterogeneous disorder, encompassing a complex spectrum of clinical presentation including motor, sleep, cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. We aimed to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation networks in post-mortem Parkinson's disease brain samples and test for region-specific association with common neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms. Of traits tested, we identify a co-methylation module in the substantia nigra with significant correlation to depressive symptoms. Notably, expression of the genes annotated to the methylation loci present within this module are found to be significantly enriched in neuronal subtypes within the substantia nigra. These findings highlight the potential involvement of neuronal-specific changes within the substantia nigra with regards to depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Our study aimed to investigate the neural mechanisms of taVNS in the motor symptoms of PD, focusing on the topological properties of cortical functional networks and cortical excitability. Thirty-two PD patients underwent functional near-infrared spectroscopy and transcranial magnetic stimulation evaluation prior to and after two-week taVNS, which were controlled by 20 healthy controls (HCs). PD patients exhibited decreased nodal efficiency (Ne) in the right M1 and increased Ne in the left pre-motor and supplementary motor area compared with HCs. The decreased Ne in the right M1 was negatively associated with UPDRS-III scores. Interestingly, taVNS treatment improved PD motor symptoms by increasing Ne in the right M1 and enhancing intracortical facilitation (ICF, ISI 10, and 15\u2009ms). The increased Ne and ICF (ISI 15\u2009ms) were negatively correlated with the decreased UPDRS-III scores. taVNS could improve nodal information processing efficiency in the M1 and enhance cortical facilitation to improve PD motor disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) encompasses motor (e.g., bradykinesia) and non-motor (e.g., apathy) symptoms.\nWe aimed to use reflexive and voluntary saccades as a proxy for bradykinesia and apathy.\nSeventeen PD patients and thirteen controls (matched for age and educational level) were recruited. We assessed apathy using the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) and bradykinesia using MDS-UPDRS III. Subjects were asked to fixate successively two green points (cues, 40\u00b0 apart) alternating at 1\u00a0Hz. After 20\u00a0s, all stimuli disappeared, and participants were required to continue fixating on the previous locations of the cues at the same frequency for another 20\u00a0s. We measured the Maximal Amplitude (MA) (saccade amplitude from side to side) and its period. Linear mixed models assessed the effect of the group (patient/control), cue, DAS, and bradykinesia score.\nOverall, the DAS was similarly correlated to the period (p\u2009=\u20090.0157) and the MA (p\u2009=\u20090.0002) in the absence of a cue. However, this correlation was significant only in the patient subgroup for the MA (p\u2009=\u20090.0005). In the absence of cue, bradykinesia was similarly correlated to the period (p\u2009=\u2009.0001) and the MA (p\u2009=\u20090.0004). However, the period was better correlated to bradykinesia than the DAS.\nWhile the saccade period best correlates with bradykinesia, maximal amplitude in the absence of cue better reflects the severity of apathy. Our paradigm may be a promising objective biomarker for assessing bradykinesia and apathy in PD.",

    "abstract": "Hyposmia is one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and antecedes motor dysfunction by up to a decade. However, the underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of dopamine metabolism in post-mortem olfactory bulbs from ten Parkinson's disease and ten neurologic control subjects. In contrast to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, we observed an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the Parkinson's disease olfactory bulb, suggesting a potential role for dopamine in the hyposmia associated with the condition. Using immunohistochemistry, high-performance liquid chromatography, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we demonstrate a reduction in catechol-O-methyltransferase catabolism of dopamine to homovanillic acid, potentially due to a depletion of the methyl donor substrate S-adenosyl methionine. We hypothesized that reduction in catechol-O-methyltransferase activity would result in increased dopamine occupation of the D",

    "abstract": "Postoperative delirium is a common complication of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease, which affects the short-term and long-term prognosis of Parkinson's disease patients.With the continuous development of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease in China, the prevention and treatment of postoperative delirium has also received increasing attention. To promote standardization and normalization of the prevention and treatment of delirium after deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, reduce the occurrence of delirium after deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease in China, and achieve better prognosis. The Functional Neurosurgery Group of the Neurosurgery Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, Functional Neurosurgery Group of Chinese Congress of Neurological Surgeons and Chinese Neuromodulation Society organized experts with experience in deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease to write this consensus. Based on a systematic review and summary of domestic and international literature and clinical evidence related to delirium following deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, this expert consensus was developed. It discusses six aspects: epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, and forms 14 recommended suggestions, providing reference and guidance for clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of delirium after deep brain stimulation surgery in Parkinson's disease.\n\u672f\u540e\u8c35\u5984\u662f\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8111\u6df1\u90e8\u7535\u523a\u6fc0\u672f\u540e\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u540e\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8111\u6df1\u90e8\u7535\u523a\u6fc0\u672f\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u672f\u540e\u8c35\u5984\u7684\u9632\u6cbb\u4e5f\u65e5\u76ca\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u4e3a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8111\u6df1\u90e8\u7535\u523a\u6fc0\u672f\u540e\u8c35\u5984\u9632\u6cbb\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8111\u6df1\u90e8\u7535\u523a\u6fc0\u672f\u540e\u8c35\u5984\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u548c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u540e\uff0c\u4e2d\u534e\u533b\u5b66\u4f1a\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u5206\u4f1a\u529f\u80fd\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u5b66\u7ec4\u3001\u4e2d\u56fd\u533b\u5e08\u534f\u4f1a\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u5206\u4f1a\u529f\u80fd\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u5b66\u7ec4\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u533b\u5e08\u534f\u4f1a\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u63a7\u4e13\u4e1a\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u5185\u79d1\u7b49\u5b66\u79d1\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e0e\u603b\u7ed3\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8111\u6df1\u90e8\u7535\u523a\u6fc0\u672f\u540e\u8c35\u5984\u76f8\u5173\u56fd\u5185\u5916\u6587\u732e\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc1\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u7f16\u5199\u6b64\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c31\u5176\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u3001\u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u3001\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u53ca\u9884\u9632\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bba\u8ff0\u5e76\u5f62\u621014\u6761\u63a8\u8350\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u7597\u53ca\u9884\u9632\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8111\u6df1\u90e8\u7535\u523a\u6fc0\u672f\u540e\u8c35\u5984\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u4e0e\u6307\u5bfc\u3002.",

    "abstract": "Clinical guidelines recommend a holistic approach to Parkinson's disease (PD) care, yet randomized trials examining mindfulness-based interventions in this context are scarce. This study investigated the effects of two mindfulness practices - meditation and yoga - on biopsychosocial outcomes in PD patients, including anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, motor/nonmotor symptoms, health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL), mindfulness, and stress and inflammation biomarkers, compared to usual care.\n159 participants with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD and a Hoehn and Yahr stage of 1, 2, and 3, were randomized into meditation (n = 53), yoga (n = 52), and control (n = 54). Meditation and yoga were delivered in 90-min groups for 8 weeks. Primary outcomes included anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes included motor and nonmotor symptoms, HRQOL, mindfulness, and serum levels of interleukin-6, cortisol and TNF-alpha. Assessments were done at baseline (T0), 2 months (T1), and 6 months (T2). Linear mixed models were conducted following intention-to-treat principle.\nCompared to control, both meditation, and yoga groups had significant improvements in anxiety symptoms (meditation: mean difference [MD] = -1.36, 95% CI: -2.46 to-0.26; yoga: MD = -1.61, CI: -2.70 to -0.52), motor symptoms (meditation: MD = -5.35, CI: -8.61 to-2.09; yoga: MD = -6.59, CI: -9.82 to-3.36), HRQOL (meditation: MD = -2.01, CI: -3.41 to-0.62; yoga: MD = -1.45, CI: -2.83 to-0.08), and describing skills (meditation: MD = 0.97, CI: 0.04-1.89; yoga: MD = 0.92, CI: 0.01-1.84) at T1, and significant reductions in serum interleukin-6 levels (meditation: MD = -1.14, CI: -2.18 to-0.10; yoga: MD = -1.11, CI: -2.09 to-0.13) at T2. Only meditation significantly reduced depression (MD = -1.44, CI: -2.57 to-0.30) at T1 and sustained the motor and HRQOL improvements at T2.\nMeditation and yoga significantly improved anxiety symptoms, chronic inflammation, motor symptoms, mindfulness-describing facet, and HRQOL in PD patients. Meditation provided additional benefits in reducing depressive symptoms and sustaining motor and HRQOL improvements.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex and multifactorial disorder of the nervous system. Tianma Gouteng Decoction (TGD) is a clinical prescription of traditional Chinese medicine for PD, but its neuroprotective effects and mechanisms for PD are poorly understood.\nThe aim of this study was to explore the mechanism of TGD in the treatment of PD.\nSerum pharmacochemistry, single cell sequencing, network pharmacology, and validation experiment were combined to study the effect of TGD in PD model.\nTGD water extract and its distribution in serum of PD mice were analyzed by secondary metabolomics. The crossing blood-brain barrier components and targets were preliminarily identified. Target cells and pathways of TGD were analyzed by network pharmacology and single cell sequencing.\nTGD treatment improved the movement disorders in MPTP-induced PD mice, restoring dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region and suppressing the expression of \u03b1-synuclein. We identified 1272 components in TGD, among which 73 were distributed in the serum of PD mice after oral administration. Network pharmacological analysis demonstrated that these components were involved in the regulation of apoptosis, and 15 of them could across the blood-brain barrier and bind to PD pathological proteins.

    "abstract": "The underlying mechanism of Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with the neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic neurons, and the cerebellum plays a significant role together in non-motor and motor functions in PD progression. Morphological changes in the cerebellum can greatly impact patients' clinical symptoms, especially motor control symptoms, and may also help distinguish patients from healthy subjects. This study aimed to explore the potential of cerebellar gray matter volume, related to motor control function, as a neuroimaging biomarker to classify patients with PD and healthy controls (HC) by using voxel-based morphometric (VBM) measurements and support vector machine (SVM) methods based on independent component analysis (ICA).\nCerebellar gray matter volume was measured using VBM in patients with PD (n\u202f=\u202f27) and HC (n\u202f=\u202f16) from the Neurocon dataset. ICA analysis was performed on the gray matter volume of all subregions, resulting in 7 independent components. These independent components were then utilized for correlation analysis with clinical scales and trained as input features for the SVM model. PD patients (n\u202f=\u202f20) and HC (n\u202f=\u202f20) from the TaoWu dataset were used as test data to validate our SVM model.\nAmong patients with PD, 3 out of the 7 independent components showed a significant correlation with clinical scales. The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 86% in classifying PD patients and HC, with a sensitivity of 72.2%, specificity of 88%, and F1 Score of 76.5%. The accuracy of the SVM model verification analysis using the TaoWu dataset was 70%, with a sensitivity of 62.5%, a specificity of 100%, and the F1 Score was 76.9%.\nThe results suggest that abnormal cerebellar gray matter volume, which is highly correlated with motor control function in Parkinson's patients, may serve as a valuable neuroimaging biomarker capable of distinguishing Parkinson's patients from healthy individuals. We observed that the combination of the ICA method and the SVM method produced an improved classification model. This model may function as an early warning tool that enables clinicians to conduct preliminary identification and intervention for patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is diagnosed based on motor symptoms, but non-motor symptoms of the disease, such as cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, hyposmia, sleep disorders, and psychiatric disorders heavily impact patient and caregiver quality of life. It has proven challenging to faithfully reproduce and quantify these non-motor phenotypes. Indeed, many non-motor signs in animals that may phenotypically resemble features in patients may be caused by different mechanisms or may not be consistent within the same or similar models. In this review, we survey the existing literature on the assessment of non-motor signs in parkinsonian rodents and non-human primates. We highlight the gaps in our understanding and suggest how researchers might improve experimental designs to produce more meaningful results with the hope of better understanding the disease and developing better therapies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 7-10 million people globally. It presents with motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremors, rigidity, and postural instability, along with non-motor issues such as anxiety and mood fluctuations. PD is characterized by the progressive loss of nigrostriatal neurons, \u03b1-synuclein protein aggregation, reduced tyrosine hydroxylase level, and impaired dopamine signaling. Neuroinflammation plays a key role in PD progression, with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines promoting M1 microglial activation, which exacerbates neurodegeneration. Conversely, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-4 help shift microglia to the neuroprotective M2 phenotype, reducing inflammation. Animal models show an imbalance with increased M1 and reduced M2 microglia. This study explored the neuroprotective effects of treadmill exercise in a rotenone-induced PD mouse model. After 21\u00a0days of exercise, behavioral impairments improved, as shown by open field tests, Rota-rod, and footprint analysis. Exercise also reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines; TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 levels while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines; IL-10, and IL-4. This shift correlated with decreased \u03b1-synuclein levels and increased tyrosine hydroxylase expression, indicating reduced neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that treadmill exercise can mitigate PD symptoms and pathology by modulating neuroinflammation and restoring dopaminergic function.",

    "abstract": "GBA1 variants and decreased glucocerebrosidase activity are implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the hypothesis that increased levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), a main substrate of glucocerebrosidase, are involved in PD pathogenesis. Using multiple genetic methods, we show that ATPase phospholipid transporting 10D (ATP10D), not GBA1, is the main regulator of plasma GlcCer levels, yet it is not involved in PD pathogenesis. Plasma GlcCer levels were associated with PD, but not in a causative manner, and are not predictive of disease status. These results argue against targeting GlcCer in GBA1-PD, and underscore the need to explore alternative mechanisms and biomarkers for PD. ANN NEUROL 2025.",

    "abstract": "Fall severely affects the quality of life of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for PD motor symptoms (MS), but DBS increased the risk of falls in some studies and has mixed effects on nonmotor symptoms (NMS). However, the link between NMS and falls, and how DBS influences this relationship, remain unclear. This study investigated changes in NMS and falls before and after STN-DBS, and the longitudinal association between NMS and falls.\nThe study included 136 PD patients undergoing STN-DBS between April 2020 and February 2022. Data were collected preoperatively, at 6\u2009months, and at 12\u2009months postoperatively. Assessments included MS via the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III (UPDRS-III) and NMS via the Nonmotor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). We used the Friedman and chi-square tests to assess changes in NMS and falls. Specific circumstances of falls were assessed through structured interviews. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to explore the longitudinal associations between NMS and fall occurrence, as well as the interaction effects between MS and NMS on fall occurrence.\nSignificant improvements (p\u2009<\u20090.01) were observed in all NMSS domains except gastrointestinal, with no change in fall occurrence. However, there were significant changes in both the locations where falls occurred and whether freezing of gait was present among falling patients (p\u2009<\u20090.01). GEE analysis revealed significant associations between falls and mood/cognition (p\u2009=\u20090.044), gastrointestinal (p\u2009=\u20090.027), and urinary symptoms (p\u2009=\u20090.007), as well as interactions between motor and these NMS domains (p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nNMS, particularly mood/cognition, gastrointestinal, and urinary symptoms, and their interactions with MS, are associated with falls, underscoring the need for targeted fall prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "The parkin-interacting substrate (PARIS, also known as ZNF746) is a transcriptional repressor, whose accumulation and phosphorylation play central pathological roles in Parkinson's disease (PD). PARIS-induced transcriptional repression of PGC-1\u03b1 or MDM4 contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and p53-dependent neuron loss in PD. Despite the important role of PARIS in PD pathogenesis, unbiased transcriptomic profiles influenced by PARIS accumulation in dopaminergic neurons remain unexplored.\nWe engineered Tet-Off conditional transgenic mice expressing PARIS in dopaminergic neurons, driven by DAT-PF-tTA driver mice. The conditional PARIS transgenic mice were characterized by PD-associated pathologies, including progressive dopamine cell loss, neuroinflammation, PGC-1\u03b1 repression, and mitochondrial proteome alteration. Motor impairment was assessed using pole and rotarod tests. L-DOPA and c-Abl inhibitors were administered to PARIS transgenic mice to evaluate their therapeutic efficacy. The transcriptomic profiles and gene ontology clusters were analyzed by bulk and single-nucleus RNA-seq for the ventral midbrains from PARIS transgenic and age-matched controls.\nConditional dopaminergic PARIS expression in mice led to the robust and selective dopaminergic neuron degeneration, neuroinflammation, and striatal dopamine deficits, resulting in L-DOPA-responsive motor impairments. Consistent with the results of previous reports, PARIS suppressed dopaminergic PGC-1\u03b1 expression, disturbed mitochondrial marker protein expression, and reduced COXIV-labeled mitochondria in dopamine neurons. Pharmacological inhibition of c-Abl activity in PARIS transgenic mice largely prevents PD-associated pathological features. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis revealed PARIS-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both collectively and in a cell-type-specific manner, along with enriched biological pathways linked to PD pathogenesis. Single-cell resolution transcriptomic analysis confirmed repression of PGC-1\u03b1 and several mitochondria-related target genes in dopaminergic cells. Additionally, we identified distinct glial cell subpopulations and DEGs associated with PD pathogenesis.\nConditional PARIS transgenic mice recapitulate robust and dopaminergic neuron-selective pathological features of PD, allowing the preclinical evaluation of antisymptomatic and disease-modifying therapeutic strategies within a couple of months. Based on this new PD mouse model, we provide unbiased bulk and single-nucleus transcriptomic profiles that are regulated by PARIS and potentially contribute to PD pathogenesis. A PD mouse model with flexible pathology induction capacity and a whole transcriptome could serve as a useful resource for translational PD research.",

    "results": "Conditional dopaminergic PARIS expression in mice led to the robust and selective dopaminergic neuron degeneration, neuroinflammation, and striatal dopamine deficits, resulting in L-DOPA-responsive motor impairments. Consistent with the results of previous reports, PARIS suppressed dopaminergic PGC-1\u03b1 expression, disturbed mitochondrial marker protein expression, and reduced COXIV-labeled mitochondria in dopamine neurons. Pharmacological inhibition of c-Abl activity in PARIS transgenic mice largely prevents PD-associated pathological features. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis revealed PARIS-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), both collectively and in a cell-type-specific manner, along with enriched biological pathways linked to PD pathogenesis. Single-cell resolution transcriptomic analysis confirmed repression of PGC-1\u03b1 and several mitochondria-related target genes in dopaminergic cells. Additionally, we identified distinct glial cell subpopulations and DEGs associated with PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate that brain infiltration of peripheral immune cells and their interaction with brain-resident cells contribute to Parkinson's disease (PD). However, mechanisms of T cell-brain cell communication are not fully elucidated and models allowing investigation of interaction between T cells and brain-resident cells are required. In this study, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) model composed of stem cell-derived human midbrain organoids (hMO) and peripheral blood T cells. We demonstrated that organoids consist of multiple midbrain-specific cell types, allowing to study T cell motility and interactions with midbrain tissue in a spatially organized microenvironment. We optimized co-culture conditions and demonstrated that T cells infiltrate hMO tissue, leading to neural cell loss. Our work establishes a novel 3D cell co-culture model as a promising tool to investigate the effect of the adaptive immune system on the midbrain and can be used in future studies to address these processes in the context of PD.",

    "abstract": "Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor commonly used to treat depression and neuropathic pain. Duloxetine-associated parkinsonism has been previously reported in only two cases with psychiatric disorders. We present the first case where duloxetine unmasked motor manifestations of subclinical Parkinson's disease.\nA 41-year-old male underwent a discectomy for a lumbar herniation. As numbness in the left sole persisted postoperatively, duloxetine (20 mg/day) was initiated seven days after surgery. Two days\u00a0later, the patient developed a slow gait, difficulty turning, and short steps. Neurological examination revealed resting tremor in the left foot, dystonic posturing of the left little toe, bradykinesia of both hands, reduced gait speed with short steps, and rigidity in the left lower limb and neck. Based on the temporal association, duloxetine-associated parkinsonism was suspected. Four days after discontinuing duloxetine, the patient's gait speed, step length, and right-hand bradykinesia improved, and the foot tremor and toe dystonia resolved. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography revealed reduced tracer uptake in the bilateral striatum, leading to a diagnosis of duloxetine-associated parkinsonism and subclinical Parkinson's disease. One year and four months later, gait impairment reappeared, characterized by short steps and slow speed, though without foot tremor or toe dystonia.\nIn this case, duloxetine appeared to unmask parkinsonism associated with subclinical Parkinson's disease. Potential mechanisms include inhibition of dopamine release due to 5-HT",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of a fast-imaging technique combining Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) and Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging (SWI) at 1.5\u00a0T for visualizing the Swallow Tail Sign (STS) in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The STS, a biomarker linked to PD pathogenesis, offers promise for non-invasive diagnosis. However, conventional SWI often requires high field strengths and lengthy scan times, limiting accessibility. This study aimed to provide a faster, more practical alternative for PD diagnosis.\nA prospective study included 130 participants (22 early-stage PD, 108 healthy controls [HC]) recruited consecutively from a neurology clinic. Eligibility required freedom from MRI contraindications. A fast EPI-SWI sequence was employed as the primary diagnostic tool, with Movement Disorder Society criteria serving as the reference standard. Diagnostic measures, including sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), were calculated.\nAfter excluding participants with motion artifacts or suboptimal image quality, 120 participants (20 PD, 100 HC) were included in the analysis. The fast EPI-SWI technique demonstrated 100\u00a0% sensitivity, 96\u00a0% specificity, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 83.3\u00a0%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100\u00a0%. The AUC for diagnostic accuracy was 0.98.\nThe fast EPI-SWI sequence at 1.5\u00a0T achieved high diagnostic accuracy for detecting the STS, offering a practical solution for early PD diagnosis in settings with limited access to high-field MRI.\nThe use of EPI SWI for detecting the Swallow Tail Sign could provide a faster and more accessible method for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in clinical settings, particularly in resource-limited environments.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) differ among clinical subtypes of PD and the association between urinary disorders and motor and non-motor features, quality of life (QoL), and disease variables.\nSubjects underwent to the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) motor section part III, Hoehn-Yahr (H&Y) scale and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) to evaluate motor symptoms, the stage of disease severity, and cognitive function, respectively. Patients were divided into tremor-dominant type (TDT), akinetic-rigid type (ART), and mixed type (MXT) PD subgroups. Urinary symptoms were evaluated with 3-day voiding diary, uroflowmetry, and the incontinence quality of life questionnaires (I-QoL); psychological status by Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A) and Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D).\n52 patients were enrolled; mean (\u00b1\u2009SD) age: 66.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.6 yrs.

The immune system has multiple roles including beneficial effects such as clearing alpha synuclein aggregates. However, peripheral immune cells entering the brain may also contribute to inflammation and neurodegeneration. To identify which cells might have a negative impact and could be potential therapeutic targets, we compared immune signatures of patients and healthy controls.\nMulticolor flow cytometry was used to determine the frequencies of major immune cell subsets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PD patients and controls. Because of the major impact of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on the distribution of immune cell subsets, particularly cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T-cells, all participants were tested for CMV seropositivity.\nAlthough the cohort of 35 PD patients exhibited the well-established T-cell differentiation signature driven by CMV infection, there were no differences in the frequencies of differentiated or pro-inflammatory T-cells, B-cells or natural killer cells (NK-cells) attributable to the disease. However, percentages of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were higher in PD patients than controls. Moreover, percentages of CD14+CD16+ (intermediate) monocytes expressing the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) correlated with disease severity assessed by the Movement Disorder Society's revised version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) score and disease duration.\nA comprehensive evaluation of the major subsets of circulating immune cells in PD patients revealed differences in myeloid cells between PD and healthy controls and some correlation of monocyte abundance with disease severity.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal interhemispheric functional connectivity is frequently reported in Parkinson's disease (PD), but its structural basis remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate changes in interhemispheric functional, structural, and callosal connectivity, as well as their interrelationships, in PD patients.\nThe study included 57 PD patients and 50 healthy controls (HCs). Interhemispheric functional connectivity was evaluated using voxel mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) derived from resting-state functional MRI, while structural connectivity was measured through homotopic cortical thickness covariance from T1-weighted MRI. The corpus callosum (CC), connecting bilateral regions with VMHC differences, was assessed using fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion MRI. Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate the interrelationships among imaging data and their clinical relevance.\nCompared to HCs, PD patients showed reduced VMHC and interhemispheric structural connectivity in similar brain regions, displaying a positive correlation trend between these measures. The affected regions encompassed the bilateral sensorimotor cortices (precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and paracentral lobule) and posterior cortical areas, including the superior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus, precuneus, middle occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus, as well as the superior and middle temporal gyri. FA in the CC, connecting regions with reduced VMHC, was also lower in PD patients. Additionally, interhemispheric structural, functional, and callosal connectivity reductions were, respectively, related to cognitive impairment, motor dysfunctions, and disease duration in PD.\nThe study identified convergent reductions in interhemispheric functional, structural and callosal connectivity in PD patients, emphasizing the strong link between structural and functional brain abnormalities. Our findings may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "Differentiating idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) from multiple system atrophy-parkinsonian type (MSA-P) is essential for optimizing patient care and prognosis, given the differences in disease progression and treatment response.\nThis study aimed to develop and evaluate a radiomics-based model using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived features to distinguish IPD from MSA-P.\nA multicenter retrospective study.\nA multicenter retrospective study was conducted with 287 patients (186 IPD and 101 MSA-P) who underwent brain MRI. Radiomic features were extracted from T1-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging sequences, and various machine learning classifiers were applied, including logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), ExtraTrees, extreme gradient boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. Model performance was assessed using area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. A nomogram combining clinical and radiomic features was also evaluated.\nThe SVM model, selected as the base for the Rad-signature, achieved the best diagnostic performance, with AUCs of 0.885 and 0.900 in the training and testing cohorts, respectively. The Rad-signature significantly outperformed clinical-only models in distinguishing IPD from MSA-P. The nomogram incorporating radiomic and clinical features yielded the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC\u2009=\u20090.973 and 0.963 for training and testing cohorts, respectively) and balanced sensitivity and specificity. Decision curve analysis confirmed the nomogram's clinical utility.\nRadiomics-based MRI analysis offers a powerful tool for distinguishing IPD from MSA-P, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and aiding personalized treatment planning. Integrating radiomic and clinical data may improve diagnostic workflows in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, resulting in motor symptoms. Ongoing research shows promise for long-term solutions.\nStudies highlight the dysregulation of Syt11 and \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in PD. Disrupted \u03b1-syn homeostasis due to palmitoylation of Syt11 contributes to its aggregation, potentially playing a role in PD pathology. \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in stool samples show promise as an early diagnostic biomarker. Vocal impairments in PD may be linked to \u03b1-syn-induced neuropathology. Irisin, produced after exercise, promotes the degradation of pathologic \u03b1-syn. Progress has been made in identifying PD biomarkers. Retinal thinning and abnormal protein aggregates in skin biopsies provide noninvasive diagnostic indicators. Blood-based biomarkers like \u03b1-syn, DJ-1, and LRRK2 hold promise but face limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) models enhance mitophagy, detect PD through sleep-breathing signals, and improve survival. AI analysis aids noninvasive assessment and risk prediction. Further understanding of PD involves studying pathological seeds and genetic mutations. Adenosine receptor regulation relates to early-onset PD, and specific gene mutations impact patient survival. Differentiated-induced pluripotent stem cells offer the potential for cell replacement therapy. Autoimmune features and T-cell involvement suggest intervention targets. Stem cell-based therapies and neurostimulation strategies show promise for improving motor function. Imaging reveals increased central inflammation in PD, suggesting an inflammatory role. Machine learning algorithms and home gait speed monitoring aid in diagnosis and disease progression tracking. Abnormal putamen gradients reflect dopaminergic loss and motor dysfunction. Antiepileptic drug prescriptions are associated with an increased PD risk. Personalized medicine, gut-brain axis involvement, and vestibular stimulation therapy offer potential PD treatment avenues. Genetic engineering techniques and deep brain stimulation show promise for alleviating PD symptoms.\nOngoing research and technological advancements promise to improve PD screening, diagnosis, and treatment, bringing hope to affected individuals.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common progressive neurological disorders characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. In recent years, PIAS family proteins have been proposed as key factors in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression levels of PIAS family genes in patients with PD and compare them with those in the healthy control group.\nThe expression of PIAS family genes in the peripheral blood cells was investigated by RT-qPCR technique and the results were statistically analyzed using R software.\nPIAS4 gene expression was significantly lower in PD patients compared to the control group (p\u2009=\u20090.016), while we found no significant change in the expression of other PIAS genes between PD patients and healthy control group. Considering gender, the expression of PIAS3 was higher in males than that in females (p\u2009=\u20090.024). Also, significant downregulations in PIAS3 and PIAS4 genes were observed with increasing age, especially in men regardless of being patient or healthy (p\u2009=\u20090.04 and 0.001, respectively). In the correlation analysis, there were significant positive pairwise correlations between PIAS family members. Also, significant negative correlations between the expression of PIAS3 and PIAS4 genes with age were found.\nThese findings show that part of the disruption of immune system regulation occurring in PD is probably related to the expression of PIAS family genes and that these proteins, especially PIAS4, can play an important role in the inflammatory and pathophysiological mechanisms of PD.",

    "results": "PIAS4 gene expression was significantly lower in PD patients compared to the control group (p\u2009=\u20090.016), while we found no significant change in the expression of other PIAS genes between PD patients and healthy control group. Considering gender, the expression of PIAS3 was higher in males than that in females (p\u2009=\u20090.024). Also, significant downregulations in PIAS3 and PIAS4 genes were observed with increasing age, especially in men regardless of being patient or healthy (p\u2009=\u20090.04 and 0.001, respectively). In the correlation analysis, there were significant positive pairwise correlations between PIAS family members. Also, significant negative correlations between the expression of PIAS3 and PIAS4 genes with age were found.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by significant impairment in social, emotional, and cognitive functioning. Its precise pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Alterations in protein homeostasis and some misfolded proteins have been identified within the brains of patients diagnosed with neuropsychiatric disorders. In contrast to neurodegenerative processes such as Parkinson's disease (PD), where the accumulation of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) protein is a primary cause of significant neuronal loss, altered proteostasis in MDD may result in loss-of-function effects by modifying synaptic neuroplasticity. Moreover, aberrant activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathways may intensify the pathological alterations due to altered proteostasis. In this study, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and caudate nucleus from MDD patients and non-psychiatric controls were used. Postmortem samples of same brain areas from PD patients (Braak 2-3 and 5-6) and controls were also included. Protein levels of ER and unfolded protein response (UPR), synucleins (\u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-Syn), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured by Western-Blot. Phospho-eIF2\u03b1/eIF2\u03b1 ratio was increased in the dlPFC and caudate nucleus of MDD and PD patients compared to their respective controls. Brain area-dependent changes in BiP and GRP94 levels were also found. We further detected accumulation of immature BDNF precursors and opposite changes in \u03b1- and \u03b2-Syn levels in the dlPFC of MDD and PD patients compared to controls. Our findings suggest that alterations in proteostasis contribute to the pathophysiology of MDD, as previously described in PD. A deeper understanding of the pathways involved will identify other candidate proteins and new targets with therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Current treatments for patients with Parkinson's disease (PwP) can fail to address gait disturbance and falls, which in turn affect quality of life (QoL). The CUE1 device delivers cueing with vibrotactile stimulation showing potential to alleviate motor symptoms and reduce falls based on preliminary user testing results. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of CUE1 and its effect on motor and non-motor symptoms in PwP.\nPwP used the CUE1 for 9-weeks and were assessed at week 0, 3, 6, and 9 on MDS-UPDRS Part-III, Timed Up and Go (TUG), TUG with dual task (DT), and Functional Gait Assessment (FGA).

    "abstract": "Superagers are older individuals who resist age-related cognitive decline and who perform just as well or better than younger people in cognitive tasks. In healthy aging studies, superagers not only experience positive cognitive outcomes (e.g. lower risk of future mild cognitive impairment), but may also experience fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms as they age. We seek to identify superagers in Parkinson's disease (PD) and potential outcomes associated with superager status.\nData was gathered from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). 689 individuals newly diagnosed with PD were assessed annually for up to 10 years. Participants were classified into three groups: superagers, cognitively normal, and PD mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). Multilevel models examined longitudinal group differences in global cognition, depression, anxiety, and motor severity.\nA significant main effect of group revealed that superagers performed better than the PD-MCI and cognitively normal groups in global cognition. There were significant group by time interactions, revealing the superagers group was on a more favorable longitudinal trajectory relative to other two groups. Superagers also reported less severe depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to the PD-MCI and the cognitively normal groups. Superagers had a more favorable trajectory of motor symptom severity relative to the cognitively normal and PD-MCI groups.\nSuperagers with PD may be detected with neuropsychological testing and appear to resist the effects of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Cognitive studies and trials may benefit from incorporating the concept of superagers, as opposed to a single homogenous cognitively normal group.",

    "abstract": "Early-onset Parkinson's Disease (EOPD) is a neurodegenerative disease with the clinical manifestation of movement symptoms before the age of 50. Patients with EOPD frequently have a positive family history of disease, with bi-allelic loss of function mutations in PRKN and PINK1 as the most common genetic cause. To date, the majority of genetic studies have been conducted on patients with European ancestry, limiting the understanding of the genetic heterogeneity of EOPD across populations. The aim of this study was to screen the PRKN and PINK1 genes in an Ecuadorian EOPD cohort, and improve the understanding of the genetic profile of patients in this population.\nSeventy unrelated patients with EOPD and with an average age at onset of 42.6 \u00b1 5.6 years were recruited at the Hospital Eugenio Espejo in Quito, Ecuador, and screened for the presence of PRKN and PINK1 single nucleotide and copy number variations.\nSanger sequencing identified six PRKN variants, and five resulted in nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions. Seven PINK1 variants were identified: four nonsynonymous, and three common (MAF > 1%), among the EOPD cohort. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) identified three carriers with PRKN copy number variants. Overall, across the series, two patients carried pathogenic homozygous deletions of exons 3 and 4.\nGaining insights into the genetics of EOPD in Latin America is important. In this study, we have identified two carriers of pathogenic PRKN copy number variants in a relatively large group of Ecuadorian patients with EOPD. Additional, familial, early-onset and sporadic PD studies are warranted to further expand the knowledge base regarding Latin American populations.",

No previous studies have explored burst characteristics and coupling across the sensorimotor cortical-STN circuit and determined their relationship to dynamic measurements of bradykinesia.\nWe sought to (1) establish the characteristics of sensorimotor cortical and STN bursts during naturalistic behaviors, (2) determine the predictability of STN bursts from motor cortical recordings, and (3) relate burst features to continuous measurements of bradykinesia using wearable sensors.\nWe analyzed 1046\u2009h of wirelessly streamed bilateral sensorimotor cortical and STN recordings from 5 PD patients with concurrent measurements of bradykinesia.\nSTN bursts were longer than cortical bursts and had shorter inter-burst intervals. Long bursts (>200\u2009ms) in both structures displayed temporal overlap (>30%), with cortical bursts tending to lead STN burst onset by 8\u2009ms. Worsening bradykinesia was linked to increased cortical burst rates and durations, whereas STN burst properties had the opposite effect.\nCortical beta bursts tend to precede STN beta bursts with short delays and their occurrence relates to worsening bradykinesia in naturalistic settings. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic system dysfunction that results from the degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra. However, studies suggest that other neurotransmitters, especially histamine, may also play a role in the development of PD.\nNumerous studies show that histamine levels in the basal ganglia significantly change in PD pathology, correlating with motor symptoms observed in animal models of PD. Histamine activates H1R or H4R on microglia in the substantia nigra, triggering an inflammatory response and promoting dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Additionally, histamine modulates neuronal excitability and firing activity (firing rate and pattern) by activating H1R, H2R, or H3R on neurons in the basal ganglia nucleus, ultimately impacting normal motor behavior as well as motor symptoms in models of PD.\nThis review presents the role of histamine and its receptor ligands in the basal ganglia nuclei, along with downstream ion channels linked to histamine receptors that influence immune response, neuronal excitability, and firing activity in PD. It highlights their effects on neuronal firing and their connection to PD motor symptoms. Investigating new ligands targeting basal ganglia histamine receptors and associated ion channels may facilitate the development of novel treatments for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative condition associated with the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. This leads to neurological impairments with heightening severity and is globally increasing in prevalence due to population ageing. Cell transplantation has demonstrated significant promise in altering the disease course in the clinic, and stem cell-derived grafts are being investigated. Current clinical protocols involve systemic immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection, which could potentially be avoided by encapsulating the therapeutic cells in a locally immunosuppressive biomaterial matrix before delivery. Here we report the progression of an immunomodulatory encapsulation system employing ultrapure alginate hydrogel beads alongside tacrolimus-loaded microparticles in the encapsulation of dopaminergic neuron progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The hiPSC-derived progenitors were characterised and displayed robust viability after encapsulation within alginate beads, producing dopamine as they matured ",

    "abstract": "To investigate the bidirectional relationship between depression and activities of daily living (ADL) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and explore the mediating role of cognitive function over time.\nData from 892 PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database were included in this study, and depression, cognitive function, and ADL were measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part II (UPDRS II) respectively. The cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) was employed to analyze the reciprocal relationship between depression and ADL. Then, we explored the mediating role of cognitive function in the bidirectional relationship between depression and ADL in patients with PD, and the mediation effect test was carried out using a bias-corrected nonparametric percentile bootstrap approach.\nDepression in patients with PD predicted their subsequent ADL (\nThere is a bidirectional relationship between depression and ADL in patients with PD. Furthermore, we found that cognitive function mediates the relationship that exists between depression and ADL in patients with PD.

    "abstract": "Currently, few symptomatic and palliative care options are available for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Interdisciplinary research in materials engineering and regenerative medicine has stimulated the development of innovative therapeutic strategy for patients with PD. Hydrogels, which are versatile and accessible to modify, have garnered considerable interests. Hydrogels are a kind of three-dimensional hydrophilic network structure gels that are widely employed in biological materials. Hydrogels are conspicuous in many therapeutic applications, including neuron regeneration, neuroprotection, and diagnosis. This review focuses on the advantageous applications of hydrogel-based biomaterials in diagnosing and treating the patients with PD, including cell culture, disease modeling, carriers for cells, medications and proteins, as well as diagnostic and monitoring biosensors.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the association between the triglyceride-glucose index, which measures insulin resistance, and the incidence risk of Parkinson's disease.\nOur study used the Health Screening Cohort database of the National Health Insurance Service of South Korea (2002-2019). We included 310,021 participants who had no previous history of Parkinson's disease and for which more than 3 triglyceride-glucose index measurements were available. A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was determined using the code of the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition (G20) with a specific reimbursement code for rare intractable diseases and a history of prescriptions for anti-Parkinsonism drugs.\nDuring a median of 9.64 years (interquartile range 8.72-10.53), 4,587 individuals (1.48%) had Parkinson's disease. Based on a multivariable time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model, a per-unit increase in triglyceride-glucose index scores was associated with a significantly increased risk of Parkinson's disease (Hazard ratio (HR): 1.062, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.007-1.119). In a sensitivity analysis, the triglyceride-glucose index was associated with the incidence risk of Parkinson's disease in a non-diabetes mellitus cohort (HR: 1.093. 95% CI: 1.025-1.165), but not in a diabetes mellitus cohort (HR: 0.990, 95% CI: 0.902-1.087). In a restricted cubic spline analysis, the association between the triglyceride-glucose index and the incidence risk of Parkinson's disease showed a non-linear increasing (J-shape) trend.\nOur study demonstrated that higher triglyceride-glucose index scores were associated with the incidence risk of Parkinson's disease in the general population, particularly in a non-diabetes mellitus cohort.",

    "abstract": "Gait impairment is closely related to quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to explore alterations in brain microstructure in PD patients and healthy controls (HCs) and to identify the correlation of gait impairment in the ON and OFF states of patients with PD, respectively.\nWe enrolled 24 PD patients and 29\u00a0healthy controls (HCs) from the Movement Disorders Program at Beijing Friendship Hospital Capital Medical University between 2019 and 2020. We acquired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and processed the diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) images. Preprocessing of diffusion-weighted data was performed with Mrtrix3\u00a0software, using a directional distribution function to track participants' main white matter fiber bundles. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded. Quantitative gait and clinical scales were used to assess the status of medication ON and OFF in PD patients.\nThe axial kurtosis (AK), mean kurtosis (MK), and radial kurtosis (RK) of five specific white matter fiber tracts, the bilateral corticospinal tract, left superior longitudinal fasciculus, left anterior thalamic radiation, forceps minor, and forceps major were significantly higher in PD patients compared to HCs. Additionally, the MK values were negatively correlated with Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) scores in both the ON and OFF in PD patients. Within the PD group, higher AK, MK, and RK values, whether the patients were ON or OFF, were associated with better gait performance (i.e., higher velocity and stride length).\nPD exhibits characteristic regional patterns of white matter microstructural degradation. Correlations between objective gait parameters and DKI values suggest that dopamine-responsive gait function depends on preserved white matter microstructure. DKI-based Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis may serve as a tool for evaluating PD-related motor impairments (e.g., gait abnormalities) and could yield potential neuroimaging biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Accurately measuring hypokinetic arm swing during free-living gait in Parkinson's disease (PD) is challenging due to other concurrent arm activities. We developed a method to isolate gait segments without these arm activities.\nWrist accelerometer and gyroscope data were collected from 25 individuals with PD and 25 age-matched controls while performing unscripted activities in their home environment. This was done after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic medication ('pre-medication') and approximately one hour after intake ('post-medication'). Using video annotations as ground truth, we trained and evaluated two classifiers: one for detecting gait and one for detecting gait segments without other arm activities. Based on the filtered gait segments, arm swing was quantified using the median and 95th percentile range of motion (RoM). These arm swing parameters were evaluated in three ways: (1) the agreement between predicted and video-annotated gait segments without other arm activities, (2) the sensitivity to differences between PD and controls, and (3) the sensitivity to the effects of dopaminergic medication.\nOn the most affected side, the mean (SD) balanced accuracy for detecting gait without other arm activities was 0.84 (0.10) pre-medication and 0.88 (0.09) post-medication. The agreement between arm swing parameters of predicted and video-annotated gait segments without other arm activities was high irrespective of medication state (intra-class correlation coefficients: median RoM: 0.99; 95th percentile RoM: 0.97). Both the median and 95th percentile RoM were smaller in PD pre-medication compared to controls (median: \nFiltering out gait segments with other concurrent arm activities is feasible and increases the change in arm swing parameters following dopaminergic medication in free-living conditions. This approach may be used to monitor treatment effect and disease progression in daily life.",

    "abstract": "This study attempts to develop a new nanomanufacturing strategy for Parkinson's disease using natural biodegradable components (chitosan, albumin, and dopamine) that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) due to biocompatibility, biodegradability, targeted delivery, and controlled drug release. It was prepared,\u00a0thoroughly optimized and characterized using various biophysical and chemical techniques. Results showed that the nanomanufactured system (molar ratio of 1:0.25:0.5 and particle size range: 38-190\u00a0nm) exhibited a zeta potential of +\u200973 mV facilitating efficient pentration of BBB through an adsorption mechanism with the cell membrane's negative charges. The particle size of the nanomanufactured system and spherical nanoparticle clusters indicated its ability to enhance dopamine delivery to brain tissues. Encapsulation efficiency was measured at 74.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29 with dopamine release faster at pH 5.4 and sustained release over 96\u00a0h in both acidic media (pH 5.4) or physiological conditions (pH 7.4). Cytotoxicity studies showed a degradation rate in normal cells that never exceeded 20% and the nanomanufactured system exhibited low half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, indicating low cytotoxicity. Albumin plays a vital and distinct role in stimulating normal cells and enhancing the transport system to the target via an adsorptive-mediated endocytosis pathway. The electron microscopy images depict distrution of heterogeneous nanoparticles, with sizes ranged from 36.86\u00a0nm to 190.3\u00a0nm and a mean average diameter of 108.1\u00a0nm. The average particle size of the nanosystem was 49.4\u2009\u00b1\u20099.9\u00a0nm, with a Polydispersity Index (PI) of 0.494. The loading efficiency was 14.78\u2009\u00b1\u20090.37% and the encapsulation efficiency was 74.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29%. This nanomanufactured system holds significant promise for improving Parkinson's disease treatment by enabling targeted and efficient drug delivery to the brain.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of mitochondrial function has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the role of mitochondrial metabolism in disease pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Using an unbiased metabolomic analysis of purified mitochondria, we identified alterations in \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) pathway upon loss of PD-linked CHCHD2 protein. KGDH, a rate-limiting enzyme complex in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, was decreased in CHCHD2-deficient male mouse brains and human dopaminergic neurons. This deficiency of KGDH led to elevated \u03b1-ketoglutarate and increased lipid peroxidation. Treatment of CHCHD2-deficient dopaminergic neurons with lipoic acid, a KGDH cofactor and antioxidant agent, resulted in decreased levels of lipid peroxidation and phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein. CHCHD10, a close homolog of CHCHD2 that is primarily linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, did not affect the KGDH pathway or lipid peroxidation. Together, these results identify KGDH metabolic pathway as a targetable mitochondrial mechanism for correction of increased lipid peroxidation and \u03b1-synuclein in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) has been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the effect of the FDA-approved Secukinumab (SEC), an IL-17A inhibitor, on PD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of SEC and its potential mechanisms in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. Male C57BL/6\u00a0J mice were mainly assigned to three groups: Sham, MPTP, and MPTP\u2009+\u2009SEC. Motor coordination was assessed using the climbing rod and rotarod tests. Dopaminergic neurons (TH\u2009+) and glial cells (Iba-1\u2009+\u2009, GFAP\u2009+) in the substantia nigra were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Flow cytometry was used to analyze immune cell populations in the brain and spleen. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were quantified using RT-PCR. SEC treatment significantly alleviated the loss of dopaminergic neurons and improved motor coordination in MPTP mice. It also reduced the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, including CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells, NK cells, and monocyte-macrophages into the brain. SEC attenuated glial activation (Iba-1\u2009+\u2009, GFAP\u2009+) and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL9), which recruit immune cells into the brain. These results suggest that Secukinumab protects dopaminergic neurons and attenuates neuroinflammation in MPTP-induced model. SEC treatment in PD might be an effective therapeutic approach for clinical application in the future. HIGHLIGHTS: \u2022 Secukinumab reduces the loss of dopaminergic neurons and axons in MPTP mice. \u2022 Secukinumab inhibits the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain in MPTP mice. \u2022 Secukinumab inhibits the activation of glial cells and reduces neuroinflammation in MPTP mice.",

    "abstract": "Ginsenoside CK (CK) is a metabolite of natural diol ginsenoside in the intestine, which has a unique chemical structure and pharmacological activity. CK has great potential in the treatment of neurologic dysfunction diseases. However, the therapeutic effect and potential mechanism of CK on Parkinson's disease (PD) have not been studied. Accordingly, this study used microbiome analysis to correlate behavioral, physiological and biochemical indices, and combined with WB to elucidate the mechanism of CK's improvement on PD. CK showed significant therapeutic effects on PD mice, which improved behavioral abnormalities such as spatial memory ability and motor coordination in PD mice, increased the activities of T-AOC and GSH-Px, decreased the MDA content, thus alleviating oxidative stress injury, suppressed the levels of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, and activated the expression of anti-inflammatory factor IL-2, which then exerted against neuroinflammation, inhibited the apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of PD mice, increased the expression of TH, and prevented the aggregation of \u03b1-Syn in the substantia nigra. Microbiomics analysis showed that CK treatment could reshape the gut microbiota of PD mice by increasing the abundance of probiotics (Bacteroides anomalies) and decreasing the number of pathogenic bacteria (Actinomycetes). Correlation analysis showed that gut microbiota had potential correlation with behavioral, physiological and biochemical indexes. Western blot results showed that CK inhibited the expression levels of apoptotic proteins Bax, caspase-3, and Bcl-2, which revealed that CK treatment could improve the dysfunction of MPTP-induced PD mice from the molecular level. Collectively, these findings will provide a basis for further development of CK as an anti-PD drug.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that gastrointestinal dysfunction and enteric nervous system pathology play a critical role in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. Considering the bidirectional relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and mood disorders, this study aimed to elucidate the effects and possible mechanisms of action of vortioxetine, a serotonergic antidepressant, on the pathophysiological changes induced by rotenone in the enteroglial cells. \u03b1-synuclein, phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein, TLR2, S100B and RAGE expression were detected in duodenal tissues of rats administered rotenone (2\u00a0mg/kg/day, s.c.) and/or vortioxetine (10\u00a0mg/kg/day, s.c.) for 28 days. For the mechanism of action studies, rat-derived enteroglial cells were treated with rotenone (10\u00a0\u03bcM) and/or vortioxetine (5\u00a0\u03bcM or 1\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h. The effects of vortioxetine were evaluated in the presence of the TLR2 antagonist C29, RAGE antagonist FPS-ZM1 and the S100B inhibitor pentamidine. TLR2, S100B, RAGE, and NF\u03baB mRNA levels and proinflammatory cytokines via RT-qPCR and ELISA. Our results demonstrate that rotenone treatment significantly increased \u03b1-synuclein, pS129-\u03b1-synuclein, TLR2, and S100B expression while reducing RAGE levels, indicating marked enteric pathology. Vortioxetine administration attenuated these effects, reducing \u03b1-synuclein accumulation and proinflammatory markers. In vitro, rotenone impaired glial responses, decreasing S100B, RAGE, and NF\u03baB markers, while vortioxetine improved these responses, promoting resynthesis of inflammatory molecules. Notably, S100B, NF\u03baB, and cytokine levels (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) were affected by C29, FPS-ZM1, and pentamidine pretreatments. Thus, vortioxetine is thought to have beneficial effects on rotenone-induced pathological changes in EGCs, and some of these effects are thought to be mediated by the TLR2/S100B/RAGE pathway.",

    "abstract": "The protein DJ-1 appears to play a protective role in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we show that endogenous neurotoxins of the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline family (TIQs), formed upon reaction of various aldehydes such as methylglyoxal (MGO) with the neurotransmitter dopamine, act as irreversible inhibitors of the esterase activity of human DJ-1, with IC50 values between 15 and 57 \u03bcM. The presence of a catechol function appears to be essential for these inhibitory effects, which may be at the origin of the oxidation of cysteine 106, a crucial residue in the DJ-1 active site, thereby leading to DJ-1 inhibition. We also show that these endogenous neurotoxins inhibit the protective effects of DJ-1 against glycated guanosine diphosphate (GDP) formation and against alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation induced by MGO. In total, the observed inhibition of DJ-1 by these endogenous neurotoxins may contribute to their damaging effects on the nervous system and, should be taken into account in therapeutic strategies for PD and related disorders.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a largely unmet need.\nMesdopetam is a novel small molecule dopamine D3 receptor antagonist aimed for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. This was a phase 2b study dose finding study to investigate efficacy and safety of 2.5\u2009mg, 5\u2009mg and 7,5\u2009mg b.i.d. in a randomized controlled trial.\nPD patients with \u22652\u2009hours of troublesome dyskinesia were randomized to placebo or mesdopetam twice daily for 12\u2009weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to week 12 in ON time without troublesome dyskinesia (Good ON-time) as recorded with home diaries. Secondary efficacy endpoints assessing ON phase dyskinesia were the modified UDysRS (sum of parts 1, 3 and 4) and MDS-UPDRS part 4.2.\nGroups did not differ in change from baseline to end of study in Good ON-time. Several secondary assessments for ON phase dyskinesia such as the modified UDysRS showed clinically relevant and statistically significant improvements for the 2.5 and 7.5\u2009mg doses. OFF time showed dose dependent decrease with highest efficacy for the 7.5\u2009mg dose. The adverse event profile was similar to placebo.\nIn this study mesdopetam failed to increase Good ON-time as compared to placebo. However, a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the prespecified secondary efficacy endpoint UDysRS warrants further investigation. Results from this dose finding study suggest 7.5\u2009mg b.i.d. to be the preferred dose for further study.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. It has been demonstrated that there is a correlation between the increase in bacterial abundance and the severity of certain symptoms associated with PD.\nthe aim of this pilot study was to analyze the effect of supplementation with prebiotic fiber on the gut microbiota (GM) and nutritional status of elderly volunteers with Parkinson's disease.\nthis is a pilot study of pre and post intervention with prebiotic fiber. All subjects involved were volunteers with PD, who were given nutritional counseling and gut microbiota measured on time cero and after 30 days of prebiotic fiber intervention.\na statistically significant difference was found in calf circumference (p 0.0422) after the intervention with prebiotic fiber. GM analyses show an initial difference in gut bacterial abundance of older people with PD and people without PD. Furthermore, our results showed a difference in bacterial families and genera after the supplementation with prebiotic fiber. in addition, we found a statistically significant difference in the val-ue of circumference calf and a trend in the improvement of body weight, Body mass index (BMI), neck circumference, arm circumference, brachial area, and Diet Quality Questionnaire (DQQ) for older adults.\nsupplementation with 20 g of prebiotic fiber for 30 days could modify the intestinal microbiota, reducing bacterial genera and phylum that are abundant in Park-inson's disease, such as Verrucomicrobia. Therefore, the use of prebiotic fiber could represent an alternative to improve intestinal health and nutritional status of people with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "To identify and validate causal protein targets that may serve as potential therapeutic interventions for both the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) through integrative proteomic and genetic analyses.\nWe utilized large-scale plasma and brain protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) datasets from the deCODE Health study and the Religious Orders Study/Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP), respectively. Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) were conducted using the OTTERS framework for plasma proteins and the FUSION tool for brain proteins, examining associations with PD onset and three progression phenotypes: composite, motor, and cognitive. Significant protein associations (FDR-corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05) from PWAS were further validated using summary-based Mendelian randomization (SMR), colocalization analyses, and reverse Mendelian randomization (MR) to establish causality. Phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (PheW-MR) was performed to assess potential side effects across 679 disease traits when targeting these proteins to reduce PD-related phenotype risk by 20%. Additionally, we conducted cellular distribution-based clustering using gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) to explore the distribution of key proteins across brain regions, constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks via the STRING database to explore interactions among proteins, and evaluated the druggability of identified targets using the DrugBank database to identify opportunities for drug repurposing.\nOur analyses identified 25 candidate proteins associated with PD phenotypes, including 16 plasma proteins linked to PD progression (10 cognitive, 4 motor, and 3 composite) and 9 plasma proteins associated with PD onset. Notably, GPNMB was implicated in both plasma and brain tissues for PD onset. PheW-MR revealed predominantly beneficial side effects for the identified targets, with 83.7% of associations indicating positive outcomes and 16.3% indicating adverse effects. Cellular clustering categorized candidate targets into three distinct expression profiles across brain cell types using ABA. PPI network analysis highlighted one key interaction cluster among the proteins for PD cognitive progression and PD onset. Druggability assessment revealed 15 out of 25 proteins had repurposing opportunities for PD treatment.\nWe have identified 25 causal protein targets associated with the onset and progression of PD, providing new insights into the research and development of treatment strategies for PD.",

Additionally, we conducted cellular distribution-based clustering using gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) to explore the distribution of key proteins across brain regions, constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks via the STRING database to explore interactions among proteins, and evaluated the druggability of identified targets using the DrugBank database to identify opportunities for drug repurposing.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the treatment strategies of Parkinson's Disease (PD) among movement disorder specialists in tertiary centres in Poland, and how literature warnings (levodopa and dopamine agonist phobia) have influenced their practice.\nThe survey was conducted between 30 November, 2020 and 18 October, 2021, in four Polish tertiary referral centres for PD (two in Gdansk, one in Sosnowiec, and one in Warsaw). Movement disorder specialists collected information on the treatment of 494 consecutive patients diagnosed with PD. The questionnaire included information on the age of the patient, the duration of PD, the Hoehn&Yahr (H&Y) stage, comorbidities, pharmacotherapy, and advanced PD therapies i.e. deep brain stimulation (DBS), levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG), and continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions (CSAI).\nLevodopa was the most prescribed medication (n = 465/494), followed by dopamine agonists (n = 292/494). The mean dose of levodopa was 810.58 \u00b1 473.11 mg, and it did not exceed 2,000 mg/d in 98.5% of patients. The mean doses of dopamine agonists used were relatively low (ropinirole 8.64 \u00b1 3.94 mg, pramipexole base 1.76 \u00b1 0.65mg). Amantadine (n = 197/494) and MAO-B inhibitors (n = 202/494) were prescribed less frequently. Catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (n = 7/494) and anticholinergics (n = 4/494) were rarely used in the studied population. Complex polytherapy with three or more PD medications was the most often used treatment strategy (n = 223/494).\nLevodopa remains the gold standard in PD treatment in tertiary movement disorder centres in Poland. Dopamine agonists formed the second most frequently prescribed group of medications; however, the observed low dosages of both levodopa and dopamine agonists may suggest a cautious approach by clinicians. Amantadine and MAO-B inhibitors (mainly rasagiline) constituted important elements of PD pharmacotherapy. The high prevalence of complex polytherapy underlines the complexity of PD management, the cautious use of single medication at high doses, and the need for personalised therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a loss of functioning neurons in the substantia nigra. Two options exist when encountering damaged neurons: replace or support. We implemented a strategy of using autologous peripheral nerve tissue, in a reparative state, to provide a collection of neurorestorative support to unhealthy neurons with the goal of modifying the motor progression of PD.\nReport on two-year compliance feasibility, safety, and clinical experience of combining this delivery at the time of deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery.\nParticipants with PD undergoing open-label peripheral nerve tissue implantation to the substantia nigra at the time of DBS surgery were followed from pre-surgery to two years after surgery through clinical evaluations.\nSeventeen of 18 participants who underwent the procedure completed the 2-year study visits. No study-related serious adverse events occurred.\nThe trial met its primary endpoints of feasibility and safety. We were able to practicably and safely implant participants and have participants comply with 2-year visits and exams. Adverse events related to study participation were deemed manageable by participants.\nParkinson's disease (PD) causes the loss of cells within the substantia nigra, which is an area of the brain involved with movement. In this study, we used a piece of nerve from a participant's own ankle to provide proteins and factors to help sick or dying cells. The goal of the study was to understand if it would be too much of a burden to ask participants to attend study visits for 2 years and if the procedure was safe. We also did preliminary testing of whether the support provided by the nerve implant could slow or stop the disease from getting worse over time. Eighteen persons with PD who were already undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery also received peripheral nerve implants to the substantia nigra. Seventeen out of 18 participants who received the implant completed the 2-year study visit, meaning that participants were willing to return for study visits and exams. The most common complaint that participants had was that the side of the foot or ankle where we took the nerve hurt or tingled, but after time, they did not feel the problem was very bothersome. Based on these results, we conclude that we could perform the surgery, the demands of the study were not too burdensome on participants, and that it was safe. The results from this study encourage us to perform more clinical trials on this procedure in the future.",

    "abstract": "Research over the past twenty years has shown that gait outcomes have a high sensitivity for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD), for detecting the effects of interventions, and for monitoring disease progression, even in early disease. However, the lack of standardization in protocols and reported gait measures is impeding data aggregation across study sites and contributes to heterogeneity in the results, thus limiting the adoption of gait outcomes in clinical trials.\nTo provide recommendations for a minimum set of gait measures to be adopted in projects evaluating people with PD to enhance standardization across the field.\nThe Gait Advisors Leading Outcomes for Parkinson's (GALOP) committee is an advisory committee for the MJFF. Based on a five-step approach, GALOP generated recommendations for standardizing protocols that assess quantitative gait measures, following expert consensus on best practices.\nBuilt on the literature and consensus amongst experts, we recommend a minimum set of meta-data to accompany gait protocols and a minimum gait assessment protocol to be performed at a comfortable speed. Suggestions on challenging testing are provided.\nTo support and empower the scientific community, we have generated recommendations to collect and share gait data gathered from people with PD using an open data repository. Standardizing gait protocols and outcomes in PD has the potential of accelerating research and clinical trials, harmonizing protocols across study sites, fostering collaborations, and in the long run, improving patient care and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "The 10-m walk test (10MWT) is a stopwatch-based clinical mobility assessment. To better understand mobility limitations, 10MWT test completion times may be complemented with gait parameters like step length. State-of-the-art augmented reality (AR) glasses can potentially do this given their unique 3D-positional data from which gait parameters may be derived. We examined the test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and face validity of gait parameters derived from AR glasses during a 10MWT in 20 people with Parkinson's disease, performed at self-selected comfortable and fast-but-safe walking speeds. AR-derived 10MWT completion times and gait parameters (mean step length, cadence, and maximal gait speed) were compared across repetitions and with lab-based (Interactive Walkway) and clinical (stopwatch) reference systems. Good-to-excellent test-retest reliability statistics were observed for test completion times and gait parameters for all systems and conditions alike. Concurrent validity was demonstrated between AR, lab-based, and clinical references for test completion times (good-to-excellent agreement: ICC > 0.879) and gait parameters (excellent agreement: ICC > 0.942). Face validity was confirmed by significant differences in test completion times and gait parameters between speed conditions in a-priori expected directions. These findings support the conclusion that gait parameters can be derived reliably and validly from AR glasses in people with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "This pilot study aimed to evaluate the usability of a new, feedback-based dexterity training system in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) and healthy adults. Seven PwPD and seven healthy adults participated in the study. The System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire Version 3 (PSSUQ) were used to assess usability. Additionally, the feedback shown as a counter, detected through newly developed algorithms, was evaluated by comparing the device-detected repetitions during six exercises to those counted by a supervisor. High median SUS scores of 92.5 were obtained in both PwPD (IQR = 81.25-98.75) and healthy adults (IQR = 87.5-93.75, maximum score 100, minimum score 0). Similarly, high PSSUQ median scores were achieved after the session (1.14, IQR = 1.00-1.33, PD; 1.08, IQR = 1.00-1.58, healthy adults, maximum score 1, minimum score 7). PwPD completed 648 repetitions, with 551 (85%) correctly recognized by the system. For healthy adults, 883 out of 913 (97%) repetitions were classified as right. The present study showed high usability and high perceived user satisfaction for the new training system in all study participants. The system effectively detects exercise repetition rates but requires further refinement to enhance accuracy for specific pinch grip exercises.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains essentially clinical, based on the subjective observations of clinicians. In addition, misdiagnosis with other neuro disorders, such as Alzheimer's (AD), can occur. Herein, an untargeted lipidomic analysis of 75 plasma samples was performed to identify lipid species capable of discriminating between these two neuro groups. Therefore, PLS-DA and OPLS-DA analysis revealed significant differences in patient profiles in the sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid categories. As a result, a putative lipid biomarker panel was developed, which included HexCer (40:1; O2) and PC (O-32:0), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) > 80, respectively. This panel was effective in discriminating between diseased and healthy subjects, but most importantly, it could discriminate between two neurodegenerative disorders that can present similar symptoms, namely PD and AD. Together, these findings suggest that the dysregulated metabolism of lipids plays a critical role in AD and PD pathology and may represent a valuable clinical tool for their diagnosis. Thus, further targeted studies are encouraged to better understand the underlying mechanisms of PD and confirm the diagnostic potency of the identified lipid metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by heterogeneous symptomatology, in which the classical motor features of Parkinsonism are associated with clinically significant non-motor symptoms. Olfactory alteration, as a manifestation of PD's premotor or prodromal phase, is well known. These impairments can lead to malnutrition, decreased appetite, and depression, thereby worsening patients' quality of life. However, only a few studies clarify the mechanisms, characteristics, and clinical diagnostic and therapeutic implications of impaired taste perception. Moreover, unlike most motor features of PD, non-motor symptoms often have limited treatment options or responses. The purpose of this review is to collate and describe all relevant studies on taste and smell alterations in patients with PD and how these alterations could affect nutritional status. Our search aimed to identify English-language research articles and reviews published in peer-reviewed journals over the past two decades (2004-2024), while also including older foundational studies when relevant. Several studies show that hyposmia in PD worsens over time, potentially linked to structural changes in the brain's basal ganglia and piriform cortex. Severe hyposmia is also associated with a higher risk of dementia in PD patients and can negatively influence quality of life, affecting social interactions and nutrition. Regarding taste perception, recent studies have suggested that hypogeusia may occur even in the prodromal stage of PD, such as in patients with REM sleep disorder, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Additionally, research has explored the role of bitter taste receptors and their possible involvement in inflammation and \u03b1-synuclein misfolding, suggesting a link between taste dysfunction and immune system changes in PD. Attention was then focused on the gut microbiota's link to the central nervous system and its contribution to gustatory dysfunctions, as well as how the nasal microbiome influences PD progression by altering the olfactory system. Nowadays, the primary role of a correct diet in the overall treatment of PD patients is becoming increasingly important for practitioners. Diet should be included among the available aids to counteract some aspects of the pathology itself. For all these reasons, it is also crucial to determine whether these chemosensory impairments could serve as disease markers, helping to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been extensively used in different animal species to develop chemical models of PD. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of acute exposure to MPTP (3 \u00d7 150 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) on adult zebrafish by assessing the neurochemical, transcriptional, and motor changes associated with PD pathogenesis. MPTP treatment resulted in a significant decrease in brain catecholamines, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and normetanephrine. Additionally, a trend towards decreased levels of dopamine precursors (tyrosine and L-DOPA) and degradation products (3-MT and DOPAC) was also observed, although these changes were not statistically significant. Gene expression analysis showed the downregulation of ",

    "abstract": "This review explores the promising potential of repurposing type 2 diabetes (T2D) medications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), highlighting the shared pathophysiological mechanisms between these two age-related conditions, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ferroptosis. The overlap suggests that existing diabetes drugs could target the common pathways involved in both conditions. Specifically, the review discusses how T2D medications, including metformin (Met), peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, incretins, and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, can improve mitochondrial function, reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and potentially inhibit ferroptosis. The connection between ferroptosis and existing treatments, including diabetes medication, are only beginning to be explored. The limited data can be attributed also to the complexity of mechanisms involved in ferroptosis and Parkinson's disease and to the fact that the specific role of ferroptosis in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis has not been a primary focus until recent. Despite the promising preclinical evidence, clinical findings are mixed, underscoring the need for further research to elucidate these drugs' roles in neurodegeneration. Repurposing existing diabetes medications that have well-established safety profiles for Parkinson's disease treatment could significantly reduce the time and cost associated with drug development and could offer a more comprehensive approach to managing Parkinson's disease compared to treatments targeting a single mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Additionally, PD severely impacts physical abilities and independence. Chronic pain, affecting 67.6% of PD patients, varies in form and presentation, and it is often underdiagnosed.\nThis study investigated the association between chronic pain and motor symptom severity in PD patients.\nThis analysis used data from a cross-sectional study on 52 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients conducted at Jena University Hospital, Germany. The dataset, available on Dryad, included demographics; clinical reports; and assessments of coping strategies, quality of life, and pain. Descriptive statistics, a bivariate analysis, and an ordinal logistic regression model were executed to explore the association between pain and motor symptom severity (MSS). A direct acyclic graph was used to represent the relationship between variables and identify potential confounders, and an outcomes definition sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact of using pain intensity as an outcome. The E-value was calculated to evaluate the strength of association needed by an unmeasured confounder to nullify the observed association.\nA total of 50 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients were included, with 64% being male, with an average age of 76.1 years. The sample included 20 patients without pain and 30 with chronic pain. The bivariate analysis did not identify significant differences in disease duration, cognitive function, and non-motor symptoms between pain and no-pain groups. However, significant differences (\nChronic pain is strongly associated with MSS in PD patients, with a more pronounced effect as MSS progresses from medium to severe, supporting a dose-response relationship. Effect sizes suggest a robust association, emphasizing the need for pain assessment in managing motor symptoms in PD.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying extrapyramidal disorders and their anatomical substrate have been extensively investigated. Recently, the role of the claustrum in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions has been better detailed. The main aim of this review was to summarize the supporting evidence for the role of the claustrum in degenerative and vascular parkinsonism.\nThe anatomy, biology, vascular supply, and connections of the claustrum in humans were identified and described, providing the substrate for the vascular involvement of the claustrum in large- and small-vessel disease. The vascular supply of the claustrum includes up to three different sources from a single artery, the middle cerebral artery, and it is known as territory with an intermediate hemodynamic risk. The connections of the claustrum make it a sensory integrator and a relevant point in several networks, from consciousness to movement planning.\nThe claustrum is still an incompletely explained structure. However, recent description of its multiple connections indicate that it is involved in several diseases, including Parkinson's disease. The evidence underlying its potential role in vascular parkinsonism is still scarce, but it might be a field warranting future investigations.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is recognized as the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, with its incidence rate projected to increase alongside ongoing population growth. However, the precise etiology of Parkinson's disease remains elusive. This article explores the inflammatory mechanisms linking gut microbiota to Parkinson's disease, emphasizing alterations in gut microbiota and their metabolites that influence the disease's progression through the bidirectional transmission of inflammatory signals along the gut-brain axis. Building on this mechanistic framework, this article further discusses research methodologies and treatment strategies focused on gut microbiota metabolites, including metabolomics detection techniques, animal model investigations, and therapeutic approaches such as dietary interventions, probiotic treatments, and fecal transplantation. Ultimately, this article aims to elucidate the relationship between gut microbiota metabolites and the inflammatory mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease, thereby paving the way for novel avenues in the research and treatment of this condition.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition in which degeneration mostly occurs in the dopamine (DA)-producing neurons within the substantia nigra in the midbrain. As a result, individuals with this condition suffer from progressively worsening motor impairment because of the resulting DA deficiency, along with an array of other symptoms that, over time, force them into a completely debilitating state. As an age-related disease, PD has only risen in prevalence over the years; thus, an emphasis has recently been placed on discovering a new treatment for this condition that is capable of attenuating its progression. The gut microbiota has become an area of intrigue among PD studies, as research into this topic has shown that imbalances in the gut microbiota (colloquially known as gut dysbiosis) seemingly promote the primary etiologic factors that have been found to be associated with PD and its pathologic progression. With this knowledge, research into PD treatment has begun to expand beyond synthetic pharmaceutical compounds, as a growing emphasis has been placed on studying plant-derived polyphenolic compounds, namely flavonoids, as a new potential therapeutic approach. Due to their capacity to promote a state of homeostasis in the gut microbiota and their long-standing history as powerful medicinal agents, flavonoids have begun to be looked at as promising therapeutic agents capable of attenuating several of the pathologic states seen amidst PD through indirect and direct means. This review article focuses on three flavonoids, specifically epigallocatechin-3-gallate, quercetin, and kaempferol, discussing the mechanisms through which these powerful flavonoids can potentially prevent gut dysbiosis, neuroinflammation, and other molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progression of PD, while also exploring their real-world application and how issues of bioavailability and potential drug interactions can be circumvented or exploited.",

    "abstract": "Background/Objections: The pharmacological management of Parkinson's Disease (PD) is often supplemented by deep brain stimulation (DBS) to tackle problems of advanced disease such as motor fluctuation, dyskinesias or medication-resistant tremor. DBS uses high-frequency stimulation with spatially distributed electrodes to produce electrical fields that influence neuronal networks. The programming of such stimulation is complex and time-consuming. Recent technological advancements have enabled DBS systems to record local field potentials (LFPs). In conjunction with biomarker discovery, such as beta oscillations, this shows promise in streamlining the DBS programming process. This review aims to synthesize the current literature investigating LFP characteristics in PD in order to understand the place of LFPs in assisting with DBS programming.\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases including OVID MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, resulting in 738 identified articles; 122 studies remained after screening and 87 studies were selected for detailed analysis.\nAnalyzing LFPs clearly has the potential to assist or streamline DBS programming in clinical practice, but there are knowledge gaps and challenges to overcome, especially in the utilization of intraoperative LFPs.\nMore research is required to compare different algorithms that utilize LFPs in DBS programming to identify a simple, practical and time-saving algorithm incorporating reliable LFP biomarkers that will enhance the DBS programming experience for both patients and clinicians.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) is implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) and plays a significant role in neuronal degeneration. Iron response proteins (IRPs) bind to iron response elements (IREs) found in the 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) of the messenger RNA that encode the \u03b1-Syn gene. This study used multi-spectroscopic approach techniques to investigate the impact of iron on \u03b1-Syn IRE RNA binding to IRP1. The formation of a stable complex between \u03b1-Syn RNA and IRP1 was suggested by fluorescence quenching results. Fluorescence measurements showed that \u03b1-Syn RNA and IRP1 had a strong interaction, with a binding constant (",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the impact of the elevation training mask (ETM) on swallowing safety and swallowing efficiency in patients with Parkinson's disease (PWP) when used as a respiratory muscle strengthening tool. Study Design. Prospective cohort study. Setting. Tertiary university-affiliated medical center. Thirteen PWP underwent Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing and spirometry assessments both before and after a 4-week ETM use, which included incrementally increasing resistance each week. Measurements taken included EAT-10, swallowing disturbances questionnaire (SDQ), Penetration Aspiration Score (PAS), Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale, and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF). Disease severity was assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Eleven out of 13 male participants (median age 70\u00a0years, UPDRS 33, disease duration 8.5\u00a0years) completed the 4-week protocol (84.6% completion rate). Vallecular residue significantly decreased for solids (median from 3.0 [IQR: 2.0-3.0] to 2.0 [IQR: 1.0-2.0], p\u2009=\u20090.028) and semi-solids (from 3.0 [IQR: 2.0-4.0] to 2.0 [IQR: 1.0-3.0], p\u2009=\u20090.025), with a non-significant improvement for liquids (from 2.0 [IQR: 2.0-2.0] to 2.0 [IQR: 1.0-2.0], p\u2009=\u20090.19). Patient-reported outcomes (EAT-10, SDQ, VHI-10, RSI) and PEF showed non-significant trends toward improvement. A 4-week use of ETM, serving as a form of respiratory muscle strengthening, demonstrated specific improvements in vallecular residue for semi-solid and solid consistencies in PWP with dysphagia. While other swallowing and respiratory measures showed positive trends, these changes did not reach statistical significance. Further research with a larger cohort is needed to evaluate ETM's role in swallowing rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is a well-established treatment for improving motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its effects on patients with cognitive impairment (CI) remain controversial due to the unique challenges and risks posed by cognitive decline. This study aimed to evaluate the mid- to long-term impact of STN-DBS on motor function, non-motor symptoms, and QOL in PD patients with CI. A retrospective cohort of 72 PD patients who underwent STN-DBS and 73 non-DBS patients was analyzed. Baseline and follow-up assessments (minimum one-year follow-up) included motor function (MDS-UPDRS III \"off\"), non-motor symptoms (NMSS), QOL (PDQ-8), and cognitive function (MMSE). Patients were stratified into a CI cohort based on education-adjusted MMSE cutoffs, with 30 patients in the STN-DBS group and 23 in the non-DBS group. Over two years, the STN-DBS group showed significant improvements in motor function, reduced medication burden (LEDD), and enhanced QOL. Notably, patients with CI in the STN-DBS group achieved better long-term motor and non-motor outcomes compared to the non-DBS group. These results highlight the potential of STN-DBS to offer sustained benefits for cognitively impaired PD patients, though further research is necessary to confirm its long-term safety and efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, with motor and non-motor symptoms being its main clinical manifestations. Neuroinflammation has been shown to involve in pathogenesis of PD. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) in PD exhibited reduction in number and suppressive activity. Existing methods to increase the Tregs remains challenging for clinical application because of the difficulty in Tregs expanding or serious side-effects. Therefore, new approaches still need to be explored to balance the amount and activity of Tregs. In this study, we assessed the protective effects of IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes (IL-2C) on mouse models of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). And the results showed that IL-2C significantly increased the number of Tregs both in spleen and brain, accompanied by reduced nigral dopaminergic neuron loss and behavioral defects. Besides, IL-2C also attenuated neuroinflammation as observed by diminished glial activation, fewer infiltration of CD4",

    "abstract": "Sleep disturbance (SD) is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and adversely affect the quality of life (QOL). Although dopamine dysfunction has been implicated, the specific role of dopaminergic activity in SD among patients with PD remains unclear. Given that dopamine-related medications can affect sleep, it is essential to assess SD in drug-na\u00efve patients. This study investigated the association between SD and uptake of striatal dopamine transporters using Dopamine Transporter Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography with \nWe retrospectively analyzed 112 drug-na\u00efve patients through the PD Sleep Scale-version-2 (PDSS-2) and DAT-SPECT. Patients were divided into SD and non-SD groups using a PDSS-2 cut-off score of 15. The Mann-Whitney U test and binomial regression were used to compare the groups.\nSD was identified in 47.3\u00a0% of participants, correlating significantly with increased age, more severe motor symptoms, cognitive decline, depressive symptoms, and reduced QOL scores. Binomial regression analyses-adjusted for sex, age, motor dysfunction, cognitive function, and nocturnal autonomic cardiovascular dysfunction-showed that reduced DAT-SPECT uptake in the left anterior and posterior putamen significantly contributed to higher PDSS-2 scores.\nThis study demonstrated a link between SD and putamen DAT-SPECT uptake in drug-na\u00efve patients with PD, indicating the role of dopamine in sleep regulation. These findings underscore the importance of managing SD in patients with PD to improve QOL and suggest the need for further investigation of the impact of dopaminergic dysfunction on sleep.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) involves the loss of dopamine neurons and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), leading to Lewy bodies. While \u03b1-syn-targeting immunotherapies show promise, clinical application is challenging. Emerging strategies include nano-platforms for targeted delivery and imaging, and cell-based therapies with patient-specific dopaminergic neurons, aiming to enhance treatment effectiveness despite challenges. Exosome-based methodologies are emerging as a promising area of research in PD due to their role in the spread of \u03b1-syn pathology. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that can carry misfolded \u03b1-syn and transfer it between cells, contributing to the progression of PD. They can be isolated from biological fluids such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid, making them valuable biomarkers for the disease. Additionally, engineering exosomes to deliver therapeutic agents, including small molecules, RNA, or proteins, offers a novel approach for targeted therapy, capitalizing on their natural ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Ongoing studies are evaluating the safety and efficacy of these engineered exosomes in clinical settings. This review explores the role of exosomes in PD, focusing on their potential for diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of pathology. It highlights advancements and future directions in using exosomes as biomarkers and therapeutic tools.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, and accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in the substantial nigra. Emerging evidence identifies ferroptosis as a regulated iron-dependent cell death mechanism marked by excessive lipid peroxidation (LPO) as a key contributor to PD pathogenesis. Ferroptosis is intertwined with critical disease processes such as aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein protein, oxidative stress generation, mitochondrial alteration, iron homeostasis dysregulation, and neuroinflammation. This mechanism disrupts cellular homeostasis by impairing iron metabolism and antioxidant pathways like the xc",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is predominantly controlled through pharmacotherapy. People with PD have highly complex medication regimens that are often poorly managed during hospital admissions. This project aims to understand the issues experienced by patients with PD and healthcare staff that impacted their medication management during their hospital admission at a tertiary metropolitan hospital in New South Wales, Australia.\nThis project focuses on the mixed-methods diagnostics phase of the healthcare redesign approach to health service improvement, utilising organisational data, online surveys, interviews, and focus groups.\nThe findings from this project highlight key areas to address to improve the medication management of patients with PD admitted to hospital. The organisational data (\nPoor PD medication management in hospital impacts the patient experience and should be improved to ensure better outcomes for patients and the health services.",

    "abstract": "Environmental toxins and epigenetic changes have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This paper aimed to (i) identify environmental toxins associated with AD, PD, and ALS, (ii) locate potential industrial sources of toxins in the United States (U.S.), and (iii) assess epigenetic changes driven by exposure to toxins reported by patients. Environmental factors and epigenetic biomarkers of neurodegeneration were compiled from 69 studies in the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) and geographic information system approaches. Some 127 environmental toxins have been associated or putatively associated with AD, PD, or ALS, with four toxic metals (As, Cd, Mn, and Hg) common to all three of these neurodegenerative diseases. Environmental toxins associated with epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA methylation) in patients include air pollutants, metals, and organic chemicals (e.g., pesticides, mycotoxins, and cyanotoxins). Geographic analysis showed that study locations (e.g., U.S., Europe, and East Asia) were selected by researchers based on convenience of access rather than exposure risk and disease prevalence. We conclude that several toxins and epigenetic markers shared among neurodegenerative diseases could serve as attractive future targets guiding environmental quality improvements and aiding in early disease detection.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are the most common neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). The development of aberrant protein aggregates and the progressive and permanent loss of neurons are the major characteristic features of these disorders. Although the precise mechanisms causing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are still unknown, there is a wealth of evidence suggesting that misfolded proteins, accumulation of misfolded proteins, dysfunction of neuroreceptors and mitochondria, dysregulation of enzymes, and the release of neurotransmitters significantly influence the pathophysiology of these diseases. There is no effective protective medicine or therapy available even with the availability of numerous medications. There is an urgent need to create new and powerful bioactive compounds since the number of people with NDDs is rising globally. Heterocyclic compounds have consistently played a pivotal role in drug discovery due to their exceptional pharmaceutical properties. Many clinically approved drugs, such as galantamine hydrobromide, donepezil hydrochloride, memantine hydrochloride, and opicapone, feature heterocyclic cores. As these heterocyclic compounds have exceptional therapeutic potential, heterocycles are an intriguing research topic for the development of new effective therapeutic drugs for PD and AD. This review aims to provide current insights into the development and potential use of heterocyclic compounds targeting diverse therapeutic targets to manage and potentially treat patients with AD and PD.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common gait disorder that often accompanies Parkinson's disease (PD). The current understanding of brain functional organization in FOG was built on the assumption that the functional connectivity (FC) of networks is static, but FC changes dynamically over time. We aimed to characterize the dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) in patients with FOG based on high temporal-resolution functional MRI (fMRI).\nEighty-seven PD patients, including 29 with FOG and 58 without FOG, and 32 healthy controls underwent resting-state fMRI. Spatial independent component analysis and a sliding-window approach were used to estimate DFC.\nFour patterns of structured FC 'states' were identified: a frequent and sparsely connected network (State I), a less frequent but highly synchronized network (State IV), and two states with opposite connecting directions between the visual network and the sensorimotor network (positively connected in State II, negatively connected in State III). Compared with the non-FOG group, patients with FOG spent significantly less time in State II and more time in State III. The longer dwell time in State III was correlated with more severe FOG symptoms. The fractional window of State III tended to correlate to visual-spatial and executive dysfunction in FOG. Moreover, fewer transitions between brain states and lower variability in local efficiency were observed in FOG, suggesting a relatively 'rigid' brain.\nThis study highlights how visuomotor network dynamics are related to the presence and severity of FOG in PD patients, which provides new insights into understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms that underly FOG. \u00a9 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

Compared with the non-FOG group, patients with FOG spent significantly less time in State II and more time in State III. The longer dwell time in State III was correlated with more severe FOG symptoms. The fractional window of State III tended to correlate to visual-spatial and executive dysfunction in FOG. Moreover, fewer transitions between brain states and lower variability in local efficiency were observed in FOG, suggesting a relatively 'rigid' brain.",

    "abstract": "In neuropsychological diagnostics, the assignment of cognitive tests to domains is usually not empirically based. Hence, we aimed to assess the dimensionality structure of cognition in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and conceptually replicate the findings in cognitively healthy individuals (CHIs).\nWe performed Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) for dimensionality analysis of cognitive test scores in \nEGA identified five dimensions. After removing redundancy identified by UVA, EGA identified a unidimensional structure of cognitive test scores. The findings were conceptually replicated in CHIs.\nThe findings imply the need to re-evaluate the composition of cognitive test batteries to reduce redundancy and improve the validity of cognitive diagnostics. Cognition may be better described as a network of interrelated cognitive functions rather than a factorial structure of latent cognitive domains.\nCognitive test scores of the same paradigm were strongly associated with each other.This finding indicates redundancy in the cognitive test battery.After removing redundancy, scores were best represented by unidimensional structures.The findings in Parkinson's disease were conceptually replicated in healthy controls.The results suggest that cognition should be viewed as a complex \"network\" of interrelated functions.",

    "abstract": "Increased iron accumulation measured by quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has been observed in various brain regions, especially substantia nigra (SN), in Parkinson's disease (PD). Glymphatic dysfunction evaluated by diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) in PD has also attracted much attention recently. This study aimed to compare and combine DTI-ALPS and QSM of SN in the diagnosis and severity assessment of PD.\nAs a case-control study, we retrospectively recruited 60 PD patients and 60 matched healthy controls. The DTI-ALPS index, QSM of SN, and their combination were calculated and further compared between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the diagnostic performance. We further analyzed the correlation of the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III score with DTI-ALPS and QSM of SN.\nThe average DTI-ALPS was significantly lower, whereas the average QSM of bilateral SN was significantly higher in PD [median (interquartile range): 1.38 (1.26-1.53); 0.09 (0.07-0.10)] compared to healthy controls [1.52 (1.41-1.71), P<0.001; 0.08 (0.07-0.09), P=0.020]. The combination showed a significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) of 0.801 than that of DTI-ALPS (0.729) or QSM of SN (0.624) in discriminating PD from healthy controls. Moreover, the average QSM of bilateral SN showed significant correlations with the MDS-UPDRS III score (rho =-0.276, P=0.034).\nDTI-ALPS and QSM of SN are potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and severity assessment of PD. The combination of them may improve the diagnostic performance.",

    "abstract": "Sexual health is influenced by a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors, all of which can be impacted by Parkinson's disease (PD). Female sexual dysfunction includes reduced sexual desire and/or arousal, pain during sexual activity, or difficulty achieving orgasm. Despite its impact on quality of life, sexual health in women with PD remains poorly understood.\nTo investigate the impact of motor, non-motor, and social PD aspects on sexual health of women with PD.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study with 100 women with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-3) who reported an active sex life in the last six months. Data were collected via remote interviews and included demographic and clinical features, cognitive capacity, motor and non-motor experiences, fatigue, self-esteem, sleep disorders, couple relationship quality, depressive symptoms, and sexual health assessments using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Sexual Quotient-Female (SQ-F). Multiple regression models were used to identify predictors of FSFI and SQ-F scores.\nResults indicated that while several motor, non-motor, and social factors correlated with sexual health, only couple relationship quality and sleep quality significantly predicted both short-term (FSFI) and long-term (SQ-F) sexual health. No significant associations were observed with age, disease onset, postmenopausal status, or daily medication dosage.\nThe present study's evidence identifies multiple key areas, such as couple's relationship quality and sleep quality that could be targeted for intervention to improve sexual health in women with PD.\nSexual problems are common in people with Parkinson's disease. Many factors, including biological, psychological, and social aspects affected by Parkinson's disease, can influence sexual health. However, sexual problems in women with Parkinson's disease are not well understood and have not been thoroughly researched. This study aims to address this gap by focusing specifically on women with Parkinson's disease. This study looked at how motor, non-motor, and social factors impact the short- and long-term sexual health of women with Parkinson's disease. The study included 100 women diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, with an average age of 54 years. These women had mild to moderate Parkinson's disease and had an active sex life in the past six months.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a growing burden with varied clinical manifestations and responses to Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation (STN-DBS). At present, there is no effective and simple machine learning model based on comprehensive clinical scales to predict the improvement in motor symptoms of PD treated with DBS. A total of 647 PD patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China were enrolled retrospectively. LightGBM machine learning algorithm was used for modeling, and 123 PD patients from Qingdao Municipal Hospital were used as external data to verify the effectiveness of the model. The study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry with the registration number of ChiCTR2300073955. The LightGBM model outperformed others, demonstrating an internal test set AUC of 0.874 (95%CI [0.822-0.927]) and an average AUC of 0.921\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 during cross-validation. The external validation yielded an AUC of 0.769 (95% CI[0.685-0.853]). Key predictive variables identified include MMSE scores, HAMA scores, years of education, medication improvement rate, and preoperative UPDRS scores. The results indicate that the LightGBM model based on the top seven influencing factors is a promising tool for predicting the improvement in motor symptoms of PD after 1 year of STN-DBS.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a challenge, especially because it is considered highly individualized. The Brazilian Academy of Neurology (ABN) has identified the need to disseminate knowledge about its management, adapting the best evidence to the Brazilian population. The present article aims to report the recommendations for the treatment of non-motor symptoms of PD, developed by a group of specialists in movement disorders from the ABN's scientific department. In 2021, the first part, referring to the motor symptoms of PD, was published. The main non-motor symptoms were addressed-among them neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, cognitive alteration, and psychosis-as well as the possible recommended therapies and medications used to control pain, sleep disorders, and dysautonomia.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of clear speech on listener discrimination and listener effort.\nSeventeen normal-hearing young adults listened to recorded sentences spoken by individuals with Parkinson disease and hypokinetic dysarthria pre- and post-clear speech instruction. Sentences were presented in the background noise at four different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We quantified listener discrimination by the number of correct words the participant repeated back and the SNR at which the participant achieved 50% correct word recognition (SNR-50). We quantified listener effort subjectively and with pupillometry. Mixed-model analyses of variance were used to determine the main effect of speech condition (habitual, clear), the main effect of dB SNR (+10, +5, 0, and -5), and the interaction between speech condition and dB SNR for (a) number of correct words, (b) subjective listening effort, and (c) mean pupil diameter. A paired-samples \nBetter discrimination in the clear condition was indicated by significantly more correct words repeated back and a significantly lower SNR-50. Reduced listening effort in the clear condition was indicated by significantly lower subjectively reported listening effort and smaller mean pupil diameter. The greatest difference between the clear and habitual condition was at 0 dB SNR.\nClear speech instruction improved listener discrimination and reduced effort indicated by subjective, behavioral, and physiological measurements. The greatest improvement was seen in adverse listening conditions with background noise, but when the background noise was too loud to overcome, there was no benefit to hearing clear versus habitual speech.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the potential causal relationship between depression and Parkinson's disease (PD) using Mendelian randomization (MR). Summary statistics for depression and PD were obtained from 2 large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving individuals of European ancestry. Independent genetic loci associated with depression and PD were identified as instrumental variables. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) approach was used as the primary method for causal inference, while MR-Egger and weighted median methods served as supplementary analyses to verify the robustness of the results. Heterogeneity tests, multiple validity checks, and leave-one-out sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the reliability of the findings. The IVW analysis yielded an odds ratio of 1.44 (95% confidence interval: 1.001-2.077, P\u2005=\u2005.048), suggesting a potential causal relationship between depression and PD. No evidence of heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy was found, and sensitivity analyses confirmed the reliability of the results. This study applied 2-sample MR analysis to genetic data, revealing a causal link between depression and the development of PD. These findings highlight the importance of early screening and intervention for individuals with depression to reduce the risk of developing PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive motor symptoms, including tremors, bradykinesia, and postural instability. The disease is characterized by dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra, leading to cognitive decline and motor dysfunction. Dietary supplements, known as nutraceuticals, have numerous health and medical benefits for treating and preventing the disease. Nutraceuticals offer neuroprotection through several mechanisms, including iron chelation, modulation of the cell-signaling pathway, scavenging of superoxide radicals and ROS, and suppression of inflammation. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of nutraceuticals as a complementary approach to traditional pharmaceutical treatments. Nutritional supplements such as Coenzyme Q10, Lycopene, Resveratrol, and Omega-3 fatty acids offer neuroprotection by targeting alpha-synuclein misfolding, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation, potentially reducing the disease progression and improving patients' quality of life.",

    "abstract": "To our knowledge, no randomized clinical trials have compared the efficacy and safety of teleneurorehabilitation (TNR) with in-person rehabilitation in Parkinson disease (PD) during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of TNR among patients with PD during the COVID-19 lockdown.\nThe TELEPARK single-center, assessor-blinded, randomized clinical trial was conducted over 11 months from September 2020 to July 2021, with follow-up after 12 weeks. Final data could be analyzed on July 1, 2024. Patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with idiopathic PD with Hoehn and Yahr stage 1 to 2.5, Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24 or higher, and who possessed a smartphone allowing videocalling were eligible for inclusion and randomized to in-person or TNR therapy.\nThe in-person group received physiotherapy, aerobic, and breathing exercises for 30 minutes in person once a week for 4 weeks and then once every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. The TNR group received in-person sessions on day 1, followed by supervised sessions via videocalling once a week for the first 4 weeks, then once every 2 weeks for 8 weeks.\nThe primary outcome was mean change in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (MDS-UPDRS III) postintervention score from baseline. Mean changes in postintervention MDS-UPDRS II and III, Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 Summary Index (PDQ8-SI), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and functional reach test (FRT) scores from baseline between groups was assessed using unpaired t tests.\nA total of 63 participants (28 in-person and 35 TNR) were analyzed. Mean (SD) ages in the in-person and TNR groups were 60.50 (7.08) years and 62.80 (12.46) years, respectively. Twelve of 28 patients in the in-person group (42.9%) and 16 of 35 patients in the TNR group (45.7%) were female. Mean (SD) MDS-UPDRS III scores were significantly lower following TNR (pre-TNR: 35.17 [17.72] vs post-TNR: 28.6 [19.7]; P\u2009=\u2009.001). Mean (SD) change in postintervention MDS-UPDRS III scores was not significantly different between the 2 groups (TNR: -6.74 [11.07] vs in-person: -7.54 [10.52]; P\u2009=\u2009.39). Median changes in NMSS and PDQ8-SI scores were similar between the groups.\nTNR is safe and effective in improving motor and nonmotor symptoms and quality of life among Indian patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Observation studies suggest that coffee consumption may lower the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study was to explore the causal relationship and genetic association between coffee consumption and the age-at-onset (AAO), risk, and progression of PD. Using Mendelian randomization, we identified a significant association between coffee consumption and delayed PD AAO (IVW: OR, 1.91; 95% CI 1.53-2.38; P=8.072e-09), but no causal association or genetic correlation with PD risk or progression. Our findings suggest a potential protective causal effect of higher coffee consumption on PD AAO, with no evidence of an association with PD risk or progression.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation may impact the endocytosis of dopamine transporter (DAT) by influencing processes like neuronal survival, thereby contributing to the initiation and progression of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Some small molecule inhibitors or natural bioactive compounds have the potential to modulate epigenetic processes, thereby reversing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) reprogramming and abnormal differentiation, offering potential therapeutic effects for PD. Although no specific DNA modification enzyme directly regulates DAT endocytosis, enzymes such as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) may indirectly influence DAT endocytosis by regulating the expression of genes associated with this process. DNA modifications impact DAT endocytosis by modulating key signaling pathways, including the (protein kinase C) PKC and D2 receptor (D2R) pathways. Key enzymes involved in RNA modifications that influence DAT endocytosis include m",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the association between a new inflammatory marker, systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in adult population.\nA cross-sectional design was used, participants were recruited from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2020. Three logistic regression models were used to explore the association between SII and the risk of PD, and subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were used. In addition, the restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to explore the dose-response relationship between SII and PD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to explore the diagnostic value of SII for PD.\nA total of 54,027 adults (mean age 35 years) were included in this study. The results of logistic regression showed that after adjusted for all covariates, compared with the Q1 group (lowest quartile in SII), the risk of PD in the Q3 group (OR = 1.82, 95%CI = 1.20-2.82, \nSII is positively correlated with the prevalence of PD in the adult population, and SII can help differentiate between PD and non-PD cases.",

    "abstract": "Since both serotonergic and dopaminergic afferents densely innervate many parts of the central nervous system, intact crosstalk between serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) transmission is essential for regulating synaptic plasticity in the striatum (STR), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hippocampus (HPC).. Experimental models have provided strong evidence of a synergistic action of DA and 5-HT convergent release in PFC, HPC, and STR to modulate motor control, learning, and memory processes. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms underlying the actions of agonists and antagonists of 5-HT and DA receptors on striatal synaptic plasticity in physiological conditions and Parkinson's disease (PD), a movement disorder in which an imbalance of these two neurotransmitter systems has been hypothesized. This review will also discuss the interactions between 5-HT and DA in PFC and HPC, with particular regard to the influence of this crosstalk on synaptic plasticity and learning. Finally, we will provide an overview of how stimulation or inhibition of DA and 5- HT receptors affects these neurotransmitter expression levels in the three brain regions of interest.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder, affecting approximately 1% of the general population over 65 years of age. PD is commonly associated with the development of motor and non-motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms arise decades earlier than motor symptoms due to the degeneration of GABAergic, serotonergic, and other neurons involved in autonomic regulation. However, motor symptoms in PD are developed due to degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of midbrain. The PD neuropathology is related to the progressive loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc of midbrain. Particularly, dysfunction of serotonergic system is implicated in the development of non-motor symptoms such as sleep disorders, cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety. In addition, dysfunction of serotonergic neurons which affects the dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc leads to the development of motor symptoms. Moreover, dysfunction of serotonergic neurons is associated with the development of L-dopamine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia. Consistently, administration of serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonist attenuates the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. These findings emphasized the possible role of serotonergic system in PD. However, the underlying mechanisms that mediate the latent effect of 5-HT in PD are not completely elucidated. Therefore, this mini-review aims to discuss the exact role of 5-HT in PD, and how the 5-HT modulators affect PD neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine in the substantia nigra resulting in movement disorder. Although several computational models have been proposed to explore different aspects of PD, a comprehensive computational model of PD and its suppression remains elusive. This study presents a computational model of the Cortico-Basal Ganglia Thalamus (CBGT) network, and demonstrates the effects of close-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a potential therapeutic intervention. The model focuses on addressing abnormal brain wave patterns associated with PD-related hand movement through DBS. To assess the model performance, a three-link manipulator is incorporated into the CBGT model, with the joints corresponding to shoulder, elbow and wrist of human arm. PD-like symptoms are simulated by modulating the dopaminergic input. The striatal (STR) neurons were selected as target neurons for application of DBS. A proportional-integral (PI) controller regulates DBS at different frequencies in striatal neurons based on errors in manipulator movement. The effectiveness of DBS at STR was compared with the DBS at globus pallidus externus and subthalamic nucleus. DBS suppressed neuronal signal oscillations at 13-30\u00a0Hz and reduced abnormal hand movements. The results demonstrate that application of DBS at STR could correct manipulator movement. Additionally, the trajectory of movement by the end-effector were compared with DBS at different target neurons in CBGT. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the proposed computational model in development of neuroprosthesis for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) gene have been causally linked to familial Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is primarily characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain. \u0391-Syn plays a pivotal role in the formation of Lewy bodies (LB), serving as a prominent pathological marker in PD. Growing evidence has illuminated the involvement of the insulin signaling pathway dysfunction in various neurodegenerative models. This study set out to explore how \u03b1-Syn influences the insulin signaling pathway and the overall lifespan of fruit flies afflicted with Parkinson's disease. It has been established that the \u03b1-Syn gene affects mitochondrial function, with mutations leading to mitochondrial impairments and increased oxidative stress, which ultimately contributes to the death of dopaminergic neurons.The impairment of mitochondrial function disrupts metabolism and exerts an adverse influence on the insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are investigated and observed a decrease in the expression of PERK (Protein kinase R-like ER kinase) during ER stress. These findings confirmed the intricate interplay between the insulin signaling pathway and the activation of the \"PERK-ER\" stress pathway. However, the degeneration of neurons triggers a neuroinflammatory response, which are found to be mitigated by the improvement of insulin signaling and the \"PERK-ER\" stress-related pathway. This study's results shed light on the novel regulatory role of PERK within the insulin signaling pathway and suggest its potential as a therapeutic candidate for modulating neuroinflammation in the context of \u03b1-Syn -associated Parkinson's Disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of \u03b1-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and its molecular mechanism, and to establish an evaluation model for corneal nerve fiber injury. The function and mechanism of \u03b1-synuclein in Parkinson's disease were studied. The expression level of \u03b1-synuclein in corneal tissues of Parkinson's disease patients and normal control group was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. At the same time, the morphological changes of corneal nerve fibers were observed by confocal microscopy, and the degree of corneal nerve injury was evaluated by corneal synesthetic nerve function test. The results showed that the expression level of \u03b1-synuclein in the corneal tissue of patients with Parkinson's disease was significantly increased, and the morphology and function of corneal nerve fibers were significantly abnormal. Corneal synesthetic nerve function test results also showed that the corneal sensory nerve conduction speed slowed down and sensitivity decreased in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill, which is frequently used in health products and drinks, is recognized for its high content of essential oils that could have protective effects against PD, despite the lack of complete understanding of its pharmacological mechanisms. This research aims to examine how ESC can affect autophagy signaling pathways and activate the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to effectively decrease oxidative damage, thus shedding light on the possible anti-PD effects of this treatment. The results demonstrated that ESC significantly reduced behavioral issues linked to Parkinson's disease in a mouse model that was induced by MPTP and safeguarded dopaminergic neurons that expressed tyrosine hydroxylase. Moreover, ESC boosted the antioxidant capability of Nrf2, assisted with autophagy processes, and finally decreased protein expression levels of Keap1, HO-1, MAPK, mTOR, and ERK.

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment (CI) is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the diagnosis and prediction of CI progression in PD remain challenging. We aimed to explore a multi-omics framework based on machine learning integrating comprehensive radiomics, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and genetics information to identify CI progression in early PD.\nPatients were first diagnosed with PD without CI at baseline. According to whether CI progressed within 5 years, patients were divided into two groups: PD without CI and PD with CI. Radiomics signatures were extracted from patients' T1-weighted MRI. We used machine learning methods to construct radiomics, hybrid, and multi-omics models in the training set and validated the models in the testing set.\nIn the two groups, we found 7, 23, and 25 radiomics signatures with significant differences in the parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes, respectively. The radiomics model using the 25 signatures of the frontal lobe had an accuracy of 0.833 and an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.879 to predict CI progression. In addition, the hybrid model fused with the cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b2 level had an accuracy of 0.867 and an AUC of 0.916. In our study, the multi-omics model showed the best predictive performance. The accuracy of the multi-omics model was 0.900, and the average AUC value after five-fold cross-validation was 0.928.\nRadiomics signatures have a recognition effect in the CI progression in early PD. Multi-omics frameworks combining radiomics, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and genetic information may be a potential predictor of CI progression in PD.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac dysautonomia plays an important role in understanding Parkinson's disease (PD), with recent studies highlighting the presence of \u03b1-synuclein in cardiac tissue. We hypothesise that sympathetic dysregulation observed in PD may involve pathological changes caused by \u03b1-synuclein in stellate ganglia (SG). This study aimed to investigate \u03b1-synucleinopathy in SG of the genetic PD murine animal model. Mice overexpressing Ala30Pro (A30P) mutant \u03b1-synuclein were used. We here demonstrate a technique for meticulously dissecting SG. The collected SG from the transgenic mice were immunolabelled with neuronal markers, A30P human mutant \u03b1-synuclein and anti-\u03b1-synuclein aggregates. A30P mutant \u03b1-synuclein protein was expressed in the sympathetic neuronal (tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive) cell bodies. Approximately 27% of the TH-positive cell bodies expressed the A30P mutant \u03b1-synuclein protein. The mutant protein was densely localised at the cardiopulmonary pole of the SG. Additionally, we observed that the A30P mutant protein formed fibril aggregation in the SG. Our findings suggest that \u03b1-synucleinopathy in the PD animal model can affect the sympathetic autonomic nervous system, providing insight for further research into targeting \u03b1-synuclein pathology in the SG as a potential link between cardiac dysautonomia and PD.",

    "abstract": "Established assessment scales used for Parkinson's disease (PD) have several limitations in tracking symptom progression and fluctuation. Both research and commercial-grade wearables show potential in improving these assessments. However, it is not known whether pervasive and affordable devices can deliver reliable data, suitable for designing open-source unobtrusive around-the-clock assessments. Our aim is to investigate the usefulness of the research-grade wristband Empatica E4, commercial-grade smartwatch Fitbit Sense, and the Oura ring, for PD research.\nThe study included participants with PD (N\u2009=\u200915) and neurologically healthy controls (N\u2009=\u200916). Data were collected using established assessment scales (Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire, Hoehn and Yahr Stage), self-reported diary (activities, symptoms, sleep, medication times), and 2-week digital data from the three devices collected simultaneously. The analyses comprised three steps: preparation (device characteristics assessment, data extraction and preprocessing), processing (data structuring and visualization, cross-correlation analysis, diary comparison, uptime calculation), and evaluation (usability, availability, statistical analyses).\nWe found large variation in data characteristics and unsatisfactory cross-correlation. Due to output incongruences, only heart rate and movement could be assessed across devices. Empatica E4 and Fitbit Sense outperformed Oura in reflecting self-reported activities. Results show a weak output correlation and significant differences. The uptime was good, but Oura did not record heart rate and movement concomitantly. We also found variation in terms of access to raw data, sampling rate and level of device-native processing, ease of use, retrieval of data, and design. We graded the system usability of Fitbit Sense as good, Empatica E4 as poor, with Oura in the middle.\nIn this study we identified a set of characteristics necessary for PD research: ease of handling, cleaning, data retrieval, access to raw data, score calculation transparency, long battery life, sufficient storage, higher sampling frequencies, software and hardware reliability, transparency. The three analyzed devices are not interchangeable and, based on data features, none were deemed optimal for PD research, but they all have the potential to provide suitable specifications in future iterations.",

Empatica E4 and Fitbit Sense outperformed Oura in reflecting self-reported activities. Results show a weak output correlation and significant differences. The uptime was good, but Oura did not record heart rate and movement concomitantly. We also found variation in terms of access to raw data, sampling rate and level of device-native processing, ease of use, retrieval of data, and design. We graded the system usability of Fitbit Sense as good, Empatica E4 as poor, with Oura in the middle.",

    "abstract": "Limited understanding of regulatory mechanisms controlling LRRK2 kinase activity has hindered insights into both its normal biology and how its dysregulation contributes to Parkinson's disease. Fortunately, recent years have yielded an increased understanding of how LRRK2 kinase activity is dynamically regulated by recruitment to endolysosomal membranes. Notably, multiple small GTPases from the Rab family act as both activators and substrates of LRRK2. Additionally, it was recently discovered that LRRK2 is recruited to, and activated at, stressed or damaged lysosomes through an interaction with GABARAP via the CASM (conjugation of ATG8 to single membranes) pathway. These discoveries position LRRK2 within the rapidly growing field of lysosomal damage and repair mechanisms, offering important insights into lysosome biology and the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterized by pathological changes and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, e.g., endoplasmic reticulum stress. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the intracranial drug concentration and the therapeutic outcomes to a remarkable degree. Receptor-mediated transport has been extensively leveraged to design brain-targeting drug delivery systems to enhance intracranial drug levels. However, the target receptors at the BBB are widely expressed in normal brain parenchymal cells, which would affect drug distribution in local diseased brain regions, e.g., the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease. Here, we found glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), as an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein, is upregulated at the surface of substantia nigra neurons in Parkinson's disease. Considering that GRP94 could function like receptors to trigger cellular endocytosis and transcytosis, we constructed GRP94-specific peptide ligand NGPTHE-modified N-NPs and found that N-NPs could specially deliver drugs to the locally affected substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease. This study provides a GRP94-based proof-of-concept strategy for specific drug delivery for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a poorly understood physiopathology and no established biomarkers for the diagnosis of early stages and for prediction of disease progression. Several neuroimaging biomarkers have been studied recently, but these are susceptible to several sources of variability related for instance to cohort selection or image analysis. In this context, an evaluation of the robustness of such biomarkers to variations in the data processing workflow is essential. This study is part of a larger project investigating the replicability of potential neuroimaging biomarkers of PD. Here, we attempt to fully reproduce (reimplementing the experiments with the same methods, including data collection from the same database) and replicate (different data and/or method) the models described in (Nguyen et al., 2021) to predict individual's PD current state and progression using demographic, clinical and neuroimaging features (fALFF and ReHo extracted from resting-state fMRI). We use the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset (PPMI, ppmi-info.org), as in (Nguyen et al., 2021) and aim to reproduce the original cohort, imaging features and machine learning models as closely as possible using the information available in the paper and the code. We also investigated methodological variations in cohort selection, feature extraction pipelines and sets of input features. Different criteria were used to evaluate the reproduction attempt and compare the results with the original ones. Notably, we obtained significantly better than chance performance using the analysis pipeline closest to that in the original study (R2 > 0), which is consistent with its findings. In addition, we performed a partial reproduction using derived data provided by the authors of the original study, and we obtained results that were close to the original ones. The challenges encountered while attempting to reproduce (fully and partially) and replicating the original work are likely explained by the complexity of neuroimaging studies, in particular in clinical settings. We provide recommendations to further facilitate the reproducibility of such studies in the future.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) leads to the formation of Lewy bodies and is a major hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). The accumulation of \u03b1-Syn involves several post-translational modifications. Recently, though, glycation of \u03b1-Syn (advanced glycation end products) and activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) have been linked to neuroinflammation, which leads to oxidative stress and accumulation of \u03b1-Syn. The present study aims to detect the effect of glycated \u03b1-Syn (gly-\u03b1-Syn)-induced synucleinopathy and loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the development of PD. We isolated, purified, and prepared glycated recombinant human \u03b1-Syn using d-ribose. Gly-\u03b1-Syn was characterized by SDS-PAGE, intact mass analysis, and bottom-up peptide sequence through LC-HRMS/MS. The aggregation propensity of gly-\u03b1-Syn has been verified by morphological and shape analysis through Bio-AFM. The gly-\u03b1-Syn (2 \u03bcg/\u03bcL) was injected stereotaxically in the substantia nigra (SN) of ICR mice (3-4 months) and compared with the normal \u03b1-Syn, d ribose, and Tris-HCl/artificial CSF groups. 56 days postsurgery (DPS), an immunohistochemical examination was conducted to investigate gly-\u03b1-Syn-induced \u03b1-Syn accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. The glycation of \u03b1-Syn led to the expression of transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), an enzyme that cross-linked with AGEs and may have caused the accumulation of \u03b1-Syn. Significant RAGE activation was also observed in gly-\u03b1-Syn, which might have induced glial cell activation, resulting in oxidative stress and, ultimately, apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons. It is important to note that TGM2, phosphorylated \u03b1-Syn, RAGE expression, and glial cell activation were only found in the gly-\u03b1-Syn group and not in the other groups. This suggests that gly-\u03b1-Syn plays a major role in synucleinopathy, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Overall, the present study demonstrated glycation of \u03b1-Syn as one of the important age-associated post-translational modifications that are involved in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, at least in a subset of the diabetic patients susceptible to developing PD.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in cyclic alternating patterns (CAP) metrics, a non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep physiological rhythm, among recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and individuals at high and low risk for developing PD based on genetic and prodromal risk.\nIn this cross-sectional exploratory study, participants underwent clinical, cognitive, and motor evaluation to compute risk based on the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) prodromal criteria and a standard overnight polysomnography. CAP rate, CAP index, A index subtypes, number of CAP sequences, and CAP sequence duration were computed from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.\nThe study included 30 patients with early PD (mean age\u2009=\u200962.80\u2009\u00b1\u20097.69, disease duration\u2009=\u20091.10\u2009\u00b1\u20091.09), 26 participants at risk for PD (age\u2009=\u200964.88\u2009\u00b1\u200910.09), and 36 participants with low risk for PD (age\u2009=\u200956.83\u2009\u00b1\u20097.41). Despite comparable macrosleep architecture, most CAP measures were significantly lower in patients with PD compared with the low-risk group, whereas the at-risk group showed transitional values between PD and the low-risk group. The A2 index was significantly lower in both the at-risk and PD groups from the low-risk group (at risk\u2009=\u20097.59\u2009\u00b1\u20094.59; PD\u2009=\u20097.71\u2009\u00b1\u20095.83; and low risk\u2009=\u200912.85\u2009\u00b1\u20098.63; p\u2009=\u20090.010). Lower CAP rate and lower CAP index were associated with greater disease severity (r\u2009=\u2009-0.23 and\u2009-\u20090.24, respectively).\nPatients with early clinical PD exhibit alterations in CAP dynamics despite having comparable macrosleep architecture. Alterations of the NREM microsleep structure may occur early in the neurodegenerative process and the A2 index may be an early event in the evolution of the disease with the potential to serve as an early marker for disease progression.

    "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are synucleinopathy syndromes with similar symptom profiles that are distinguished clinically based on the arbitrary rule of the time of symptom onset. Identifying reliable electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers would provide a precise method for better diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of treatment response in these two types of dementia. From April 2015 to March 2021, the records of new referrals to a neurology clinic were retrospectively reviewed and 28 DLB(70.3% male) and 20 PDD (80.8% male) patients with appropriate EEG were selected for this study. Artifact-free 60-s EEG signals (21 channels) at rest with eyes closed were analyzed using EEGLAB, and regional spectral power ratios were extracted. Marked diffuse slowing was found in DLB patients compared to PDD patients in all regions in terms of decrease in alpha and increase in theta band. Although, these findings demean between groups after adjusting for MMSE scores, the significant difference still remained in terms of the mean relative alpha powers, particularly in the anterior and central regions. QEEG measures may have the potential to discriminate between these two syndromes. However, further prospective and longitudinal studies are required to improve the early differentiation of these dementia syndromes and to elucidate the underlying causes and pathogenesis and specific treatment.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the literature on the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in treating dysarthria in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and provide a reference for targeted clinical treatment of dysarthria in PD patients.\nA systematic search was conducted in English and Chinese databases, including Embase, Cochrane, Medline, PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and VIP Database, for relevant literature on rTMS treatment for dysarthria in PD patients. The search timeframe was from the inception of each database to October 2023. Literature was screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two researchers extracted information on study subjects, age, intervention methods, intervention duration, intervention frequency, evaluation indicators, and intervention results from the included literature. The modified Jadad scale was used to evaluate the quality of the literature.\nA total of seven studies were included, mainly focusing on the frequency, duration, and stimulation site of rTMS for dysarthria in PD patients. Six studies indicated that rTMS treatment improved dysarthria in PD patients.\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has a positive effect on improving dysarthria in PD patients, but further research is needed to determine its efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The glymphatic system may play a central role in cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson's disease, but its relationship with regional cortical atrophy is not fully explored. To explore associations among glymphatic dysfunction, regional cortical degeneration and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease participants, we evaluated 51 participants with documented Parkinson's disease (28 men; age, 61.65 \u00b1 8.27 years) and 30 age- and sex-matched normal controls (11 men; age, 59.2 \u00b1 5.90 years) who underwent 3.0-T MRI of the brain, including high-resolution T1-weighted imaging and diffusion-tensor imaging along the perivascular space as a surrogate for glymphatic flow. Cortical grey matter volume was segmented automatically based on three-dimensional T1-weighted sequences. Cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination. The relationship between glymphatic dysfunction, cognitive decline and regional cortical degeneration was explored. The participants with Parkinson's disease revealed lower diffusion-tensor imaging along the perivascular space (1.45 \u00b1 0.17 versus 1.64 \u00b1 0.17, ",

    "abstract": "The study of dynamic organization of motor acts is important for investigation of motor impairment, and a possible sign of a disorder of fronto-parietal areas of the brain in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to prospectively investigate whether limb-kinetic apraxia in legs (LKA-L) is a heretofore unrecognized manifestation of PD independent of bradykinesia and rigidity.\nPatients with PD and healthy controls (HC) performed bipedal reciprocal coordination (BRC) and monopedal reciprocal coordination (MRC) tests as a foot modification of the Oseretzky exam (originally alternate antiphase clenching and unclenching of the fists of the right and left hands). While MRC allowed for alternating movements of one leg per unit of time, BRC required synchronous movements of both legs in antiphase. Leg movement rates and their quality were measured by video recording and compared statistically between the groups of PD and HC.\nThe cohort consisted of 31 PD patients (mean age 69.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.1\u00a0years,16 males) and 12 HC (mean age 69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2\u00a0years, 6 males). No differences between PD and HC groups were identified in MRC rate of performance, which were used as a measure of legs movement speed, although the quality of MRC movements was poorer in PD patients (\nTesting for dynamic organization of LKA-L revealed disorder in individuals with PD. LKA-L analyses should be considered in the diagnosis of leg movements and gait disorders in PD.",

    "abstract": "Vibrotactile input is a useful sensory cue for individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) to overcome freezing of gait (FoG). For this input to serve as a cue, its accurate perception is required. This needs the input to be delivered at an anatomical location where it can be perceived. This is particularly true for individuals with PD whose tactile perception differs from that of healthy individuals. Literature indicates choice of various anatomical locations e.g., Finger, Wrist, Thigh, Shin, Calf, Ankle, Achilles Tendon, Heel and torso for the application of vibrotactile stimulation. Though studies have focused on the comparison of the vibrotactile perception (based on feedback) at various anatomical locations, yet these have involved only healthy individuals. However, such exploration remains as majorly untouched for individuals with PD.\nTo bridge this gap, here we have conducted a study using our vibrotactile stimulation system while involving twenty-one individuals with PD to understand the choice of anatomical location with regard to vibrotactile perception. In addition, our study involved twenty-one age-matched healthy individuals to understand possible differences if any in vibrotactile perception between the two groups of participants.\nOur results showed that for the healthy participants, both 'Wrist' and 'Thigh' were equally strong anatomical locations with regard to vibrotactile perception that were correctly identified 100% of the time closely followed by 'Finger' for which the correct identification was 98% of the time with correct identification for all these three locations being statistically (p\u2009<\u20090.05) higher than the other locations. In contrast, for individuals with PD, the 'Thigh' emerged as a strong candidate anatomical location with regard to vibrotactile perception even for those with severity of symptoms (based on clinical measure) that was correctly identified 96% of the time followed by 'Wrist' for which the correct identification was 92% of the time with the correct identification for only the 'Thigh' being statistically (p\u2009<\u20090.05) higher than all the other locations (except 'Wrist').\nThis finding is clinically significant in deciding the right anatomical location to offer vibrotactile cues for it to be correctly perceived by one with PD, providing assistance to overcome FoG.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory dysfunction is a common nonmotor symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease that may be easily overlooked. Incorporating respiratory function rehabilitation into routine rehabilitation programs for these patients is important. However, previous studies have focused primarily on professional devices and training processes that require additional professional guidance, making wide implementation challenging.\nIn this assessor-masked, randomized clinical trial, eligible participants were randomized into an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group received Liu Zi Jue Qigong exercise for 12 weeks, while the control group underwent conventional rehabilitation exercises. Primary outcomes included measures of respiratory function, such as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s (FEV1), the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s to forced vital capacity(FEV1/FVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP). Secondary outcomes included motor symptoms, quality of life, depression, and anxiety.\nThe results from a study involving 51 Parkinson's disease patients showed significant improvements in the FVC, FEV1, PEF, and MEP in the experimental group compared to those in the control group after the 12-week intervention. Additionally, there was a noticeable decrease in depression and anxiety scores in the experimental group, with statistically significant reductions compared to those in the control group.\nLiuzijue Qigong exercise has the potential to enhance respiratory function and mental health in patients with Parkinson's disease in the early and middle stages. These findings could serve as a valuable reference for implementing home-based rehabilitation techniques for individuals with Parkinson's disease.\nChinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2200056762(Retrospectively registered, Registration Date: February 15, 2022).",

    "abstract": "Pain is a common and complex non-motor symptom in people with Parkinson's disease (PWP). Little is known about the genetic drivers of pain in PWP, and progress in its study has been challenging. Here, we conducted two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with pain experienced during the earliest stages of Parkinson's disease. The study population consisted of 4,159 PWP of European ancestry who were mapped to five previously-described, longitudinal pain trajectories. In the first GWAS, the extreme pain trajectories (highest burden versus no significant pain over time) were compared, and in the second GWAS, a multinomial approach was undertaken. While no variant reached genome-wide significance, we identified promising associations, such as rs117108018 (OR",

    "abstract": "To elucidate the role of basal forebrain (BF) in non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), we investigated the association of sleep quality and cognition with BF volume and functional connectivity. The gray matter volume of the anterior intermediate part (Ch4ai) and the anterior lateral part (Ch4al) of the nucleus basalis Meynert were negatively associated with the PSQI global score. The posterior part of the nucleus basalis Meynert (Ch4p) volume was positively associated with visuospatial, memory, and executive functions. The PSQI global score correlated positively with functional connectivity from the Ch4al to the posterior cingulate, inferior parietal, anterior temporal, and medial prefrontal cortices, which correspond to the default mode network. Our results demonstrated that reduced volume of the anterior portion of the Ch4 and its aberrantly increased functional connectivity with the default mode network were closely related to poor overall sleep quality, while reduced volume of the posterior portion of the Ch4 was associated with decreased cognitive function in PD.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of Parkinson's disease tremor (PDT) is crucial for developing assistive technologies; however, this is challenging due to the nonlinear, stochastic, and nonstationary characteristics of PDT, which substantially vary among patients and their activities. Moreover, most models only have one-step prediction capabilities, which causes delays in real-time applications. This paper proposes a self-attention deep temporal convolutional network (SADTCN) model for the real-time prediction of hand-arm PDT signals from different activities and joint angular motions. The SADTCN can capture both short- and long-term dependencies and complex temporal and spatial dynamics of PDT signals and hence, can effectively adapt to varying tremor characteristics. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using experimental hand-arm PDT data. The results show that the SADTCN outperforms existing deep learning (DL) models by accurately predicting varying tremor amplitudes and frequencies multi-step ahead. Moreover, we performed spectrum analysis on the measured and predicted signal using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) as a measure of potential active tremor control and found that SADTCN can accurately determine the transience of tremor amplitude in frequency and time. Finally, we run the Wilcoxon signed-rank statistical test and the results show a statistically significant improvement in the proposed model over the other DL models in all conditions. Therefore, the SADTCN can overcome the nonstationary, nonlinear, and stochastic nature of PDT to perform multi-step prediction with high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability in unseen testing data.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disorder that significantly affects motor, sensory, and vision functions. Convergence insufficiency (CI) may be an indicator of PD progression. This study aimed to explore the relationship between CI and the stages of PD progression, as measured by the Hoehn and Yahr scale, and to compare the prevalence of CI and vision parameters between healthy individuals and PD patients.\nAge-matched healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a097) and PD patients (n\u00a0=\u00a071) underwent medical history evaluations and vision assessments. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare CI prevalence across the Hoehn and Yahr stages between the control and PD groups. Binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the increase in CI prevalence as PD stages advanced.\nSignificant differences in CI prevalence were noted between the control group (CG) and the PD group (PG), particularly in Stage III (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and overall (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The prevalence of CI increased with advancing PD stages (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In Stage I, CI emerged as the only significant factor, while Stages II and III revealed significant differences in multiple vergence-related parameters. Logistic regression revealed increased odds of CI correlating with advancing Hoehn and Yahr stages (p\u00a0<\u00a0.007).\nA significant association was found between CI and PD progression. These findings underscore the importance of standardized assessment methods and the need for longitudinal research. Regular vision evaluations are essential for effectively managing CI and related vergence deficits in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) does not always respond to dopaminergic medication, therefore new treatment strategies are needed. Preliminary evidence has suggested that manipulation of peripheral afferents may reduce tremor amplitude, but existing research is inconclusive and has not been properly controlled. Here, we explored the effects of peripheral vibrotactile stimulation (ViS) on PD tremor using a within-subjects controlled design.\nThirty PD patients with clear tremor were included. ViS (open-loop) was applied to the most affected wrist. Four stimulation conditions were compared: tremor frequency (TF), 1.5*TF, 80\u00a0Hz stimulation, and sham. We tested the effect of these stimulation conditions on tremor power (measured with accelerometry) during three contexts: rest tremor, rest tremor during cognitive load, and postural tremor. Entrainment between tremor and stimulation was tested using complex phase-locking value (PLV).\nThere were no significant effects on tremor power when ViS was applied. Stimulation effects did not depend on the context in which tremor occurred. PLVs showed that tremor phase was not influenced by ViS.\nOpen-loop ViS does not modulate PD tremor.\nThis study is one of the first controlled large sample studies to investigate how ViS may influence the objective measures of tremor in PD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the role of pesticide exposure on PD risk.\nParkinson's disease is the fastest-growing neurological disorder in the world. Since the discovery of the nigral toxin, MPTP, many studies have investigated the role of environmental contaminants, notably pesticides, on PD risk but mostly in epidemiologic studies with limited geographic coverage.\nIn the Multiple Air Pollutants in PD (MAP-PD) study, we conducted a nationwide, population-based, geographical study of 21,549,400 Medicare beneficiaries (aged 67+ in 2009) and 465 pesticides obtained from the United States Geological Survey. Our outcome variable was county-level standardized relative risk derived from Bayesian modeling and our independent variables were estimates of average annual pesticide application from 1992-2008. We mapped the nationwide association for 65 pesticides (those with sufficient data) using Multiscale Geographic Weighted Regression (MGWR), and classified pesticides according to the strength and ratio of positive to negative regression coefficients. We used linear regression to quantify the nationwide relationships between PD risk and pesticides. We explored county-level air pollution, rural/urban residence, and median income as potential confounding factors.\nWe identified 14 pesticides strongly associated with PD in the Rocky Mountain and Great Plains region. Of these, simazine, lindane, and atrazine had the strongest relationship with PD. Counties with the highest decile of simazine application had a 36% (95% CI 32%-41%) greater relative risk of PD compared to counties with the lowest decile of exposure. For atrazine and lindane, relative risks were 31% (95% CI 26%-35%) and 25% (95% CI 21%-29%) greater for counties in the top decile of application compared to the lowest decile, respectively. Moreover, there was a modest dose-response relationship between PD risk and all three pesticides.\nIn the Rocky Mountains/Great Plains region, application of lindane, simazine, and atrazine are associated with PD.

    "abstract": "To determine the feasibility and reliability of using precision-mapping techniques for people with Parkinson disease.\nStandard resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) approaches collect small amounts of data, typically \u2264 10 min, and rely on group-average network definitions. An innovative new approach applies precision-mapping techniques, with > 40min of data, to identify individual-level RSFC network maps. Precision-mapping RSFC reveals individual differences in network size, strength, and location.\nWe tested the feasibility and reliability of precision-mapping RSFC for people with Parkinson disease. Participants completed multiple fMRI sessions (3-5) up to seven months apart. Using stringent motion censoring, we determined the amount of low-motion, high quality fMRI data per person to establish feasibility. We compared the similarity of RSFC maps across sessions to examine stability and applied split-half analyses to measure the reliability of RSFC maps based on amount fMRI data.\nPreliminary analyses reveal the high feasibility and strong reliability of precision-mapping RSFC for people with Parkinson disease. All participants completed multiple fMRI sessions with large amounts of low motion data for each person (>40 min per person, frame retention average = 75%). Individual participant RSFC maps were stable across sessions (r > 0.7) and highly reliable with >40min of data (split-half reliability, r > 0.8).\nThese results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of using the precision-mapping technique for identifying individual-level RSFC networks in Parkinson disease. With this approach, it will now be possible to examine how individual-level variability of RSFC networks relates to variability in clinical manifestations and predicts progression of Parkinson disease.

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation (STN-DBS) at high (180hz) and low frequency (60hz) and L-dopa on variability of spatiotemporal gait measures in an advanced PD cohort.\nThis study consisted of PD subjects with chronic bilateral STN-DBS. Each combination of medication state (OFF/ON) and stimulation frequency (60\u00a0Hz/180Hz) were assessed and randomized across electrode contacts. Instrumented stand and walk tests were performed for each stimulation-medication condition and coefficient of variance (CV) was computed for each lower limb gait parameter. LM-ANOVA was employed for analysis.\nTwenty-two PD subjects with chronic DBS were recruited with an average age of 63.9(SD 9) years. L-dopa reduced variability in both spatial and temporal gait parameters: cadence (L/R, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), gait speed (L/R, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), toe off angle (L/R, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), SLS (L, p\u2009=\u20090.0002; R, p\u2009=\u20090.001), stance (L, p\u2009=\u20090.01, R, p\u2009<\u20090.0001;), step duration (L, p\u2009<\u20090.0001; R, p\u2009=\u20090.004), stride length (L/R, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), and foot swing (L, p\u2009=\u20090.0003; R, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Low and high frequency DBS reduced variability in cadence, foot elevation midswing, speed, right foot strike angle, SLS, stand, step duration, stride length, and foot swing. 60\u00a0Hz STN-DBS synergistically reduced left foot mid-swing elevation variability (p\u2009=\u20090.02) when combined with medication.\nThis study demonstrates significant reduction in variability of spatial and temporal gait measures from L-dopa and STN-DBS. It further reveals a synergistic effect of 60Hz STN-DBS with L-dopa in reducing foot elevation midswing variability.",

    "abstract": "Misfolded \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) is the hallmark of \u03b1-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). While seed amplification assays (SAA) have demonstrated ultrasensitive detection of misfolded \u03b1Syn, they have been primarily used reliably to provide binary (positive/negative) results for diagnostic purposes. We developed an SAA with enhanced specificity for Lewy-fold \u03b1-synucleinopathies and introduced a quantifiable measure correlating with clinical severity. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 170 patients with neurodegenerative diseases and controls was analyzed. Blinded measurements demonstrated 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity for Lewy-fold \u03b1-synucleinopathies, correctly identifying PD and DLB while excluding MSA. In addition, we validated the strain specificity of the assay by testing brain homogenates from 30 neuropathologically confirmed cases. A novel Lewy-fold pathology (LFP) score based on positive signals in a dilution series provided a quantitative measure of \u03b1Syn seeds. The LFP score significantly correlated with motor and cognitive impairment presented by Hoehn and Yahr stage, MDS-UPDRS III, and MoCA. Longitudinal tracking in seven PD cases showed progressive LFP score increases corresponding with clinical deterioration, highlighting the assay's potential for monitoring disease progression at an individual level. Our Lewy-fold-specific SAA enhances ante-mortem diagnosis and differentiates Lewy-fold \u03b1-synucleinopathies from MSA. Unlike previous assays, the LFP score offers a quantitative assessment, showing promise as a progression marker and pharmacodynamic biomarker for \u03b1Syn-targeting therapies. This represents an important step toward developing an \u03b1Syn SAA that could help to track disease progression quantitatively, with potential applications in both clinical diagnostics and therapeutic trials.",

Aberrant mitochondrial fission induced by dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) causes mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic (DA) neurons.

In this study, Mass spectrometry analysis is performed and identified a significant increased DRP1 acetylation at lysine residue 711 (K711) in the mitochondria under oxidative stress. Enhanced DRP1",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms are mediators of interactions between aging, genetics, and environmental factors in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). Multiple studies have explored the DNA modifications in PD, but few focus on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), which is important in the central nervous system and sensitive to environmental exposures. To date, studies have not differentiated between 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hmC or have analyzed them separately. In this study, we modeled paired 5-mC and 5-hmC data simultaneously. We identified 108 cytosines with significant PD-associated shifts between these marks in an enriched neuronal population from PD postmortem parietal cortex, within 83 genes and 34 enhancers associated with 67 genes. These data potentially link epigenetic regulation of genes related to LRRK2 and endolysosomal sort (",

    "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) represent a unique category of therapeutics targeting disease-related RNAs. Since this new therapeutic category emerged, the immediate need to analyze ASOs in clinically relevant biological matrices has led to several methodologies, such as ligand binding assays and imaging techniques. To overcome issues in specificity and provide exact quantitative data for ASOs, a new LC-MS/MS method was developed to analyze in brain tissue a novel 4-10-4 gapmer ASO with the potential for treating Parkinson's disease with phosphorothioated backbone and 2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) modifications. The sample pretreatment protocol to extract the ASO from brain tissue employed solid phase extraction (SPE) and protein digestion. The LC-MS/MS method was fully optimized, validated and applied to quantify the target ASO in brain tissue samples following an ",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are associated with disease risk. Recently, pathway-specific PRS have been created to take advantage of annotations inking variants to biological pathways or cell types. Here, we investigated 8 biological pathways or regions of open chromatin using pathway-specific PRS: alpha-synuclein pathway, adaptive immunity, innate immunity, lysosomal pathway1, endocytic membrane-trafficking pathway, mitochondrial pathway, microglial open chromatin single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and monocyte open chromatin SNPs. We analysed 7,402 PD patients across 18 'in-person' PD cohorts, and 6,717 patients from the online Fox Insight study. We did not find any significant associations between the 8 pathway-specific PRSs and 8 clinical outcomes in PD. Though this may be due to a lack of statistical power and limited sample size, it may also suggest that the genetic architecture of sporadic PD risk is different from the genetics of PD progression and clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging machine learning on electronic health records offers a promising method for early identification of individuals at risk for dementia and neurodegenerative diseases. Current risk algorithms heavily rely on age, highlighting the need for alternative models with strong predictive power, especially at age 65, a crucial time for early screening and prevention.\nThis prospective study analyzed electronic health records (EHR) from 76,427 adults (age 65, 52.1% women) using the THIN database. A general risk algorithm for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia was developed using machine learning to select predictors from diagnoses, and medications.\nMedications (e.g., laxatives, urological drugs, antidepressants), along with sex, BMI, and comorbidities, were key predictors. The algorithm achieved a 38.4% detection rate at a 5% false-positive rate for 2-year dementia prediction.\nThe validated prediction algorithms, easy to implement in primary care, identify high-risk 65-year-olds using medication records. Further refinement and broader validation are needed.",

    "abstract": "The direct association between Parkinson's disease (PD) and Myocardial infarction (MI) has been the subject of relatively limited research.\nThe purpose of this study was to identify the genes most associated with PD and MI to explore their common pathogenesis.\nThe gene expression profiles of PD and MI were downloaded from GEO database. Differential expression analysis was performed to identify the common differential expression genes (DEGs) of PD and MI, followed by functional annotation. Subsequently, protein-protein interaction network were constructed, and hub DEGs were identified based on CytoHubba plugin and LASSO regression analysis. To explore the potential molecular mechanism of hub DEGs, GSEA analysis, immune correlation analysis, drug prediction and molecular docking were performed, and transcription factors (TF) and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks were constructed.\nA total of 48 DEGs with the same expression trend were identified in the MI vs. normal control (NC) and PD vs. NC groups. Functional annotation results showed that the common DEGs were significantly enriched in immune and inflammation-related pathways. RPS4Y1 and UTY were the most relevant hub DEGs for PD and MI, and may be involved in the HALLMARK_MYC_TARGETS_V1 and HALLMARK_PROTEIN_SECRETION pathways. TP63 was a common TF of RPS4Y1 and UTY. The PVT1/KCNQ1OT1-hsa-miR-31-5p-RPS4Y1 and KCNQ1OT1-hsa-let-7a-5p/hsa-miR-19b-3p-UTY axes may play an important role in regulating PD and MI. CYCLOHEXIMIDE and ATALAREN may be potential drugs for the treatment of PD and MI comorbidity. In addition, PD and MI exhibit different patterns of immune cell infiltration and immune function status, which may be related to the specific pathological processes of the disease.\nThis study revealed for the first time that RPS4Y1 and UTY may be common biomarkers of PD and MI and may be potential therapeutic targets. This study provides new perspective on the common molecular mechanisms between PD and MI.",

    "abstract": "Development of objective, reliable and easy-to-use methods to detect the onset of motor changes in Parkinson's disease (PD) is required to identify the temporal window in which neuromodulatory therapies could be implemented. Turning impairments are present at early stages of PD. However, it is unclear, to date, whether circular walking is also altered in prodromal PD.\nExplore the predictive potential of circular walking in prodromal PD.\nWe included 102 subjects from a nine-year prospective cohort study (with 712 participants) in the current nested case-control analysis: 16 diagnosed with PD during follow-up (incident PD) and 96 healthy controls, matched in gender, age, and education with a 1:6 ratio. Forty-one gait features were extracted from baseline assessments with accelerometers under single and dual-tasking conditions. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to test the temporal association of non-correlated gait features to the probability of being diagnosed with PD.\nWe identified associations between time from baseline measurement to PD diagnosis for eleven gait features, mostly based on harmonic ratios, step and stride variability, and index of harmonicity, partially in combination with gait speed. Most significant associations indicated that low gait symmetry and low rhythmicity were associated with larger hazard of being diagnosed with PD. Area under the curve ranged 0.63-0.69.\nDespite low sensitivity and specificity, the findings potentially reflect prodromal motor impairments of PD manifested during circular walking, assessed quantitatively with a low-cost and wearable instrument. This will contribute to the characterization of pre-diagnostic PD motor symptoms.\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive condition that affects movement. Detecting motor changes early, even before clear symptoms appear, could help identify the right time to start treatments that slow down the disease. Turning and circular walking are often affected early in PD, but it is unclear if these impairments begin before a PD diagnosis. This study looked at how people walk in circles to see if it could predict PD before diagnosis. Researchers analyzed data from 102 people in a long-term study. Sixteen of these participants developed PD during the study, and 96 healthy individuals (matched by age, gender, and education) were used as controls. We used a single wearable sensor to measure 41 walking features during simple and multi-tasking walking tests. The results showed that certain walking features like symmetry, rhythm, and stride consistency were linked to a higher likelihood of developing PD. People with less symmetrical and less rhythmic walking patterns were more likely to develop PD. However, the ability to predict PD based on these features alone was limited. In summary, this study suggests that circular walking patterns measured with low-cost wearable devices may reveal early motor impairments in PD. Although further work is needed, these findings could help improve how we identify and monitor early PD symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI) has been used globally since the 1980s for Parkinson disease (PD) motor fluctuations but has not been available in the United States (US).\nEvaluate CSAI for motor fluctuations in the US setting.\nThis open-label study (NCT02339064) enrolled patients with PD experiencing \u22653\u2005hours (h) daily OFF time despite optimized levodopa and current/prior use of at least one other adjunctive therapy. CSAI was initiated with a 1-2 mg bolus followed by 1 mg/h infusion titrated to optimal efficacy and tolerability. Following titration, patients entered a 52-week maintenance period.\nOf 99 patients treated, 85 completed the titration period, 69 completed maintenance week 12 and 48 completed maintenance week 52. Common treatment-related adverse events included infusion site nodules and erythema, dyskinesia, nausea, and somnolence, each of which occurred more frequently during the titration period. Reduction in OFF time began at CSAI initiation and reached a mean of 3.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.18 h/day by maintenance week 12 (primary efficacy endpoint), with a corresponding increase in Good ON time of 3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.35 h/day. By maintenance week 12, 68% of patients rated themselves as much or very much improved, 62% had at least a 2-h reduction in daily OFF time, and mean concomitant oral levodopa and levodopa equivalent doses (excluding CSAI) had been reduced by 198 mg/day and 283 mg/day, respectively. Improvements were maintained through week 52.\nThis study supports the clinical utility of CSAI to reduce OFF time and increase Good ON time in patients with motor fluctuations inadequately controlled with oral therapy.\nContinuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (also called CSAI) is a treatment to control OFF time (periods of poor motor control) that occurs despite ongoing use of usual Parkinson disease medications like levodopa. Apomorphine is slowly infused under the skin using a thin, flexible tube connected to a small, wearable infusion device. CSAI therapy has been widely used outside the United States for its effective control of Parkinson disease symptoms since the mid 1980s. In order to gain approval for CSAI use in the United States, a specific study conducted in United States clinics and hospitals was required. In this study, people with Parkinson disease experiencing 3 or more hours of OFF time per day were started on apomorphine infusion (CSAI) therapy. The dose of apomorphine was increased until each study participant experienced the best possible benefit while still tolerating the medication. Once this dose was identified, participants continued on this dose. The most common side effects were nodules (small bumps under the skin) and erythema (redness of the skin) at the infusion site, dyskinesia (involuntary movements), nausea, and somnolence (sleepiness). These side effects were more frequently experienced at the start of treatment when the best dose of CSAI for each participant was being identified and the participant's other PD medications were being adjusted. Soon after they started CSAI treatment, participants noticed a reduction in the amount of OFF time that they experienced each day. After 12 weeks at a stable dose of CSAI treatment, participants' OFF time had decreased by about 3\u2005hours per day on average. At the same time, most (68%) participants said they felt their symptom control was \u201cmuch improved\u201c or \u201cvery much improved\u201d compared to before starting CSAI therapy. Importantly, these improvements were maintained throughout one year of treatment. These findings support the use of apomorphine infusion in the United States as an effective and safe treatment option for people with Parkinson disease that does not require surgery.",

Reduction in OFF time began at CSAI initiation and reached a mean of 3.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.18 h/day by maintenance week 12 (primary efficacy endpoint), with a corresponding increase in Good ON time of 3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.35 h/day. By maintenance week 12, 68% of patients rated themselves as much or very much improved, 62% had at least a 2-h reduction in daily OFF time, and mean concomitant oral levodopa and levodopa equivalent doses (excluding CSAI) had been reduced by 198 mg/day and 283 mg/day, respectively. Improvements were maintained through week 52.",

To better understand the cause of cognitive impairment\u2014the first step in being able to design new treatments for it\u2014we used a type of brain imaging called PET to look at the binding of a specific receptor in the brain and explored how this was associated with cognitive function in a group of people with PD. Earlier, similar studies used a type of PET scan that shows deeper parts of the brain but we used a PET scan that can better show the outer surface of the brain, called the cortex, where these receptors are more sparse but important in normal brain function. We found that binding of this receptor was higher in people with PD compared to people of a similar age without neurologic issues and that those with PD who had more cognitive impairment, showed higher binding than those with PD who did not have cognitive impairment. Also, in those with PD, higher binding was associated with more cognitive impairment on tests of visual memory, such as learning and remembering an array of pictures. This knowledge may inform the development of medications or other treatments that specifically target this receptor to treat cognitive issues in PD.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease (PD) typically exhibit a narrow-based gait. We previously found that walking with reduced trunk rotation and obliquity led to narrow-based gait in healthy adults; a decrease in trunk motion coincided with a decrease in mediolateral extrapolated center of mass (XCoM) excursion, requiring a smaller step width to maintain a constant mediolateral margin of stability (MoS).\nTo assess whether reduced trunk motion in PD is related to narrow-based gait, without affecting mediolateral MoS. To explore the underlying mechanisms of narrow-based gait, we examined the effects of increasing arm swing (aiming to increase trunk motion), and widening steps on gait in PD.\nFifteen people with PD and narrow-based gait and 17 age-matched controls walked on a treadmill for three minutes at a fixed gait speed during three conditions: baseline, increased arm swing and widened step width. Step width, trunk rotation and obliquity were calculated using marker data, and XCoM excursion and MoS using ground reaction forces.\nTrunk rotation, XCoM excursion, and step width were significantly smaller in PD compared to controls, while the MoS did not differ. Increased arm swing did not substantially increase trunk motions in PD, though people with PD were able to widen their step width.\nWe provide further evidence for a relation between trunk motion and step width. In PD, reduced trunk motion may contribute to narrow-based gait, without affecting mediolateral MoS; future work is needed to confirm a causal relationship between reduced trunk motion and narrow-based gait in PD.\nPeople with Parkinson's disease (PD) typically walk with a smaller base of support compared to healthy adults. The underlying mechanisms are unclear. In an earlier study that we conducted among healthy adults, we found that walking with reduced trunk motion led to a narrow-based gait pattern, without affecting sideways stability. In this study, we tested whether reduced trunk motion is related to narrow-based gait in people with PD, while having no impact on sideways stability. To further explore the mechanisms underlying narrow-based gait, we examined the effects of walking with increased arm swing (to increase trunk motion), and widening steps on gait in PD. This study included 15 people with PD, and 17 age-matched controls who walked on a treadmill for three minutes at a fixed gait speed during three experimental conditions. The conditions included: walking with no additional instructions, walking with increased arm swing, and walking with increased step width. The study variables collected were step width, trunk rotation and obliquity (as measures for trunk motion), center of mass excursions and a measure for (dynamic) stability. We found that trunk rotation, center of mass excursions and step width were smaller in people with PD compared to controls while stability did not differ. Increased arm swing did not lead to increased trunk motion in PD. People with PD were able to widen their step width. We have provided further evidence for a relation between trunk motion and step width. In people with PD, reduced trunk motion may contribute to narrow-based gait, without affecting stability. Future studies should confirm the relationship between reduced trunk motion and narrow-based gait in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD)-related anxiety occurs frequently and may be associated with imbalance between anxiety-related circuits. While the thalamus is a shared region of these circuits, its role in PD-related anxiety has not been explored so far.\nTo identify changes in volume of the thalamus and its subnuclei in patients with PD-related anxiety.\nCognitively intact PD patients (n\u2009=\u2009105) were divided into two groups based on their score on the Parkinson anxiety scale (PAS): 31 PD patients had anxiety (Anx-PD) and 74 did not have anxiety (non-Anx-PD). Forty-five healthy control subjects were included. Participants underwent 7-Tesla MRI scanning. Using automatic segmentation, the volumes of the thalamus and its subnuclei were measured, compared between the groups and regressed on the PAS.\nThe volumes of the thalamus and its subnuclei did not significantly differ between the groups. However, in anxious PD patients, more severe anxiety was strongly associated with a smaller volume of the right medial thalamic subregion, specifically the right mediodorsal magnocellular nucleus and the right mediodorsal parvocellular nucleus (R\u2009=\u20090.63, \u00df\nA reduced volume of the mediodorsal and anteroventral thalamus, overlapping structures between the anxiety related circuits, are associated with more severe PD-related anxiety and may explain its high prevalence in the disease.\nAnxiety is a frequent and debilitating symptom in Parkinson's disease. Its management and treatment is challenging and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms may help treating it better. It is hypothesized that the balance of two anxiety circuits in the brain, the so-called fear circuit and the limbic anxiety circuit, is disturbed in Parkinson-related anxiety. There is an overactivation of the fear circuit and an underactivation of the limbic anxiety circuit. These circuits overlap in part and studying alterations of the overlapping structures may help to better understand the mechanisms of Parkinson-related anxiety. The thalamus is an important relay station in the brain, which was shown to be involved in Parkinson-related anxiety. The objective of this study was to identify changes of the volume of the thalamus and its subregions in Parkinson-related anxiety using high-definition MRI scanning. We hypothesized that the volume of some parts of the thalamus would be reduced in Parkinson-related anxiety. We included 105 Parkinson patients, of which 31 had significant anxiety and 74 did not, and 45 healthy participants. All participants underwent a clinical and a psychological assessment and a high-definition \u201c7-Tesla\u201d MRI scan in order to measure the volume of the thalamus and its subregions. The volume of the thalamus was the same in the three groups but a reduced volume of some sub-parts, the medio-dorsal and antero-ventral thalamus, was associated with more severe anxiety in Parkinson patients. These two thalamic parts are part of both the fear circuit and the limbic anxiety circuit. Knowledge of the interrelationship of the two circuits and their imbalance in Parkinson-related anxiety could open new avenues of treatment and management of Parkinson-related anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Clinical assessments of motor symptoms rely on observations and subjective judgments against standardized scales, leading to variability due to confounders. Improving inter-rater agreement is essential for effective disease management.\nWe developed an objective rating system for Parkinson's disease (PD) that integrates computer vision (CV) and machine learning to correct potential discrepancies among raters while providing the basis for model performance to gain professional acceptance.\nA prospective PD cohort (n\u2009=\u2009128) were recruited from multi-centers. Motor examination videos were recorded using an android tablet with CV-based software following the MDS-UPDRS Part-III instructions. Videos included facial, upper- and lower-limb movements, arising from a chair, standing, and walking. Fifteen certified clinicians were recruited from multi-centers. For each video, five clinicians were randomly selected to independently rate the severity of motor symptoms, validate the videos and movement variables (MovVars). Machine learning algorithms were applied for automated rating and feature importance analysis. Inter-rater agreement among human raters and the agreement between artificial intelligence (AI)-generated ratings and expert consensus were calculated.\nFor all validated videos (n\u2009=\u20091024), AI-based ratings showed an average absolute accuracy of 69.63% and an average acceptable accuracy of 98.78% against the clinician consensus. The mean absolute error between the AI-based scores and clinician consensus was 0.32, outperforming the inter-rater variability (0.65), potentially due to the combined utilization of diverse MovVars.\nThe algorithm enabled accurate video-based evaluation of mild motor symptom severity. AI-assisted assessment improved the inter-rater agreement, demonstrating the practical value of CV-based tools in screening, diagnosing, and treating movement disorders.\nParkinson's disease affects how people move, and doctors assess the severity of symptoms using a standard checklist. However, these checks can depend on the doctor's experience and personal judgment, which makes the results different from one doctor to another. This inconsistency makes it hard to track the disease accurately over time and tailor treatments effectively. Our team aimed to create a more consistent way to assess the motor symptoms automatically. We developed a system using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) that enables recording and analyzing motor examination videos by a tablet. This system looks for detailed signs that are hard for the naked eye to see reliably. It then calculates scores based on motor signs to show symptom severity. We tested this system with 128 participants across four hospitals, focusing on videos capturing facial expressions, limb movements, getting up from a chair, posture, and gait. We found that the signs and scores from our system matched well with those given by a group of experienced experts. It can serve as a \u201csecond reader\u201d to help doctors calibrate their assessments. A key feature of our AI system is that it explains how it makes decisions, unlike many other AI systems that are like a \u201cblack box\u201d. This helps doctors and patients understand the symptoms better. The video-based assessment is highly convenient and portable, making it suitable for widespread adoption across various healthcare facilities, including home settings. This expansion would enable more patients to get professional evaluations, improving access to quality healthcare services.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG), a common, perplexing gait disorder observed in Parkinson's disease (PD), is a leading cause of injurious falls and contributes significantly to social isolation. Unlike other PD cardinal features, FOG appears to develop independently, and its heterogeneity presents challenges for both definition and measurement. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FOG remain poorly understood, limiting the development of effective treatments. Although the roles of specific, targetable biomarkers in FOG development remain unidentified, evidence suggests that it is likely multimodal, potentially involving extranigral transmitter circuits. The diversity of FOG phenotypes may also reflect underlying differences in pathophysiology. In this paper, we first present evidence that FOG may occur independently of dopaminergic influence. We then review an expanding body of research supporting the hypothesis that FOG arises from a dysfunctional pathophysiological feedback loop, involving norepinephrine (NE) depletion, neuroinflammation, and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation. This biological disruption occurs concurrently with, but distinct from, the primary dopaminergic pathology of PD. When they occur on the background of dopamine loss, the interactions between NE, A\u03b2, and inflammation, as observed in Alzheimer's disease models, may similarly play a critical role in the development of FOG in PD and could serve as pathobiological markers. The proposed changes in the pathophysiological loop might even precede its onset, highlighting the need for further investigation. A deeper understanding of the involvement of A\u03b2, NE, and inflammatory markers in FOG could pave the way for rapid clinical trials to test existing amyloid-clearing therapies and noradrenergic drugs in appropriate patient populations.\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease associated with the loss of dopamine in the brain. Freezing of gait (FOG) is a complex abnormality of walking seen in people with PD where they feel like their feet are glued to the floor. It is common (affecting up to 60% of patients), a leading cause of injurious falls and contributes significantly to social isolation. It appears to develop and progress separately from other clinical symptoms of PD. Cognitive impairment is frequently associated with FOG. The cause is unknown, and treatment is limited. It is well known that there are several types of FOG suggesting that there might be more than one cause. There is also information suggesting that FOG, in some cases, may occur independent of the loss of dopamine that typically occurs in PD. In this paper we review information supporting that notion. Then, we develop our hypothesis of a different chemical pathway as a possible cause of FOG. This pathway involves the protein amyloid (too much in the brain) and the chemical norepinephrine (too little in the brain), both have been previously related to the development of Alzheimer's disease. We review the literature (including some of our work) that supports the possible role of this chemical pathway in the development of FOG. A deeper understanding of this chemical pathway in FOG could pave the way for the development of new effective drugs in appropriate patient populations.",

The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 6 in Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2 (PDSS-2). Secondary endpoints included functional motor and non-motor assessments (Movement Disorder Society [MDS]-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS], MDS-Non-motor Scale [NMS], 8-item PD Questionnaire [PDQ-8], 16-item PD Fatigue Scale [PFS-16], ON/OFF home diary), Clinical and Patient Global Impression of Change (CGI-C; PGI-C) and adverse events.\nAt week 6, there was a significant reduction of -7.9 points (95%CI -13.6, -2.2; \nAdding opicapone 50\u2005mg to levodopa/DDCI therapy in patients with PD and motor fluctuations and sleep disturbances improved both sleep disturbances and OFF time in these patients.\nPatients with Parkinson's disease (PD) commonly experience a range of sleep problems, including insomnia (difficulty falling or staying asleep), difficulties turning over in bed, excessive daytime sleepiness, acting out while sleeping, and other disruptions that affect their sleep quality and quantity, with an overall impact on their quality of life. However, there is no clear guidance on how to manage these problems. Opicapone is a PD medication that can be added to standard levodopa therapy to manage ON-OFF episodes in patients with PD. The OASIS study evaluated whether adding opicapone to a previous stable regimen of levodopa can be beneficial for sleep problems in patients with PD and ON-OFF episodes. During the OASIS study, 16 patients with a diagnosis of sleep problems associated with PD received opicapone in addition to their standard levodopa therapy for 6 weeks. At the end of the 6-week treatment period with opicapone, patients demonstrated significant improvements in overall sleep, particularly in their sleep disturbances. Moreover, patients reported improvements in motor and non-motor symptoms, including fatigue (another common symptom in patients with PD) and in their quality of life. Overall, improvements in health status and their clinical conditions were noted by both patients and clinicians following the addition of opicapone. This study suggests that opicapone can improve sleep problems in patients with PD and ON/OFF episodes but larger studies should be conducted to confirm these benefits.",

    "abstract": "Psychedelic assisted psychotherapy (PAP) can improve treatment-resistant depression. Its usefulness in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown. PD patients may have problems adjusting to their chronic progressive neurological disease. A change from emotional avoidance to acceptance has been reported following psilocybin administration in patients with treatment-resistant depression.\nTo report for the first time the effect of psilocybin in a PD patient.\nA non-depressed 43-year-old female with a 2-year history of PD presented with difficulty adjusting to PD, anxious ruminations and pessimism. The patient declined an increase in dopaminergic medication or the introduction of an anxiolytic. Therapeutic patient education was not beneficial. The patient received four sessions of high-dose PAP within one year. Neurological and psychiatric assessments were performed before and at one year follow-up using qualitative interviews and quantitative assessment of motor status, dispositional optimism, depression, anxiety, apathy, and well-being.\nPAP was well tolerated. It significantly improved the patient's overall pessimistic outlook on her future and decreased her anxious ruminations and worries about potential handicap due to PD. Her general well-being improved, as well as all psychometric scores except for the apathy scale. Motor status remained unchanged. Better acceptance of PD allowed her to accept pharmacological treatment adjustment.\nPAP could be a safe and useful treatment for PD patients with dispositional pessimism and difficulties accepting their disease by promoting profound decentration from habitual thoughts and emotions, improving mood and PD acceptance. Randomized, controlled studies are needed to confirm this result.\nThis study explored the effects of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) on a 43-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease (PD), who struggled to accept her diagnosis, leading to anxious ruminations and pessimism. Treatment adjustments were considered but were either ineffective or declined by the patient. The patient received four high-dose PAP sessions over a year. The therapy was well-tolerated, reduced her anxious thoughts, and improved her outlook on the future and general well-being. The patient accepted medication adjustments. The study suggests PAP might help PD patients with high dispositional pessimism and acceptance issues, though more research is needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common non-motor symptom in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and is associated to poor clinical outcomes. Currently, rivastigmine is the only approved medication for PD dementia, and there are no treatments available for people with PD and mild cognitive impairment. To advance the pharmacological management of cognitive impairment in PD, it is essential to optimize clinical trial design. This includes refining cognitive outcome measures, ensuring longer study durations, and incorporating PD-specific cognitive assessments. Biomarkers offer valuable opportunities for screening, stratification, enrichment, and monitoring in trials, increasing the likelihood of detecting treatment effects. Additionally, adopting patient-centered approaches that prioritize inclusivity can enhance trial validity and address the current lack of diversity in PD studies. Digital cognitive assessments offer a promising tool for improving participation and enabling longitudinal monitoring, especially in underrepresented and mobility-challenged populations. By tackling these challenges, this review outlines strategies for advancing the pharmacological management of cognitive impairment in PD. It emphasizes the need for precise, inclusive, and biomarker-driven trials to accelerate drug development.\nThere is an urgent need to develop treatments for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, as it is a common symptom associated with poor health outcomes, with only one approved medication for patients in the dementia stage. This review outlines strategies for advancing pharmacological management of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. These strategies include implementing systematic diagnosis of cognition, improving clinical trial design by using biomarkers, refining cognitive assessments, and extending study duration; increasing diversity and inclusivity through a patient-centered approach, and adopting digital cognitive assessments to enhance participation and enable more effective tracking.",

    "abstract": "While significant progress has been made in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have consistently failed. To address the underlying molecular mechanisms of PD, two biology-based criteria have been proposed: the \"Synucleinopathy-Neurodegeneration-Genetics\" (SynNeurGe) and \"neuronal \u03b1-synuclein disease\" (NSD) frameworks. Both frameworks emphasize the importance of biological markers over clinical symptoms. They recognize \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and genetic mutations (such as SNCA) as key diagnostic elements, with \u03b1-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) used to detect early disease stages. Dopaminergic neurodegeneration, measured by DAT imaging, is also central to both frameworks. These shared features aim to improve early diagnosis and precision medicine for PD. However, SynNeurGe provides a broader, more flexible framework that integrates \u03b1-synuclein pathology (S), neurodegeneration (N), and genetics (G), linked to clinical features (C). It aims to accommodate the complexity of PD and related Lewy body diseases, facilitating research on targeted DMTs. In contrast, NSD focuses specifically on PD and Lewy body dementia, introducing a staging system (NSD-ISS) based on biological markers and clinical impairment, helping track disease progression from preclinical to symptomatic stages. Despite their differences, both approaches highlight the need for more specific biomarkers and prospective studies to improve early intervention and personalized treatment. Harmonizing SynNeurGe and NSD concepts will be key in creating a universally accepted framework for precise PD diagnosis and therapy development.\nIn recent years, significant progress has been made in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms, but therapies to slow or stop disease progression have failed. Symptomatic treatments focus on neurotransmitter replacement, while disease-modifying therapies target the molecular and cellular causes of PD. Two research criteria aim to redefine PD biologically, not just by clinical symptoms. The SynNeurGe and NSD concepts both focus on the role of \u03b1-synuclein, a protein linked to PD, but differ slightly in approach.SynNeurGeThis framework highlights three key elements\u2014pathological \u03b1-synuclein in bodily fluids, evidence of neurodegeneration, and specific gene mutations. These are linked to clinical features, aiming to support targeted research for precision medicine.NSD (Neuronal \u03b1-synuclein disease)This approach identifies PD and related diseases by detecting \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid and dopaminergic neurodegeneration using dopamine transporter imaging. It also introduces a staging system, from pre-symptomatic to more advanced stages, based on biological markers and clinical symptoms. Both models share common ground in using \u03b1-synuclein detection, demonstration of neurodegeneration, and genetic mutations to define PD biologically. NSD proposes a more restricted concept, which fits within the broader SynNeurGe framework. Further research is needed to track how these biological markers evolve over time, with a focus on finding more precise biomarkers and affordable diagnostic tools. Harmonizing these two concepts could lead to earlier diagnoses, more accurate staging, and personalized treatment plans for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally recognized as a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction and \u03b1-synuclein protein accumulation in the brain. However, recent research suggests that the circulatory system may also contribute to PD pathogenesis through the spread of \u03b1-synuclein beyond the brain. The blood-brain barrier (BBB), a key regulator of molecular exchange between the bloodstream and the brain, may become compromised in PD, allowing harmful substances, including pathogenic forms of \u03b1-synuclein, to infiltrate the brain and promote neurodegeneration. Transport mechanisms such as P-glycoprotein and the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP-1) further modulate the movement of \u03b1-synuclein across the BBB, influencing disease progression. Additionally, extracellular vesicles are emerging as crucial mediators in the dissemination of \u03b1-synuclein between the brain and peripheral tissues, facilitating its spread and accumulation. The lymphatic system, responsible for clearing \u03b1-synuclein, may also contribute to PD pathology when impaired. This review highlights the growing evidence for a circulatory axis in the initiation and progression of PD. We propose that future research should explore the hypothesis that the circulatory system contributes to the pathogenesis of PD by aiding the distribution of \u03b1-synuclein throughout the body.\nParkinson's disease (PD) is known for its effects on movement and the brain. But the cause remains unknown. Recent research suggests that problems with blood and blood flow contribute to the development of PD. For instance, proteins linked to PD have been identified in blood and heart tissues, indicating they could be early signs of the disease. Changes in heart rate, changes in blood pressure when standing up, and altered brain blood flow have been linked to PD. This review explores evidence that the circulatory system has important roles in the development and progression of PD. We propose further research to test if proteins in the blood start the disease and if blood vessels help spread it to the brain.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting 1-2% of people over age 65. The risk of developing PD dramatically increases with advanced age, indicating that aging is likely a driving factor in PD neuropathogenesis. Several age-associated biological changes are also hallmarks of PD neuropathology, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Accumulation of senescent cells is an important feature of aging that contributes to age-related diseases. How age-related cellular senescence affects brain health and whether this phenomenon contributes to neuropathogenesis in PD is not yet fully understood. In this review, we highlight hallmarks of aging, including mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of proteostasis, genomic instability and telomere attrition in relation to well established PD neuropathological pathways. We then discuss the hallmarks of cellular senescence in the context of neuroscience and review studies that directly examine cellular senescence in PD. Studying senescence in PD presents challenges and holds promise for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms, which could contribute to the development of effective disease-modifying therapeutics. Targeting senescent cells or modulating the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in PD requires a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between PD pathogenesis and cellular senescence.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease (PD) are prescribed a variety of medications to mitigate symptoms and improve their quality of life. These symptomatic therapies cover a range of pharmacological classes, including classical dopaminergic treatments, other antiparkinsonian agents, and pharmacotherapies for non-PD conditions. Often, medications are prescribed for concomitant use and in increasing doses, particularly as the disease progresses. Documentation of these interventions in clinical trials is necessary to accurately capture medication usage, compare medication utilization across different studies, understand factors contributing to experimental therapeutic response, and analyze clinical trial data in a precise manner. At the present time, there is no current international standard for how these medications are documented within clinical trials. As a case example, we will highlight medication use documentation in a large international multicenter observational study commonly used as a reference for design of clinical trials. This review aims to raise awareness within the scientific community of the importance of proper medication documentation and the need for standardization to harmonize prescriptive practices, improve treatment interpretability, and perform consistently robust analyses from clinical trials data.\nCurrently approved medications for the treatment of Parkinson's have been shown to improve motor symptoms, overall disability, and quality of life. There is an urgent need for novel treatments that delay, halt, or reverse the relentless progression of Parkinson's. New disease-modifying treatments are advancing rapidly, and integration of data across different trials is ideally needed to gain insights from every study. It is important to accurately capture the medications that are prescribed to people enrolled in clinical trials. Dopaminergic medications are known to have distinct effects in different patients and at varying stages of disease. This study carefully examines the classification of dopaminergic medications in the PPMI study, a flagship observational study that is used often by sponsors to plan and design clinical trials. The results demonstrate that there are some inconsistencies across sites and study cohorts in terms of classifying medication use in PPMI. There is an urgent need to align on consensus standards to document medications, including both prescribed Parkinson's medications and any other drugs. This would help to accurately identify potential beneficial and/or adverse effects of drugs being evaluated in clinical trials. Several initiatives aimed at standardization are underway with a need for unified consensus and implementation by sponsors of clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein is a normal protein, but misfolded forms in the cerebrospinal fluid can be detected using the alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (\u03b1Syn-SAA), a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease (PD). Some experts consider this assay a 'game changer' for redefining and reclassifying PD. In this article, we, three individuals with PD, share our perspective on the suitability of \u03b1Syn-SAA as the basis for a new classification and staging system for PD. We also discuss other biomarkers and their relevance to those with PD, drawing on our research and the scientific background of two authors. We aim to clarify complex media reports and study findings for the PD community. We argue that while \u03b1Syn-SAA can identify the presence of pathology, it cannot explain the underlying cause for such pathology or predict the progression of PD. Given the varied biological pathways leading to PD, using \u03b1Syn-SAA as a unified biological definition for a new classification system is premature. Further research is needed before it can serve as the foundation for defining and staging Parkinson's disease. Although \u03b1Syn-SAA has its place, like the DAT scan, it should be seen as a tool for confirming diagnoses rather than defining them.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with heterogenous symptoms and progression rates. Some studies have classifying PD into tremor-dominant and non-tremor-dominant PD (TD-PD and Non-TD-PD), finding that TD-PD tend to have a better prognosis, slower disease progression, and lower pathological burden compared to Non-TD-PD. However, this classification does not consider the specific types of tremors, even though recent studies have shown that different types of tremors in PD might have distinct underlying mechanism.\nData from 517 de novo drug-na\u00efve PD patients was analyzed.\nSurvival analysis was carried out including motor subtypes, rest tremor presence, kinetic tremor presence, postural tremor presence, as well as the instability of tremor presence or motor subtypes as predictors. Occurrence of 6 outcomes, including motor and non-motor milestones at follow-up, were used as the time-to-event.\nBoth TD-PD subtype and rest tremor presence was associated with slower PD progression, while kinetic tremor presence and postural tremor presence, especially kinetic tremor presence, was associated with a faster one.\nOur study suggests different types of tremors are associated with distinct PD prognoses, indicating potential differences in underlying mechanisms. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying different types of tremors in PD and to explain their relationship to disease prognosis.\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogenous disease with diverse symptoms and rates of progression. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of motor subtype, different types of tremors, and their consistency on the progression of PD. We analyzed data from 537 newly diagnosed, untreated PD patients and monitored them for several important progression milestones. We found that patients with tremor-dominant PD and those experiencing resting tremors tended to have slower disease progression. Conversely, the presence of kinetic tremors and postural tremor, especially kinetic tremor, was associated with a faster progression of PD. These findings suggest that the specific types of tremors in PD may have potentially different mechanisms. Understanding these differences could help in developing targeted treatments that address specific tremor types, potentially improving outcomes for patients. Further research is necessary to explore the underlying mechanisms behind these tremor types and their relationship to PD prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FoG) is among the most disabling gait disorders of Parkinson's disease. The full understanding of its mechanisms requires a network study approach. So far, FoG was mainly studied using magnetic resonance imaging, and especially using the resting state functional sequence, which does not completely reflect the brain actual modifications.\nThis study aims to investigate metabolic networks using position emission tomography (PET) imaging. Exploration after a rest or gait session combined with a delayed tracer's uptake are assumed to reflect the actual metabolism modifications.\nTwenty-six patients in the off-drug state underwent two PET imaging sessions using [\nIn the rest condition, the freezing group showed globally reduced metabolic connectivity between brain regions compared to the non-freezing group. During gait, enhanced connectivity was observed in the cerebellum, cerebello-cortical loops and parieto-frontal regions, with high recruitment of the visual cortex in the freezing group. However, connectivity inside cerebellar networks remained lower in the freezing group than in the non-freezing group, while occipito-frontal connectivity was higher in the freezing group.\nStudying real freezing of gait in a vertical position emphasized the role of the visual cortex and cerebellum in gait problems.\nFreezing of gait is among the most disabling gait disorders associated with Parkinson's disease. It is characterized by a sudden episodic inability to produce effective stepping despite the intention to walk. Brain imaging, primarily using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been widely utilized to study its mechanisms. However, this imaging modality does not allow for the exploration of actual gait aspects, as images are acquired while the patient is in a supine position within the machine. In this study, we propose using nuclear medicine imaging, which allows for the assessment of metabolism over the 20\u201330 min following the injection of a radiotracer. Thus, even though the acquisition is also performed in a supine position, this delay is expected to reflect the actual mechanisms. Twenty-six patients were examined twice using nuclear medicine imaging: in a resting condition and after a gait session. Among the patients, twelve exhibited freezing. Images were analyzed to measure the connectivity between cerebral regions. The results showed that patients with freezing had lower connectivity between brain regions. After the gait session, some connections were re-established, but overall, the connectivity remained lower than in patients without freezing. The affected connections mainly involved the cerebellum, cerebello-cortical loops, and parieto-frontal regions, with implications for the visual cortex. Thanks to the study conducted in a vertical position, this research highlighted the roles of the visual cortex and cerebellum in gait problems.",

    "abstract": "Directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides more precise control of current spread than conventional ring-shaped electrodes. Whether this enhanced flexibility improves motor function is unclear.\nHere we examine whether directional and circular stimulation differentially impact motor performance in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nMotor behaviors were assessed in 31 patients who underwent unilateral subthalamic nucleus brain stimulation surgery (SUNDIAL, NCT03353688). Eight configurations, including 6 directional contacts and their corresponding rings), were evaluated during device activation. Objective measures of motor performance related to limb dexterity, gait, and overall mobility were evaluated in a double-blind fashion in the \"off\" medication state versus preoperative baseline, with stimulus amplitude at the center of the therapeutic window.\nSignificant changes in performance were observed across each of five motor tasks between the best and worst directional contacts on a given DBS row (p\u2009<\u20090.001 each task). Certain stimulation directions led to functional declines versus baseline, whereas the best direction yields greater improvement than ring stimulation (p\u2009=\u20090.005, p\u2009=\u20090.001, p\u2009=\u20090.007, p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively, across tasks). Directional DBS improves therapeutic window and side effect thresholds versus ring stimulation (0.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.94 and 0.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.51\u2005mA, p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively), but these variables correlated only modestly with motor performance at a given stimulation site.\nOptimized directional subthalamic nucleus DBS yields better group-level motor performance than ring stimulation, in addition to its known advantages related to tolerability. Prospective studies should evaluate whether these improvements persist over longer time intervals.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiologic evidence from different countries shows both increasing and decreasing incidence rates of Parkinson's disease over time without clear trends.\nWe aimed to investigate age-specific incidence rates of Parkinson's disease and possible explanations for the observed trends in Germany over a 10-year period.\nTwo different random samples of subjects aged \u226550 years included in 2004-2009 and 2014-2019, each consisting of 250,000 individuals, were drawn from Germany's largest health care insurance company followed up for new Parkinson's disease cases. We compared the age-specific incidence rates of Parkinson's disease for both cohorts and performed Cox regression models to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) of PD in the second period compared with the first period, adjusted for age, sex, and risk factors for Parkinson's disease.\nFor most age groups in men and in women, we found lower age-specific Parkinson's disease incidence rates in the second period. Cox regression analysis showed an overall 18% risk reduction in Parkinson's disease incidence (HR\u2009=\u20090.82, 95% confidence interval [0.76-0.89]). Mean age at diagnosis increased in men (+1.9 years) and women (+0.8 years). After adjustment for risk factors, the HR was 0.78 [0.72-0.85]. Sensitivity analysis considering the competing event of death showed an HR of 0.79 [0.73-0.86]), demonstrating the independence of time trends from changes in death rates.\nOur data show that the risk of Parkinson's disease has decreased over time and that this decrease is independent of factors such as changes in death rates, age structure, sex, and specific risk factors.\nParkinson's disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, showing both increasing and decreasing incidence rates with no clear trend. Our group sought to investigate age-specific incidence rates of Parkinson's disease in Germany over a period of ten years. The data that were used for our analysis, were drawn from Germany's largest health care insurance company.

Mean age at diagnosis increased in men (+1.9 years) and women (+0.8 years). After adjustment for risk factors, the HR was 0.78 [0.72-0.85]. Sensitivity analysis considering the competing event of death showed an HR of 0.79 [0.73-0.86]), demonstrating the independence of time trends from changes in death rates.",

    "abstract": "Reducing nigrostriatal iron overload reduces neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) models.\nExamine the safety and efficacy of deferiprone in reducing motor disability progression in dopaminergic-treated and treatment-na\u00efve patients with early-stage PD.\nTwo phase II, multicenter studies, SKY and EMBARK, enrolled patients diagnosed with early PD (<3 years from screening). In SKY, patients on stable dopaminergic therapy were randomized 1:1 to one of four dosage (or placebo-matching) cohorts (300, 600, 900, 1200\u2005mg twice daily [BID]) for 9 months. EMBARK enrolled patients on stable dopaminergic therapy or treatment-na\u00efve patients and received 15\u2005mg/kg BID. For both studies, the primary outcome was the change from baseline to month 9 in motor examination score (Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS] Part III). ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02728843; ANZCTR: ACTRN12617001578392.\nOverall, 140 patients were randomized in SKY (28 per cohort). Thirty-six patients enrolled in EMBARK (27 dopaminergic-treated; 9 treatment-na\u00efve). In the SKY study, all doses showed the same worsening as the placebo group, with the exception of the 600\u2005mg dose, which was associated with non-significant reductions in MDS-UPDRS Part III least-squares mean (LSM) between baseline and 9 months (-2-8 points versus placebo). In EMBARK, LSM (SE) changes from baseline in MDS-UPDRS Part III were nonsignificant (-1.6 [1.7]) and significant (8.3 [3.9]) for dopaminergic-treated and treatment-na\u00efve patients, respectively, the latter indicating disease worsening. Adverse events possibly related to deferiprone were reported in 35.7%-88.9% across all deferiprone groups vs. 42.9% for placebo.\nSKY and EMBARK studies indicate that deferiprone combined with L-dopa does not provide significant motor function benefit, while the absence of L-dopa treatment worsens symptoms.\nParkinson's disease is an age-related brain condition that can lead to problems with movement, muscle cramps, mental health, and pain. People with Parkinson's disease also struggle with activities of daily living that can reduce their well-being. Researchers have found that some people with Parkinson's disease have high levels of iron in their brain. Currently, we do not know if removing iron from the brain can help people with Parkinson's disease. In this study, we examined if a medicine that removes iron from the brain could improve symptoms of Parkinson's disease. This medicine is called deferiprone. Our study included 176 people with Parkinson's disease. People were then divided into 2 groups. In the first group, people were already being treated for Parkinson's disease and then were given deferiprone for 9 months. We found that a low or high dose of deferiprone did not improve disease symptoms. In the second group, people taking no other medication for their Parkinson's disease were given deferiprone for 9 months. In this group, deferiprone worsened Parkinson's symptoms. There are currently no arguments in favor of using deferiprone in Parkinson's disease. Deferiprone without L-dopa worsens symptoms. Research could potentially evaluate low doses of iron chelator in combination with L-dopa over the long term and in large numbers of people.",

    "abstract": "Timely recruitment and effective retention of participants are challenging for clinical Parkinson's disease (PD) research studies. Not achieving this can affect delivery costs and bias results.\nTo identify successful recruitment and retention methodologies for clinical research studies in PD.\nWe conducted a systematic scoping review using a Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome and Study design (PICOS) framework to search and screen literature within five databases for published quantitative and mixed methods studies evaluating recruitment and retention strategies of interventional and observational trials in PD.\nSearches identified 4608 records, of which six papers covering eight studies were included in the review following screening for eligibility. No papers on retention strategies were found that met eligibility criteria. Effective strategies for rapid recruitment included research registries and trial finders (n\u2009=\u20093), digital marketing campaigns (n\u2009=\u20093), site recruitment support (n\u2009=\u20091) and multiple referral sources (n\u2009=\u20091). Recruitment diversity was increased by online campaigns, mandatory 10% minority targets set by funders and supplemental site funding.\nThis scoping review has identified methods that can be used to increase the rate and diversity of recruitment to PD clinical studies. Retention methodologies are under-researched.\nRecruiting patients to clinical studies and ensuring participants complete them (known as \u201cretention\u201d) is challenging in Parkinson's disease (PD). If studies take longer this increases costs, and if the right people do not take part in studies this can mean that results may not be representative of the PD community. Our objective is to find out what effective strategies there are to support recruitment and retention to clinical research studies in PD. We reviewed literature within five study databases. We used the population, intervention, comparator, outcome and studies (PICOS) framework to create a search strategy based on our research question, and inclusion criteria for study selection. Important criteria were: (1) studies had to test a recruitment or retention strategy in a PD clinical research study, (2) studies had to provide evidence on how well the strategy worked. We found 4608 unique research papers, six of which described and evaluated recruitment strategies. No papers on retention strategies were found that met eligibility criteria. Successful recruitment strategies included digital marketing (n\u2009=\u20093), research registries (n\u2009=\u20093), supporting study sites (n\u2009=\u20091) and multiple sources to refer people with Parkinson's (PwP) to studies (n\u2009=\u20091). Recruitment of PwP from diverse backgrounds was enhanced by (1) online campaigns, (2) funders requesting that 10% of study participants come from diverse backgrounds 3) additional funding for research teams.This scoping review identified methods that can be used to increase the rate and diversity of recruitment to PD clinical studies.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms, caused by the degeneration and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Current therapies are limited to symptom management, unable to prevent neuronal loss or halt the progression of the disease. A significant limitation to more effective treatments is the difficulty of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) communication plays a crucial role in several physiological processes within the nervous system. Notably, EVs have the unique ability to cross the BBB, making them a highly promising vehicle for delivering therapeutic agents directly to the brain. Given the rising prevalence of PD, the need for therapies that prevent neuronal death and promote cell survival is urgent. This study explores the potential of neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC-EVs) using two in vitro models of PD. Our findings demonstrate that NSC-EVs significantly enhance the survival of dopaminergic neurons by reducing apoptosis and showing strong neuroprotective effects. Notably, the natural extracellular vesicles used in this study are enriched with Catalase, a potent scavenger protein with antioxidant properties. This natural enrichment further strengthens their neuroprotective capacity, enabling them to mitigate oxidative stress and protect vulnerable neurons. The use of such naturally enriched extracellular vesicles represents a promising approach for developing innovative therapies to effectively combat Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder with an increasing prevalence in aging populations. Identifying effective therapeutic targets and treatments remains a critical challenge. This study aimed to discover potential therapeutic targets and design novel compounds for PD treatment. Gene expression analysis was conducted using diverse datasets, including microarray, mRNA sequencing, and miRNA sequencing. While no common genes were identified across all datasets, the RNA-seq dataset GSE-135036 was prioritized. The investigation focused on downregulated miRNAs targeting upregulated mRNAs, revealing that hsa-mir-5585 regulates Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) within the Shigellosis pathway. Given RIPK1's role in cell death and inflammation, it emerged as a promising therapeutic target for PD. To identify RIPK1 inhibitors, 67 compounds were screened via molecular docking, with CHEMBL-3109201 exhibiting the highest binding affinity. A structurally similar compound, CHEMBL-76328382, also demonstrated strong interactions. A fragment-based drug design approach generated two novel compounds, BI-1215 and BI-146, which, along with RIPK1-IN-4 and CHEMBL-70909876, were shortlisted based on docking scores and ADME profiles. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of CHEMBL-70909876 and BI-1215, with RMSD fluctuations between 0.005 and 0.2\u00a0nm. MM-PBSA analysis further validated their superior thermodynamic stability and binding affinity compared to other candidates. This study offers novel insights into PD pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions, marking a significant step toward effective treatment strategies for this debilitating disorder.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to establish a consensus on key factors that influence medication choices for Parkinson's disease and to identify the behavioural determinants of these factors using behavioural change theory as a theoretical lens.\nThis qualitative study used the nominal group technique to conduct structured online focus group meetings. A facilitator guided participants to (1) individually generate a list of factors that influence their decision to prescribe, (2) collectively share these factors, (3) refine and clarify factors and (4) rank the most important factors. Subsequently, the most important factors identified were mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model to identify the behavioural determinants that influence medication choice.\nEighteen healthcare professionals, including neurologists, consultants and specialist nurses/practitioners who prescribe medication, were recruited across Europe and participated in one of seven focus groups.\nThere was good consensus among the participants about which factors influence their prescribing decisions. Overall, participants identified 60 unique factors that were broadly categorised into the following themes: medical or symptom concern, patient characteristics, side effects, access to treatment, clinical guidelines, social support and patient preference. Factors discussed and prioritised by the participants aligned with seven of the 14 TDF domains: knowledge; memory, attention and decision processes; beliefs about consequences; goals; social/professional role and identity; environment context and resources; and social influences. Together, these were subsequently mapped onto four of the six subdomains of the COM-B model: psychological capability, reflective motivation, physical opportunity and social opportunity.\nThese findings suggest that prescribing decisions for Parkinson's disease are determined by a complex range of factors linked to the COM-B components capability, motivation and opportunity. These can be further understood by specific behavioural domains, as identified by the TDF, which should be targeted to help optimise subsequent prescribing decisions.",

    "results": "There was good consensus among the participants about which factors influence their prescribing decisions. Overall, participants identified 60 unique factors that were broadly categorised into the following themes: medical or symptom concern, patient characteristics, side effects, access to treatment, clinical guidelines, social support and patient preference. Factors discussed and prioritised by the participants aligned with seven of the 14 TDF domains: knowledge; memory, attention and decision processes; beliefs about consequences; goals; social/professional role and identity; environment context and resources; and social influences. Together, these were subsequently mapped onto four of the six subdomains of the COM-B model: psychological capability, reflective motivation, physical opportunity and social opportunity.",

    "abstract": "Proteins of the TRIM family are involved in both innate immunity and the nervous system processes and may play an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we analyzed the expression of 35 genes of the TRIM family in neural progenitors (NPs), terminally differentiated neurons (TDNs) and glial derivatives (NGs) obtained from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of healthy donors (HD) and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), in the absence of inflammatory stimuli and upon the induction of a nonspecific inflammatory response under the influence of TNF\u03b1. In NPs and TDNs of PD patients, compared with HD cells, differences in expression were observed for only a small number of TRIM genes. Under the influence of TNF\u03b1 in TDNs, the expression of individual TRIM genes was activated, which was more significant in the cells of patients with PD compared to cells of HDs. In NGs of PD patients, the expression of many TRIM genes was initially reduced compared to HD cells and remained low or further decreased after exposure to TNF\u03b1. The data obtained demonstrate differences in the network of the TRIM family members in PD neurons and glia compared to control, and also show the multidirectional influence of the inflammatory stimulus on the expression of a number of TRIM genes in these types of cells. Considering the important role of many TRIM genes in the functioning of the innate immune system, it can be assumed that, in PD, more significant disturbances in the functioning of genes of this family occur in glia compared to neurons.",

    "abstract": "The presence of non-motor symptoms (NMS) such as olfactive deficit or neuropsychiatric symptoms has been associated with the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD). NMS are also associated with different brain structural features underlying distinctive processes in PD. NMS has been poorly studied in patients with a PD-like clinical profile, showing Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit (SWEDD). This study proposes to compare classification models differentiating PD, SWEDD and Healthy Controls (HC) based on NMS and neurostructural factors. 683 participants (382\u00a0PD diagnosed in the last 2 years, 48 with SWEDD, 170 HC) from the PPMI dataset were compared based on available assessments. Each participant underwent an olfactive, neuropsychiatric and sleep assessment, and a 3T MRI. Brain volumes were extracted and standardized from each MRI. Classifications were based on logistic regressions using 5-fold cross-validation models combining different NMS and MRI data and determining their involvement in differentiation between patient subgroups (PD vs. SWEDD) or between patients and HC. NMS were significant factors in PD vs. SWEDD, PD vs. HC and SWEDD vs. HC classifiers, when considered alone or in combination with MRI data. No classification models were significantly different from chance based-on MRI, nor more accurate combining NMS and MRI when compared with models based on NMS only. These results highlight the importance of NMS in differentiating between PD and SWEDD, PD and HC, SWEDD and HC. However, classical imaging data such as cortical and subcortical volumetry seems insufficient to improve these classifications. Other imaging features such as connectivity could also be studied.",

A total of 916 participants were recruited in the HSPD cohort, and 171 participants were in the PPMI cohort. Longitudinal analysis examined the association between baseline APLP1 levels and PD progression.\nA significant increase in APLP1 levels was observed in PD patients compared to healthy controls. Longitudinal analysis showed that patients with elevated baseline APLP1 levels experienced faster motor deterioration in HSPD cohort (HR\u2009=\u20093.627, P\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nThe data indicate that APLP1 is associated with the progression of PD, potentially offering a measurable indicator of disease progression. \u00a9 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "In levodopa treated patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the standard approach to managing motor fluctuations is to adjust dopaminergic therapy. However, despite the availability of a wide armamentarium of dopaminergic medications, most patients treated with levodopa will still experience significant OFF time, and it is increasingly clear that motor fluctuations have a significant non-dopaminergic component. In this narrative review, we compare and contrast the therapeutic profiles of the only two non-dopaminergic medications approved in the US for the management of OFF time, namely amantadine and istradefylline. When compared against each other the two agents exemplify two different pharmacological approaches to treatment. Whereas amantadine has a multimodal pharmacology, istradefylline has highly specific actions at A",

The model aims to be accurate even with small datasets and missing values, ultimately promoting its use in clinical practice to benefit patients and medical professionals.\nOur study introduces LightGBM-TabPFN, a novel hybrid model for predicting dementia conversion in PD. Combining LightGBM's strength in handling missing values with TabPFN's ability to exploit small datasets, LightGBM-TabPFN outperforms seven existing methods, achieving outstanding accuracy and interpretability thanks to SHAP analysis. This analysis leverages data from 242 PD patients across 17 variables.\nOur LightGBM-TabPFN model significantly outperformed seven existing methods. Achieving an accuracy of 0.9592 and an area under the ROC curve of 0.9737.\nThe interpretable LightGBM-TabPFN with SHAP signifies a significant advancement in predictive modeling for neurodegenerative diseases.

The objective of this study was to examine the potential relationship between the levels of circulating TMAO and its precursors and the risk of PD using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.\nWe aggregated data from three genome-wide association studies (International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium, Parkinson's Research: The Organized Genetics Initiative and GenePD, and FinnGen) to extract single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with circulating concentrations of TMAO, choline, carnitine, and betaine. These SNPs were employed as instrumental variables in a random-effects model to evaluate the causal relationship between circulating concentrations of TMAO and its precursors and the risk of Parkinson's disease, by estimating odds ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. The primary analysis employed the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method, which was complemented with MR-Egger regression analysis.\nThe analysis using the IVW method, which aggregated data from the three databases, did not show any causal relationship between circulating concentrations of TMAO and its precursors, and the risk of PD (\nThis study did not identify any conclusive evidence of a causal association between the circulating concentrations of TMAO or its precursors and the risk of PD. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether such an association indeed exists.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity, sedentary behavior (SB), and sleep duration are associated with brain health. Effects of those on developing Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly investigated. This study aimed to examine the independent and joint associations of\u00a0physical activity, SB, sleep with\u00a0PD risk.\nWe analyzed data on 401,697 participants from the UK Biobank cohort, which was enrolled in 2006-2010. Physical activities were measured based on a questionnaire. Sleep and SB time were defined through self-reported total number of hours. Models fitted with restricted cubic spline were conducted to test for linear and non-linear shapes of each association. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association of three modifiable behaviors.\nOur analytic sample included 401,697 participants with 3030 identified cases of PD (mean age, 63\u00a0years; 62.9% male). PD risk was 18% lower in the high total physical activity group (95% CI, 0.75-0.90), 22% lower in the high leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) group (95% CI, 0.71-0.86) compared with the low level and 14% higher in the high sleep duration group (95% CI, 1.05-1.24) compared to moderate group. Total SB time was irrelevant with PD risk, while high TV viewing showed a 12% increase of PD risk compared to the low group (95% CI, 1.02-1.22). Low computer use (0\u00a0h/day) was associated with a 14% higher risk compared to 1\u00a0h/day use (95% CI, 1.04-1.26). Those associations were independent. A combination of 7\u00a0h/day sleep, moderate-to-high computer use, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity of LTPA showed lowest PD risk (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57-0.85).\nPhysical activity, SB, and sleep were associated with PD risks separately. Our findings emphasize the possibility for changing these three daily activities concurrently to lower the risk of PD. These findings may promote an active lifestyle for PD prevention.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability greatly reduces quality of life in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Early and objective detection of postural impairments is crucial to facilitate interventions. Our aim was to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate people with early to mid-stage PD from healthy age-matched individuals based on spectrogram images obtained from their body sway. We hypothesized the time-frequency content of body sway to be predictive of PD, even when impairments are not yet clinically apparent.\n18 people with idiopathic PD and 15 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. We tracked participants' center of pressure (COP) using a Wii Balance Board and their full-body motion using a Microsoft Kinect, out of which we calculated the trajectory of their center of mass (COM). We used 30\u00a0s-snippets of motion data from which we acquired wavelet-based time-frequency spectrograms that were fed into a custom-built CNN as labeled images. We used binary classification to have the network differentiate between individuals with PD and controls (n\u2009=\u200915, respectively).\nClassification performance was best when the medio-lateral motion of the COM was considered. Here, our network reached a predictive accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1-score of 100%, respectively, with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 1.0. Moreover, an explainable AI approach revealed high frequencies in the postural sway data to be most distinct between both groups.\nHeeding our small and heterogeneous sample, our findings suggest a CNN classifier based on cost-effective and conveniently obtainable posturographic data to be a promising approach to detect postural impairments in early to mid-stage PD and to gain novel insight into the subtle characteristics of impairments at this stage of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Surgical device-aided therapies (DATs), including carbidopa-levodopa enteral suspension (CLES) and deep brain stimulation (DBS), are efficacious treatment options for people with advanced Parkinson's disease (aPD). While provider and patient preference influence treatment choices, DAT use remains low and social drivers of health (SDOH) may present barriers to access. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of patient characteristics and SDOH-including geographic distance to facilities that provide DATs-with likelihood of receiving DAT.\nAdults diagnosed with PD and meeting aPD clinical indicators were identified among 100\u00a0% Medicare Fee-for-Service beneficiaries linked to Inovalon's SDOH data warehouse between 01/01/2018-12/31/2020. Multivariate logistic regression models determined factors associated with DAT vs no-DAT initiation.\nOf 503,245 Medicare beneficiaries with PD, 22\u00a0% met proxy criteria for aPD, with 2\u00a0% (2450) receiving DAT (CLES 24\u00a0%; DBS 76\u00a0%). Nationwide aPD prevalence was 309 per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries. There were 413 DAT facilities nationwide (average 8 facilities/state), and aPD patients traveled 98 miles on average to a facility (range 11-255 miles). aPD patients under age 75 were 2-3x more likely to receive DAT, while those identifying as female, Black race, have moderate to severe comorbidity, and lower household incomes were less likely to receive DAT.\nFindings suggest low utilization of DATs among US Medicare beneficiaries with aPD. Even states with more DAT facilities often require patients to travel long distances. Identifying and minimizing access disparities, particularly for women, racial minorities, and people with low socioeconomic status may improve DAT utilization and outcomes for patients with aPD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates, yet current models inadequately mimic the complex human brain environment. Recent advances in brain organoid models offer a more physiologically relevant platform for studying PD, however, iPSC-derived brain organoids require long maturation times and may not accurately represent the aged brain's epigenetics and cellular contexts, limiting their applicability for modeling late-onset diseases like PD. In this study, a novel approach for generating 3D-induced dopaminergic (iDA) neuron organoids directly from human fibroblasts is presented. It is confirmed that these 3D iDA organoids more closely resemble the aged human brain and accurately replicate PD pathologies. Furthermore, this model is extended by incorporating astrocytes to create 3D iDA neuron-astrocyte assembloids, recognizing the critical role of glial cells in neurodegenerative processes. It is identified that PD assembloids incorporating control astrocytes with A53T mutant iDAs demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of healthy astrocytes. In contrast, A53T mutant astrocytes progressively contributed to neuronal degeneration and synucleinopathy in 3D-iDA assembloids. These findings suggest that directly converted 3D-iDA organoids and assembloids provide a robust and physiologically relevant model for studying PD pathogenesis and evaluating therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Elevated beta (\u03b2; 13-30 Hz) synchronization within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) characterizes bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD). \u03b2 oscillations may serve as biomarkers for off-period motor symptoms and control signals for adaptive, closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) in PD. However, their relation to striatal dopaminergic denervation and PD progression remains uncertain. Research on \u03b2 oscillations is limited to advanced PD stages undergoing DBS, prohibiting insights into early-stage progression and compensatory mechanisms. We therefore investigated \u03b2 dynamics, correlation with motor performance, and nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in a progressive PD rat model overexpressing AAV1/2-A53T \u03b1-synuclein, mimicking PD pathology. Over eight weeks, we longitudinally conducted behavioral assessments using the cylinder test and recorded local field potentials (LFP) from the STN and motor cortex (MCx) in the AAV-A53T-\u03b1Syn PD rat model. Increased \u03b2 power and burst parameters accompanied early motor deficits in the AAV-A53T-\u03b1Syn PD rat model. Changes were observed in the STN and MCx versus empty vector controls; alterations intensified with pathology progression. Increased high \u03b2 power and burst parameters (e.g. long burst probability in the STN but not MCx) were associated with motor impairment and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Multivariate analyses from these rat-derived data demonstrated that combined \u03b2 parameters in the cortico-subthalamic pathway and striatal dopaminergic fiber density predicted motor performance and neurodegeneration. Additional multivariate analyses confirmed the translational relevance of the A53T PD model, linking \u03b2 activity and dopamine uptake to motor impairment (UPDRS III Med-OFF) in human PD patients. Our data support the pathophysiological significance of \u03b2 oscillations as a progression marker of PD for motor symptoms and neurodegeneration. Our predictive models carry translational relevance, with the prospect of monitoring disease progression and neuroprotective outcomes in PD based on LFP recordings.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of Lewy bodies that are composed of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn). However, the factors that regulate \u03b1-Syn pathology and nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration remain poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrate cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) increases the risk for PD. Moreover, 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC), a brain-specific oxysterol that is catalyzed by CYP46A1, is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients. Herein, we show that the levels of CYP46A1 and 24-OHC are elevated in PD patients and increase with age in a mouse model. Overexpression of CYP46A1 intensifies \u03b1-Syn pathology, whereas genetic removal of CYP46A1 attenuates \u03b1-Syn neurotoxicity and nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in the brain. Moreover, supplementation with exogenous 24-OHC exacerbates the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by \u03b1-Syn fibrils. Intracerebral injection of 24-OHC enhances the spread of \u03b1-Syn pathology and dopaminergic neurodegeneration via elevated X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) levels. Thus, elevated CYP46A1 and 24-OHC promote neurotoxicity and the spread of \u03b1-Syn via the XBP1-LAG3 axis. Strategies aimed at inhibiting the CYP46A1-24-OHC axis and LAG3 could hold promise as disease-modifying therapies for PD.",

    "abstract": "Emerging pathological and neurophysiological evidence has highlighted the cerebellum's involvement in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to explore the potential of cerebellum-derived magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics in distinguishing PD patients from healthy controls (HC). A retrospective analysis was conducted using three-dimensional-T1 MRI data (n=\u2009374) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset (n=\u2009204) and an independent in-house cohort (n=\u2009170). Radiomic features (n=\u2009883) were extracted from the cerebellar gray and white matter of each individual. Three machine learning models were developed: a cerebellar gray matter model, a cerebellar white matter model, and a combined gray and white matter model, to classify PD patients and HC. The results showed that the cerebellar gray matter model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.931 in the training set, with a sensitivity of 60.8% and specificity of 97.1%, while in the testing set, it obtained an AUC of 0.874, with a sensitivity of 86.1% and specificity of 62.6%. The white matter-based model demonstrated an AUC of 0.846 (sensitivity, 59.8%; specificity, 87.3%) in the training set and an AUC of 0.868 (sensitivity, 81.0%; specificity, 75.8%) in the testing set. Notably, the combined gray and white matter model exhibited superior performance, achieving an AUC of 0.936 (sensitivity, 65.7%; specificity, 96.1%) in the training set and an AUC of 0.881 (sensitivity, 82.3%; specificity, 63.7%) in the testing set. Key radiomic features contributing to PD classification included Gray-level Dependence Matrix, Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix and First-Order from gray matter, as well as Gray-level Size Zone Matrix from white matter, highlighting significant radiomics changes in the cerebellum associated with PD. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MRI radiomics of cerebellar gray and white matter can effectively differentiate PD patients from HC, supporting the cerebellum's pivotal role in PD pathology and its potential as an imaging biomarker for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related progressive disorder that leads to dopaminergic loss and subsequent motor dysfunction. Current therapies mainly deal with symptomatic effects, and hence, therapies targeting progressive neurodegeneration need to developed. In this study, tirzepatide, a coagonist of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors, exhibited a neuroprotective effect in preliminary studies. This study aims to evaluate the effect of tirzepatide, in comparison with exendin-4, in a rat model of PD. The effect of tirzepatide (50 and 100 nmol/kg, s.c.) and exendin-4 (8 \u03bcg/kg, s.c.) on behavioral functions, oxidative markers, inflammatory markers, dopamine level, and alpha-synuclein expression were studied against a rotenone (2 mg/kg)-induced toxicity model in rats. Tirzepatide prevented rotenone-induced motor deficits. Additionally, it significantly inhibited the rotenone-induced increase in proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Furthermore, it upregulated striatal dopamine levels. It alleviated oxidative stress and alpha-synuclein aggregation. Both doses of tirzepatide exert neuroprotective effects in a PD rat model. Furthermore, the effect is dose-dependent, and a 100 nmol/kg dose of tirzepatide was found to be more effective.",

    "abstract": "The link between subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and apathy in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) remains a controversial topic. The literature is mixed and the most supported explanation is the reduction of dopaminergic treatment. Yet a body of clinical and experimental evidences suggest that STN-DBS itself can also promote apathy in certain patients. However, the parameters accounting for apathy heterogeneity in stimulated patients along with the mechanisms underlying apathy induced by STN-DBS remain to be investigated. Whether bilateral and unilateral STN-DBS have the same influence on apathy is for instance unknown. We previously and separately showed in patients and rodents that bilateral STN-DBS can promote apathy per se. Here, we compare the effect of bilateral versus unilateral STN-DBS both in patients and in rodents. We conducted a clinical follow-up of patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing unilateral or bilateral STN-DBS and assessing apathy 3\u2009months before and after STN-DBS. In parallel, we applied chronic and uninterrupted unilateral or bilateral DBS in rodents and extract longitudinal motivational changes with a battery of behavioural tests. While bilateral STN-DBS promotes apathy in patients and induces a loss of motivation in rodents, we found that unilateral STN-DBS did not exert such an effect both in patients and in rats. These data show that bilateral but not unilateral STN-DBS promotes apathy. This not only substantiate the induction of neuropsychiatric effects by STN-DBS but also suggest that this might be circumvented if STN-DBS is applied unilaterally instead of bilaterally.",

    "abstract": "Hemoglobin (Hb) and heme, which are typically confined within red blood cells (RBCs), are essential for intravascular transport of gases and nutrients. However, these molecules acquire secondary functions upon exposure to the extracellular environment. Hb and heme generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are potent pro-inflammatory agents that contribute to oxidative stress and cellular damage. These events are relevant to neurodegenerative processes, where oxidative stress, irregular deposition of protein aggregates, and chronic inflammation are key pathological features. Extracellular Hb, heme, and oxidative stress derived from hemorrhagic events or RBC lysis may contribute to increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. These events allow Hb and heme to interact with neuroimmune cells and pathological protein aggregates, further amplifying pro-inflammatory signaling and the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). Chronic neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction lead to neuronal degeneration. Here, we sought to elucidate the pro-oxidative and inflammatory actions of extracellular Hb and heme, emphasizing their potential impact on AD and PD development.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. PD patients exhibit varying degrees of abnormal glucose metabolism throughout disease stages. Abnormal glucose metabolism is closely linked to the PD pathogenesis and progression. Key glucose metabolism processes involved in PD include glucose transport, glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phosphate pathway, and gluconeogenesis. Recent studies suggest that glucose metabolism is a potential therapeutic target for PD. In this review, we explore the connection between PD and abnormal glucose metabolism, focusing on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. We also summarize potential therapeutic drugs related to glucose metabolism based on results from current cellular and animal model studies.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence supports the causal role of both plasma metabolites and gut microbiota (GM) in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it remains unclear whether GM are responsible for causing PD through plasma metabolites. Here, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the intrinsic causal relationships among GM, plasma metabolites, and PD. Summary statistics were derived from a GWAS of 1400 metabolites (N\u2009=\u20098299), GM (N\u2009=\u200918,340), and PD (Ncase\u2009=\u200933,674 and Ncontrol\u2009=\u2009449,056). We used two-step/mediation MR (TSMR) to study the mediating effect of plasma metabolites on the association between GM and the risk of developing PD. We detected 54 genetic traits that were causally associated with PD development. According to the TSMR analysis, ceramide had a mediating effect on the relationship between the genus Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and the risk of developing PD (15.35% mediation; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.29-32.75%). 7-Alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate had a mediating effect on the relationship between the genus Eubacterium xylanophilum group and the risk of developing PD (11.04% mediation; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.11-27.07%). In the present study, we used MR analysis to investigate the connections among GM, plasma metabolites, and PD. This comprehensive investigation offers insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of PD and the roles of the intestinal microbiota and metabolites in this disease.",

    "abstract": "Timely identification of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia is crucial for the effective management and enhancement of patients' quality of life. The utilization of electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring applications has proven instrumental in diagnosing various brain disorders. Prior research has predominantly relied on predefined knowledge of physiological alterations associated with different diseases, employing feature extraction to discern brain conditions. This study introduces SwiftBrainNet, a neural network designed for the classification of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia using short resting-state EEG segments. SwiftBrainNet aims to minimize reliance on manual feature extraction, relying solely on short EEG segments. Functioning as a single-input, dual-output neural network, SwiftBrainNet incorporates a deep supervisory mechanism facilitated by an auxiliary decoder, which enhances its classification performance by guiding the network in extracting shallow features. Our study conducts a clinical application-oriented experiment that uses continuous multi-segment EEG voting classification. This experiment demonstrates a noticeable improvement in accuracy compared to leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), especially when combined with our data augmentation techniques. These findings underscore the method's practical value in clinical settings, where continuous data frames and enhanced generalization across subjects can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, the high accuracy observed in subject-dependent classification with very short data segments suggests that SwiftBrainNet might capture subject-specific EEG patterns, which could be further explored to enhance disease-related feature learning. This paper provides new evidence supporting the use of short-term EEG data for neurodiagnostic applications, making SwiftBrainNet a promising tool for the early detection of neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neuro-degenerative disease that is common in middle-aged and elderly people, and its incidence is increasing year by year. Studies have shown that pathological products produced by a series of pathological cascade reactions in the enteric nervous system (ENS) of PD patients travel to the brain through the vagus nerve pathway in the microbial-gut-brain axis, and ultimately lead to the occurrence and development of PD. Acupuncture plays an important role in interfering with pathological products of ENS, restoring ecological balance of intestine and delaying PD process. In this paper, the effects of acupuncture on intestinal flora, production of related microbial products, \u03b1-synuclein, neuroinflammatory response and oxidative stress in patients or animal model with PD were reviewed.\n\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\uff08PD\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u4e8e\u4e2d\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u9010\u5e74\u589e\u9ad8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793aPD\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u80a0\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ENS\uff09\u5185\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u75c5\u7406\u6027\u7ea7\u8054\u53cd\u5e94\u6240\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u4ea7\u7269\u7ecf\u5fae\u751f\u7269-\u80a0-\u8111\u8f74\u4e2d\u7684\u8ff7\u8d70\u795e\u7ecf\u901a\u8def\u4e0a\u884c\u81f3\u5927\u8111\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5bfc\u81f4PD\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u9488\u523a\u5728\u8c03\u8282ENS\u4e2d\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u4ea7\u7269\u3001\u6062\u590d\u80a0\u9053\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7684\u751f\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u53ca\u5ef6\u7f13PD\u8fdb\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5c31\u9488\u523a\u5e72\u9884PD\u60a3\u8005\u6216\u52a8\u7269\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80a0\u9053\u83cc\u7fa4\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u4ea7\u7269\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3001\u03b1-\u7a81\u89e6\u6838\u86cb\u767d\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u708e\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\u53ca\u6c27\u5316\u5e94\u6fc0\u7b49\u4f5c\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0.",

    "abstract": "In preclinical research of Parkinson's disease, several rodent models, notably the classical 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model and the A53T-alpha-synuclein model, have been widely used, yet their distinct neurochemical characteristics in conjunction with behavioral and histopathological changes have been scarcely documented.\nWe examined the two rat models of Parkinson's disease and characterized them using [18F]FP-CIT animal PET imaging. The 6-OHDA model (n=10) was induced by unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the middle forebrain bundle, while the A53T-alpha-synuclein model (n=10) was mediated by the adeno-associated viral vectors injected into the substantia nigra. We hypothesized that these models would present differential neurochemical profiles, which could reflect their behavioral and histopathological features and potentially serve as a supplementary tool for evaluating the outcomes of interventions in animal experiments.\nThe striatum showed decreased PET uptake on the affected side compared to the unaffected control side, which was highly correlated with the stepping behaviors (R = 0.854 [95% CI, 0.606 to 0.951]). The decrease in striatal PET uptake was more pronounced in the 6-OHDA model than in the A53T-alpha-synuclein model: the 6-OHDA model exhibited a 60% [95% CI, 48% to 65%] decrease in the affected side compared the control side, while the A53T-alpha-synuclein model exhibited a 20% [95% CI, -16% to 47%] decrease. Interestingly, PET uptake in the forebrain cortical region, including the motor cortex, was exclusively decreased in the 6-OHDA model (p = 1.0\u00d710-4 and p = 1.2\u00d710-3, respectively), indicating that 6-OHDA model is affected not only in the nigrostriatal system but also in other cortical regions. Conversely, the A53T-alpha-synuclein model showed no significant alterations in these cortical regions.\nAlthough the A53T-alpha-synuclein model demonstrates less definitive behavioral changes compared to the 6-OHDA model, it presents a more confined pathophysiological representation of Parkinson's disease and may be better suited for evaluating certain therapeutic interventions when utilized with adequate neurochemical characterization.",

    "abstract": "Repurposing the existing drugs for the management of both common and rare diseases is increasingly appealing due to challenges such as high attrition rates, the economy, and the slow pace of discovering new drugs. Drug repurposing involves the utilization of existing medications to treat diseases for which they were not originally intended. Despite encountering scientific and economic challenges, the pharmaceutical industry is intrigued by the potential to uncover new indications for medications. Medication repurposing is applicable across different stages of drug development, with the greatest potential observed when the drug has undergone prior safety testing. In this review, strategies for repurposing drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD) are outlined, a neurodegenerative disorder predominantly impacting dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta region. PD is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition marked by an amalgam of motor and non-motor symptoms. Despite the availability of certain symptomatic treatments, particularly targeting motor symptoms, there remains a lack of established drugs capable of modifying the clinical course of PD, leading to its unchecked progression. Although standard drug discovery initiatives focusing on treatments that relieve diseases have yielded valuable understanding into the underlying mechanisms of PD, none of the numerous promising candidates identified in preclinical studies have successfully transitioned into clinically effective medications. Due to the substantial expenses associated with drug discovery endeavors, it is understandable that there has been a notable shift towards drug reprofiling strategies. Assessing the efficacy of an existing medication offers the additional advantage of circumventing the requirement for preclinical safety assessments and formulation enhancements, consequently streamlining the process and reducing both the duration of time and financial investments involved in bringing a treatment to clinical fruition. Furthermore, repurposed drugs may benefit from lower rates of failure, presenting an additional potential advantage. Various strategies for repurposing drugs are available to researchers in the field of PD. Some of these strategies have demonstrated effectiveness in identifying appropriate drugs for clinical trials, thereby providing validation for such strategies. This review provides an overview of the diverse strategies employed for drug reprofiling from approaches that place emphasis on single-gene transcriptional investigations to comprehensive epidemiological correlation analysis. Additionally, instances of previous or current research endeavors employing each strategy have been discussed. For the strategies that have not been yet implemented in PD research, their strategic efficacy is demonstrated using examples involving other disorders. In this review, we assess the safety and efficacy potential of prominent candidates repurposed as potential treatments for modifying the course of PD undergoing advanced clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study aimed to examine hospitalization costs and associated factors for Parkinson disease (PD) patients. A total of 848 PD patients were extracted from the National Neurological and Brain Center in Xinjiang, and basic demographic information, medical insurance payment, and hospital expenses were collected. SPSS 26.0 was used and univariate analysis was performed on the number of days of hospitalization, times of hospitalizations, gender, payment method, and total hospitalization costs. Correlation analysis was performed using multiple linear regression to explore the influencing factors of hospitalization expenses. The average hospitalization cost of PD patients was 15,515.78\u2005\u00b1\u200529,667.49 yuan. Diagnosis fees accounted for the highest proportion (29.50%), followed by material costs (25.50%) and drug costs (21.20%). PD patients with less than 5 hospitalizations were the main source of disease, but 2.83% of them had more than 10 hospitalizations (P\u2005=\u2005.025). Female patients were significantly more than male patients, but the total hospitalization costs of male patients were much higher than those of female patients (P\u2005<\u2005.001). The number of PD patients increased significantly when they were over 60 years old, but the hospitalization costs were much lower than those of patients under 60 years old (P\u2005=\u2005.007). The effect of the payment method on total hospitalization cost did not show a statistical difference (P\u2005=\u2005.213). There was a positive correlation between hospitalization days and total hospitalization cost (P\u2005<\u2005.001). In conclusion, the results of the regression model suggested that age, length of hospital stay, gender, and number of hospitalizations could be used as predictive variables for hospitalization costs in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor impairments such as stiffness, involuntary shaking, and slowed movement. In addition, PD patients frequently experience nonmotor symptoms, especially depression. This study uses a mixed-methods scientometric analysis to review global research trends and advancements in PD and depression. This analysis is vital for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers, identifying knowledge gaps and directing future research efforts.\nWe conducted a comprehensive literature review on PD and depression using the Web of Science database from 2004 to 2023, facilitated by CiteSpace 6.1.R6. Our analysis examined collaborations among authors, institutions, countries, and keywords, incorporating insights from RCTs and qualitative studies. We calculated effect sizes and confidence intervals with precision. Ethical approval was not required as the study used publicly available data without personal information.\nOur analysis included 3048 research papers and 915 reviews, involving 17,927 authors and 12,466 institutions. The United States and the University of Toronto led in publications. Studies revealed significant effect sizes with narrow confidence intervals, particularly on the prevalence and impact of depression in PD patients. High-frequency keywords included \"Parkinson's disease,\" \"depression,\" \"quality of life,\" \"non-motor symptom,\" and \"dementia.\" Visual mapping identified critical research nodes and future directions.\nOver the past 2 decades, research on the PD-depression link has accelerated. Our analysis highlights prevailing trends and critical areas, providing evidence-based recommendations for therapeutic strategies. This study offers valuable insights for clinicians and researchers, emphasizing future research priorities to improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to gain deeper understanding of the experiences of occupational therapists and physiotherapists, working with those with atypical Parkinson's conditions, within the UK. A literature review identified that research into these roles is limited and unrepresentative.\nA qualitative approach, informed by hermeneutic phenomenology was used to guide the study design. Semi-structured, online interviews, focussed on therapists' experiences of success and challenge, were completed with six physiotherapists, and three occupational therapists, experienced in working within this area of practice. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and were analysed using Braun and Clarke's reflexive thematic analysis.\nFour themes were generated and discussed: (1) maintaining hope without giving false hope, (2) maintaining quality of life despite deterioration, (3) maintaining empowerment and choice despite loss of control, (4) maintaining effective working despite variable resources.\nParticipants' accounts of success and challenge reveal a complex landscape of tensions that must be negotiated and balanced within their practice. Insight is gained into some of the mechanisms involved in maintaining a patient's hope, their ability to participate and their sense of identity, despite the devastating losses associated with these conditions.\nExploration of participant\u2019s experiences of success and challenge as occupational therapists and physiotherapists working with those with atypical Parkinson\u2019s conditions, reveals some of the mechanisms which underlie their complex practice.Individualised, client centred care, which focuses on quality of life and maintaining patients\u2019 engagement with valued activities, and connection with others can maintain hope despite the progressive nature of these conditions.Building a therapeutic relationship over time, in which patient\u2019s choices and preferences are respected, can facilitate acceptance, and empower patients to make timely and informed decisions at all stages of their condition.Communication and joint working with the wider multidisciplinary team is key to successful and coordinated patient care.Specialist knowledge of these conditions enhance practice and allows for the balance between risk and quality of life to be maintained.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) consist of progressive illnesses of central nervous system that primarily affect the elderly and are characterized by movement symptoms, memory decline, and cognitive impairment. A number of variables, including the lack of a novel treatment, a steady rise in the patient population, and the high expense of care and treatment, have contributed to the growing significance of these diseases. In recent decades, we have gained a better understanding of the causes of diseases, but complex mechanisms of neuronal loss, combined with physiological factors that are incompatible, pose challenges in describing the pathogenic processes and devising effective treatments. Currently, there are no known treatments for most of these diseases, rendering them incurable. Therefore, there is a pressing need for therapeutic interventions that have the potential to effectively treat neurodegeneration.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a widespread neurodegenerative condition [1]; however, its association with glycolysis, specifically the activity of genes related to glycolysis, has not yet been explored. We downloaded 3 datasets related to PD from the GEO database and identified the glycolytic genes related to PD. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were conducted. We constructed a PD diagnosis model using the SVM algorithm for differentially expressed glycolysis-related genes and verified the model with LASSO regression analysis. Next, we constructed a regulatory network of genes that were differentially expressed with respect to glycolysis. Finally, the amount of immune cell infiltration was analyzed in PD samples, and the correlation between differential genes and immune cells was calculated. A total of 64 differentially expressed glycolytic genes associated with PD were screened. Then, a GO analysis was conducted, followed by KEGG and GASE enrichment analyses. Within the established PD diagnostic model, 26 genes that were differentially expressed and linked to glycolysis showed strong statistical significance. After further screening, a diagnostic model for PD including seven key genes was established. Further analysis showed that ABHD5 most strongly correlated with neutrophils (r\u00a0=\u00a00.507). The key gene SMAD3 was strongly negatively associated with gamma delta T cells (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.488). This research offered a theoretical foundation for the association between glycolysis and PD. Seven glycolytic genes were identified as significantly linked to PD and warrant additional research.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting motor function due to progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Current therapies offer symptomatic relief but fail to halt disease progression, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. This study explores the neuroprotective potential of exogenous human metallothionein 2 (hMT2) peptide in a rotenone-induced PD zebrafish model.\nAdult zebrafish were divided into four groups: control, rotenone-treated, hMT2 pre-treatment, and hMT2 co-treatment. PD model was established by exposing zebrafish to 5 \u00b5g/L rotenone water for 28 days. hMT2 (0.2 \u00b5g) was administered intracranially either one day before or seven days after rotenone exposure.\nThe novel tank test demonstrated that rotenone exposure significantly impaired locomotor activity (\nThese results suggest that hMT2 exhibited neuroprotective effect in the PD model zebrafish. These findings support the potential of MT as a therapeutic agent for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder. A large majority of Parkinson's disease patients have an unknown etiology, which is classified as idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Generating disease models directly from idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients may improve the understanding of the disease pathology. Both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative roles have been suggested for cystatin C in neurodegenerative disease. In Parkinson's disease, investigations assessing cystatin C levels in different types of biospecimens such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and in vitro models have had conflicting results. We present a study assessing cystatin C levels in different biospecimen types originating from the same subjects. Using a sandwich ELISA, we compared cystatin C concentration in blood derivatives (plasma and serum) and culture media of derived models (stem cells, neuroepithelial stem cells, and midbrain organoids) of three idiopathic Parkinson's disease and three age-matched healthy control subjects with the same ",

    "abstract": "To explore MRI-based radiomics models, integrating clinical characteristics, for differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) to evaluate their diagnostic performance.\nA total of 256 participants [153 PD, 103 healthy controls (HCs)] from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical Hospital, were enrolled as the training set, and 120 subjects (74 PD, 46 HCs) from the PPMI dataset served as the test set. Radiomics features were extracted from structural MRI (T1WI and T2-FLair). Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were developed using MRI radiomics data from both monomodal and multimodal radiomics models. The clinical-radiomics model was constructed by integrating clinical variables, including UPDRS, Hoehn-Yahr stage, age, sex, and MMSE scores. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the performance of the models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to access the clinical usefulness of the models.\nIn the training set, the T2-FLair and T1WI radiomics model achieved an AUC of 0.896 (95% CI, 0.812-0.900) and 0.899 (95% CI, 0.818-0.908), respectively. The double-sequence radiomics model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance, with an AUC of 0.965 (95% CI, 0.885-0.978) in the training set and an AUC of 0.852 (95% CI, 0.748-0.910) in the test set. The integrated clinical-radiomics model showed enhanced diagnostic accuracy, with AUC = 0.983 (95% CI, 0.897-0.996) in the training set and AUC = 0.837 (95% CI, 0.786-0.902) in the test set. Rad-scores derived from the radiomics model were significantly correlated with diagnostic outcomes (\nThe integrated clinical-radiomics model offered superior diagnostic performance compared to models based relying solely on imaging or clinical data, underscoring its potential as a non-invasive and effective tool in routine clinical practice for the early diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Visual disability in Parkinson's disease (PD) is not fully explained by retinal neurodegeneration. We aimed to delineate the brain substrate of visual dysfunction in PD and its association with retinal thickness.\nForty-two PD patients and 29 controls underwent 3-Tesla MRI, retinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and visual testing across four domains. Voxel-level associations between gray matter volume and visual outcomes were used to define a visual impairment region (visualROI). Functional connectivity of the visualROI with brain networks was analyzed. Covariance analysis of brain regions associated with retinal thinning (retinalROI) was conducted using hierarchical clustering to develop a model of retinal and brain neurodegeneration linked to disease progression.\nThe amygdala was the primary component of the visualROI, comprising 32.3% and 14.6% of its left and right volumes. Functional connectivity analysis revealed significant disruptions between the visualROI and medial/lateral visual networks in PD. Covariance analysis identified three clusters within retinalROI: (1) the thalamic nucleus, (2) the amygdala and lateral/occipital visual regions, and (3) frontal regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex and frontal attention networks. Hierarchical clustering suggested a two-phase progression: early amygdala damage (Braak 1-3) disrupting visual network connections, followed by retinal and frontal atrophy (Braak 4-5) exacerbating visual dysfunction.\nOur findings support a novel, amygdala-centric two-phase model of visual dysfunction in PD. Early amygdala degeneration disrupts visual pathways, while advanced-stage disconnection between the amygdala and frontal regions and retinal neurodegeneration contributes to further visual disability.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have reported social cognitive deficits, particularly in emotional processing, in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, a comprehensive characterization of these deficits and their underlying neural correlates remains elusive. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between deficits in the recognition of complex mental states and structural/functional brain changes in non-demented PD individuals. To reach this aim, 24 PD participants underwent clinical assessment, neuropsychological testing and the FAcial Complex Expressions (FACE) test, a novel test of complex mental state recognition from faces. Patients were classified as clinically impaired (n\u2009=\u20098) or unimpaired (n\u2009=\u200916) based on performance on this test. Magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired to investigate the association between FACE test performance and both resting-state functional connectivity and grey matter volume, within the emotion understanding network and at the whole-brain level. Statistical analyses also included the comparison of imaging metrics between the impaired and unimpaired groups. Results showed that complex mental state recognition in PD was significantly associated with both defective and compensatory mechanisms at the functional and anatomical level within the emotion understanding network, particularly involving the amygdala, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, primary/secondary somatosensory cortices, and right anterior temporal cortex. Whole-brain results extended the network to temporal and medial frontal areas. In conclusion, reduced recognition of complex mental states in non-demented PD patients is associated with alterations in the emotion understanding network A comprehensive characterization of early emotional deficits in these patients may have significant implications in the characterization of the cognitive phenotype, with potential benefit for tailored non-pharmacological intervention.",

    "abstract": "Compensatory mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are thought to explain the temporal delay between the beginning of the neurodegenerative process and the appearance of clinical signs. The enhanced structural integrity of the corticospinal tract was previously suggested as one of these mechanisms.\nTo understand the relations between corticospinal tract integrity and the anatomical, clinical, electrophysiological, and genetic PD characteristics.\nWe analyzed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fractional anisotropy (FA) data from 40 genotyped patients with PD (18 without known genetic cause, 11 with \nPD is associated with higher corticospinal FA values (p\u2009<\u20090.001) that are negatively correlated with the disease duration (p\u2009=\u20090.032), confirming previous results. Higher FA values are negatively correlated with cerebral grey matter volumes (p\u2009<\u20090.001) but not with the motor or cognitive PD characteristics, or with the subthalamic beta-oscillatory activity measured intra-operatively. Increased corticospinal FA values are strongly affected by the genetic etiology of PD, with higher values in the monogenic forms of the disease (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The compensatory index, calculated by dividing the corticostriatal FA value by the cerebral grey matter volume, is highest in \nThe genetic etiology of PD strongly shapes corticospinal tract changes along with disease-duration and cerebral grey matter atrophy. The changes may serve as compensatory mechanism.\nPeople with Parkinson's disease (PD) start to exhibit symptoms years after changes in their brain have begun, which may be explained by compensatory mechanisms. One possible compensatory mechanism is enhanced signal transduction in the corticospinal tracts (CST) linking the cortex and the spinal cord. The goal of the study was to understand the relations between CST integrity and the anatomical, clinical, electrophysiological, and genetic characteristics of PD. We employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fractional anisotropy (FA) to assess the integrity of the CST.

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FoG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) with limited response to dopaminergic medication and subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). Substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) stimulation could improve FoG.\nTo analyze the effect of combined STN-SNr stimulation at different frequencies on FoG.\nWe performed a double-blind, cross-over, randomized pilot trial involving STN-DBS treated PD patients with FoG. Participants received: high-frequency (HF) STN-DBS (S), combined HF-STN and SNr stimulation (C1), and combined HF-STN and low-frequency (LF) SNr stimulation (C2), for one month each. The primary endpoint was the score change in the New-Freezing-of-Gait-Questionnaire (NFOG-Q). Secondary analyses were performed on motor complications, axial symptoms, daily living activities, psychiatric symptoms, sleep, and patient preference.\nFifteen patients received at least one combined stimulation. No significant difference in NFOG-Q scores was found between S, C1, and C2; one-third of patients showed a clinically significant improvement (\u22658 points) with combined stimulations. Motor complications improved significantly with C1 and C2 (C1-S: 3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8 vs. 4.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8, p\u2009=\u20090.046; C2-S: 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1 vs. 4.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8, p\u2009=\u20090.005). 80% of patients preferred the combined STN-SNr stimulation while blinded. All adverse events were manageable.\nOur study did not prove a statistically significant improvement in NFOG-Q with STN-SNr stimulation; however, one-third of patients experienced a clinically meaningful FoG improvement, and the majority preferred to maintain STN-SNr stimulation. STN-SNr stimulation was both safe and effective in addressing motor complications and improving sleep quality, highlighting the importance of further exploration into the effects of combined STN-SNr stimulation.\nWe aimed to identify novel therapeutic approaches for freezing of gait (FoG), a disabling symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with risk of falls and poor life quality. FoG affects 31 up to 87% of PD patients and can be difficult to manage with standard PD medications. FoG may remain unchanged or even worsen in patients treated with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). We focused on DBS-treated PD patients and stimulated simultaneously two areas of the brain: the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the typical target for treating PD motor symptoms, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). 15 PD patients with FoG received different types of brain stimulation for one month each: STN stimulation alone and combined STN\u2009+\u2009SNr stimulation at two different stimulation frequencies. We measured improvement of FoG (using a validated questionnaire) and other PD symptoms (including motor fluctuations, anxiety and depression, and sleep quality), as well as safety and tolerability of the combined STN\u2009+\u2009SNr stimulation. Finally, we observed the patient preference for the type of stimulation provided. We found no statistically significant change of FoG scores with STN\u2009+\u2009SNr stimulation, but one-third of patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in FoG. STN\u2009+\u2009SNr stimulations helped improve motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. Moreover, 80% of the patients preferred the combined stimulation over the standard STN stimulation. We believe this data suggest that combined STN\u2009+\u2009SNr stimulation could be a valuable area for further research aiming to improve FoG and can be safely attempted in clinical practice in DBS-treated patients with disabling FoG.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective in managing motor symptoms in select cases of Parkinson's disease (PD). Nonetheless, the ideal timing for surgery and the comparative outcomes of unilateral versus bilateral DBS procedures remain under-researched areas.\nWe aimed to compare the impact of unilateral and bilateral DBS on the motor manifestations of PD using standardized Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part-III (UPDRS-III).\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of PD patients who underwent multidisciplinary DBS screening which made a formal recommendation for surgical approach. We compared unilateral, bilateral \"rapid\" (less than 2 months apart), and bilateral \"staged\" (5-11 months apart) implantation approaches. The study included 90 patients, 48 patients, and 42 patients from the 3 groups, respectively. The primary outcome was the percentage improvement in baseline off UPDRS-III scores compared to medication-off/DBS-on conditions at 3-6 months and 10-14 months post-surgery. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare scores within groups and across follow-up periods. The Kruskal-Wallis test assessed differences among groups. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses were performed to adjust for confounding variables.\nUPDRS-III scores improved significantly from baseline at both follow-up intervals regardless of the type of DBS staging approach. The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed no significant differences in UPDRS-III percentage improvement among groups at 3-6 months (p\u2009=\u20090.125) and 10-14 months (p\u2009=\u20090.298) post-DBS.\nOur study revealed that in a single experienced DBS center which employed multidisciplinary screening, assignment to unilateral and bilateral DBS, both rapid and staged, targeting the STN or GPi, effectively improved motor symptoms for up to 14 months.\nDeep brain stimulation is a surgical treatment that helps manage motor symptoms in select people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the best timing for surgery and whether it's better to have DBS implanted on one side of the brain (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral) from the beginning are still unclear. This study compared the effects of unilateral and bilateral DBS on movement problems in 180 PD patients. The patients were divided into three groups: 90 had DBS on one side, and 90 had DBS on both sides implanted in a staged manner, either quickly (named bilateral rapid, with surgeries done less than 2 months apart) or more slowly (named bilateral staged, with surgeries done 5\u201311 months apart). We measured their movement problems using a standard motor assessment after surgery at two different times: 3\u20136 months and 10\u201314 months; and we compared that to their baseline scores. We found that all groups showed significant improvement in their movement problems after DBS. There were no major differences in improvement between those who had one side done and those who had both sides done, whether quickly or slowly, up to 14 months after surgery. In conclusion, DBS, whether done on one side or both sides of the brain and regardless of the timing of staging between surgeries, significantly improved movement problems in PD patients for up to 14 months after surgery.",

    "abstract": "In 2023, a workshop was organized by the UK charity Cure Parkinson's with The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research and Parkinson's UK to review the field of growth factors (GFs) for Parkinson's disease (PD). This was a follow up to a previous meeting held in 2019.\nFor many years, scientists have explored the idea of administering growth factors to the brain, thereby repairing the damage associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD). Growth factors like glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) have shown promise in animal models of PD, and initial clinical trials suggested that this approach may be beneficial for patients. However, there has been some uncertainty in the field after a number of clinical trials did not reach their primary endpoints. Nevertheless, the development of growth factor therapies for PD has continued, with new trials underway. Recent developments in this scientific area were discussed at a workshop organized by a number of PD charities in 2023. The discussion and conclusions from that workshop are presented in this new paper.",

    "abstract": "Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) is acknowledged for its therapeutic benefits in Parkinson's disease (PD), yet long-term adherence remains a challenge.\nThe primary aim of this study was to assess the preliminary effects of EMST coupled with a mobile health app (SpiroGym) on self-efficacy and exercise adherence in PD patients. The secondary aim was to assess the usability of the SpiroGym app.\nThis single-group, multicenter, multinational proof-of-concept study involved 63 PD patients across four tertiary PD centers. Participants were enrolled in either a 1-week (n\u2009=\u200935) or 24-week (n\u2009=\u200928) EMST program coupled with SpiroGym app. Self-efficacy was assessed using the Self-Efficacy for Home Exercise Program scale (SEHEPS) and exercise adherence was monitored by SpiroGym app. Usability was evaluated using the System Usability Scale.\nPost-intervention, significant improvements in SEHEPS were observed in 1-week group (d\u2009=\u20090.48; p\u2009=\u20090.02) and 24-week group (d\u2009=\u20090.57; p\u2009=\u20090.002). Adherence rates in the 24-week PD patient group were high throughout the course of the study. Post-training SEHEPS was found to correlate (rho\u2009=\u20090.55; adjusted p\u2009=\u20090.016) with adherence to EMST during the non-supervised maintenance phase. The SpiroGym app exhibited high usability (>85th percentile score), with no significant differences noted between short-term and long-term use, indicating sustained user satisfaction.\nThe results of our study suggest a promising role for SpiroGym app in supporting adherence to home-based EMST in PD patients. Nevertheless, future comparative studies are required to confirm SpiroGym's effectiveness.\nPeople with Parkinson's disease (PD) can have trouble sticking with long-term exercise programs. This study looked at using a smartphone app called SpiroGym to see if it could help people with PD with their home breathing exercises. We included 63 patients with PD from four different treatment centers. Patients were divided into two groups: one used the SpiroGym app for 1 week, and the other for 24 weeks. We wanted to see if the app helped patients feel more confident about exercising at home and if breathing exercises were performed regularly. We also checked how easy the app was to use. After using the app, both groups reported feeling more confident about doing their home breathing exercises. The group that used the app for 24 weeks regularly did their exercises throughout the study. Participants rated the app highly for ease of use, regardless of how long they used it. In conclusion, the SpiroGym app might be a potentially helpful tool for people with PD to maintain their breathing exercises at home. However, future studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Best practice guidelines in Parkinson's disease (PD) calls for the immediate initiation of rehabilitation therapies (inclusive of physical (PT) and occupational therapy (OT)) to prevent or ameliorate the loss of function and quality of life associated with disease progression.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the utilization of PT and OT services within the first 2 years following PD diagnosis and to observe longitudinal trends in PT and OT utilization early following PD diagnosis.\nThis retrospective cohort study accessed 12 years (2011 to 2023) of data from electronic health records at a midwestern US healthy system. Patients with new PD diagnoses and two-years of visit history were included. The primary outcome was utilization of PT or OT services within two-years of PD diagnosis. Data extracted included demographics and PD therapies. Records of 9720 patients were included in the analyses.\nOverall, 36.9% of the cohort (\nThis study shows a promising increase in utilization of PT and OT services over previous reports and longitudinally, however it continues to convey how far clinical practice continues to lag behind best practice and scientific recommendation.\nThis study looked at how often people with Parkinson's disease (PD) use physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) in the first two years after being diagnosed. These therapies are important because they can help maintain a person's ability to function and improve their quality of life as the disease progresses. The researchers analyzed data from 9720 patients diagnosed with PD between 2011 and 2023. They wanted to see how many of these patients received PT or OT within two years of their diagnosis and to track how the use of these therapies changed over time. The study found that only about 37% of patients received PT or OT within the first two years of their PD diagnosis. Certain groups of people were more likely to use these therapies, including older adults, women, African Americans, those with other health conditions, and those taking medication to manage PD symptoms. Over time, the use of PT and OT increased slightly each year by about 1.4% between 2013 and 2021. The findings suggest that while more people are using PT and OT after a PD diagnosis than in the past, many still aren\u2019t receiving these important therapies as recommended. This highlights a gap between what is considered best practice and what is actually happening in clinical care. More efforts may be needed to ensure that all people with PD have access to the therapies that can help them live better with the disease.",

    "abstract": "Empathy is an inaccessible part of advanced social cognitive functions in humans. Impairment of empathy greatly affects the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) but the underlying neurophysiologic mechanisms have not been established.\nThe dynamic process of brain oscillations in PD pain empathy was explored and the mechanism of empathy damage was studied.\nA total of 27 patients with PD and 13 healthy controls were recruited to undergo a pain judgment task, and the event-related potentials were recorded. This study compared the changes in theta and beta oscillations among two groups after the presentation of painful and neutral stimuli.\nTime-frequency analysis results revealed that patients with PD exhibited event-related theta oscillation synchronization and beta oscillation desynchronization during pain empathy. Compared to healthy controls, patients with PD exhibited a reduced magnitude of beta oscillation desynchronization in response to painful stimuli and attenuated synchronization of theta oscillations induced by neutral stimuli. There are abnormal beta power differences between painful and neutral stimuli, while no differences were found in theta power in PD. Moreover, a positive correlation existed between the degree of beta oscillation desynchronization associated with painful stimuli and the accuracy of pain judgments.\nPain empathy deficits in PD were associated with reduced dynamic modulation of brain theta and beta oscillations.",

Compared to healthy controls, patients with PD exhibited a reduced magnitude of beta oscillation desynchronization in response to painful stimuli and attenuated synchronization of theta oscillations induced by neutral stimuli. There are abnormal beta power differences between painful and neutral stimuli, while no differences were found in theta power in PD. Moreover, a positive correlation existed between the degree of beta oscillation desynchronization associated with painful stimuli and the accuracy of pain judgments.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence points to a critical role of the immune system in the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's disease (PD). This late knowledge has revolutionised our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying PD and has opened new avenues toward disease-modifying rather than dopamine-replacement therapeutic approaches. When pharmacological treatments fail to adequately alleviate clinical symptoms, brain stimulation techniques are taken into consideration. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) constitutes the most common method for invasive brain stimulation, while the non-invasive brain stimulation paradigms comprise among others repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). How each brain stimulation paradigm interferes with disease pathogenesis still remains elusive. In light of recent evidence supporting the involvement of the immune system in PD, a question that arises is whether brain stimulation techniques have an immunomodulatory potential. Here, we summarize the existing knowledge and provide mechanistic insights that should foster future research. Overall, it appears that DBS and rTMS can modulate both the central and the peripheral component of the immune system and can lead to clinical improvement through immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory mechanisms. The paucity of evidence for tDCS and tACS precludes any conclusions and highlights the necessity of more mechanistic studies focusing on their immunomodulatory potential, if any. Any pre-clinical findings warrant further clinical validation using human in vivo markers and post-mortem human brain tissue. Unravelling the mechanisms that underpin the beneficial therapeutic effects of brain stimulation in PD patients can contribute substantially to the fine-tuning of the current stimulation protocols and pave the way for more efficient and clinically meaningful neuromodulation paradigms.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the differences in multimodal physiological signals between patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy individuals, focusing on how symptom fluctuations affect these signals in PD. A total of 35 PD patients and 30 healthy controls participated. The PD patients were further categorized into two groups: those with symptom fluctuations (SF) and those without (NSF). Multimodal physiological signals, including EEG, ECG, respiration, and pulse, were recorded in resting state. Features were extracted from these signals and analyzed using non-parametric statistical tests. The results showed that the SF group had significantly higher absolute power in the \u03b2 bands in the frontal, parietal, and central regions, as well as increased \u03b4 band power in the parietal regions compared to the NSF group. Additionally, several time-domain characteristics of the ECG signal were significantly greater in the SF group. These findings suggest that symptom fluctuations may influence cortical activity and cardiac autonomic function in PD patients. While levodopa-based treatments can alleviate certain symptoms, they may not fully compensate for the functional alterations in brain activity. Further research is needed to explore the effects on other physiological systems.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of falls in patients with Parkinson's disease (PWP) is crucial for effective prevention efforts. Historically, fall risk models have heavily relied on motor features, overlooking the vital cognitive-motor interplay essential for locomotion.\nBaseline assessments and year-long fall data from the CYClical Lower Extremity Exercise for Parkinson's disease II (CYCLE-II) trial's control group were utilized. A LASSO logistic regression model assessed thirty-seven demographic, motor, and cognitive variables to identify key fall predictors. To explore the practical implementation of predicting falls in a clinical setting, a second model was developed using a subset of nine candidate measures conducive for retrieval from electronic medical records. Models' accuracy was validated against Paul et al.'s 3-step fall prediction model.\nAnalysis included 123 participants (mean age 65.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3 years, 66\u00a0% males, mean disease duration 4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1 years). Seventy-two participants (58.5\u00a0%) fell at least once; with 33.1\u00a0% occurring during walking, 34.4\u00a0% resulting in injuries. The initial model identified 8 predictors with an AUC of 0.68. The second model, incorporating disease duration and cognitive tests, achieved an AUC of 0.67, comparable to Paul et al.'s validation (AUC 0.66). Participants with poorer information processing and spatial memory were more prone to falling over the 12-month period.\nImpaired cognitive performance and longer disease duration were powerful predictors in identifying a future fall in PWP. The link between cognitive performance and potential for falling reinforces the strong interplay between gait and cognition.",

    "abstract": "Increased levels of glutamate, a novel regulator of neuroinflammation, is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST) is widely used in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, it has been less commonly used in clinical practice for PD. Here, to explore the clinical significance of variations in glutamate levels in the striatum and thalamus in PD, we included forty-nine PD patients and forty-four healthy controls (HCs). Glutamate levels were analyzed by performing magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) using GluCEST data. Four regions of interest (ROIs) were manually outlined on GluCEST images, and MTRasym values were calculated for each. FreeSurfer was used to calculate the volumes. We found that MTRasym values in the striatum and thalamus were elevated in PD. Variations in MTRasym values were correlated with motor scores. It has been found that the volume of the left pallidal nucleus were reduced in PD. The glutamate levels in the striatum and thalamus were significantly different from those in HCs and associated with disease progression. Collectively, glutamate metabolic abnormalities may be present in PD pathophysiology and associated with disease progression. GluCEST imaging may have potential to become an imaging technology for measuring glutamate alterations in the striatum and thalamus in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with mechanisms that results in loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) region of the brain. Being a complex heterogeneous disorder, there is a requisite in discovering the underlying molecular signatures that could potentially help in resolving challenges associated with diagnosis as well as therapeutic management. SNCA gene that encodes for the protein \u03b1-synuclein is widely known for its indispensable role in aggravating the progression of sporadic and familial PD, upon mutations. Likewise, mitochondrial dysfunction is inferred to be playing a central role in both forms of PD. Observations from experimental models and human PD cases displayed strong evidence for disruption of mitochondrial dynamics, inhibition of mitochondrial complex I protein's function and elevation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the toxic aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein. Further, recent studies have raised the possibility of an underlying relationship, where the \u03b1-synuclein toxicity is exacerbated by the mutant mitochondrial complex proteins and vice-versa. In this review, we provide an overview of mechanisms influencing \u03b1-synuclein-related neurodegeneration, particularly, emphasizing the role of SNCA (\u03b1-synuclein) gene in leading to altered mitochondrial biogenesis during PD. We have described how transgenic Drosophila models were reliable at recapitulating some of the essential characteristics of PD. In addition, we highlight the capability of utilizing transgenic fly models in deciphering the altered \u03b1-synuclein toxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction, as induced by defects in the mitochondrial DNA.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration, \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) pathology, and inflammation. Microglia in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) upregulate major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII), and variants in genes encoding MHCII affect PD risk. Additionally, elevated TNF levels and \u03b1-Syn-reactive T cells in circulation suggest a strong link between innate and adaptive immune responses in PD. We have previously reported that reduced levels of the class II transactivator, the master regulator of MHCII expression, increases susceptibility to \u03b1-Syn-induced PD-like pathology in rats and are associated with higher serum levels of soluble TNF (sTNF). Here, we demonstrate that inhibiting sTNF with a dominant-negative TNF variant, XPro1595, known to be neuroprotective in endotoxin- and toxin-induced neurodegeneration models, fails to protect against robust \u03b1-Syn-induced PD-like pathology in rats. We used a model combining rAAV-mediated \u03b1-Syn overexpression in SNpc with striatal injection of \u03b1-Syn preformed fibrils two weeks later. Systemic XPro1595 treatment was initiated one-week post-rAAV-\u03b1-Syn. We observed up to 70\u00a0% loss of striatal dopaminergic fibers without treatment, and no protective effects on dopaminergic neurodegeneration after XPro1595 administration. Pathological \u03b1-Syn levels as well as microglial and astrocytic activation were not reduced in SNpc or striatum following XPro1595 treatment. An increase in IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 levels in CSF was observed in rats treated with XPro1595, possibly explaining a lack of protective effects following treatment. Our results highlight the need to determine the importance of timing of treatment initiation, which is crucial for future applications of sTNF therapies in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "The dysfunction of the dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is believed to play a key role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) accompanied by executive dysfunction (EDF). In this study, we identified an abnormal increase in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) levels in PD patients, which closely correlates with the severity of cognitive impairment. LPC disrupts the miR-2885/TDP-43 signaling pathway in microglia, driving dopaminergic presynaptic engulfment. In LPC-exposed mice, microglial activation via miR-2885/TDP-43/p65 signaling led to inflammatory cytokine and complement release, marking dopaminergic synapses for phagocytosis with a \"PS/C1q\" signal. Following the inhibition of LPC-induced microglial activation through chemogenetic methods, we observed a significant reduction in the phagocytosis of dopaminergic synapses, resulting in improved executive function. The miR-2885 disrupted LPC-induced dopaminergic phagocytosis and alleviated EDF. Furthermore, the accumulation of excessive TDP-43 due to the loss of miR-2885 promoted the engulfment of dopaminergic synapses by facilitating the entry of p65 into the nucleus. Inhibiting TDP-43 levels effectively mitigated LPC-induced EDF. Additionally, supplementing dopamine receptor agonists enhanced the excitability of regional glutamatergic neurons, leading to improved executive function. In summary, LPC exposure in the mPFC impairs microglial regulation, leading to dopaminergic synaptic loss and underactivity of glutamatergic neurons. These changes drive the development of executive dysfunction in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Current treatment methods for PD are unable to halt disease progression. The gut microbiota contributes to the neurodevelopment of PD; however, the gut-brain connections and underlying neural bases that regulate this complex behavior are not yet clear. Enterococcus faecalis (EF) is a common commensal bacterium of the gut and a common pathogen associated with hospital-acquired infections. Here, we demonstrated the significant therapeutic effects of a non-pathogenic strain of EF (EF ATCC19433) on PD. In this study, we established a mouse model of PD by intraperitoneal injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). We found that EF treatment alleviated behavioral impairment, dopaminergic neuronal loss, blood-brain barrier damage, and neuroinflammation induced by MPTP in the mice. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that dysbiosis of PD-related microbial communities induced by MPTP was reversed by EF treatment. Moreover, EF treatment relieved gastrointestinal dysfunction in the mice. The therapeutic efficacy of EF in MPTP-induced PD mice is markedly diminished when the activity of EF is lost. Further mechanistic studies indicated that the neuroprotective effects of EF in PD were associated with the vagus nerve pathway. Following the surgical severance of the vagus nerve through subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, the protective effects of EF on PD were markedly diminished. Our study suggests that EF can alleviate neurofunctional impairments and gastrointestinal disorders associated with PD, indicating that gut-derived microbes influence brain function through the vagus nerve pathway.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder with both non-motor and motor symptoms. Variants in the glucosylceramidase beta 1 (GBA1) gene are the strongest genetic risk factor for PD, while homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in this gene classically cause Gaucher disease (GD). This study presents an early-onset PD patient with a homozygous GBA1 deletion. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed, and the identified variant was validated via Sanger sequencing. The variant was classified according to ACMG guidelines and ClinGen updates. The patient, a Brazilian female of mixed ethnicity, exhibited the full spectrum of classical motor and non-motor PD symptoms without evident hallmarks of GD. The identified homozygous GBA1 variant (NM_000157.4:c.222_224del; p.T75del; rs761621516) has a very low global allele frequency (0.00003284) and is associated with reduced enzymatic activity. This variant exhibits a founder effect among individuals of African descent. This case highlights an intricate genotype-phenotype landscape for GBA1 variants, underscoring the role of homozygous GBA1 variants in PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the main neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor activity, there are different pathophysiological pathways contributing to its development including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, Lewy's bodies accumulation, and impaired autophagy. Vinpocetine is an herbal extract with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities that may counteract pathophysiologic neurodegeneration pathways. Moreover, Lactobacillus is a probiotic that can modulate the gut-brain axis and provide the body with the needed precursors of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory mediators. In the current study PD was induced experimentally in Sprague Dawley rats with rotenone (2.5\u00a0mg/kg, i.p, daily) for 60 days, vinpocetine; Vinpo (20\u00a0mg/kg, orally, daily) and Lactobacillus; Lacto (2.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910",

    "abstract": "The high heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease (PD) hinders personalized interventions. Brain structure reflects damage and neuroplasticity and is one of the biological bases of symptomatology. Subtyping PD in the framework of brain structure helps in the prediction of disease trajectories and optimizes treatment strategies.\nThe study included a total of 283 de novo PD and 141 healthy controls (HC). Structural heterogeneity between PD and HC was compared, and patients were classified using Heterogeneity through Discriminative Analysis. Gray matter volume (GMV), clinical symptoms, and substantia nigra free water (SNFW) among all subtypes were compared. These subtypes were followed for an average of 2.5\u2009years to monitor motor impairment.\nEarly PD patients possessed higher GMV heterogeneity than HC, and two subtypes based on GMV patterns were identified. Subtype 1 showed widespread GMV reductions, while subtype 2 had an increased volume in the basal ganglia and parts of the cortex. Subtype 1 had more severe motor and non-motor symptoms, as well as higher posterior SNFW. The whole-brain GMV in the PD group was negatively correlated with posterior SNFW; basal ganglia volume in subtype 1 was negatively correlated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III scores, whereas no linear correlation was found in subtype 2. The UPDRS-III progression rate was higher in subtype 1 than in subtype 2 (2.52 vs 0.92 points/year).\nThe heterogeneity of PD patients reflected the changes in their brain structure. The identification of these changes helps the classification of patients into different subtypes, additionally supported by clinical manifestations and SNFW, with consequent benefits for clinical consultancy and precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "An abundance of observational researches had suggested that vitamin D insufficient was related to Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. However, their relationships were debatable and the causality remains uncertain. We intended to evaluate the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and Parkinson's disease (PD) risk using NHANES data (2007-2018) and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses with the genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data. Demographic characteristics and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression were conducted to assess the relationship between the serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of PD prevalence by utilizing NHANES database. Besides, a two-sample MR analysis was applied to evaluate the causal association between serum 25(OH)D levels and PD risk. The main analysis was conducted by citing the inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) approach, while additional MR approaches and multiple sensitivity analysis were cited to evaluate the robustness and pleiotropy for the discoveries. In total, 30,796 adults from NHANES 2007-2018 were selected for the present research. As a result, 1.1% participants with PD (mean age: 61.9\u2009\u00b1\u200915.5 years), while 68.5% reported vitamin D insufficient. Compared with participants without PD, those with PD had a greater level of 25(OH)D (P\u2009<\u20090.01). However, after adjusted for demographic characteristics and comorbid factors, this association was not observed. Furthermore, no potential causal relationships between the serum level of 25(OH)D and PD risk were found via MR analysis (IVW-MR: OR\u2009=\u20091.082; 95% CI, 0.902 to 1.297; P\u2009=\u20090.395). After eliminating variants with horizontal pleiotropy risk, pleiotropy-robust MR analysis presented similar results. In conclusion, this research suggested that serum 25(OH)D levels was not correlated with PD risk. Additionally, the MR analyses revealed no significant causal association between serum 25(OH)D levels and PD risk at the genetic level. Awareness of these findings may improve personalized prevention and treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder, and early diagnosis is crucial for the treatment and quality of life of patients. Gait movement disorder is a significant manifestation of PD, and automated gait assessment is key to achieving automated detection of PD patients. With the development of deep learning, in order to improve the accuracy of early Parkinson's disease detection and enhance the robustness of motion recognition models, this study introduces an innovative deep learning approach, namely Multi-area Attention Spatiotemporal Directed Graph Convolutional Network (Ma-ST-DGN). The model effectively captures temporal and spatial information from the movement data of subjects to better understand subtle movement abnormalities in patients. Simultaneously, by reconstructing human skeleton features using directed graphs and introducing a multi-area self-attention mechanism, the model can adaptively focus on key information in different areas and apply more effective fusion strategies on features from different areas, thereby increasing sensitivity to potential signs of Parkinson's disease. By more effectively integrating global and local area information, the model captures subtle manifestations of PD. We use the first Parkinson's disease gait dataset, PD-Walk, consisting of walking videos of 95 PD patients and 96 healthy individuals. Extensive experiments on this clinical video dataset demonstrate that the model achieves the best performance to date, with an accuracy of 88.7%, far superior to existing sensor and vision-based Parkinson's gait assessment methods. Therefore, the method proposed in this study may be effective for early diagnosis of PD in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "We continue to lack a clear understanding on how the biological and clinical complexity of Parkinson's disease emerges from molecular to macroscopic brain interactions. Here, we use personalized multiscale spatiotemporal computational brain models to characterize for the first time the synergistic links between genes, several multimodal neuroimaging-derived biological factors, clinical profiles, and therapeutic needs in PD. We identified genes modulating PD-caused brain reorganization in dopamine transporter level, neuronal activity integrity, microstructure, dendrite density and tissue atrophy. Inter-individual heterogeneity in the identified gene-mediated biological mechanisms was associated with five distinct configurations of PD motor and non-motor symptoms. Notably, the protein-protein interaction networks underlying both brain phenotypic and symptom configurations in PD revealed distinct hub genes including MYC, CCNA2, CCDK1, SRC, STAT3 and PSMD4. We also studied the biological mechanisms associated with physical activities performance, observing that leisure and work activities are strongly related to neurotypical cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response processes, respectively. Finally, patient-tailored in silico gene perturbations revealed a set of putative disease-modifying drugs with potential to effectively treat PD across different biological levels, most of which are associated with dopamine reuptake and anti-inflammation. Our study constitutes the first self-contained multiscale spatiotemporal computational approach providing comprehensive insights into the complex multifactorial pathogenesis of PD, unraveling key biological modulators of physical and clinical deterioration, and serving as a blueprint for optimum drug selection at personalized level.",

    "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived midbrain dopaminergic cells (mDACs) represent a promising source for autologous cell therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD), but standardized regulatory criteria are essential for clinical translation. In this pre-clinical study, we generated multiple clinical-grade hiPSC lines from freshly biopsied fibroblasts of four sporadic PD patients using episomal reprogramming and differentiated them into mDACs using a refined 21-day protocol. Rigorous evaluations included whole-genome/exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and in\u00a0vivo studies, including a 39-week Good Laboratory Practice-compliant mouse safety study. While mDACs from all lines met safety criteria, mDACs from one patient failed to improve rodent behavioral outcomes, underscoring inter-individual variability. Importantly, in\u00a0vitro assessments did not reliably predict in\u00a0vivo efficacy, identifying dopaminergic fiber density as a key efficacy criterion. These findings support comprehensive quality control guidelines for autologous cell therapy and pave the way for a clinical trial with eight sporadic PD patients, scheduled to commence in 2025.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a rapidly growing neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by intracellular \u03b1-synuclein aggregates. The tyrosine kinase c-Abl plays a critical role in PD pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify novel c-Abl inhibitors from natural products using molecular docking and dynamics simulations. We explored phytochemicals from Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry and Therapeutics (IMPPAT) database and employed molecular docking and molecular dynamics to discover c-Abl inhibitors. Three potential hits: IMPHY008934, IMPHY009589, and IMPHY006310 were identified. These compounds demonstrated comparable binding affinity to Nilotinib, a comparison drug. Toxicity predictions revealed IMPHY008934 and IMPHY009589 exhibited lower toxicity than Nilotinib. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of IMPHY009589 and IMPHY008934 with c-Abl. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis showed that IMPHY006310 and IMPHY008934 displayed enhanced reactivity and polarizability. Our findings suggest these natural compounds may target c-Abl in PD pathogenesis and possibly downregulate the overexpressed \u03b1-synuclein and may serve as promising leads for PD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Camptocormia, a postural deformity seen in Parkinson's disease (PD), complicates general anesthesia, especially airway management, owing to severe spinal flexion in advanced stages.\nWe report the anesthetic management of a 76-year-old man with PD who developed severe long-seated forward flexion with the face buried between the knees, from camptocormia and multiple spinal surgeries. Removal of the exposed spinal implants was necessary, and general anesthesia was planned. Anesthesia was administered in the right lateral position from induction to awakening. Video laryngoscopy enabled successful intubation, and remimazolam with flumazenil ensured good recovery without complications.\nThis case demonstrates the feasibility of managing the airway and administering anesthesia in the right lateral position in patients with PD with severe long-seated forward flexion. Video-laryngoscopy and remimazolam with flumazenil offer advantages in such cases, although further studies are required to validate their broader applications.",

    "abstract": "Stress granules (SGs) fulfill a pivotal role in host defense mechanisms, by sequestering both mRNA and protein via the process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). In this study, we showed that perillaldehyde (PAE), a natural occurring compound, bound directly to the core protein of SGs, Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1/2 (G3BP1/2), thereby inducing the assembly of SGs through the LLPS of G3BP/RNA complexes in vitro. Moreover, in Parkinson's disease (PD) models using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and mice, PAE administration prompted SG formation, enhanced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, shielded dopaminergic neurons from toxic insults, mitigated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregation, and improved PD-like motor disorders. In addition, these findings revealed that the interaction between G3BP1 and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibited the functions of cytoplasmic HDAC6 and reduced \u03b1-syn aggregation in cells and worms. Notably, the inhibition of SG assembly via gtbp-1 and tiar-1 RNAi effectively counteracted the beneficial effects of PAE in C. elegans. Collectively, these results imply that PAE may exert neuroprotective effects by targeting G3BP-mediated SG formation, thereby safeguarding dopaminergic neurons from toxic damage.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have assessed motor and nonmotor symptoms and the prodromal probability of Parkinson's disease (PD) among farming populations.\nThe aim was to assess self-reported nonmotor and motor symptoms and the prodromal PD probability in relation to incident PD among US farmers.\nThe study included 16,059 farmers (aged 65.6\u2009\u00b1\u200910.8\u2009years) from the Agricultural Health Study, with a median of 6.2\u2009years of follow-up. We assessed associations using multivariable logistic regression and presented odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nAt baseline, the prevalence of individual symptoms ranged from 2.0% for arm/leg tremor to 21.1% for excessive daytime sleepiness. We identified 127 incident PD patients during follow-up. Except for depression, all symptoms were significantly associated with future PD diagnosis, with OR (95% CI) ranging from 1.6 (1.1-2.2) for excessive daytime sleepiness to 3.9 (2.3-6.8) for arm/leg tremor. The prodromal PD probability, calculated based on limited available self-reported prodromal and PD risk markers, was low. Using the Movement Disorder Society's prodromal PD criteria, the median (interquartile range) at baseline was 4.4% (7.2%) for incident PD patients and 2.3% (3.4%) for participants free of PD. Further, it exhibited low sensitivity and positive predictive value in identifying incident PD patients in this farming population.\nSelf-reported prodromal PD symptoms were relatively common in US farmers. They were associated with incident PD diagnosis but had limited values in predicting disease risk. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Except for depression, all symptoms were significantly associated with future PD diagnosis, with OR (95% CI) ranging from 1.6 (1.1-2.2) for excessive daytime sleepiness to 3.9 (2.3-6.8) for arm/leg tremor. The prodromal PD probability, calculated based on limited available self-reported prodromal and PD risk markers, was low. Using the Movement Disorder Society's prodromal PD criteria, the median (interquartile range) at baseline was 4.4% (7.2%) for incident PD patients and 2.3% (3.4%) for participants free of PD. Further, it exhibited low sensitivity and positive predictive value in identifying incident PD patients in this farming population.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are severe disorders characterized by progressive neuron degeneration, leading to cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and other neurological issues, significantly impairing daily life and the quality of life. Despite advancements in understanding these mechanisms, many aspects remain unclear, and current treatments primarily manage symptoms without halting disease progression. Multiple biological pathways are implicated in neurodegeneration, including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and aberrant protein folding. Given the multifactorial nature of neurodegenerative diseases, a neuroprotective approach targeting various mechanisms holds significant promise for prevention. Natural products derived from plants, animals, and fungi, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, show substantial potential in the prevention of neurodegeneration. Unlike synthetic compounds, bioactive compounds from these natural sources offer diverse targets due to their varied structures and biological activities. This review focuses on the potential of bioactive compounds from plants with sedative and mood-modulating effects in preventing and/or slowing down neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). Given the increasing age of the general population, PD has emerged as a significant public health and societal concern, impacting both individual well-being and socioeconomic progress. The present interventions have proven insufficient in impeding the progressive nature of PD. Consequently, it is imperative to promptly identify efficacious strategies for the prevention and treatment of PD. Icaritin (ICT) is a flavonoid extracted from Epimedium Brevicornu Maxim that is a phytoestrogen with antitumour, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiaging, and neuroprotective properties. This paper reviews the protective effect of ICT on dopaminergic neurons through anti-oxidative stress, improving mitochondrial function, inhibiting neuroinflammatory responses, reducing Lewy body formation, and decreasing apoptosis. The primary objective of this article is to provide valuable insights and serve as a reference for the potential use of ICT in the prevention and treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) is a rare degenerative condition of the nervous system that primarily affects individuals of working age. Its distinct clinical and genetic features make it a critical area of study in neurological research and public health.\nThis analysis utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, covering 371 diseases and injuries across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. The study focused on individuals aged 15-49 to characterize EOPD. Data on occurrence, frequency, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were collected. Sociodemographic measures were used to analyze patterns and differences. Statistical methods, including joinpoint regression and decomposition analysis, were employed to identify temporal patterns and factors influencing variations in EOPD burden over time.\nThe global incidence of EOPD saw a significant increase between 2000 and 2009, with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 4.3%, continuing at a slower rate (AAPC 1.6%) from 2010 to 2021. By 2021, the incidence reached 2.1 cases per 100,000 population, up from 1.0 in 1990. Males had a higher incidence (AAPC 2.3%) compared to females (AAPC 0.8%). In 2021, 59.7% of the 81,047 global EOPD cases were male. Significant increases were observed in East Asia (AAPC 5.1%), Andean Latin America (AAPC 2.0%), and North Africa/Middle East (AAPC 1.1%), with a decline in High-income North America. China had the highest incidence in 2021 (5.17 cases per 100,000), followed by Peru and Bolivia. Saudi Arabia had the highest DALYs attributable to EOPD. The decomposition study indicated that the rise in global incidence and DALYs from 1990 to 2021 was mainly driven by epidemiological changes and population growth, with regional variations in impact.\nThis global analysis highlights the need for targeted interventions and research to address gender-specific risk factors, regional disparities, and the effects of epidemiological changes on the growing EOPD burden.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is the major degradation process in cells and is involved in a variety of physiological and pathological functions. While macroautophagy, which employs a series of molecular cascades to form ATG8-coated double membrane autophagosomes for degradation, remains the well-known type of canonical autophagy, microautophagy and chaperon-mediated autophagy have also been characterized. On the other hand, recent studies have focused on the functions of autophagy proteins beyond intracellular degradation, including noncanonical autophagy, also known as the conjugation of ATG8 to single membranes (CASM), and autophagy-related extracellular secretion. In particular, CASM is unique in that it does not require autophagy upstream mechanisms, while the ATG8 conjugation system is involved in a manner different from canonical autophagy. There have been many reports on the involvement of these autophagy-related mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases, with Parkinson's disease (PD) receiving particular attention because of the important roles of several causative and risk genes, including LRRK2. In this review, we will summarize and discuss the contributions of canonical and noncanonical autophagy to cellular functions, with a special focus on the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, primarily affecting movement and motor function. Described by the symptoms, including tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, PD presents clinical heterogeneity in patients, which complicates diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.\nThe study aimed to find the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a biomarker for motor subtypes in idiopathic PD.\nThis prospective observational study was conducted at Chiniot General Hospital Karachi, Pakistan, from January 2023 to January 2024. Data were collected from 55 patients suffering from idiopathic PD. Demographic and clinical data were collected for each patient, including age, sex, disease duration, and medications used for PD management.\nThere was no significant difference between the tremor-dominant (TD) and postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) subtypes in terms of age (p = 0.45), sex distribution (p = 0.62), or disease duration (p = 0.68). However, the Hoehn and Yahr scale, which measures disease severity, was significantly higher in the PIGD subtype (2.9 \u00b1 0.6) compared to the TD subtype (2.4 \u00b1 0.5) with a p-value of 0.03, indicating greater disease severity in the PIGD group. The results indicate that the NLR was significantly higher in the PIGD subtype (3.17 \u00b1 0.89) than in the TD subtype (2.41 \u00b1 0.72), with a p-value of 0.01. This suggests a stronger inflammatory response in the PIGD subtype, which could be linked to greater disease severity in these patients.\nThe NLR can be a potential biomarker for distinguishing motor subtypes in idiopathic PD.",

    "abstract": "The investigation aimed to study the outcome of rosiridin in Parkinson's disease (PD) induced by rotenone (ROT) in rodents.\nRodents were randomized into IV groups and were induced with ROT followed by treatment with rosiridin. Group I-IV received saline as a vehicle, II-ROT (0.5 mg/kg S.C) for 28 consecutive days, III and IV- rosiridin 10 and 20 mg/kg orally with ROT. On completion of the experimental duration, behavioral investigations were carried out. Biochemical variables such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), oxidative stress and antioxidants markers (Malondialdehyde-MDA, glutathione-GSH, superoxide dismutase-SOD, and catalase-CAT), anti-inflammatory (Interleukin-1 beta-IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha-TNF-\u03b1), alteration in neurotransmitters (Serotonin-5-HT), norepinephrine, and dopamine-DA, along with metabolites such as 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid-5- HIAA),), mitochondrial complex I, II, IV, and caspase-3 activity were evaluated at the end of the experiment. Furthermore, molecular docking and dynamics were performed for target ligands.\nRosiridin significantly restored the level of AChE, oxidative stress and antioxidants markers (MDA, GSH, SOD, and CAT), anti-inflammatory (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1), alteration in neurotransmitters, mitochondrial complex I, II, IV, and caspase-3 activity. Rosiridin has a favorable negative binding affinity to AChE (-8.99 kcal/mol). The results of the molecular dynamics simulations indicate that proteins undergo a substantial change in conformational dynamics when binding to rosiridin.\nIn this study, rosiridin may exhibit neuroprotective properties against the Parkinson's model for treating PD.",

    "abstract": "Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to predict the behaviour of others by inferring their cognitive and affective states. The literature suggests that different neural substrates within the basal ganglia are involved in the affective (ventral striatum) and cognitive (dorsal striatum) components of ToM. We investigated ToM dysfunction in two different basal ganglia pathologies, Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), in their early stages. Indeed, a different progression of neurodegeneration from the dorsal striatum to the ventral striatum is described in the two diseases. We also investigated whether there is a correlation between ToM and executive function. Twenty-one patients with HD, 21 with PD, and 22 healthy subjects (HS) were recruited. All participants completed a ToM assessment using the Yoni task, which assesses both cognitive and affective components at two levels of meta-representational difficulty (i.e. first-order items only require inferring the mental state of a person, while second-order items also require inferring the mental states of a person about others). The clinical groups also underwent a full neuropsychological assessment. In HD patients, both cognitive and affective ToM were equally impaired, whereas in PD patients, impairment of the cognitive component predominated. Specifically, compared to HS, HD patients scored lower on both inferential levels and on both cognitive and affective components, whereas PD patients scored lower than HS only on second-order and cognitive items. In the clinical groups, there was an imbalance between the cognitive and affective components, with higher accuracy on affective items. Performance on the Yoni task did not correlate with tests assessing executive functions. We suggest that the different pattern of ToM alteration in HD and PD may be a result of differential involvement of the ventral and dorsal striatum and that ToM abilities in these clinical populations are not directly supported by executive functioning.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the factors capable of modulation of conformational stability and aggregation propensity of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn), a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), is crucial for developing future therapeutic interventions for this disease. This chapter aims at exploring the roles of osmolytes in affecting the structural dynamics of \u03b1-Syn as well as focuses on how these osmolytes impact folding, stability, and aggregation behavior of this important intrinsically disordered protein. A number of potent osmolytes, including trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), trehalose, myo-inositol, taurine, glycine, glutamate, and glycerol were discussed along with their overall effect on \u03b1-Syn. These osmolytes can stabilize native conformations or promote alternative folding pathways, thereby influencing \u03b1-Syn aggregation. The chapter highlights the dual role of osmolytes in either preventing or exacerbating aggregation, depending on their concentration and interaction mechanism with \u03b1-Syn. Moreover, by integrating current research results, the chapter provides insights into how osmolytes might be utilized for therapeutic interventions with potential avenues for managing PD. Overall, the chapter underscores the significance of osmolyte-induced modulation of \u03b1-Syn aggregation in the context of PD and highlights future research areas in this direction.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly, characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of Lewy bodies. Hufeng Jiu from Vespa magnifica Smith, a traditional remedy used by the Chinese Jingpo minority, is documented in the Pharmacopoeia of China (2020) for treating rheumatic arthritis. Notably, recent research suggests that components of wasp venom (WV) from Vespa magnifica Smith, particularly polypeptides such as Mastoparan-M (Mast-M) and Vespakinin-M, may have potential therapeutic effects for neurological disorders. However, the specific polypeptide components of WV and their therapeutic effects on PD models remain insufficiently understood.\nThis study aims to characterize the neuroactive polypeptides in Vespa magnifica Smith venom and investigate the therapeutic potential of Mast-M for PD.\nNeuroactive polypeptides in WV were identified using LC/MS, and Mast-M derived from venom of Vespa magnifica Smith was verified with HPLC. The neuroprotective effects of WV and its peptides were assessed using the CCK-8 assay in 1-methyl-4- phenylpyridinium (MPP\nA total of 1007 peptides were identified in the WV, including 187 UniProtKB unreviewed, with 185 predicted to be BBB-permeability. Our results show that Mast-M exhibits a time-dependent distribution in mice, initially localizing in the peritoneal region and subsequently accumulating in the brain, liver, and kidney. Cellular uptake studies reveal that Mast-M penetrates cell membranes and accumulates intracellularly over time. In the MPP\nMast-M emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for PD, capable of crossing the BBB, enhancing autophagy, and providing neuroprotection in PD models. Further studies are warranted to optimize dosing and elucidate its full therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Up to 75% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) experience voice and speech impairments, such as breathy phonation and low speech volume, which worsen over time and negatively impact the quality of life. However, given their increasingly limited mobility, face-to-face speech therapy is often inaccessible. Mobile health (mHealth) apps offer accessible and cost-effective alternatives; yet, their application in PD-specific, self-delivered voice therapy remains underexplored.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, adherence, and satisfaction of a self-delivered smartphone app for voice therapy in patients with PD, designed to minimize speech-language pathologist involvement while promoting patient independence. In addition, it seeks to assess the preliminary therapeutic effectiveness of the app in addressing voice and speech problems in this population.\nA single-arm, rater-blinded, and pretest and posttest study was conducted between September to November 2023. Patients with PD with voice and speech problems who have no problem with using Android (Google) smartphones were recruited. Participants downloaded the researcher-developed mHealth app on their smartphone and participated in a patient-tailored 5-week home-based speech training program. Each session included 5 stages: breathing, oral motor exercises, loudness, prosody, and functional speaking. The training program consisted of 20 sessions, with participants completing 1 session per day, 4 days per week. Each session lasted approximately 20-30 minutes. Adherence was monitored through app logs, satisfaction was assessed through a phone survey, and therapeutic effectiveness was evaluated using acoustic analysis and auditory-perceptual assessments.\nOut of 30 patients were initially recruited, but 2 of them withdrew. Out of 25 participants completed all the training sessions while 3 dropped out. The adherence was above 90% in 20 participants (80%, 20/25), 70% to 90% in 4 (16%, 4/25), and below 70% in 4 (16%, 4/25). Satisfaction was 75% (18/24) among the 24 people who participated in the survey. Significant improvements were observed in all acoustic measures: the maximum phonation time increased from 11.15 (SD 5.38) seconds to 14.01 (SD 5.64) seconds (P=.003), and vocal intensity increased from 71.59 (SD 4.39) dB to 73.81 (SD 3.48) dB (P<.001) across both sustained phonation and reading tasks. Voice quality scores on the GRBAS (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain) scale improved significantly (all components P<.001). Furthermore, 58.3% (14/24) of participants reported subjective improvements in their voice.\nThis study demonstrates that home-based, self-training speech therapy delivered through a mHealth app is a feasible solution for patients with PD, suggesting that mHealth apps can serve as a convenient and effective alternative to face-to-face therapy by enhancing accessibility and empowering patients to actively manage their condition.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that reducing drug-related problems (DRPs) may improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTo investigate the impact of pharmacist participation in Parkinson's disease clinic on the number of DRPs, clinical outcomes, and the quality of life of PD patients.\nThis single-blinded randomised controlled trial was conducted at the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Clinic. Patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200918\u00a0years, diagnosed with idiopathic PD for at least 3\u00a0years, and receiving antiparkinsonian drugs were randomly assigned (1:1) to the pharmacist-physician (PP) or usual care (UC) groups. The primary outcome was changes in the number of DRPs from baseline to 24\u00a0weeks between groups. Secondary outcomes included the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) score, eight-item version of the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) score, and Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) score at week 24.\nA total of 80 patients were randomised, with 40 in each group. The mean number of DRPs reduced in both groups; however, the reduction was greater in the PP group compared to the UC group (-\u20097.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6 vs. -\u20093.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8, p\u2009<\u20090.001), especially non-adherence issues. The MDS-UPDRS and PDQ-8 scores showed significantly greater improvement in the PP group. A higher proportion of patients in the PP group achieved improvement in PGIC scales compared to those in the UC group.\nOur findings demonstrated that pharmacist-physician collaboration service in the PD clinic positively impacted patient outcomes.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT05410210 (date 13 May 2022).",

    "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms in Parkinson's disease are common and are comprised of hallucinations and delusions. Psychosis is a major cause of disability in PD and is primarily due to an interaction with PD medication. The decision to treat psychosis is determined by the severity of the symptoms, impact on quality of life and tolerance for the treatment. Initial management involves a reduction in non-PD psychoactive medications and/or modification of PD medications. Pharmacotherapy is primarily limited to atypical antipsychotics and pimavanserin.\nThis review will focus on the phenomenology of Parkinson's disease psychosis and its management.\nPimavanserin is the only Food and Drug Administration medication approved for the treatment of PDP. Among the antipsychotics, only clozapine and pimavanserin demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of PDP. Despite lack of evidence for efficacy in PDP, quetiapine is commonly used because it does not worsen motor function and lacks the blood monitoring requirement of clozapine. Pimavanserin is the first-line treatment for mild psychotic symptoms that do not require a rapid response and quetiapine and clozapine for psychosis that requires improvement in a short period of time. Antipsychotics used to treat PDP should demonstrate safety, motor tolerability and efficacy over time.",

    "abstract": "This randomized controlled trial assessed the effects of positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on cognition in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nIndividuals with PD with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) < 27 and OSA were randomized to PAP or nasal dilator strips (placebo) for 6 months. The primary outcome was the change in MoCA from baseline to 6 months compared by t-test between groups by intention to treat (ITT). Sensitivity and per protocol (PP) analyses were performed, adjusting for potential confounders. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported and motor outcomes. Exploratory outcomes comprised detailed neurocognitive tests.\nWe randomized 94 participants (31% female) with mean age 67.3 (SD 10.5) years, body mass index 28.1 (4\u00b77) kg/m2 and MoCA 22.7 (3.5). The change in MoCA in the PAP group (n=48) was 0.60, 95%CI [-0.08, 1.29] and in the control group (n=46) -0.39, 95%CI [-1.21, 0.43]; between-group difference 1.00, 95%CI [-0.06, 2.05] (ITT). Adjusted ITT analyses showed improved MoCA by 1.44, 95%CI [0.09, 2.79], in treated vs. control groups. In PP analyses, the adjusted between-group difference was 1.43, 95%CI [0.054, 2.81] between PAP (n=33) vs. control (n=41) groups. Non-motor symptoms, depression and sleep quality scores, and performance on certain executive and psychomotor tasks improved with PAP. PP analyses also showed significant improvement in motor function in PAP compared to control groups.\nEvaluation for OSA in PD patients with reduced cognition should be considered as OSA treatment may improve cognitive function, and possibly patient-reported and motor outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This article provides a detailed look at Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative ailment mostly known for movement difficulties such tremor, stiffness, and bradykinesia, which affects approximately 1% of persons over the age of 60. Although the precise cause of PD is still unknown, various factors such as pesticide exposure, genetics, and lifestyle choices like smoking and caffeine consumption are thought to play a role in its development. The presence of Lewy bodies characterizes the disease, the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and disruptions in basal ganglia circuitry, resulting in both motor and nonmotor symptoms. This review is structured into several key sections, beginning with an exploration of the pathophysiological mechanisms behind PD, including how genetic mutations can lead to deficits in the Ubiquitin Proteasome System and mitochondrial function, which are linked to familial cases of the disease. Following this, the article explores diagnostic methods, such as the UK Brain Bank Criteria, advanced imaging techniques, olfactory testing, and innovative technologies like machine learning, all of which support early detection and accurate diagnosis of PD. Treatment strategies are also comprehensively reviewed, focusing on traditional pharmacological options like levodopa and dopamine agonists, as well as surgical interventions such as deep brain stimulation. Additionally, the review discusses promising new therapies, including immunotherapy aimed at neuroinflammation and gene therapy for disease modification. The impact of lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet on reducing PD risk and enhancing symptom management are also considered. In conclusion, this review highlights the complex nature of Parkinson's disease and underscores the need for a holistic approach that combines pharmacotherapy, advanced treatments, and lifestyle adjustments. By addressing both symptom management and disease modification, these strategies provide hope for improving quality of life.",

    "abstract": "The substantia nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC) are among the first brain regions to degenerate in Parkinson's disease (PD). This has important implications for early cognitive deficits because these nuclei are sources of ascending neuromodulators (i.e., dopamine and noradrenaline) that support various cognitive functions such as learning, memory, and executive function.\nOur aim was to investigate the selective and independent contributions of SN and LC degeneration to cognitive deficits in PD.\nWe ran a cross-sectional study testing patients with PD and older adults on tasks of positive reinforcement learning, attention/working memory, executive function, and memory to measure cognitive performance in domains thought to be related to dopaminergic and noradrenergic function. Participants also underwent neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging as a measure of degeneration.\nReduced SN neuromelanin signal in PD was independently associated with impaired positive reinforcement learning (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08, 0.74) controlling for changes in the LC. In contrast, reduced LC neuromelanin signal was independently associated with impairments in attention/working memory (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.20, 95% CI [-0.47, -0.10]) and executive function (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.22, 95% CI: -0.57, -0.24), controlling for changes in the SN.\nThese results suggest that SN and LC degeneration may contribute to different cognitive deficits, potentially explaining the heterogeneity that exists in the cognitive manifestations of PD. These results also highlight the potential value of leveraging brain-behavior relationships to develop performance-based measures of cognition that could be used to characterize the phenotypic differences associated with underlying patterns of neurodegeneration. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and vascular parkinsonism (VP) are characterized by similar neurological syndromes but differ in pathogenesis, morphology, and therapeutic approaches. The molecular genetic mechanisms of these pathologies are multifactorial and involve multiple biological processes. To comprehensively analyze the pathophysiology of PD and VP, the methods of systems biology and gene network reconstruction are essential. In the current study, we performed metabolomic screening of amino acids and acylcarnitines in blood plasma of three groups of subjects: PD patients, VP patients and the control group. Comparative statistical analysis of the metabolic profiles identified significantly altered metabolites in the PD and the VP group. To identify potential mechanisms of amino acid and acylcarnitine metabolism disorders in PD and VP, regulatory gene networks were reconstructed using ANDSystem, a cognitive system. Regulatory pathways to the enzymes converting significant metabolites were found from PD-specific genetic markers, VP-specific genetic markers, and the group of genetic markers common to the two diseases. Comparative analysis of molecular genetic pathways in gene networks allowed us to identify both specific and non-specific molecular mechanisms associated with changes in the metabolomic profile in PD and VP. Regulatory pathways with potentially impaired function in these pathologies were discovered. The regulatory pathways to the enzymes ALDH2, BCAT1, AL1B1, and UD11 were found to be specific for PD, while the pathways regulating OCTC, FURIN, and S22A6 were specific for VP. The pathways regulating BCAT2, ODPB and P4HA1 were associated with genetic markers common to both diseases. The results obtained deepen the understanding of pathological processes in PD and VP and can be used for application of diagnostic systems based on the evaluation of the amino acids and acylcarnitines profile in blood plasma of patients with PD and VP.\n\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f) \u0438

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (pwPD) and atypical parkinsonism usually complain of impaired balance. Instrumental posturography is widely used to quantitatively assess static balance in pwPD but many posturographic parameters and protocols have been suggested. We aimed to appraise the use of static posturography in pwPD and atypical parkinsonism, and identify gaps hindering its translation into clinical routine.\nA systematic review on four databases. Study methodology, clinical aspects, assessment protocol, technical aspects, and transferability to clinical practice were critically appraised by a set of quality questions, scored on three levels (0, 0.5, 1). Total scores were used to assess overall studies' quality.\n132 studies were included. The majority (105/132) was rated medium-quality. The domains \"transferability to clinical practice\" and \"assessment protocol\" received the lowest scores. The main flaw hindering portability to clinical settings was the lack of a stated rationale behind the choice of a specific protocol and the selection of the posturographic parameters. Missing reporting about the technical aspects employed to manage posturographic data and comprehensive instructions given to the patients further contributed to lower quality.\nWe provided recommendations for enhancing the clinical transferability of studies on static posturography to assess pwPD, including (1) discussing the rationale for choosing the assessment protocols and posturographic parameters, (2) detailing the inclusion criteria and select appropriate samples, and (3) reporting all the technical information to replicate the procedures and computations.\nInternational Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on 6th February 2024 (ID CRD42024500777), https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024500777.",

    "results": "132 studies were included. The majority (105/132) was rated medium-quality. The domains \"transferability to clinical practice\" and \"assessment protocol\" received the lowest scores. The main flaw hindering portability to clinical settings was the lack of a stated rationale behind the choice of a specific protocol and the selection of the posturographic parameters. Missing reporting about the technical aspects employed to manage posturographic data and comprehensive instructions given to the patients further contributed to lower quality.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate compliance and accuracy in comparison with traditional PD diaries for tracking motor symptoms using a new smartphone application (MyParkinson's) and paper diary strategies. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with progressive motor symptoms. Treatment becomes more challenging as PD progresses, motor complications in the form of wearing-off phenomenon and levodopa-induced dyskinesia develop. Traditional paper diaries and clinical scales used to evaluate patients may be inadequate in assessing whether the patient is \"on\" or \"off,\" resulting in less-than-ideal treatment changes.\nA randomized crossover design was utilized to examine 22 advanced PD patients who underwent symptomatic assessment with both diaries during two separate 24-h periods seven days apart. The compliance and accuracy of data were assessed by comparing diary entries with the clinical examination notes and WhatsApp queries. LaOerly, patients' diary preferences were also evaluated.\nThe digital diary had significantly beOer compliance and accuracy than the paper diaries, with substantial/almost perfect levels of agreement (\nDigital diaries are helpful in the clinical management of PD patients as they minimize recall bias and reduce data errors in appropriately selected patients. Our study suggests a broader adoption of digital health technologies in PD management. Still, additional research is necessary to improve the tools and assess long-term patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "With a progressively aging global population, the prevalence of Parkinson's Disease and dementia will increase, thus multiplying the healthcare burden worldwide. Sensing technology can complement the current measures used for symptom management and monitoring. The aim of this umbrella review is to provide future researchers with a synthesis of the current methodologies and metrics of sensing technologies for the management and monitoring of activities and behavioral symptoms in older adults with neurodegenerative disease. This is of key importance when considering the rapid obsolescence of and potential for future implementation of these technologies into real-world healthcare settings.\nSeven medical and technical databases were searched for systematic reviews (2018-2024) that met our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Articles were screened independently using Rayyan. PRISMA guidelines, the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews, and the Johanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews were utilized for the assessment of bias, quality, and research synthesis. A narrative synthesis combines the study findings.\nAfter screening 1458 articles, 9 systematic reviews were eligible for inclusion, synthesizing 402 primary studies. This umbrella review reveals that the use of sensing technologies for the observation and management of activities and behavioral symptoms is promising, however diversely applied, heterogenous in the methods used, and currently challenging to apply within clinical settings.\nHuman activity and behavioral recognition requires true interdisciplinary collaborations between engineering, data science, and healthcare domains. The standardization of metrics, ethical AI development, and a culture of research-friendly technology and support are the next crucial developments needed for this rising field.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) neuropathology is marked by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, accompanied by the widespread involvement of central and peripheral structures. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin crucial for the survival of dopaminergic neurons, plays a pivotal role in neuronal and glial development, neuroprotection, and the modulation of synaptic plasticity. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive technique, enhances neurotransmitter release, trans-synaptic efficacy, signaling pathways, gene transcription, neuroplasticity, and neurotrophism. Evidence supports that high-frequency rTMS increases BDNF expression and improves task-specific cognitive deficits in PD patients. This article outlines a detailed protocol to investigate whether rTMS targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally induces changes in plasma BDNF levels, the plasma-derived exosomal BDNF concentration, and executive functions in individuals with PD. Identifying non-invasive interventions that effectively modulate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognitive and behavioral functions is critical for addressing cognitive impairments and mitigating disease progression in the PD population. This study aims to advance translational research by identifying biomarkers and developing therapeutic strategies for future applications in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Intensive aerobic exercise slows the progression of movement disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) and is therefore recommended as an important component of treatment for PD patients. Studies in animal models of PD have shown that vigorous exercise has neuroprotective effects, and emerging evidence suggests that it may be a disease-modifying treatment in humans. However, many people with PD may not be able to participate in vigorous exercise because of multiple medical conditions that severely limit their physical activity. In this study, we have shown that chronic MPTP treatment in sedentary mice resulted in loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, decreased levels of neurotrophins, BDNF and GDNF, and increased levels of inflammatory markers and pro-inflammatory changes in immunocompetent cells. Moderate exercise, initiated both before and after chronic MPTP treatment, significantly attenuated the loss of dopaminergic neurons and increased BDNF and GDNF levels even above those in sedentary control mice. No signs of inflammation were observed in MPTP-treated mice, either when training began before or after MPTP treatment. Training induced beneficial changes in the dopaminergic system, increased levels of neurotrophins and suppression of inflammation were similar for both steady moderate (present data) and intense training (our previously published data). This suggests that there is a kind of saturation when the percentage of rescued dopaminergic neurons reaches the highest possible value, and therefore further increases in exercise intensity do not enhance neuroprotection. In conclusion, our present results compared with the previous data show that increasing exercise intensity beyond the level used in this study does not increase the neuroprotective effect of aerobic training in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the \nA literature review of studies addressing the role of NO in PD was conducted using major scientific databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, using keywords such as \"nitric oxide\", \"NOSs\", \"Parkinson's disease\", and \"nitrate neuroprotection in PD\". Studies on nitrate metabolism via the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway and its effects on PD hallmarks were analyzed. Studies regarding the role of nitrosamine formation in PD, which are mainly formed during the nitrification process of amines (nitrogen-containing compounds), often due to chemical reactions in the presence of nitrite or nitrate, were also examined. In particular, nitrate has been shown to induce oxidative stress, affect the mitochondrial function, and contribute to inflammatory phenomena in the brain, another factor closely related to the pathogenesis of PD.\nExcessive NO production, particularly from iNOS and nNOS, was strongly associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress, amplifying neuronal damage in PD. Dietary nitrate was shown to enhance NO bioavailability through the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway, mitigating inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative damage.\nDysregulated NO production contributes significantly to PD progression via inflammatory and oxidative/nitrosative pathways. Dietary nitrate, by modulating NO levels, offers a promising therapeutic strategy to counteract these pathological mechanisms. Further clinical trials are warranted to establish its efficacy and optimize its use in PD management.",

    "abstract": "Pain is one of non-motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) that significantly impacts on patients' quality of life and increases the risk of developing psychiatric disorders. The mechanisms underlying pain in PD are poorly understood and the classic pharmacological treatments supplying to dopamine depletion have limited therapeutic effects on this symptom. It has been demonstrated that short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) play a key role in several central nervous system diseases including PD; low serum and faecal levels of SCFAs have been described in PD patients. Among SCFAs, the gut microbial metabolite butyrate has a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effect, influencing neurological and behavioural processes. Using a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced-PD mouse model, we evaluated the effects of sodium butyrate (BuNa) treatment on pain and mood-related behaviour, exporing the role of PPARs, opioid and endocannabinoid systems. Our results demonstrated that repeated BuNa treatment (100\u202fmg/kg po) in PD-mice reduced pain hypersensitivity as well as depressive- and anxiety-lke behaviour both on day 7 and day 14 after 6-OHDA injection. Moreover, AM281(CB1R antagonist), GW6471 (PPAR-alpha antagonist), and naloxone (opioid receptor antagonist), reduced BuNa efficacy. Finally, BuNa treatment was associated with a significant reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines at spinal and supraspinal levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that increasing endogenous butyrate concentration reduces PD comorbidities such as pain and psychiatric symptoms, restoring opioidergic and endocannabinergic pathways.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide estimates reveal two-fold increase in incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) over 25 years. The two-fold increased incidence and lack of proper treatment uplifted a compelling solicitude, nagging towards accurate diagnosis. The present study aims at systematic survey on recent methodologies to light up the panorama of PD through various imaging modalities.\nCentring on imaging modalities of PD detection, this study range over on PD biomarkers such as anatomical and neurotransmitter alterations, serum and genetic delving into features and diagnostic techniques. Reviewed various Machine learning and deep learning models employed for PD detection and their performance offered. Presented a deep focus on existing datasets for PD diagnosis and their limited applicability and the directions needed to extend their applicability. This study also highlights the need of discriminative feature set for proper PD diagnosis and highlights the deep insight into existing machine and deep learning models along with their potential limitations and future directions.\nThe review highlights that most of the algorithms incorporate some form of machine learning or deep learning to facilitate automated diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Also highlighted that most methodologies are experimented on T1 weighted MRI data and highlighted they are easily available and less complex in nature.\nIn conclusion deep learning models yields promising results on accurate diagnosis of PD and highlights the need of refining the existing methods to handle the challenges in enhancing diagnostic accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Mostly known for its implication in synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), \u03b1-synuclein is predominantly expressed in the nervous system. Most of the peripheral \u03b1-synuclein is found in erythrocytes, and several studies have examined a possible association between erythrocytic \u03b1-synuclein and PD.\nWe have used a recently developed ELISA that selectively detects fibrillar and oligomeric \u03b1-synuclein to measure aggregated \u03b1-synuclein in red blood cells (RBCs) collected from PD patients and age/sex-matched control individuals (n\u00a0=\u00a035). The PD group included patients without any common mutation (genetically undetermined group, GU-PD, n\u00a0=\u00a056) as well as mutation carriers in the \u03b1-synuclein gene (A53T-PD, n\u00a0=\u00a028) and glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA-PD, n\u00a0=\u00a024).\nWe found that the concentration of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein in erythrocytes was significantly increased in GU-PD patients compared to controls. A53T-PD and GBA-PD patients exhibited similar levels of erythrocytic aggregated \u03b1-synuclein as the control group. The levels of fibrillar/oligomeric \u03b1-synuclein in RBCs were reduced in respect to the age of control individuals suggesting that the observed increase in the GU-PD cohort was not due to normal aging. Parallel assessment of monomeric \u03b1-synuclein revealed that aggregated, but not total, \u03b1-synuclein could discriminate PD patients from control individuals.\nThe elevation of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein in GU-PD erythrocytes, which is not related to aging, suggests that these forms may be indicative of PD pathology and possibly accumulate upon disease establishment. As such, aggregated \u03b1-synuclein in RBCs could be a potential biomarker for PD diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting quality of life. The onset of PD is thought to result from a multifaceted convergence of aging, genetic predisposition, and environmental exposure. The hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP) score, a specific measure of inflammation and nutrition, has been identified in the literature. No study has determined whether there are differences in inflammation and nutrition between sporadic and familial forms of PD.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted involving 1036 participants from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), including sporadic PD (sPD) and familial PD (fPD). Data on demographics (age, sex, race, years of education, BMI, age of onset), clinical characteristics (Hoehn and Yahr Scale, Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale(MDS-UPDRS) Part III Score, MDS-UPDRS Total Score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Epworth Sleepiness Scale Score, Geriatric Depression Scale Score, Rapid Eye Movement(REM) Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire Score, caudate nucleus uptake value on dopamine transporter scan, putamen uptake value on dopamine transporter scan, striatum uptake value on dopamine transporter scan), and laboratory parameters (hemoglobin, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, platelets, blood glucose, uric acid, total protein, urea nitrogen, and albumin) were collected from all participants. Logistic regression and smooth curve fitting analyses were used to support the research objective.\nA total of 1036 patients aged between 29.26 and 85.88 years were included in the analysis. A high HALP level was associated with an increased risk of fPD (per 10 units: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.18, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.07-1.29, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), after adjustment for potential confounders. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, the risk of fPD occurring in Q3 was 1.8 times that in the Q1 group (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.8, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.16-2.78, P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). In addition, the results of the subgroup and sensitivity analysis were robust.\nThis study highlights that HALP levels are associated with an increased risk of fPD, independent of confounders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation of abnormal \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) within dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain. Despite excessive accumulation of \u03b1-syn being key to the pathogenesis of PD, the mechanisms governing its clearance remain elusive. In this study, we found that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system plays a crucial role in capturing and facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated \u03b1-syn. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin was found to promote K27-linked polyubiquitination of \u03b1-syn, directing it to the endosome for subsequent degradation. We showed that the deletion of the Listerin gene exacerbates the neurodegenerative progression in a mouse model of PD, whereas the overexpression of Listerin effectively mitigates disease progression in PD mice. Consequently, our study reveals a mechanism for \u03b1-syn degradation and identifies Listerin as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorder is one of the most common and disabling neuropsychiatric syndromes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), seriously affecting the quality of life and prognosis of PD patients.\nThe objective of this study was to analyze the risk factors for anxiety in PD patients and to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating PD with anxiety disorder (PDAD).\nBaseline data were recorded for 211 PD patients and 139 PDAD patients, and multi-factorial and independent risk factors for anxiety disorder in PD patients were analyzed. \u200bThe 139 PDAD patients were divided into clinical testing (CMO) and CBT groups. Assessments were taken at baseline and after the end of the intervention. A 5-month follow-up survey was conducted after the intervention. The mouse PD model was induced by MPTP, and the anxiety state of mice was detected by rotarod test and open-field test. The expression of BDNF/PI3K/Akt protein in serum and mouse brain was detected by western blot.\nPDAD patients had significantly higher HAMA scores than PD patients. PSQI, ESS, HAMD, SCOPA-AUT, UPDRS-III and Hoehn-Yahr were independent risk factors for anxiety disorder in PD patients. After the intervention, the psychological state, cognitive function and quality of life improved in both the CMO and CBT groups, with the CBT group showing better improvement Results from follow-up showed that the number and frequency of falls was lower in the CBT group than in the CMO group, and that patients were more satisfied with the CBT intervention than the CMO group. L-dopa treatment alleviated anxiety in PD mice. L-dopa treatment increased BDNF, p-PI3K, and p-Akt protein levels. Moreover, the combination of L-dopa and CBT enhanced the boosting effect of L-dopa on these proteins.\nCBT is an effective treatment for anxiety in patients with Parkinson's disease. Medications combined with CBT have been shown to be effective in improving depression, anxiety and quality of life in PDAD patients.",

    "results": "PDAD patients had significantly higher HAMA scores than PD patients. PSQI, ESS, HAMD, SCOPA-AUT, UPDRS-III and Hoehn-Yahr were independent risk factors for anxiety disorder in PD patients. After the intervention, the psychological state, cognitive function and quality of life improved in both the CMO and CBT groups, with the CBT group showing better improvement Results from follow-up showed that the number and frequency of falls was lower in the CBT group than in the CMO group, and that patients were more satisfied with the CBT intervention than the CMO group. L-dopa treatment alleviated anxiety in PD mice. L-dopa treatment increased BDNF, p-PI3K, and p-Akt protein levels. Moreover, the combination of L-dopa and CBT enhanced the boosting effect of L-dopa on these proteins.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms affect over 90% of people with Parkinson's disease at all stages, with pain and fatigue being among the most prevalent yet often neglected in clinical practice. Despite their significant impact, these symptoms are frequently underdiagnosed and inadequately treated, adding substantial burden to patients' lives. The lack of a clear definition and classification of these symptoms has led neurologists to underestimate their presence among people with Parkinson's disease and limited the ability to address them with mechanism-based care and effective treatments. Managing these symptoms is challenging because of the lack of robust, specifically designed, randomized-controlled trials on effective treatments. This review delves into the current understanding of diagnosing, assessing, and treating pain and fatigue in Parkinson's disease, highlighting critical knowledge gaps and suggesting future research directions. The framework emphasizes improving classification methods, deepening our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, evaluating treatment impacts on pain and fatigue, and leveraging longitudinal data collection through consensus-based methodology. By addressing these critical areas, we strive to enhance the management of these debilitating non-motor symptoms and ultimately improve patients' quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant astrocytic involvement in Parkinson's disease (PD), the knowledge regarding the role of reactive astrogliosis is still at the surface level; largely due to lack of specific biomarkers to track these processes. Novel astroglial PET-tracers BU99008 and Deprenyl, hold immense potential for visualizing reactive astrogliosis in PD.\u00a0 However, they have not been thoroughly investigated in PD.\nWe employed a multi-marker approach and performed in vitro radioligand binding and autoradiography studies with \nAstroglial tracers BU99008 and Deprenyl displayed a range of binding sites with different levels of affinity and proportions (%) in healthy control (CN) and Parkinson's disease (PD) brains. Astroglial tracers BU99008 and Deprenyl showed a highly specific (permanent) high-affinity (HA) binding site in the nanomolar range, which might be consistent across different pathologies. Astroglial tracers BU99008 and Deprenyl highlighted distinct tracer binding behavior, indicating that they might be targeting different subpopulations or specific states of astrocytes in CN and PD brains. Astroglial tracers BU99008 and Deprenyl captured prominent reactive astrogliosis at the advanced/end stages of PD, substantiated by a significant increase in intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)-positive reactive astrocytes and marked changes in astrocytic morphology and processes.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prevalent neurological disorder associated with significant public health burdens and long-term risks, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Emerging evidence suggests a strong link between moderate to severe TBI and an elevated risk of PD, though the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.\nCommon differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in GEO datasets of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Further analyses, including GO and KEGG pathway enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, hub gene identification, as well as miRNA and transcription factor prediction and drug candidate screening, were conducted. Subsequently, the expression of hub genes was validated using additional TBI- and PD-related GEO datasets and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). Finally, the expression of hub genes was further validated in a mouse model of TBI induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI).\nShared transcriptional signatures between TBI and PD were uncovered, highlighting overlapping molecular networks and pathways. The glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) gene emerged as a pivotal hub gene, with its expression significantly altered in both TBI and PD datasets.\nThis study underscores the critical role of GPX3 in the molecular intersection of TBI and PD, suggesting it as a novel and potential therapeutic target, offering new insights into potential therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to impaired dopamine (DA) signaling and motor control. Intermittent dosing of current DA precursors results in side effects, prompting research into controlled drug release mechanisms for sustained and targeted delivery of DA.\nIn this work, we stabilized DA within a nanostructured silicate matrix (nanoreservoir) using the sol-gel method. We examined the physicochemical properties, kinetics of drug release, and biocompatibility in dopaminergic neurons and fibroblasts.\nThe optimized synthesis method allowed for the stabilization of DA by preventing its oxidation. The physicochemical and controlled release analysis showed a direct relationship between the mesoporous structure, interaction of the DA with the matrix, and the release kinetics followed, proving the possibility to modify the rate of release by adjusting the synthesis parameters. Furthermore, the nanoreservoirs were biocompatible with dopaminergic neurons and fibroblasts \nThe research sets the stage for potential ",

    "abstract": "Recently, the role of T cells in the pathology of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S)-mediated neurodegenerative disorders called synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy, has attracted increasing attention. Although the existence of \u03b1S-specific T cells and the immunogenicity of the post-translationally modified \u03b1S fragment have been reported in PD and DLB, the key cellular subset associated with disease progression and its induction mechanism remain largely unknown.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from synucleinopathy patients and healthy controls were cultured in the presence of the \u03b1S peptide pools. Cytokine analysis using culture supernatants revealed that C-terminal \u03b1S peptides with a phosphorylated serine 129 residue (pS129), a feature of pathological \u03b1S aggregates, promoted the production of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-13 in PD patients compared with that in controls. In pS129 peptide-reactive PD cases, Ki67 expression was increased in CD4 T cells but not in CD8 T cells, and intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed the existence of pS129 peptide-specific Th1 and Th17 cells. The pS129 peptide-specific Th17 responses, but not Th1 responses, demonstrated a positive correlation with the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III scores. A similar correlation was observed for IL-17A levels in the culture supernatant of PBMCs from PD patients with disease duration\u2009<\u200910\u00a0years. Interestingly, enhanced Th17 responses to pS129 peptides were uniquely found in PD patients among the synucleinopathies, suggesting that Th17 responses are amplified by certain mechanisms in PD patients. To investigate such mechanisms, we analyzed Th17-inducible capacity of \u03b1S-exposed dendritic cells (DCs). In vitro stimulation with \u03b1S aggregates generated Th17-inducible DCs with IL-6 and IL-23 production through the signaling of TLR4 and spliced X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1s). In fact, the levels of IL-6 and IL-23 in plasma, and the XBP1s ratio in type 2 conventional DCs were increased in PD patients compared with those in controls.Here, we propose the importance of \u03b1S-specific Th17 responses in the progression of PD and the underlying mechanisms inducing Th17 responses. These findings may provide novel therapeutic strategies to prevent disease development through the suppression of TLR4-XBP1s-IL-23 signaling in DCs.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the spread of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregates throughout the central nervous system in a stereotypical manner. These diseases include Lewy body disease (LBD), which encompass Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD), and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). LBD and MSA chiefly contain \u03b1-syn aggregates in neurons and oligodendrocytes, respectively, although glial \u03b1-syn pathology in LBD is increasingly being recognized. Semi-quantitative and machine learning-based quantifications of neuronal, oligodendrocytic and astrocytic \u03b1-syn pathology were implemented on a cohort of LBD and MSA post-mortem tissue samples. The neuroanatomical distribution of each cell-type specific \u03b1-syn pathology was evaluated using conditional probability matrices and Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm. We revealed extensive glial \u03b1-syn pathology in LBD, emphasizing the disease- and region-specific profile of astrocytic \u03b1-syn pathology, which was absent in MSA and minimal in the substantia nigra of LBD. Furthermore, we have described distinct morphologies of astrocytic \u03b1-syn pathology, which were found to correlate with the density of astrocytic \u03b1-syn inclusions. Astrocytic \u03b1-syn pathology was mainly centered in the amygdala and exhibited a unique stereotypical progression whilst oligodendrocytes displayed a distribution akin to the established neuronal progression pattern. SuStaIn modeling was further used to test for heterogeneity in the spatiotemporal progression, revealing that a subset of cases might follow an alternative pattern. Based on these findings, we introduce a novel multimodal progression framework that integrates, for the first time, the temporal and spatial progression of astrocytic and oligodendrocytic \u03b1-syn pathology alongside neuronal pathology in PD, providing further information regarding the role of neurons and glia in disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome signaling cascade activation is a significant contributor to the initiation and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent evidence supports that targeting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly could be a potential strategy to halt PD progression. The molecular mechanism of the olfactory-brain axis in mediating PD remains elusive. The current study explores that MPTP exposure to C57BL/6 mice leads to glial cell activation and impairs the olfactory function. The role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the olfactory bulb and the brain mediating neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration by activating multiple inflammatory pathways is explored. Loganic acid (LA), an iridoid glycoside, has been shown to provide antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and inhibit microglial activation. Our results in-vitro\u00a0studies demonstrated that LA treatment in MPP",

    "abstract": "Efforts to develop disease-modifying treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) have been hindered by the lack of animal models replicating all hallmarks of PD and the insufficient attention to extra-nigrostriatal regions pathologically critical for the prodromal appearance of non-motor symptoms. Among PD models, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) infusion in mice has gained prominence since 2012, primarily focusing on the nigrostriatal region. This study characterized tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuron and fiber loss across the brain following a unilateral 6-OHDA (20\u2009\u00b5g) infusion into the dorsal striatum. Our analysis integrates immunolabeling, brain clearing (iDISCO+), light sheet microscopy, and computational methods, including fMRI and machine learning tools. We also examined sex differences, disease progression, neuroinflammatory responses, and pro-apoptotic signaling in nigrostriatal regions of C57BL/6 mice exposed to varying 6-OHDA dosages (5, 10, or 20\u2009\u00b5g) followed by 1, 7, and 14 days of recovery. This comprehensive, spatiotemporal analysis of 6-OHDA-induced pathology was used to map the time course of neuronal degeneration and the onset of neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "It is currently unknown why some individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) go on to develop dementia (Parkinson's disease dementia; PDD), whereas others do not. One possibility is differences in susceptibility to metallomic dysregulation. A previous study of the PDD brain identified substantive perturbations in metal levels, including severe multi-regional decreases in Cu. The current work uses the same methods to ascertain whether this metallomic dysfunction is also present in the PD brain.\nTissue from nine PD cases free of cognitive decline and 15 equivalent controls was obtained from seven brain regions. Levels of Na, Mg, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Se were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine any potential confounder effects. Results were compared with those previously obtained for PDD.\nDecreased Cu in the medulla was the only statistically significant case-control difference observed in the PD brain; this contrasts markedly with the widespread metallic dysfunction observed in PDD. PD and PDD cases were well-separated by PCA analysis. In the PD cohort, tau Braak stage correlated with Cu concentrations in several regions, but these correlations were not retained when including PDD cases.\nThere is a marked difference in the metallomic profiles of PD and PDD, with an almost complete lack of metallic involvement observed in the former. This resistance to metallomic dysfunction may contribute to resilience against cognitive impairment in individuals with PD who do not develop dementia.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) is a well-known measure to assess disability in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of this study was to develop a short form of the WHODAS 2.0 for persons with PD using a machine learning-based methodology (ML-WHODAS) and to examine the efficiency (i.e., number of items needed to be administered) and validity of the ML-WHODAS.\nA secondary data analysis was performed. Data were randomly assigned to training datasets (80\u00a0%) and validation datasets (20\u00a0%). For developing the ML-WHODAS, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regressor was used to select the most informative items from the training datasets, and then the final XGBoost model was generated. The efficiency, concurrent validity, and convergent validity of the ML-WHODAS were then examined using the validation dataset.\nData from 1633 patients were randomly assigned into the training dataset (1306) and the validation dataset (327). Eighteen items were selected for the ML-WHODAS to reproduce 6 domain scores and one global score of the original WHODAS 2.0. In the validation dataset, the Pearson's coefficients r between the scores of the ML-WHODAS and WHODAS 2.0 were 0.97-0.99, indicating very high concurrent validity. Significant correlations were found regarding convergent validity of the domain and global scores.\nThe ML-WHODAS showed good efficiency and validity compared to the WHODAS 2.0 in persons with PD. The ML-WHODAS demonstrates its potential as an alternative to the WHODAS 2.0, though further validations (e.g., test-retest reliability and responsiveness) are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric manifestations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). They generally affect one-third of patients and greatly impact their quality of life. There have been several scales for diagnosing anxiety disorders. However, none were created distinctively for PD and lacked the diagnostic qualities for PD patients. The Parkinson's Anxiety Scale (PAS) was created to address this issue, and it has demonstrated good psychometric features since. In this study, our aim was to assess the validity and reliability of the Persian adaptation of PAS (P-PAS). The study included 52 patients from Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital's Movement Disorders clinic. During their visits, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and P-PAS were collected. Demographical data and disease history were obtained from the hospital dataset. Two weeks later, the P-PAS was taken from the patients for the second time by phone. Thirty-one (59.6%) of our patients were men. The mean age of the patients was 63.79. The majority (59.6%) of the patients had a Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2. Disease duration had a median of 5\u2009years and a range of 1 to 23\u2009years. Cronbach's alpha was 0.839. The intra-class correlation between the two P-PAS was 0.777. P-PAS had a correlation of 0.866, 0.785, and 0.508 with BAI, HADS-Anxiety (HADS-A), and HADS-Depression (HADS-D), respectively. P-PAS exhibited acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. It demonstrated good divergent and convergent validity. P-PAS is a reliable and valid scale for use in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an essential transcriptional factor, involved in the regulation of countenance of various anti-oxidant enzymes and cytoprotective genes that respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, thus potentially contributing to several neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Parkison's disease (PD). PD is the second most prevalent progressive NDD, characterized by gradual neuronal death in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), depletion of dopamine level, and a wide range of motor symptoms, including bradykinesia, tremor, tingling, and muscle fatigue. The etiopathology of PD is caused by multifactorial intertwined with the onset and progression of the disease. In this context, Nrf2 exhibits neuroprotective action by preserving dopaminergic neurons in the striatum and retarding the disease progression; thus, Nrf2 activation plays a crucial role in PD. Additionally, Nrf2 binds with the antioxidant response element, which is located in the promoter region of most of the genes that are responsible for coding antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, protein kinase C (PKC) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) are also involved in the regulation of Keap1 pathway-mediated Nrf2 activation. As Nrf2 revealed its defensive and protective role in the central nervous system (CNS), it is gaining enough interest in treating PD. The treatments that are currently available are intended to alleviate the symptoms of PD; however, they are unable to halt the progression and severity of the disease. Therefore, in this review we delve deeper into various molecular mechanisms associated with oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation in PD. Additionally, we elaborated on the substantial role that NRF2 plays in mitigating these adverse effects and its potential as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Tremor is a common symptom in movement disorders and is evident at rest in Parkinson's Disease (PD). In PD, tremor may be responsive to brain stimulation, ranging from Deep Brain Stimulation to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Transcranial Pulse Stimulation (TPS) is a novel/painless/non-invasive technique which appears to induce biomolecular changes through shock waves. Here, as one of the first studies in the field of PD, we exploratively investigate the possibility to observe changes in tremor, induced by single-session TPS delivered on the motor cortex of PD patients.\nTPS was delivered in 16 patients. Of these, 9 were admitted to sham (placebo). Resting tremor was measured at baseline (T0), after TPS (T1), and after 24\u00a0\u200bh from intervention (T2).\nAt baseline, tremor was always present. After TPS, tremor reduction was noted at T1 and T2 (compared to T0 and placebo). We noted a decrease in the amplitude of resting tremor (not its frequency).\nTPS is a non-invasive technique that may be a novel solution for reducing tremor in PD, lasting at least 24\u00a0\u200bh after single-sessions. No side effects were reported. We discuss evidence suggesting potential physiological changes in mechanisms of neural circuits that are affected in PD.",

Mice were evaluated for brain malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and nitric oxide (NO), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), acetylcholinesterase (ACHE), interlukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1). Histopathologic examination was also done.\nCticholine co-treatment at 50, 100 or 200\u202fmg/kg significantly decreased brain MDA and increased PON-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. When given at 200\u202fmg/kg, it also significantly decreased NO production, while at 100 and 200\u202fmg/kg significantly increased GSH brain. MCP-1 significantly decreased upon treatment with 100 or 200\u202fmg/kg of citicholine. IL-1 \u03b2 and NF-\u03baB significantly decreased and AChE significantly increased by 200\u202fmg/kg citicholine. Oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers also showed favorable changes after Vit E, caffeine or L-dopa. However, the combination of Vit E and/or caffeine with 100\u202fmg/kg citicholine was not superior to that of only citicholine at 100 or 200\u202fmg/kg.\nCiticholine is neuroprotective in acute rotenone nigrostriatal degeneration via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is suggested that citicholine may have a role in treatment of Parkinson's disease by decreasing neuro-inflammation and oxidative stress, preventing the development of neuronal damage.",

    "abstract": "Although there are established guidelines for the selection of suitable candidates, objective and timely referral for the use of apomorphine remains challenging.\nThis research examined how telemonitoring may facilitate referrals for continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA Blind Rater and a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) including an expert PD nurse, neurologist, and geriatrician determined apomorphine pump treatment eligibility for 20 patients with PD. The MDT considered telemonitoring data and physical examination to determine eligibility. The Blind Rater used only telemonitoring data (PDMonitor\u00ae) to evaluate eligibility.\nThe results show that using wearable sensors to determine appropriateness of apomorphine pump treatment is similar to a complete method that combines objective motor symptom monitoring with clinical evaluation. The MDT and blind rater had a 0.89 Cohen's kappa coefficient, which suggests high rate of agreement. The best-performing objective metric for differentiating patients who were recommended (APO) from those non-recommended (non-APO) for apomorphine pump therapy, was the device-reported percentage of time in the \"ON\" state, which takes into consideration the \"OFF\" and dyskinesia time. The APO group had lower values in this metric and could be differentiated from the non-APO group accurately (85%).\nUsing telemonitoring to determine eligibility for apomorphine therapy might improve evaluation and treatment in patients with PD and, therefore help improve their quality of life.",

Two authors screened studies based on key inclusion criteria, including at least two cognitive tests, and a follow-up of 6\u2009months or more. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).\nFifteen studies were identified (7 APO and 8 LCIG). APO generally preserved cognitive function over a 12-month follow-up, with some decreases in visuospatial memory and executive functions. LCIG, with a 28-month follow-up, showed more extensive cognitive decline, particularly in patients with pre-existing impairments. Variability in cognitive tests made direct comparisons difficult.\nAPO may have a more favorable cognitive profile than LCIG. However, differences in follow-up duration, moderate risk of bias, and inconsistent cognitive assessments warrant cautious interpretation. Improved patient selection and comprehensive cognitive evaluations are recommended for future practice.",

    "abstract": "Differential diagnosis of rest tremor (RT) disorders is challenging, often requiring 123I-ioflupane single-photon-emission-computed tomography (DaTscan), an expensive technique not available worldwide. In the current study, we investigated the performance of a new wearable mobile device termed \"RT-ring\" in predicting DaTscan result in patients presenting with RT based on rest tremor inertial features.\nConsecutive RT patients underwent RT-ring tremor analysis, surface electromyography (sEMG), and DaTscan. The RT-ring is a miniaturized mobile device that uses machine learning based on inertial tremor data to estimate the RT pattern. This electrophysiologic tremor feature has proven to accurately predict DaTscan result. The primary outcome was the RT-ring's performance in distinguishing patients with and without striatal dopaminergic deficit.\nSixty-seven RT patients were enrolled, including 42 patients with striatal dopaminergic deficit and 25 with normal DaTscan. The RT-ring showed 85.0% sensitivity, 90.9% specificity, and 87.9% balanced accuracy in predicting DaTscan result, and demonstrated 96.8% agreement with sEMG in RT pattern classification.\nThe RT-ring is a promising, non-invasive, user-friendly, wearable mobile device for supporting the diagnosis of tremulous Parkinson's disease in primary care settings, especially in low-income countries with limited access to dopamine imaging.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurological disorder, characterized by motor symptoms such as tremor and rigidity due to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This study investigates the formulation of quercetin, a natural bioflavonoid with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as niosomes for intranasal delivery to enhance its bioavailability and therapeutic potential for PD.\nThe niosomal formulation was optimized for critical parameters including particle size, entrapment efficiency, and zeta potential. Male Wistar rats were utilized to assess the effects of quercetin-loaded niosomes on motor function, dopaminergic neuron protection, and oxidative stress alleviation.\nThe optimized niosomal formulation exhibited a particle size of 195\u00a0nm, a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.29, a zeta potential (ZP) of -30.63\u00a0mV, and an entrapment efficiency (EE) of 82.77%. \nThe findings suggest that the quercetin-loaded niosomal formulation offers improved drug delivery and efficacy, indicating its potential as a superior treatment option for PD compared to conventional dosage forms. This approach may pave the way for enhanced therapeutic strategies targeting the neurodegenerative processes underlying Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. It has been reported that astrocytes play a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Here, we aimed to identify the heterogeneity of astrocytes and investigate genes associated with astrocyte differentiation trajectories in PD.\nThe single-cell transcriptomic profiles of PD samples were collected from the GEO database. We have identified subsets of astrocytes and analyzed their functions. The differentiation trajectory of astrocyte subtypes was explored using Monocle2. Inflammatory response scores were determined using AUCell. The levels of CHI3L1 mRNA and protein expressions in astrocytes were analyzed using qRT-PCR and Western Blot assay, respectively.\nWe characterized seven cell types within the substantia nigra region of both PD and normal samples. Our analysis revealed that astrocytes comprised the second-highest proportion of cell types. Additionally, we identified three distinct subpopulations of astrocytes: Astro-C0, Astro-C1, and Astro-C2. Notably, Astro-C0 was associated with inflammatory signaling pathways. Trajectory analysis indicated that Astro-C0 occupies an intermediate stage of differentiation. The astrocyte-related gene CHI3L1 was found to be highly expressed in the Astro-C0 subpopulation. Furthermore, we observed increased levels of CHI3L1 mRNA and protein in LPS-induced astrocytes. Astrocytes exhibiting elevated CHI3L1 levels demonstrated interactions with microglia in PD patients. Lastly, we discovered that CHI3L1 was significantly overexpressed in PD patients and exhibited strong diagnostic potential for the disease.\nThis study clarified the heterogeneity of astrocytes in PD based on the single-cell transcriptomic profiles and found that CHI3L1 may be a diagnostic biomarker for PD.",

    "results": "We characterized seven cell types within the substantia nigra region of both PD and normal samples. Our analysis revealed that astrocytes comprised the second-highest proportion of cell types. Additionally, we identified three distinct subpopulations of astrocytes: Astro-C0, Astro-C1, and Astro-C2. Notably, Astro-C0 was associated with inflammatory signaling pathways. Trajectory analysis indicated that Astro-C0 occupies an intermediate stage of differentiation. The astrocyte-related gene CHI3L1 was found to be highly expressed in the Astro-C0 subpopulation. Furthermore, we observed increased levels of CHI3L1 mRNA and protein in LPS-induced astrocytes. Astrocytes exhibiting elevated CHI3L1 levels demonstrated interactions with microglia in PD patients. Lastly, we discovered that CHI3L1 was significantly overexpressed in PD patients and exhibited strong diagnostic potential for the disease.",

    "abstract": "Previous researches have often underestimated the diversity and combined effects of risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to identify how multiple modifiable risk factors collectively impact PD.\nThe study included 452,492 participants from the UK Biobank, utilizing genetic data and 255 phenotypic variables. A broad exposure association study was conducted across seven domains: socioeconomic status, medical history, psychosocial factors, physical measures, early life, local environment, and lifestyle. Risk scores of each domain for each participant were generated. The joint effects of modifiable and genetic risks assessed using Cox proportional hazards model. Population attributable fraction (PAF) was estimated to quantify contribution ratio of risk factors in different domains to the occurrence of PD.\nMultiple risk factors significantly (\nResults indicated that addressing modifiable risk factors, especially in physical measures and psychological factors, could potentially prevent up to 33.87% of PD cases. In formulating prevention strategies, it is recommended to prioritize domains such as physical measures, psychosocial factors, lifestyle, and medical history.",

    "abstract": "The modulation of the brain's electrical activity for therapeutic purposes has recently gained attention, supported by the promising results obtained through the non-invasive application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurological diseases. To optimize therapeutic efficacy, it is crucial to investigate the cellular and molecular effects of tDCS. This will help to identify important biomarkers, predict patient's response and develop personalized treatments. In this study, we applied direct current stimulation (DCS) to a neural cell line, using mild currents over short periods of time (0.5\u2009mA, 20\u2009min), with 24-h intervals. We observed that DCS induced changes in the cellular lipidome, with transient effects observed after a single stimulation (lasting 24\u2009h) and more significant, long-lasting effects (up to 72\u2009h) after repeated stimulation cycles. In neural cells, multiple DCS treatment modulated structural membrane lipids (PE, PS, PI), downregulated glycerol lipids with ether-linked fatty acids and pro-inflammatory lipids (ceramides and lyso-glycerophospholipids) (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.005). Multiple DCS sessions altered transcriptional activity by decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05; IL-1\u03b2, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01), while increasing the expression of neuroprotective factors such as heme oxygenase-1 (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05), as well as proteins involved in vesicular transport (SNARE, sorting nexins and seipin and \u03b1-synuclein; p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05). In addition, DCS enhanced the release of extracellular vesicles, with repeated stimulations significantly increasing the release of exosomes threefold. In conclusion, while a single electrical stimulation induces transient metabolic changes with limited phenotypic effects, repeated applications induce a broader and deeper modulation of lipid species. This may lead to a neuroprotective and neuroplasticity-focussed transcriptional profile, potentially supporting the therapeutic effects of tDCS at the cellular and molecular level in patients..",

    "abstract": "Within the last three decades, revolutions in genomics data generation and bioinformatics analysis techniques have profoundly impacted our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of Parkinson's disease (PD). From the description of the first PD-associated risk gene in 1997 through today, new technologies have revolutionized approaches to identify genetic and molecular mechanisms implicated in human health and disease. Spurred by the dramatically decreasing costs for genotyping, genome sequencing, and transcriptomics approaches, the ability to profile large cohorts of human populations or model organisms has accelerated the understanding of disease susceptibility, pathways, and genes. Thus far, \u223c30 genetic loci have been unequivocally linked to the pathogenesis of PD, highlighting essential molecular pathways underlying this common disorder. More recently, the advent of single-cell transcriptomics techniques applied to human brain tissue has implicated cell-type-specific dysregulation and vulnerability (beyond the loss of dopaminergic neurons) in the disease. Herein, we discuss how neurogenomics and bioinformatics are applied to dissect the nature of this complex disease with the overall aim of identifying new targets for therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with over ten million active cases worldwide and one million new diagnoses per year. Detecting and subsequently diagnosing the disease is challenging because of symptom heterogeneity with respect to complexity, as well as the type and timing of phenotypic manifestations. Typically, language impairment can present in the prodromal phase and precede motor symptoms suggesting that a linguistic-based approach could serve as a diagnostic method for incipient Parkinson's disease. Additionally, improved linguistic models may enhance other approaches through fusion techniques. The field of large language models is advancing rapidly, presenting the opportunity to explore the use of these new models for detecting Parkinson's disease and to improve on current linguistic approaches with high-dimensional representations of linguistics. We evaluate the application of state-of-the-art large language models to detect Parkinson's disease automatically from spontaneous speech with up to 78% accuracy. We also demonstrate that large language models can be used to predict the severity of PD in a regression task. We further demonstrate that the better performance of large language models is due to their ability to extract more relevant linguistic features and not due to increased dimensionality of the feature space.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) may have neuroprotective effects. However, long-term real-world studies are needed to clarify their potential impact on Parkinson's disease.\nThis nationwide cohort study included 33,462 patients (16,731 GLP-1RA initiators and 16,731 propensity score-matched dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor [DPP-4i] initiators) from 2007 to 2018, followed until 2022. Eligible participants were \u2265\u200950\u2009years, had no prior cancer or Parkinson's disease, and were residents in Denmark for at least 10\u2009years. Patients were followed until Parkinson's diagnosis, death, emigration, treatment discontinuation (no additional prescription within 180\u2009days), switch to the other study drug, or end of follow-up. Additional analyses included comparisons with insulin, competing risk of death, and the main analysis disregarding adherence.\nDuring follow-up, 192 patients developed Parkinson's disease, including 93 during sustained treatment. After 10\u2009years, sustained GLP-1RA users had a lower hazard ratio (HR 0.57 (95% CI 0.37;0.85)) and absolute risk difference (-0.24 (95% CI -0.63 to 0.15)) compared to DPP-4i users. Similar trends were found when using insulin as a comparator. A significant survival advantage was found among sustained users of GLP-1RA (particularly when comparing with insulin). When not accounting for adherence, the results was not statistically significant.\nResults were suggestive for a potential neuroprotective effect of GLP-1RAs against Parkinson's disease. Further studies are needed to assess biomarkers of disease progression, and evaluate safety in patients with Parkinson's disease, dosing, and effects when combined with other treatments in neurodegenerative diseases.",

The subjects were split up into four groups: 50 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, 50 with Alzheimer's disease, 50 with Parkinson's disease, and 50 with periodontal disease. To evaluate periodontal condition, including clinical attachment loss and pocket depth, thorough oral exams were performed. Measurements were made of serum biomarkers for inflammation, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Multivariate regression models were used to examine correlations between the severity of periodontal disease and the underlying systemic diseases.\nIn all groups, there were significant relationships between higher levels of indicators of systemic inflammation and the severity of periodontal disease. In comparison to healthy controls (CRP mean value: 2.1 mg/L; IL-6 mean value: 6.4 pg/mL), participants with periodontal disease had higher mean levels of CRP (5.6 mg/L) and IL-6 (mean value: 12.8 pg/mL). Furthermore, compared to those with rheumatoid arthritis, those with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disorders showed higher levels of pocket depth and periodontal attachment loss.\nIn conclusion, the results point to a possible connection between systemic diseases such rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's.",

    "abstract": "Lateral trunk flexion is a common form of postural abnormality in Parkinson's disease and could be associated with verticality misperception. However, the mechanisms underlying lateral trunk flexion and verticality misperception in Parkinson's disease remain unclear. In the current study, we examined whether lateral trunk flexion is associated with verticality misperception in patients with Parkinson's disease. We also identified the brain regions involved in lateral trunk flexion and altered verticality perception. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the verticality perception using the subjective visual vertical test in 81 patients with Parkinson's disease and 14 age-matched healthy controls. According to the 97.5th percentile upper reference limit of the body tilt angle in the healthy controls, patients with Parkinson's disease were grouped into 37 patients with lateral trunk flexion and 44 patients without lateral trunk flexion. The mean of absolute subjective visual vertical angles was compared between patients with Parkinson's disease with lateral trunk flexion, those without lateral trunk flexion, and the healthy controls, and the impact of verticality misperception on lateral trunk flexion was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. We further performed a voxel-wise comparison of regional cerebral blood flow using N-isopropyl-p-[",

    "abstract": "Substantia nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC) are two catecholaminergic, neuromelanin-rich nuclei that are affected in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may show neuroimaging abnormalities before the onset of motor manifestations. The simultaneous, multimodal investigation of their microstructural abnormalities may provide useful insights on the spatial diffusion and tissue characteristics of neurodegeneration, and this may in turn help develop markers for disease-modifying clinical trials. Therefore, through neuromelanin-sensitive and diffusion MRI, we aimed to investigate microstructural abnormalities in those nuclei in isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) and PD. Fourteen participants with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD, 18 with PD and 18 healthy controls were scanned with structural, neuromelanin-sensitive and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) MRI. iRBD participants also underwent dopamine transporter imaging. SN neuromelanin and NODDI diffusion parameters and LC neuromelanin signals were extracted. Motor and global cognitive assessments were also collected. iRBD and PD participants showed significantly reduced neuromelanin contrast in the LC middle section compared with healthy controls. PD also showed significantly reduced caudal LC and posterior SN neuromelanin signal. No differences in SN NODDI parameters were detected between iRBD and healthy controls. Five iRBD participants showed reduced striatal dopamine transporter. In the combined disease groups (iRBD and PD), significant associations were shown between SN neuromelanin signal and neurite density index (",

    "abstract": "Depression is thought to affect up to half of Parkinson's patients at some point during their illness, while anxiety is reported by about 40% of PD patients. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in Saudi Arabia.\nThe study involved Saudi Arabian citizens and residents aged 40 or older with PD, who completed internet-survey (including online and email-based data collection) or telephone-survey by trained interviewers. We used the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire for quality-of-Life assessment questionnaire (PDQ-39), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression (PHQ-9), and General Anxiety Disorder-7 anxiety questionnaire (GAD-7).\nThe study included 46 participants, of whom 37% were aged 60-69 years, 67% were male, 46% had completed a university education, and 87% were married. Depression symptoms were present in 84.8% of participants, while 73.9% experienced anxiety. PD patients lacking social support were 8 times more likely to develop major depression [OR = 8.27, 95% CI (1.47-46.31), p = 0.016] and 5 times more likely to experience anxiety symptoms [OR = 5.36, 95% CI (1.14-25.26), p = 0.034]. Those unable to perform daily living activities or who faced stigma had a 16.5 times higher likelihood of anxiety symptoms [OR = 16.5, 95% CI (1.62-168.48), p = 0.018]. Furthermore, cognitive impairment increased the likelihood of anxiety by 11 times [OR = 11.43, 95% CI (1.83-71.42), p = 0.009].\nThe study reveals a high prevalence of depression and anxiety among Parkinson's disease patients, linked to physical impairments and social isolation. Many patients report no mental health improvement despite treatment, highlighting the need for routine mental health assessments, social support, and tailored interventions to enhance their quality of life. The small sample size may limit the statistical power, precision, and generalizability of the study's findings.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or liver fibrosis may share similar pathophysiological features with Parkinson's disease (PD), yet their correlation was unclear. This study aimed to explore their correlation between PD and liver fibrosis using the fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) as a surrogate marker.\nWe analyzed Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data and enrolled PD patients with comprehensive baseline and 5-year follow-up time-point clinical data. Participants were categorized based on FIB-4 levels to assess the association between FIB-4 scores and various clinical scales, controlling for potential confounders. Differences in the progression of clinical scales over five years were compared using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM).\nBaseline FIB-4 levels positively correlated to scores of baseline section III of the Unified-Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III) (\nElevated baseline FIB-4 correlated to more severe baseline daytime sleepiness, motor symptoms, and memory function in PD patients, along with a more rapid decline in cognitive functions such as executive function, information processing ability, and memory. Additionally, a high FIB-4 might confer a protective effect against anxiety.",

We included articles if: (1) the study population was comprised of patients with PD, (2) the presence of psychosis was systematically ascertained through clinician diagnosis, clinical outcome assessments and/or administrative data, and (3) potential risk factors were examined prior to the onset of psychosis.\nTwenty-six studies (15 prospective cohort, 10 retrospective cohort, 1 retrospective case-control) of 21 patient cohorts (n = 15,535 unique patients) were included in the review. Ten studies included minor phenomena in their definition of psychosis. The most consistent potential risk factors for psychosis were sleep disturbances, particularly rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and autonomic dysfunction. Potentially modifiable risk factors for psychosis included excessive daytime sleepiness and exposure to anticholinergic medications and levodopa. Possible biomarkers for psychosis in PD included reduced striatal dopamine transporter binding on imaging and mutations in the \nSeveral studies have identified potentially modifiable risk factors for the development of psychosis in PD.

Possible biomarkers for psychosis in PD included reduced striatal dopamine transporter binding on imaging and mutations in the ",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing between essential tremor (ET) and tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD-TD) can be challenging due to overlapping motor symptoms. This study aims to investigate the differences in nonmotor symptoms (NMS) between ET and PD-TD patients to provide additional evidence for differentiating these two conditions.\nThis retrospective study included 1656 participants, comprising 558 PD-TD patients, 584 ET patients, and 514 controls. ET patients were assessed using the Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS), while PD-TD patients were evaluated based on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). All participants were assessed for NMS using the Nonmotor Symptoms Scale (NMSS).\nThe composite NMSS score for the PD-TD group was significantly higher than that for the ET group and the control group (23.44 \u00b1 20.20\u00a0vs. 12.60 \u00b1 14.89\u00a0vs. 9.37 \u00b1 12.44, p < 0.001). Compared to ET patients, PD-TD patients had an increased risk of all NMS, especially in hyposmia (OR = 7.70, 95% CI: 5.11-11.62). The NMSS score, urinary symptoms, and hyposmia may play a role in differentiating ET from PD-TD. The area under the curve (AUC) is 0.766 (95% CI: 0.739-0.793), with a sensitivity of 80.8% and specificity of 58.6%. When family history is included in the analysis, the AUC increases to 0.819 (95% CI: 0.795-0.843), with sensitivity improving to 82.4% and specificity to 68.2%.\nThe study reveals significant differences in NMS between ET and PD-TD. Compared to patients with ET, those with PD-TD exhibit more frequent and severe NMS. NMS and family history are helpful in differentiating between ET and PD-TD.",

However, there is a lack of research on the association between plasma EGF levels and cognitive impairments in PD patients.\nThe study included 135 PD patients. Plasma EGF concentrations were measured. PD patients without cognitive impairment were followed up for clinical assessment at an average of 2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 years.\nPD patients with cognitive impairment (PD-CI) had lower baseline plasma EGF concentrations compared to PD patients without cognitive impairment.

However, no significant association was found between plasma EGF concentrations and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Delayed Recall (HVLT-DR), Semantic Fluency Test (SFT), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Trail Making Test (TMT) A, or TMT B scores. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis revealed that baseline plasma EGF concentrations were associated with cognitive decline in PD patients without cognitive impairment in adjusted regression models (HR 0.977, 95% CI 0.955-0.999, p\u2009=\u20090.045), after adjusting for various factors. The area under the curve (AUC) for cognitive decline at follow-up time was 0.704 (95% CI 0.600-0.809), and the optimal cut-point for baseline plasma EGF concentrations was determined to be 49.56 pg/mL, with a sensitivity of 49.3% and specificity of 92.3%.\nIn conclusion, our study found a correlation between baseline plasma EGF concentrations and cognitive dysfunction in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which reliable blood biomarkers to predict disease progression remain elusive. Plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained attention as a promising biomarker platform due to their stability and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. This study explored the potential of EV-cargo proteins, specifically \u03b1-synuclein, tau, and \u03b2-amyloid, as biomarkers of PD progression. A cohort of 55 people with PD (PwP) and 58 healthy controls (HCs) underwent annual assessments of plasma EV proteins, cognition, and motor symptoms. EVs were isolated and validated using standardized methods, with pathognomonic proteins quantified via immunomagnetic reduction assays. Associations between biomarker changes and clinical symptom progression were analyzed. Over an average of 3.96 visits for PwP and 2.25 visits for HCs, PwP exhibited a distinct pattern of plasma EV protein changes linked to motor symptom progression, particularly in the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) part II score. Notably, changes in plasma EV \u03b1-synuclein levels were significantly correlated with changes in motor and cognitive symptoms, suggesting its central role in disease progression. These findings highlight the potential of plasma EV biomarkers, especially \u03b1-synuclein, as indicators of ongoing pathogenesis and as candidates for evaluating \u03b1-synuclein-targeted therapies in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to death of dopaminergic neurons and deficiency of dopamine. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide after Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is mostly prevalent in elderly people above age 60. Clinical manifestations of PD include motor symptoms like tremor, akinesia, rigidity and gait imbalance; whereas non-motor symptoms include impaired olfaction and GI dysfunction. \u0391-synuclein is the major pathological hallmark of PD pathology. It aggregates and leads to formation of fibrils and Lewy bodies. It is a pre-synaptic protein that normally governs synaptic vesicle recycling. However, its aberration leads to its aggregation. There are several other synaptic proteins besides \u03b1-synuclein, and they might also have a pathological role. These synaptic proteins include synucleins (beta-synuclein, gamma-synuclein), synaptophysin, synaptobrevin, synaptogyrin, synaptotagmin and synaptojanin. In this review, we aim to explore underlying pathological role of these proteins. Clearer insights into the role of these synaptic proteins might aid in identifying newer targets which subsequently leads to development of novel therapeutics that target progression of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Rehabilitation becomes increasingly important in the more advanced stages of Parkinson's Disease. As the disease reaches its more debilitating stages and pharmacological or surgical treatment becomes less relevant, non-pharmacological interventions including rehabilitation become key. Existing systematic interventions typically focus on individuals in the early to mid-stages of the disease. The objective of this scoping review was to identify and map the available evidence on non-pharmacological rehabilitation interventions for people living with advanced Parkinson's disease.\nThis scoping review was conducted following the methodology for scoping reviews developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane. Studies published in English from 2000 to May 2024 were considered eligible and screened for relevance.\nThirteen studies were included. The majority of the interventions were experimental; one had a focus on feasibility and one had a mixed focus on effect and feasibility. Most interventions were referred to as either rehabilitation, training, or therapy, with the two feasibility interventions focusing on comprehensive assessment and referrals. The majority used modalities concerned with levels of functioning. Studies focusing on stage 4 (H&Y) Parkinson's disease were prominent.\nThis scoping review provides a foundational overview of existing non-pharmacological rehabilitation interventions for advanced Parkinson's disease, revealing a small yet diverse range of approaches, from single-disciplinary to multidisciplinary interventions. It offers initial insights that can point to areas where further research can solidify and expand effective, targeted care strategies for people living with advanced Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease. Since the diagnosis of the PD is mainly made based on the symptoms and after the disease progression, early diagnosis can play a crucial role in delaying the passage of the PD. There have been many methods focusing on disease diagnosis using electroencephalography (EEG) signals, where most of the proposed methods are data-dependent. Here, the study aims to propose a technique that, despite its high accuracy, is robust. Various features including fractal dimension, approximate entropy, largest Lyapunov exponent, and the energy of different frequency sub-bands were extracted from EEG signals. Multi-layer perceptron neural networks were used for classification based on these features. Additionally, 2D phase space images reconstructed from EEG signals were classified using convolutional neural networks. Finally, a combination of these features and images was used for classification using ResNets. During 10 rounds of training and testing, the mean accuracies were calculated for three cases: using only features, only images, and a combination of both. The mean accuracies were 84.67 %, 76.5 %, and 90.2 % respectively. The variances for each case were 35.6 %, 19.5 %, and 13.97 %. The lower variance when using a combination of features and images indicates a more accurate and robust classification.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, and neuroinflammation is an important factor in its pathogenesis. Therefore, improving neuroinflammation has become a key direction in PD research. Cycloastragenol (CAG) is one of the active ingredients in Astragalus membranaceus, which has pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. However, there are few reports on its pharmacological effects on PD. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the pharmacological effects of CAG on PD and elucidate the potential mechanisms of action, providing new ideas for drug development in PD.\nTo comprehensively and systematically evaluate the pharmacological effects of CAG on PD and reveal its potential mechanisms of action.\nFirstly, the pharmacological effects of CAG on cell viability, cytotoxicity, behavior, and pathology were evaluated using PD in vitro (MPP\nCAG can significantly improve the behavioral indicators of PD mice, enhance neuronal vitality, and improve neuroinflammatory levels by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors. In addition, CAG can target and activate the expression of Fpr2, thereby regulating the TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and promoting the resolution of inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Sleep plays a role in the elimination of neurotoxic metabolites that are accumulated in the waking brain as a result of neuronal activity. Long-term insomnia and sleep deprivation are associated with oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, amyloid beta (A\u03b2) deposition, and Lewy body formation, which are known to increase the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Orexin A (OXA) and orexin B (OXB), two neuropeptides produced in the lateral hypothalamus, are known to influence the sleep-wake cycle and the stress responses through their interactions with OX receptor 1 (OX1R) and OX receptor 2 (OX2R), respectively.

    "abstract": "\u03b2-synuclein (\u03b2-syn), mainly expressed in central nerve system, is one of the biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood for synaptic damage, which has been reported to be elevated in CSF and blood of the patients of prion diseases (PrDs).\nWe analyzed 314 CSF samples from patients in China National Surveillance for CJD. The diagnostic groups of the 223 patients with PrDs included sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (sCJD), genetic CJD (gCJD), fatal familial insomnia (FFI) and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS). 91 patients with non-PrDs comprised Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), viral encephalitis (VE) or autoimmune encephalitis (AE) were enrolled in the control groups. The CSF \u03b2-syn levels were measured by a commercial microfluidic ELISA. The Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis H test were employed to analyze two or more sets of continuous variables. Multiple linear regression was also performed to evaluate the factors for CSF \u03b2-syn levels. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values were used to assess the diagnostic performance of \u03b2-syn.\nThe median of \u03b2-syn levels (2074\u00a0pg/ml; IQR: 691 to 4332) of all PrDs was significantly higher than that of non-PrDs group (504\u00a0pg/ml; IQR: 126 to 3374). The CSF \u03b2-syn values in the cohorts of sCJD, T188K-gCJD, E200K-gCJD and P102L-GSS were remarkably higher than that of the group of AD\u2009+\u2009PD, but similar as that of the group of VE\u2009+\u2009AE. The elevated CSF \u03b2-syn in sCJD and gCJD cases was statistically associated with CSF 14-3-3 positive and appearance of mutism. ROC curve analysis identified satisfied performance for distinguishing from AD\u2009+\u2009PD, with high AUC values in sCJD (0.7640), T188K-gCJD (0.8489), E200K-gCJD (0.8548), P102L-GSS (0.7689) and D178N-FFI (0.7210), respectively.\nOur data here indicate that CSF \u03b2-syn is a potential biomarker for distinguishing PrDs (gCJD, sCJD and GSS) from AD and PD, but is much less efficient from VE and AE. These findings have critical implications for early diagnosis and monitoring of synaptic integrity in prion diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are two distinct \u03b1-synucleinopathies traditionally differentiated through clinical symptoms. Early diagnosis of MSA is problematic, and seed amplification assays (SAAs), such as real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), offer the potential to distinguish these diseases through their underlying \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) pathology and proteoforms. Currently, SAAs provide a binary result, signifying either the presence or absence of \u03b1-Syn seeds. To enhance the diagnostic potential and biological relevance of these assays, there is a pressing need to incorporate quantification and stratification of \u03b1-Syn proteoform-specific aggregation kinetics into current SAA pipelines.\nOptimal RT-QuIC assay conditions for \u03b1-Syn seeds extracted from PD and MSA patient brains were determined, and assay kinetics were assessed for \u03b1-Syn seeds from different pathologically relevant brain regions (medulla, substantia nigra, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, and cerebellum). The conformational profiles of disease- and region-specific \u03b1-Syn proteoforms were determined by subjecting the amplified reaction products to concentration-dependent proteolytic digestion with proteinase K.\nUsing our protocol, PD and MSA could be accurately delineated using proteoform-specific aggregation kinetics, including \u03b1-Syn aggregation rate, maximum relative fluorescence, the gradient of amplification, and core protofilament size. MSA cases yielded significantly higher values than PD cases across all four kinetic parameters in brain tissues, with the MSA-cerebellar phenotype having higher maximum relative fluorescence than the MSA-Parkinsonian phenotype. Statistical significance was maintained when the data were analysed regionally and when all regions were grouped.\nOur RT-QuIC protocol and analysis pipeline can distinguish between PD and MSA, and between MSA phenotypes. MSA \u03b1-Syn seeds induce faster propagation and exhibit higher aggregation kinetics than PD \u03b1-Syn, mirroring the biological differences observed in brain tissue. With further validation of these quantitative parameters, we propose that SAAs could advance from a yes/no diagnostic to a theranostic biomarker that could be utilised in developing therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) can cause postural instability, which may result in falls. These issues have been associated with motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS), including cognitive dysfunction. Several techniques have been employed to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms involved in postural control in PD. These include behavioural studies assessing associations between cognition and postural control, functional neuroimaging studies, and resting-state neural correlates. This review provides an overview of these emerging bodies of research. Scopus, PubMed, and ProQuest were searched and detailed the brain-imaging technique, cohort, and postural control measures. A total of 79 studies were identified. Findings supported the notion of cortical involvement in postural control function to compensate for subcortical damage resulting from PD. Future studies should standardise their outcome measures and data analysis to allow comparisons of results across studies and ensure more comprehensive and robust data collection to enhance the reliability and validity of these findings.",

    "abstract": "GLP-1 receptor agonists have neurotrophic properties in in-vitro and in-vivo models of Parkinson's disease and results of epidemiological studies and small randomised trials have suggested possible benefits for risk and progression of Parkinson's disease. We aimed to establish whether the GLP-1 receptor agonist, exenatide, could slow the rate of progression of Parkinson's disease.\nWe did a phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised, placebo-controlled trial at six research hospitals in the UK. Participants were aged 25-80 years with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, were at Hoehn and Yahr stage 2\u00b75 or less when on dopaminergic treatment, and were on dopaminergic treatment for at least 4 weeks before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based system with minimisation according to Hoehn and Yahr stage and study site to receive extended-release exenatide 2 mg by subcutaneous pen injection once per week over 96 weeks, or visually identical placebo. All participants and all research team members at study sites were masked to randomisation allocation. The primary outcome was the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III score, off dopaminergic medication at 96 weeks, analysed in the intention-to-treat population using a linear mixed modelling approach. This study is registered with ISRCTN (14552789), EudraCT (2018-003028-35), and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04232969).\nBetween Jan 23, 2020, and April 23, 2022, 215 participants were screened for eligibility, of whom 194 were randomly assigned to exenatide (n=97) or placebo (n=97). 56 (29%) participants were female and 138 (71%) were male. 92 participants in the exenatide group and 96 in the placebo group had at least one follow-up visit and were included in analyses. At 96 weeks, MDS-UPDRS III OFF-medication scores had increased (worsened) by a mean of 5\u00b77 points (SD 11\u00b72) in the exenatide group, and by 4\u00b75 points (SD 11\u00b74) points in the placebo group (adjusted coefficient for the effect of exenatide 0\u00b792 [95% CI -1\u00b756 to 3\u00b739]; p=0\u00b747). Nine (9%) participants in the exenatide group had at least one serious adverse event compared with 11 (11%) in the placebo group.\nOur findings suggest that exenatide is safe and well tolerated. We found no evidence to support exenatide as a disease-modifying treatment for people with Parkinson's disease. Studies with agents that show better target engagement or in specific subgroups of patients are needed to establish whether there is any support for the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists for Parkinson's disease.\nNational Institute for Health and Care Research and Cure Parkinson's.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the role of neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) across different parkinsonian disorders-Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and multiple system atrophy (MSA)-by examining SNc dopaminergic neuron counts, neuroinflammatory T cells, and microglial activity.\nPostmortem neuropathological samples were collected from 79 individuals (PD, n\u2009=\u200938; PSP, n\u2009=\u200915; MSA, n\u2009=\u200914; controls, n\u2009=\u200912). The density of SNc tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons, T cells (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+), and Iba1 expression (Iba1-positive microglia/macrophages) were examined in the SNc and crus cerebri. Demographic and clinical data were gathered from patient histories.\nPSP patients had 89 to 212% more nigral CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells compared to MSA patients (p\u2009<\u20090.04), 125 to 178% more CD3+ and CD4+ T cells than healthy controls (p\u2009<\u20090.002), and 95% more CD4+ T cells than PD patients (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Iba1 expression in the SNc was higher in PD patients than in MSA patients (p\u2009=\u20090.004), with no significant differences observed across other conditions. There was a negative association between disease duration and SNc CD3+ T cell density (p\u2009=\u20090.002), and a positive correlation between nigral dopaminergic neuron density and CD3+ density, CD8+ density, and Iba1 expression in PD patients.\nThe study reveals distinctive neuroinflammatory patterns in the SNc, with T cell-mediated inflammation prominent in PSP and microglia-mediated inflammation in PD. PSP and MSA show greater SNc dopaminergic neuron loss compared to PD. Increased neuroinflammatory response is seen in earlier disease stages, diminishing with greater neuron loss, which may inform disease progression understanding and therapeutic strategies.

PD was defined as clinical diagnosis by a neurologist (including bradykinesia, rest tremor and/or rigidity). Age-specific risk and predictors of PD were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression.\nPD was present in 1.8% (95% CI: 0.9-2.6%) of the sample, 3.4% (95% CI: 2.2-4.6%) when including uncertain PD (clinical diagnosis or suspicion, but not meeting all criteria), and 14.0% (95% CI: 6.9-21.0%) of those aged \u226550\u2009years. Median age at motor onset was 45 (range 20-66) years.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting around 10 million people worldwide. It is primarily associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, though the exact mechanism is unclear. PD is characterized by resting tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. These motor symptoms, resulting from impaired muscle function, can lead to dysphagia and respiratory dysfunction. It is suggested that the muscular rigidity and bradykinesia in PD may impair repetitive motor actions, negatively impacting respiration. While less studied, PD-related respiratory dysfunction could stem from obstructive, restrictive, or\u00a0CNS disturbances. This case report discusses a\u00a069-year-old male with PD and dementia presented at an assisted living facility in Palmar Sur, Costa Rica, with difficulty exhaling after deep inhalation.\u00a0Physical examination revealed typical PD symptoms (resting tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability) along with hypotension, bradycardia, and bradypnea. Respiratory assessment showed he could inhale but had difficulty exhaling, suggesting a myotonic-like pathology. The cogwheel-like rigidity during exhalation is unique and points to a myotonic-like respiratory dysfunction related to his PD, a presentation not commonly observed in PD patients. Research suggests respiratory impairments in PD may result from issues with central ventilatory control, restrictive lung disease (reduced lung capacity), or obstructive lung disease (blocked airflow). Restrictive mechanisms might stem from thoracic rigidity and posture changes, while obstructive factors could be exacerbated by the patient's smoking history. Respiratory muscle fatigue may arise from the demands of repetitive ventilation. Additionally, degeneration in the brain's respiratory center, possibly linked to \u03b1-synuclein deposits, could affect respiratory regulation. Osteopathic Manipulation Treatment (OMT) may help alleviate these symptoms by improving thoracic flexibility and respiratory function. Overall, this case highlights the varied presentations of PD, focusing on the lens respiratory dysfunction, possibly due to respiratory muscle rigidity or central nervous system involvement. Recognizing these symptoms is crucial for early intervention and preventing complications like aspiration pneumonia, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in PD. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between PD and respiratory dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms and significant non-motor complications, including gastrointestinal disturbances. Constipation, which affects up to 80% of PD patients, is one of the most common and debilitating gastrointestinal symptoms. This case report describes a 77-year-old female with advanced PD, who presented multiple times to the emergency department with recurring symptoms of vomiting, abdominal pain, and severe abdominal distension. Imaging studies revealed rectosigmoid colonic dilation, fecal impaction, and right hydronephrosis and hydroureter, caused by external compression from the distended colon - a rare complication in PD. The condition was clinically diagnosed as colonic dysmotility, linked to alpha-synuclein deposition in the enteric nervous system. Management included a unique combination of rectal tube placement, manual disimpaction, and pharmacological therapy, which successfully alleviated her symptoms and resolved the associated complications. Despite the effective management of symptoms, no current therapies exist to prevent or address the underlying alpha-synuclein-related colonic dysmotility. This case underscores the need for early recognition of severe colonic dysmotility in PD and highlights the importance of further research into targeted treatments that address the complex pathophysiology of gastrointestinal dysfunction in PD.",

    "abstract": "Current clinical evaluation may tend to lack precision in detecting depression in Parkinson's disease (DPD). Radiomics features have gradually shown potential as auxiliary diagnostic tools in identifying and distinguishing different subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD), and a radiomic approach that combines unsupervised machine learning has the potential to identify DPD.\nAnalyze the clinical and imaging data of 272 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients from the PPMI dataset, along with 45 PD patients from the NACC dataset. Extract radiomic features from T1-weighted MRI images and employ principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Subsequently, apply four unsupervised clustering methods including Gaussian mixture model (GMM), hierarchical clustering, K-means, and partitioning around medoids (PAM) to classify cases in the PPMI dataset into distinct subtypes. Identify high-risk subtypes of DPD on the basis of the time and number of depression progression, and validate these findings using the NACC dataset. The data from the high-risk subtype were divided into a training subtype and a testing subtype in a 7:3 ratio. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted on the training subtype data to develop a traditional logistic regression model for the high-risk subtype, which was subsequently compared with a supervised logistic regression model constructed for the entire PPMI cohort. Finally, the performance of both models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In addition, a decision tree (DT) model was constructed based on independent risk factors of high-risk subtypes and validated using low-risk subtype data. ROC curves were employed to validate this model across training subtype, testing subtype, and low-risk subtype datasets.\nThe PAM clustering method demonstrates superior performance compared to the other three clustering methods when the number of clusters is 2. High-risk subtypes of DPD can be effectively distinguished in both the PPMI and NACC datasets. A traditional logistic regression model was developed based on rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder, UPDRS I score, UPDRS II score, and ptau in high-risk subgroups. This model exhibits a diagnostic efficacy (AUC\u2009=\u20090.731) that surpasses that of the traditional regression model constructed using the entire PPMI cohort (AUC\u2009=\u20090.674). The prediction model based on high-risk subtypes had AUC values of 0.853 and 0.81 in the training and testing subtypes, sensitivities of 0.765 and 0.786, and specificities of 0.771 and 0.815, respectively. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity in the nonhigh-risk subtype were 0.859, 0.654, and 0.852, respectively.\nBy identifying MRI structural radiomics and clinical features as potential biomarkers, the radiomic approach and UCA provide new insights into the pathophysiology of DPD to support the clinical diagnosis with high prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Rehabilitation in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) often includes balance training, but knowledge about optimal training content remains limited.\nTo describe the design, content, delivery, and reporting of balance training for individuals with PD, and furthermore, to map the systematic use and reporting of methods monitoring intensity in balance training interventions for individuals with PD.\nSix databases were searched. Interventions with at least 50\u00a0% of exercises challenging balance control were included. Balance training types (exergaming, multi-modal, sensory-motor integrated, and task-oriented) were categorized based on specific balance exercise components: motor (limits of stability, anticipatory motor strategies, reactive motor strategies, and control of dynamics), sensory (vestibular, visual, and somatosensory systems), and cognitive (dual-tasking in motor or cognitive activities). Training Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type, Volume, and Progression (FITT-VP principles) were extracted.\nIn total, 114 studies (interventions n\u00a0=\u00a0126) with 5335 participants (mean age: 67.5 years; mean PD duration: 6.8 years) were included. The highest mean number of balance components was found in the multi-modal (5.8), followed by sensory-motor (5.6), task-oriented (4.2), and exergaming (4.0). Intensity strategies were reported in 93\u00a0% of the exergaming interventions, which was superior to the other training types (multi-modal (18\u00a0%), sensory-motor (17\u00a0%), and task-oriented (6\u00a0%)).\nMulti-modal and sensory-motor interventions had a greater focus on challenging balance components compared to other types of training, while exergaming interventions demonstrated superior reporting of intensity strategies. Future research is encouraged to prioritize implementing intensity strategies and aim to incorporate a broader range of balance components within balance training exercises.",

The results were compared between the groups using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test.\n\u2003In pure-tone audiometry, significantly higher hearing thresholds were found in the SG at 6 and 8\u2009kHz. For the ABR, no differences were observed between groups. The CAEP analysis did not find statistical differences in the latencies between the groups, however, the SG presented smaller amplitudes of P1-N1, P2-N2, and N2-P3 than the CG.\n\u2003The results of this study showed a significantly higher threshold in higher frequencies in PD. Although no differences were observed at the brainstem level, the decrease in amplitude of all components in patients with PD in the CAEP suggests a deficit in both automatic and attentional cortical processing of acoustic stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and is characterized by progressive dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neuronal loss and the presence of Lewy bodies, which are primarily composed of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein. Despite advancements in symptomatic therapies, such as dopamine replacement and deep brain stimulation, no disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have been identified to slow or arrest neurodegeneration in PD. Challenges in DMT development include disease heterogeneity, the absence of reliable biomarkers, and the multifaceted pathophysiology of PD, encompassing neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal impairment, and oxidative stress. Drug repositioning and repurposing strategies using existing drugs for new therapeutic applications offer a promising approach to accelerate the development of DMTs for PD. These strategies minimize time, cost, and risk by using compounds with established safety profiles. Prominent candidates include glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, ambroxol, calcium channel blockers, statins, iron-chelating agents, c-Abl inhibitors, and memantine. Although preclinical and early clinical studies have demonstrated encouraging results, numerous phase III trials have yielded unfavorable outcomes, elucidating the complexity of PD pathophysiology and the need for innovative trial designs. This review evaluates the potential of prioritized repurposed drugs for PD, focusing on their mechanisms, preclinical evidence, and clinical trial outcomes, and highlights the ongoing challenges and opportunities in this field.",

Karst (G. lucidum) is a traditional Chinese medicinal fungus, used to exert a beneficial effect on central nervous system, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Polysaccharide is its main active ingredient, but the structural characterization and the mechanisms of the beneficial effect on PD remain to be elucidated.\nTo obtain a purified G. lucidum polysaccharide and elucidate its structure, investigate the anti-inflammatory effect on PD and explore its potential mechanisms.\nThe structure of polysaccharide was analyzed through methylation analysis and NMR analysis. The anti-inflammatory effect on PD were explored in a MPTP-induced mouse model. A comprehensive microbiota-gut-metabolomics analysis was executed and subsequently deliberated, focusing on the regulation of dysfunctions of intestinal microecology. The potential mechanisms were investigated using a LPS-induced Caco-2\u00a0cell model.\nA purified glucan, GLPZ-2 was obtained. GLPZ-2 was with triple helical structure and its backbone was found to be primarily composed of 1,6-\u03b1-D-Glcp, 1,4-\u03b1-D-Glcp, 1,4,6-\u03b1-D-Glcp and 1,3,6-\u03b2-D-Glcp, with branches at the C-3 and C-4 position by t-\u03b1-D-Glcp. PD mice experiments showed that GLPZ-2 could improve motor symptoms, reduce pathological damage and decrease brain protein expression of \u03b1-Syn, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. GLPZ-2 also could regulate the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites to restore to normal trend, increase SCFAs content and inhibit TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB pathway in intestine.\nGLPZ-2 exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect on PD, which provide a foundational basis for the application of GLPZ-2 as an effective drug to prevent and delay PD.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and coronary heart ailments have been closely associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite this established link, the potential neuroprotective impact of the potent antiplatelet agent ticagrelor (Tica) remains unexplored against PD. Thus, we hypothesized that Tica could be repurposed as a therapeutic agent against PD. Rotenone experimental model was adopted in Wistar male rats by administering rotenone subcutaneously on alternate days during a 21-day experimental period and treating a subset of rats with Tica orally for the last 11 consecutive days. The administration of Tica improved motor function (open field test, hanging wire test) and restored striatal histological features. Additionally, Tica opposed the rotenone effect and markedly obliterated the striatal \u03b1-synuclein content but enhanced the protein expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine content. On the molecular level, Tica inhibited striatal endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) as evidenced by the downregulation of the ER-resident transmembrane sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha and its downstream molecular targets, TNF receptor-associated factor 2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, along with a reduction in caspase-3 activity. On the other hand, Tica augmented the autophagy machinery by upregulating the autophagosome markers Beclin-1 and light chain 3-II, while inhibiting the content of cathepsin D. Therefore, the current study is the first to accentuate the neuroprotective potential of Tica in a rat model of PD via modulating the crosstalk between ERS, apoptosis, and autophagy to represent a potential novel therapeutic candidate for managing PD, particularly in patients with or prone to cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the aggregation and prion-like propagation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn). Irisin is an exercise-induced myokine that regulates energy metabolism and exerts protective effects in PD by reducing \u03b1-syn pathology. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of irisin are not fully understood. Here, we show that irisin inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation and promotes autophagy in cultured cells. Additionally, irisin alleviates oxidative stress and reduces cell apoptosis induced by \u03b1-syn fibrils. In a PD mouse model induced by intrastriatal injection of \u03b1-syn fibrils, irisin mitigated \u03b1-syn aggregation, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. These observations suggest that irisin functions as a protective mediator against \u03b1-syn pathology in PD and that irisin may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Akinetic crisis (AC) is a severe, potentially life-threatening condition affecting individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Similar to neuroleptic malignant syndrome, AC is characterized by a rapid worsening of motor symptoms, including bradykinesia, rigidity, and dysphagia. Additional symptoms may include hyperthermia and autonomic dysfunction. Large-scale prospective studies indicate that the incidence of AC among PD patients ranges from 3.1\u202f% to 3.9\u202f%. In our department, we recorded nine episodes of AC in seven out of 44 patients treated with Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG) since 2011. This incidence rate is notably higher than the figures reported in larger studies. No significant differences were observed between our patients and those in previous studies, except for mean disease duration. Therefore, LCIG therapy may be linked to a higher incidence of AC. Notably, one of our patients with a parkin gene mutation experienced AC three times. This aligns with previous findings that genetic PD, particularly with parkin mutations, is associated with a higher risk of AC, especially recurrent episodes. Further research is necessary to definitively establish a link between LCIG treatment and AC. Large-scale prospective studies are needed to assess the potential increased risk of this serious complication, which can significantly impact morbidity and mortality in advanced PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have investigated early predictors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, evidence is sparse regarding specific and common predictors for these diseases. We aimed to identify medication use, health conditions, and blood biomarkers that might be associated with the risk of AD, PD, and ALS ten years later.\nWe conducted population-based nested case-control studies of AD, PD, and ALS using electronic medical records in Europe (France, the UK, and Sweden) and Australia. We retrieved data on medication use, diagnosed health conditions, and measured blood biomarkers from electronic medical records or biomedical cohorts. Conditional logistic regression models and meta-analysis were applied to assess the associations between these factors and the risk of receiving a diagnosis of AD, PD, or ALS.\nWe included a total of 149,642 AD cases (mean age: 79.1-81.2 years), 252,696 PD cases (73.2-75.9 years), and 27,533 ALS cases (64.4-69.6 years). The prescription of psychoanaleptics and nasal preparations was consistently associated with an increased risk of AD, PD, and ALS 5-10 years later. Constipation and use of related medications were associated with an increased risk of AD and PD, while diabetes and use of antidiabetics were associated with a reduced risk of ALS. A higher level of triglycerides was associated with a lower risk of AD, whereas a higher level of Apolipoprotein B was associated with a lower risk of PD, 5-10 years later.\nPsychoanaleptics and nasal preparations may serve as common predictors for diagnosis of AD, PD, and ALS 5-10 years later. Conversely, the increased prevalence of constipation is specific to AD and PD, while the decreased prevalence of diabetes and use of antidiabetics is specific to ALS.\nEU Joint Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FoG) is one of the most disabling symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD). Detecting and monitoring episodes of FoG are important in the medical follow-up of patients to assess disease progression and functional impact and to adjust treatment accordingly. Although several questionnaires exist, they lack objectivity. Using wearable sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) to detect FoG episodes offers greater objectivity and accuracy. There is no consensus on the number and location of IMU, type of algorithm, and method of triggering and scoring the FoG episodes.\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the use of multiple wearable sensors sets to detect FoG in patients with PD during various walking tasks under different medication conditions.\nThis single-center, prospective cohort study (DetectFoG) will include 18 patients with PD. Patients will be fitted with 7 IMUs and will walk a freezing-provoking path under different tasks-\"single task,\" \"dual motor task,\" or \"dual cognitive task\"-and medical conditions corresponding to levodopa medication (\"on\" or \"off\"). Passages will be videotaped, and 2 movement disorder specialists will identify FoG episodes in the videos. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the most effective combination of wearable sensors for detecting FoG episodes will be studied.\nThe study is currently in the data collection phase, having commenced recruitment in February 2024. Once all data have been gathered, the data analysis will commence. As of August 2024, 3 patients have been recruited. It is anticipated that the results will be published by the end of 2025.\nDetecting FoG episodes in various medical and clinical settings would provide a more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. Furthermore, it would enable reliable and objective monitoring of the progression of this symptom based on treatments and the natural course of the disease. This could serve as an objective tool for monitoring patients and assessing the severity and frequency of FoG.\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT05822258; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05822258.\nDERR1-10.2196/58612.",

    "abstract": "Gait dysfunction in people with Parkinson disease (PwPD) is common and debilitating. Internal cues (ie, mental singing) may provide a useful alternative to external cueing (ie, listening to music) to improve walking for PwPD. In this study, we individually tailored cues to each participant by allowing them to choose their own cue song and by selecting the cue rate that elicited the longest strides.\nFifty-six participants (28 controls and 28 PwPD) performed walking trials in a single-session, cross-sectional study. Initially, uncued trials were compared with cued conditions in which participants walked to music or while they mentally sang at 4 randomized cue rates (90%, 100%, 110%, and 120% of uncued walking cadence). Participants chose their songs from a curated catalog. Cues were optimized according to longest stride lengths as measured by APDM wearable sensors. Repeated measures Analysis of Variance assessed differences between gait characteristics (velocity, cadence, and stride length) and gait variabilities (coefficients of variations) across conditions and groups.\nBoth cue types improved velocity, cadence, and stride length as compared to uncued walking. Internal cues were most beneficial to gait variability. The majority of participants exhibited the longest strides and fastest velocities at the highest cue rate of 120%, though a cue rate of 110% was most beneficial to gait variability.\nThis study shows how internal and external cues personalized by song choice and cue rate may be tailored to individuals. The information gained may help tailor cues to optimize gait performance for older adults and PwPD.\nfor more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A518 ).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease and is difficult to treat due to its elusive mechanisms. Recent studies have identified a striking association between oligodendrocytes and PD progression, yet how oligodendrocytes regulate the pathogenesis of PD is still unknown. Here, we show that G-protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) is upregulated in oligodendrocytes of the substantia nigra and that prosaposin (PSAP) secretion is increased in parkinsonian mice. The released PSAP can induce interleukin (IL)-6 upregulation and secretion from oligodendrocytes via a GPR37-dependent pathway, resulting in enhanced neuroinflammation, dopamine neuron degeneration, and behavioral deficits. GPR37 deficiency in oligodendrocytes prevents neurodegeneration in multiple PD models. Finally, the hallmarks of the PSAP-GPR37-IL-6 axis are observed in patients with PD. Thus, our results reveal that dopaminergic neurons interact with oligodendrocytes via secreted PSAP, and our findings identify the PSAP-GPR37-IL-6 axis as a driver of PD pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target that might alleviate PD progression in patients.",

    "abstract": "The complex and heterogeneous nature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still not fully understood, however, increasing evidence supports mitochondrial impairment as a major driver of neurodegeneration. Miro1, a mitochondrial GTPase encoded by the RHOT1 gene, is involved in mitochondrial transport, mitophagy and mitochondrial calcium buffering, and is therefore essential for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Recently, Miro1 has been linked genetically and pathophysiologically to PD, further supported by the identification of heterozygous variants of Miro1 in patients. Herein, we used patient-derived cellular models alongside knock-in mice to investigate Miro1-dependent pathophysiological processes and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in PD. Experimental work performed in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived models, including midbrain organoids and dopaminergic neuronal cell cultures from a PD patient carrying the p.R272Q Miro1 mutation as well as healthy and isogenic controls, indicated that the p.R272Q Miro1 mutation leads to increased oxidative stress, disrupted mitochondrial bioenergetics and altered cellular metabolism. This was accompanied by increased \u03b1-synuclein levels and a significant reduction of dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, the p.R272Q Miro1 mutation - located in the calcium-binding domain of the GTPase - disrupted calcium homeostasis. This resulted in the calcium-dependent activation of calpain proteases and the subsequent cleavage of \u03b1-synuclein. Knock-in mice expressing p.R285Q Miro1 (the orthologue of the human p.R272Q mutation) displayed accumulation of phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein in the striatum and a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, accompanied by behavioral alterations. These findings demonstrate that mutant Miro1 is sufficient to comprehensively model PD-relevant phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, reinforcing its pivotal role in PD pathogenesis.",

Patients underwent ratings with the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), [\nAll patients completed the study. Three patients reported loose stool. No serious adverse events related to treatment were reported. MDS-UPDRS-Total scores improved by 6.9 points. Very low levels of montelukast were detected in all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and resulted in a reduction in inflammation/metabolism markers.

    "abstract": "Dopamine replacement therapy is the backbone of Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment. However, long-term levodopa (L-DOPA) administration can lead to the severely disabling motor complication L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), for which standard, effective therapy is currently lacking. This study was conducted to characterize the distinct neural electrophysiological patterns involved in the progression of PD and to examine the efficacy of tetrabenazine, a vesicular monoamine transporter-2 inhibitor, in alleviating dyskinesia and its underlying electrophysiological mechanism.\nElectrophysiological analysis was performed to obtain power spectrum density and functional connectivity information from local field potential (LFP) data recorded from the primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) during different pathological states in PD model rats. Behavioral tests and abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) scoring were conducted to confirm PD model establishment and assess LID severity.\nIncreased beta oscillations and abnormally strengthened beta causality in the M1\u2009\u2192\u2009DLS direction and exaggerated beta-band M1-DLS functional connectivity were observed in the PD state. L-DOPA administration suppressed beta activity and augmented gamma power in the M1 and DLS, with increased gamma causality in the M1\u2009\u2192\u2009DLS direction and beta causality in the DLS\u2009\u2192\u2009M1 direction, as well as elevated gamma-band M1-DLS functional connectivity. Tetrabenazine strongly ameliorated dyskinetic manifestations. It suppressed gamma power in the M1 and DLS, reduced gamma causality and increased beta causality in the M1\u2009\u2192\u2009DLS direction, reduced beta causality in the DLS\u2009\u2192\u2009M1 direction, and reduced gamma-band M1-DLS functional connectivity.\nTetrabenazine abrogated aberrant gamma activity to improve LID symptoms, which provides compelling evidence for its future clinical application in LID therapy.",

L-DOPA administration suppressed beta activity and augmented gamma power in the M1 and DLS, with increased gamma causality in the M1\u2009\u2192\u2009DLS direction and beta causality in the DLS\u2009\u2192\u2009M1 direction, as well as elevated gamma-band M1-DLS functional connectivity. Tetrabenazine strongly ameliorated dyskinetic manifestations. It suppressed gamma power in the M1 and DLS, reduced gamma causality and increased beta causality in the M1\u2009\u2192\u2009DLS direction, reduced beta causality in the DLS\u2009\u2192\u2009M1 direction, and reduced gamma-band M1-DLS functional connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that destroys substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, causing tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. Current treatment approaches primarily focus on symptom management, employing pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and surgical methods. However, these treatments often result in fluctuating symptoms, side effects, and disease progression. Here, the authors have reviewed the emerging field of nanomedicine as a promising path for Parkinson's disease treatment, emphasizing its potential to overcome the limitations of traditional therapies. Nanomedicine utilizes nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery, leveraging their small size and high surface area to volume ratio to cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver therapeutic agents directly to affected brain regions. Various nanoparticles, including lipid-based, polymeric, metallic, and carbon-based, have shown potential in Parkinson's disease treatment. Additionally, nanocarrier systems like liposomes, nanogels, dendrimers, and solid lipid nanoparticles offer controlled and sustained release of therapeutic agents, enhancing their bioavailability and reducing side effects. This review provides insights into the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, highlighting the mechanisms of neurodegeneration, the role of alpha-synuclein, and the disruption of dopaminergic pathways. It further discusses the application of gene therapy in conjunction with nanomedicine for targeted therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorder. Despite its recognized significance, there remains a paucity of recent studies reporting treatment utilization and the economic impact of PD in a real-world setting, especially in Canada. This study aimed to analyze real-world treatment patterns and health care resource utilization (HCRU) of patients with PD in Quebec, Canada.\nThis was a retrospective observational study using data between 2010-2019 from the R\u00e9gie de l'assurance maladie du Qu\u00e9bec (RAMQ) databases. Patients with PD were compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Treatment adherence and persistence were measured over 24\u00a0months. All-cause and PD-related HCRU and costs were characterized on an annual basis.\nOverall, 303 PD patients and 909 age- and sex-matched controls were selected. Adherence rates were high (\u226585\u00a0%) among all drug classes, but lower with dopamine agonists. Persistence to PD treatment declined over time, with nearly 50\u00a0% discontinuation rates at 24\u00a0months in all PD drug classes, except the levodopa class (discontinuation rate: 20.4\u00a0%). PD patients had a significantly higher total costs per year than the matched control group ($17,405 vs. $6,431), mainly driven by higher inpatient costs.\nMany pharmacological options exist for PD patients and, though patients are adherent while on therapy, treatment discontinuation rates are high. This suggests potential long-term challenges in PD management, especially since PD continues to place a substantial burden on the health care system. This study underscores the need for enhanced therapeutic strategies, particularly for patients inadequately controlled with standard therapies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) affects more than one million people in the EU. It currently has no definitive cure, meaning that patients rely only on symptomatic treatments, which themselves are burdened by side effects. The need for advancements in both knowledge and available treatments is thus strongly felt by patients, caregivers, and health operators. This unmet need sparked the idea of orchestrating a collaborative effort via a common network - IMMUPARKNET (The role of IMMUnity in tackling PARKinson's disease through a Translational NETwork). The IMMUPARKNET COST Action focuses on challenges in PD and its related crosstalk with immune response. Although widely recognized, the role of immunity in the onset and development of PD is still unclear. The main goal of IMMUPARKNET is to fill this knowledge gap by establishing an innovative, interdisciplinary research network and fostering exchanges of expertise among specialists from different countries and institutions. As we gather scientists and clinicians who study immunity in PD and related fields, IMMUPARKNET will establish the first nucleus of a multidisciplinary ecosystem that aims to harmonize efforts and approaches, both in research and clinical practice, to boost the development of ground-breaking treatments for PD. Through meetings, training schools, webinars, position papers, and review manuscripts, IMMUPARKNET will lead fruitful exchanges of know-how among experts in the field. The IMMUPARKNET structure revolves around 5 working groups, with a total of 157 active members from 34 different countries. Of these active members, 58.5% are young researchers, while 67.5% come from Inclusiveness Target Countries (ITC - less research-intensive COST Members; https://www.cost.eu/about/members/). IMMUPARKNET output will facilitate the improved sharing and development of research resources, straightening the road to novel treatments and identifying where existing ones can be repurposed, all, ultimately and hopefully, finding a cure for PD.\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) affects more than one million people in the EU.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) involves the disruption of brain energy homeostasis. This encompasses broad-impact factors such as mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired glycolysis, and other metabolic disturbances, like disruptions in the pentose phosphate pathway and purine metabolism. Cortical hubs, which are highly connected regions essential for coordinating multiple brain functions, require significant energy due to their dense synaptic activity and long-range connections. Deficits in ATP production in PD can severely impair these hubs. The energy imbalance also affects subcortical regions, including the massive axonal arbors in the striatum of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons, due to their high metabolic demand. This ATP decline may result in ",

A randomized clinical trial with pretest and posttest measurements involved 90 participants referred to Roozbeh Hospital in Tehran in 2023, who were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n = 45) or a control group (n = 45). The experimental group underwent a 3-month CBT intervention comprising 12 sessions of 90 minutes each. Both groups completed the Beck Depression Inventory and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire preintervention and postintervention. Data analysis via multivariate analysis of covariance using SPSS-25 revealed significant improvements in reducing depression and enhancing quality of life in the experimental group compared with the control group (p \u2264 0.01). These findings indicate that CBT is an effective treatment for reducing depression and improving the quality of life of individuals with Parkinson disease, demonstrating its clinical applicability in therapeutic settings.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a debilitating and the second most common neurodegenerative disorder with a high prevalence. Parkinson's disease has a multifaceted etiology characterized by an altered redox state and an excessive inflammatory response. In this study, we investigated the potential neuroprotective properties of carvacrol in a haloperidol-induced Parkinson's model. In female Sprague-Dawley rats, the animal Parkinson model was induced by intraperitoneally administering 1\u00a0mg / kg of haloperidol once daily for fifteen days. Carvacrol was administered at a dose of 25 and 50\u00a0mg / kg once daily for fifteen days before haloperidol administration. In order to further illustrate the vital role of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) pathway, we administered 50\u00a0mg / kg of the TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor thalidomide once daily for 15 days.\nOur results showed that haloperidol-induced motor deficits, changed endogenous antioxidant enzymes, along with higher levels of inflammasome (NLRP3) and other inflammatory mediators. Moreover, increased levels of lipid peroxidase (LPO) indicated a significant rise in oxidative stress due to haloperidol. Moreover, carvacrol reduced these effects by preventing pyroptosis mediated by the inflammasome (NLRP3) and TNF-\u03b1. The administration of thalidomide mitigated oxidative stress and suppresses inflammatory pathways through the augmentation of the intrinsic antioxidant system. Further, co-treatment of carvacrol with thalidomide synergized the neuroprotective effect of carvacrol as demonstrated by various immunoassays and histology analyses.\nTaken together, our findings suggest that carvacrol mitigated haloperidol-induced Parkinson-like symptoms, partially through the downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and NLRP3.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disease resulting from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. Familial and sporadic forms of the disease have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Pathology has been identified with mutations in the PARK6 gene encoding PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), a quality control protein in the mitochondria. Disease-associated mutations at the transmembrane (TM) region of PINK1 protein were predicted to disrupt the cleavage of the TM region by the PARL (presenilin-associated rhomboid-like) protease at the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here, using microscopy, kinetic analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations, we analyzed three Parkinson's disease-associated TM mutations; PINK1-C92F, PINK1-R98W, and PINK1-I111S, and found that mitochondrial localization and cleavage by the PARL protease were not significantly impaired. However, clearance of hydrolyzed PINK1-R98W appears to be compromised because of altered positioning of the protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane, preventing association with translocase of the outer membrane complexes and slowing cleavage by PARL. This single amino acid change slows degradation of proteolyzed PINK1, increasing its accumulation at the outer mitochondrial membrane and resulting in increased mitophagy and decreased mitochondrial content among these cells.",

    "abstract": "The role of environmental contaminants in causing Parkinson's disease (PD) is well known, with rotenone and paraquat being the notable neurotoxins. Traces of the metalloid arsenic are frequently found in drinking water which is considered a threat to the brain's health. Pre-clinical and epidemiological studies have associated arsenic with PD whereby behavioral and neurochemical alterations were observed. However, the impact of arsenic toxicity on the dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra (SN), the hallmark region which degenerates in PD, has not been shown yet. In the present study, administration of 20\u00a0mg/kg b.w., arsenic for 28\u00a0days caused significant loss of dopaminergic neurons and their terminals respectively in the SN and striatum regions of mice brain. Moreover, the arsenic-fed rodents exhibited depleted striatal dopamine, prolonged latency to move and correct posture, and reduced exploratory behavior and neurological severity. Further, mitochondrial complexes II and IV were found to be inhibited in the SN, cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of arsenic-fed mice. Additionally, inflammatory marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expressed in glial cells and neurons respectively were enhanced in the nigrostriatal pathway of arsenic-fed animals. The present study for the first time reports that arsenic causes Parkinsonism by degenerating nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons through mitochondrial complex inhibition and inflammatory stress. The study further puts forward validatory evidence for the potential of arsenic in causing PD and the reliability of the arsenic-induced PD model for exploring the disease pathogenesis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the subthalamic nucleus (STN) function and deep brain stimulation (DBS) effects on single-unit activity (SUA) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with dysarthria.\nAfter presurgical speech analysis, we recorded STN neuronal activities while PD patients (n\u00a0=\u00a016) articulated Chinese Pinyin consonants. The Pinyin consonants were categorized by the manner and place of articulation for SUA cluster analysis. The cohort was then divided into normal articulation and dysarthria groups based on diadochokinetic (DDK) assessments. The STN SUA patterns, represented by the mean firing rate (FR), peak time, and response intensity during articulation, were analyzed and compared between the two groups. Finally, a stimulation cohort of 7 PD patients was included to test articulation and SUA pattern changes following intraoperative DBS.\nClustering analysis of STN neuronal firing patterns demonstrated that neurons encode articulation by grouping consonants with the same manner of articulation into distinct clusters. Using k-means clustering, we further classified SUAs into two waveform types: negative spikes (type 1) and positive spikes (type 2). Dysarthria patients exhibited an increased mean FR of type 1 spikes and a reduced response intensity of type 2 spikes. During intraoperative stimulation, PD patients showed accelerated DDK, accompanied by a decrease in type 1 mean FR and an increase in type 2 mean FR.\nOur findings indicate the crucial role of the STN in consonant encoding and dysarthria at the single-unit level. Both SUA firing patterns in the STN and DDK performance can be modulated by DBS.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves motor functions in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) but may cause a decline in specific cognitive domains including executive processes and language. The aim of this study was to derive standardized regression-based (SRB) reliable change indices (RCIs) in an Italian cohort of Parkinson's patients undergoing STN-DBS to detect clinically meaningful variations in verbal fluency (VF) one year after surgery define.\nBefore (T0) and 12 months after (T1) surgery, 36 PD patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS were evaluated with the Alternate Verbal Fluency Battery (AVFB), including phonemic (PVF), semantic (SVF) and alternate VF tests (AVF) and a composite shifting index (CSI). At T0, motor status was assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III (UPDRS-III) and L-dopa equivalent daily dose was recorded.\nGroup-level declines were limited to PVF and SVF scores. Applications of these RCIs revealed idiosyncratic patterns of longitudinal trends that differed from those at the group level. Indeed, when looking at individual performances, no clustered pattern of decline or improvement could be visibly detected. The UPDRS-III predicted T1 AVF and CSI scores.\nOur study provides Italian practitioners and researchers with SRB-RCIs to detect meaningful differences in the VF performance of PD patients undergoing STN-DBS one year after surgery. Variables associated with postoperative cognitive changes can be used in future studies to develop multivariable predictive models to support clinical decision making and patient counselling.",
