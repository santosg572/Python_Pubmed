    "abstract": "We introduce FSL-MRS, an end-to-end, modular, open-source MRS analysis toolbox. It provides spectroscopic data conversion, preprocessing, spectral simulation, fitting, quantitation, and visualization.\nThe FSL-MRS package is modular. Its programs operate on data in a standard format (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative [NIfTI]) capable of storing single-voxel and multivoxel spectroscopy, including spatial orientation information. The FSL-MRS toolbox includes tools for preprocessing of raw spectroscopy data, including coil combination, frequency and phase alignment, and filtering. A density matrix simulation program is supplied for generation of basis spectra from simple text-based descriptions of pulse sequences. Fitting is based on linear combination of basis spectra and implements Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization for the estimation of the full posterior distribution of metabolite concentrations. Validation of the fitting is carried out on independently created simulated data, phantom data, and three in vivo human data sets (257 single-voxel spectroscopy and 8 MRSI data sets) at 3 T and 7 T. Interactive HTML reports are automatically generated by processing and fitting stages of the toolbox. The FSL-MRS package can be used on the command line or interactively in the Python language.\nValidation of the fitting shows low error in simulation (median error of 11.9%) and in phantom (3.4%). Average correlation between a third-party toolbox (LCModel) and FSL-MRS was high (0.53-0.81) in all three in vivo data sets.\nThe FSL-MRS toolbox is designed to be flexible and extensible to new forms of spectroscopic acquisitions. Custom fitting models can be specified within the framework for dynamic or multivoxel spectroscopy. It is available as part of the FMRIB Software Library.",

    "abstract": "There are instances in which an estimate of the brain volume should be obtained from MRI in clinical practice. Our objective is to calculate cross-sectional robustness of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based software (Entelai Pic) for brain volume estimation and compare it to traditional software such as FreeSurfer, CAT12 and FSL in healthy controls (HC).\nSixteen HC were scanned four times, two different days on two different MRI scanners (1.5\u202fT and 3\u202fT). Volumetric T1-weighted images were acquired and post-processed with FreeSurfer v6.0.0, Entelai Pic v2, CAT12 v12.5 and FSL v5.0.9. Whole-brain, grey matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes were calculated. Correlation and agreement between methods was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland Altman plots. Robustness was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV).\nWhole-brain volume estimation had better correlation between FreeSurfer and Entelai Pic (ICC (95% CI) 0.96 (0.94-0.97)) than FreeSurfer and CAT12 (0.92 (0.88-0.96)) and FSL (0.87 (0.79-0.91)). WM, GM and CSF showed a similar trend. Compared to FreeSurfer, Entelai Pic provided similarly robust segmentations of brain volumes both on same-scanner (mean CV 1.07, range 0.20-3.13% vs. mean CV 1.05, range 0.21-3.20%, p\u202f=\u202f0.86) and on different-scanner variables (mean CV 3.84, range 2.49-5.91% vs. mean CV 3.84, range 2.62-5.13%, p\u202f=\u202f0.96). Mean post-processing times were 480, 5, 40 and 5\u202fmin for FreeSurfer, Entelai Pic, CAT12 and FSL respectively.\nBased on robustness and processing times, our CNN-based model is suitable for cross-sectional volumetry on clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Brain extraction represents an important step in numerous neuroimaging analyses. The brain extraction tool (BET)2 is a widely used deformable model-based approach for extraction of intracranial volume (ICV). The aim of this study is to estimate the ICV extraction accuracy using synthetic MR(SyMRI) method and BET2 in healthy adult participants and patients with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS), including infants. 'Quantification of relaxation times and proton density by multi-echo acquisition of saturation recovery with turbo-spin-echo readout' (QRAPMASTER) with a 3.0\u00a0T magnetic resonance image (MRI) system was used for data acquisition. Statistical evaluations were performed with linear regression analysis and the Jaccard similarity coefficient (J). ICV extraction accuracy with synthetic MR method is found to be higher than BET2, for both aged healthy participants and SWS.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a common comorbid condition in Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients with depression have a two-fold increased risk to develop PD. Further, depression symptoms often precede motor symptoms in PD and are frequent at all stages of the disease. However, the influence of a depressive state on the responses to antiparkinson treatments is largely unknown. In this study, the genetically inbred depression-like flinders sensitive line (FSL) rats and control flinders resistant line (FRL) rats were studied in models of experimental parkinsonism. FSL rats showed a potentiated tremorgenic response to tacrine, a cholinesterase inhibitor used experimentally to induce 6 Hz resting tremor reminiscent of parkinsonian tremor. We also studied rats lesioned with 6-OHDA to induce hemiparkinsonism. No baseline differences in dopaminergic response to acute apomorphine or L-DOPA was found. However, following chronic treatment with L-DOPA, FRL rats developed sensitization of turning and abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs); these effects were counteracted by the anti-dyskinetic 5-HT",

    "abstract": "MUC1 is an attractive target for cancer vaccines as a result of its over-expression and aberrant glycosylation pattern on many tumor cells. However, the low immunogenicity of MUC1 and immune tolerance have limited its application. Herein, we designed MUC1-based tricomponent antitumor vaccines adjuvanted with fibroblast stimulating lipopeptide 1 (FSL-1). Immunological results indicate that the glycosylated tricomponent vaccine candidate has elicited both humoral and cellular immune responses. The induced antibodies could effectively bind to MCF-7. Furthermore, the vaccine exhibited an obvious reduction in tumour burden.",

    "abstract": "Protein antigens are, in general, weakly immunogenic, and therefore require co-delivery with adjuvants to stimulate potent immune responses. The fusion of (poly)peptide antigens to immunostimulatory adjuvants (e.g. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists) has been demonstrated to greatly improve vaccine potency compared to mixtures of antigen and adjuvant. Chemical approaches, to enable the rapid, site-specific and high-yielding linkage of TLR2 ligands to recombinant protein antigens, have been previously optimized. These approaches require the use of denaturing conditions to ensure high reaction yields, which limits their application, as maintenance of native protein folding is necessary to elicit antibodies against conformational epitopes. Here, this work aimed to optimize an alternative method, to ensure the efficient bioconjugation of TLR2 ligands onto folded protein antigens. An enzyme-mediated approach, using Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (or a penta mutant with enhanced efficiency), was optimized for reaction yield and time, as well as enzyme type and amount. This approach enabled the site-specific conjugation of the TLR2-agonist fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 (FSL-1) onto a model group A Streptococcus (GAS) recombinant polytope antigen under conditions that maintain protein folding, yielding a homogeneous, molecularly-defined product, with ligation yields as high as 90%. Following intramuscular (IM) administration of the ligation product to humanized plasminogen AlbPLG1 mice, high-titer, antigen-specific IgG antibodies were observed, which conferred protection against subcutaneous challenge with GAS strain 5448. In comparison, mixtures of the GAS antigen with aluminum hydroxide or FSL-1 failed to provide protection, with the FSL-1 mixture yielding ~1000-fold lower antigen-specific IgG antibody titers, and the mixture with alum yielding a Th2-biased response compared to the more balanced Th1/Th2 responses observed with the FSL-1 conjugate. Overall, a FSL-1 bioconjugation method for the efficient production of antigen-TLR2 agonist conjugates, which maintain protein folding, was produced, with broad utility for the development of self-adjuvanting vaccines against subunit protein antigens.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma infection can cause many diseases in pigs, resulting in great economic losses in pork production. Innate immune responses are thought to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of mycoplasma disease. However, the molecular events involved in immune responses remain to be determined. Hence, the object of this study was to use RNA-Seq to investigate the gene expression profiles of the innate immune response mediated by FSL-1 in pig monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). The results revealed that 1442 genes were differentially expressed in the FSL-1 group compared with the control groups, of which 777 genes were upregulated and 665 genes were downregulated. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the upregulated genes were mainly involved in innate immune-related pathways including the TNF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. The downregulated genes were only involved in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Our results showed that FSL-1 stimulation activated the TLR2 signaling pathway and resulted in diverse inflammatory responses. FSL-1 induced the transcription of numerous protein-coding genes involved in a complex network of innate immune-related pathways. We speculate that TNF, IL1B, IL6, NFKB1, NFKBIA, CXCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5 were the most likely hub genes that play important roles in the above pathways. This study identified the differentially expressed genes and their related signaling pathways, contributing to the comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying host-pathogen interactions during mycoplasma infection and providing a reference model for further studies.",

    "abstract": "P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) are ligand-gated ion channels activated by adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), which are involved in processes that are dysfunctional in stress response and depression, such as neurotransmitter release, and neuroimmune response. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the P2X7R induce antidepressant-like effects in animals exposed to stress. However, the effect of P2X7R antagonism in an animal model of depression based on selective breeding has not previously been studied, and the mechanism underling the antidepressant-like effect induced by the P2X7R blockade remains unknown.\nThe present study aimed to: (1) determine whether P2X7R blockade induces antidepressant-like effects in the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats and, (2) investigate whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling in the frontal cortex and hippocampus is involved in this effect.\nFSL and the control Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats were treated with vehicle or the P2X7R antagonist A-804598 (3, 10 or 30\u2009mg/Kg/day) for 1 or 7 days before being exposed to the forced swim test (FST). After the behavioural test, animals were decapitated, their brains were removed and the frontal cortex, ventral and dorsal hippocampus were dissected for BDNF signalling analysis.\nWe found that repeated treatment with A-804598 (30\u2009mg/Kg) reduced the immobility time in the FST and activated the BDNF signalling in the ventral hippocampus of FSL rats.\nP2X7R blockade induces an antidepressant-like effect associated with increased levels of BDNF-AKT-p70 S6 kinase in the ventral hippocampus, which may be mediated by tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) receptor activation supporting the notion of P2X7R antagonism as a potential new antidepressant strategy.",

    "abstract": "To understand the risk of hypoglycaemia during Ramadan fasting by use of CGM, as well as to observe the Glycemic control and renal functions in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease stage 3 (CKD-3).\nA prospective interventional study conducted in the Dubai Hospital, a tertiary care centre in the United Arab Emirates, during the month of Ramadan 1437 AH (Hijri), which corresponded to June 6th till July 5th, 2016. 25 patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 3) were included in the study, who intended to fast during Ramadan. The aim was to observe the serum glucose level through 24\u202fh FreeStyle Libre flash continuous glucose monitor (FSL-CGM). Most patients had three sensors during the study, covering an average three weeks during Ramadan and three weeks outside Ramadan (Sha'ban and shawal). We also monitored the change in, BP, HBA1c, kidney functions and BMI before and after Ramadan.\nThis study included 25 adults with a mean age of 60 (\u00b114\u202fyears). Fasting Ramadan did not result in any significant change in biophysical and biochemical profile of these patients. Data from FSL-CGM showed significantly longer duration (101.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f119.1 Vs. 45.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f47.6\u202fmin, p\u202f<\u202f0.033) and more frequent hypoglycemic episodes (4.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.7 Vs. 2.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.0, p\u202f<\u202f0.047) during Ramadan compared tonon-Ramadan respectively. The mean blood glucose readings were also significantly lower (70.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f29.3 Vs.93.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f57.9\u202fmg/dl p\u202f<\u202f0.011) during Ramadan compared to non -fasting period.

    "abstract": "Most of Muslims patients with diabetes and Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) elect to fast in Ramadan, but the actual risk in this subset of patients with diabetes is largely unknown. We aimed to understand the safety of fasting in CHD patients with diabetes insisting on fasting Ramadan under optimal care. We also monitored the change in biophysical and biochemical parameters of these patients before and after Ramadan. We conducted this prospective study in a tertiary care hospital in Dubai during Ramadan 2016, (June 6th till July 5th).\n21 Patients with T2DM with stable known CHD during the three months prior to study and insisted on fasting despite advice against it were recruited for the study. All patients received continuous glucose monitoring with free style libre monitoring device (FSL-CGM) during and outside Ramadan period. We recorded DM or CVD-related emergency visit or hospitalisation, change in BMI, systolic and diastolic BP, lipids profile, e-GFR, HBA1c, and frequency of hypoglycemia during Ramadan fasting and not -fasting period.\nThis is first study using CGM in CHD patients with diabetes who observe fast in Ramadan. Patients had a significantly higher incidence (3.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.8 vs 1.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.6 episodes, p\u202f=\u202f0.033) and prolonged duration of hypoglycemia (117.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f87.2, 49.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f59.1\u202fmin p 0.022) during fasting compared to non-fasting respectively. No significant alteration was seen in BMI, SBP and DBP, lipid profile and renal function. There is a significant improvement in HBA1c during Ramadan.\nWe could not associate any adverse cardiovascular effects with fasting Ramadan in patients with stable CHD under optimal diabetes care. FSL-CGMS data showed higher frequency of hypoglycemia during Ramadan fasting. Studies with larger sample size are needed for further validation of these findings.",

    "abstract": "To compare the cross-sectional robustness of commonly used volumetric software and effects of lesion filling in multiple sclerosis (MS).\nNine MS patients (six females; age 38\u00b113 years, disease duration 7.3\u00b15.2 years) were scanned twice with repositioning on three MRI scanners (Siemens Aera 1.5T, Avanto 1.5T, Trio 3.0T) the same day. Volumetric T\nVariability in volumetrics was lower within than between scanners (CoV 0.17-0.96% vs. 0.65-5.0%, p<0.001). All software provided similarly robust segmentations of the brain volume on the same scanner (CoV 0.17-0.28%, p=0.076). Normalisation improved inter-scanner reproducibility in FreeSurfer and SPM-based methods, but the FSL-SIENAX scaling factor did not improve robustness. Generally, SPM-based methods produced the most consistent volumetrics, while FreeSurfer was more robust for WM volumes on different scanners. FreeSurfer had more robust normalised brain and GM volumes on different scanners than FSL-SIENAX (p=0.004). MS lesion filling changed the output of FSL-SIENAX, SPM and SPM-CAT but not FreeSurfer.\nConsistent use of the same scanner is essential and normalisation to the intracranial volume is recommended for multiple scanners. Based on robustness, SPM-based methods are particularly suitable for cross-sectional volumetry. FreeSurfer poses a suitable alternative with WM segmentations less sensitive to MS lesions.\n\u2022 The same scanner should be used for brain volumetry. If different scanners are used, the intracranial volume normalisation improves the FreeSurfer and SPM robustness (but not the FSL scaling factor). \u2022 FreeSurfer, FSL and SPM all provide robust measures of the whole brain volume on the same MRI scanner. SPM-based methods overall provide the most robust segmentations (except white matter segmentations on different scanners where FreeSurfer is more robust). \u2022 MS lesion filling with Lesion Segmentation Toolbox changes the output of FSL-SIENAX and SPM. FreeSurfer output is not affected by MS lesion filling since it already takes white matter hypointensities into account and is therefore particularly suitable for MS brain volumetry.",

    "results": "Variability in volumetrics was lower within than between scanners (CoV 0.17-0.96% vs. 0.65-5.0%, p<0.001). All software provided similarly robust segmentations of the brain volume on the same scanner (CoV 0.17-0.28%, p=0.076). Normalisation improved inter-scanner reproducibility in FreeSurfer and SPM-based methods, but the FSL-SIENAX scaling factor did not improve robustness. Generally, SPM-based methods produced the most consistent volumetrics, while FreeSurfer was more robust for WM volumes on different scanners. FreeSurfer had more robust normalised brain and GM volumes on different scanners than FSL-SIENAX (p=0.004). MS lesion filling changed the output of FSL-SIENAX, SPM and SPM-CAT but not FreeSurfer.",
