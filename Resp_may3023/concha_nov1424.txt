    "abstract": "Drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has been associated with hippocampal pathology. Most surgical treatment strategies, including resection and responsive neurostimulation (RNS), focus on this disease epicenter; however, imaging alterations distant from the hippocampus, as well as emerging data from responsive neurostimulation trials, suggest conceptualizing TLE as a network disorder.\nTo assess whether brain networks connected to areas of atrophy in the hippocampus align with the topography of distant neuroimaging alterations and RNS response.\nThis retrospective case-control study was conducted between July 2009 and June 2022. Data collection for this multicenter, population-based study took place across 4 tertiary referral centers in Montr\u00e9al, Canada; Quer\u00e9taro, M\u00e9xico; Nanjing, China; and Salt Lake City, Utah. Eligible patients were diagnosed with TLE according to International League Against Epilepsy criteria and received either neuroimaging or neuroimaging and RNS to the hippocampus. Patients with encephalitis, traumatic brain injury, or bilateral TLE were excluded.\nSpatial alignment between brain network topographies.\nOf the 110 eligible patients, 94 individuals diagnosed with TLE were analyzed (51 [54%] female; mean [SD] age, 31.3 [10.9] years). Hippocampal thickness maps in TLE were compared to 120 healthy control individuals (66 [55%] female; mean [SD] age, 29.8 [9.5] years), and areas of atrophy were identified. Using an atlas of normative connectivity (n\u2009=\u20091000), 2 brain networks were identified that were functionally connected to areas of hippocampal atrophy. The first network was defined by positive correlations to temporolimbic, medial prefrontal, and parietal regions, whereas the second network by negative correlations to frontoparietal regions. White matter changes colocalized to the positive network (t93\u2009=\u2009-3.82; P\u2009=\u20092.44\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4). In contrast, cortical atrophy localized to the negative network (t93\u2009=\u20093.54; P\u2009=\u20096.29\u2009\u00d7\u200910-3). In an additional 38 patients (20 [53%] female; mean [SD] age, 35.8 [11.3] years) treated with RNS, connectivity between the stimulation site and atrophied regions within the negative network was associated with seizure reduction (t212\u2009=\u2009-2.74; P\u2009=\u2009.007).\nThe findings in this study indicate that distributed pathology in TLE may occur in brain networks connected to the hippocampal epicenter. Connectivity to these same networks was associated with improvement following RNS. A network approach to TLE may reveal therapeutic targets outside the traditional target in the hippocampus.",

The network architecture, called the Local Neighborhood Neural Network, is designed to use the spatial correlations of neighboring voxels for an enhanced inference while reducing parameter overhead. Our model exploits these relationships to improve the analysis of complex structures and noisy data environments. We adopt a self-supervised approach to address the lack of ground truth data, generating signals of voxel neighborhoods to integrate the training set. This eliminates the need for manual annotations and facilitates training under realistic conditions. Comparative analyses show that our method outperforms the constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) method in quantitative and qualitative validations. Using phantom images that mimic ",

    "abstract": "We determined the intersubject association between the rhythmic entrainment abilities of human subjects during a synchronization-continuation tapping task (SCT) and the macro- and microstructural properties of their superficial (SWM) and deep (DWM) white matter. Diffusion-weighted images were obtained from 32 subjects who performed the SCT with auditory or visual metronomes and five tempos ranging from 550 to 950 ms. We developed a method to determine the density of short-range fibers that run underneath the cortical mantle, interconnecting nearby cortical regions (U-fibers). Notably, individual differences in the density of U-fibers in the right audiomotor system were correlated with the degree of phase accuracy between the stimuli and taps across subjects. These correlations were specific to the synchronization epoch with auditory metronomes and tempos around 1.5 Hz. In addition, a significant association was found between phase accuracy and the density and bundle diameter of the corpus callosum (CC), forming an interval-selective map where short and long intervals were behaviorally correlated with the anterior and posterior portions of the CC. These findings suggest that the structural properties of the SWM and DWM in the audiomotor system support the tapping synchronization abilities of subjects, as cortical U-fiber density is linked to the preferred tapping tempo and the bundle properties of the CC define an interval-selective topography.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the accuracy of stereotactic coordinates to target the ansa lenticularis (AL) using 2 surgical planning methods, the conventional millimeter method (MM) and the normalized Tenths method (TM), assessed through individualized probabilistic tractography.\nStereotactic targeting of the AL was assessed in 2 groups: 16 patients with Parkinson's disease and 16 healthy controls from Group 1, and 39 Parkinson's disease patients from Group 2. Structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging probabilistic tractography identified the AL based on the Schaltenbrand-Wahren Atlas. The MM defined stereotactic coordinates in millimeters, while the TM refined the planning by dividing the intercommissural line (AC-PC) distance into 10 equal parts, normalizing the \"X,\" \"Y,\" and \"Z\" coordinates for each patient. We subsequently compared the percentage of structural connectivity (%conn) of the AL with predefined regions of interest (ROIs), including the frontopontine-corticothalamic tracts, globus pallidus internus-ventral oral anterior, and ventral oral posterior, and quantified the streamlines in 142 brain hemispheres using the MM and TM coordinates.\nDespite anatomical variations in intercommissural (AC-PC) line lengths between both groups (22.5 \u00b1 2.09\u00a0mm and 24.4 \u00b1 2.56\u00a0mm, respectively; P\u00a0= 0.002), as well as differences in magnetic resonance imaging acquisition parameters, we found that the TM significantly enhanced streamline identification and %conn compared to the MM. These enhancements were noted across ROIs: frontopontine-corticothalamic and globus pallidus internus-ventral oral anterior in both hemispheres, and globus pallidus internus-ventral oral posterior in the left (P < 0.001) and right hemispheres (P\u00a0= 0.03).\nTM surpasses MM in identifying the structural connectivity between the AL and predefined ROIs, underscoring the advantages of coordinate normalization. However, variations in AC-PC line lengths and Euclidean distances between methods could lead to inaccuracies in the coordinate settings, potentially affecting the precision of structural connectivity and the efficacy of therapeutic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common pharmaco-resistant epilepsy in adults. While primarily associated with mesiotemporal pathology, recent evidence suggests that brain alterations in TLE extend beyond the paralimbic epicenter and impact macroscale function and cognitive functions, particularly memory. Using connectome-wide manifold learning and generative models of effective connectivity, we examined functional topography and directional signal flow patterns between large-scale neural circuits in TLE at rest. Studying a multisite cohort of 95 patients with TLE and 95 healthy controls, we observed atypical functional topographies in the former group, characterized by reduced differentiation between sensory and transmodal association cortices, with most marked effects in bilateral temporo-limbic and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. These findings were consistent across all study sites, present in left and right lateralized patients, and validated in a subgroup of patients with histopathological validation of mesiotemporal sclerosis and post-surgical seizure freedom. Moreover, they were replicated in an independent cohort of 30 TLE patients and 40 healthy controls. Further analyses demonstrated that reduced differentiation related to decreased functional signal flow into and out of temporolimbic cortical systems and other brain networks. Parallel analyses of structural and diffusion-weighted MRI data revealed that topographic alterations were independent of TLE-related cortical thinning but partially mediated by white matter microstructural changes that radiated away from paralimbic circuits. Finally, we found a strong association between the degree of functional alterations and behavioral markers of memory dysfunction. Our work illustrates the complex landscape of macroscale functional imbalances in TLE, which can serve as intermediate markers bridging microstructural changes and cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is commonly associated with mesiotemporal pathology and widespread alterations of grey and white matter structures. Evidence supports a progressive condition although the temporal evolution of TLE is poorly defined. This ENIGMA-Epilepsy study utilized multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to investigate structural alterations in TLE patients across the adult lifespan. We charted both grey and white matter changes and explored the covariance of age-related alterations in both compartments.\nWe studied 769 TLE patients and 885 healthy controls across an age range of 17-73 years, from multiple international sites. To assess potentially non-linear lifespan changes in TLE, we harmonized data and combined median split assessments with cross-sectional sliding window analyses of grey and white matter age-related changes. Covariance analyses examined the coupling of grey and white matter lifespan curves.\nIn TLE, age was associated with a robust grey matter thickness/volume decline across a broad cortico-subcortical territory, extending beyond the mesiotemporal disease epicentre. White matter changes were also widespread across multiple tracts with peak effects in temporo-limbic fibers. While changes spanned the adult time window, changes accelerated in cortical thickness, subcortical volume, and fractional anisotropy (all decreased), and mean diffusivity (increased) after age 55 years. Covariance analyses revealed strong limbic associations between white matter tracts and subcortical structures with cortical regions.\nThis study highlights the profound impact of TLE on lifespan changes in grey and white matter structures, with an acceleration of aging-related processes in later decades of life. Our findings motivate future longitudinal studies across the lifespan and emphasize the importance of prompt diagnosis as well as intervention in patients.",

    "results": "In TLE, age was associated with a robust grey matter thickness/volume decline across a broad cortico-subcortical territory, extending beyond the mesiotemporal disease epicentre. White matter changes were also widespread across multiple tracts with peak effects in temporo-limbic fibers. While changes spanned the adult time window, changes accelerated in cortical thickness, subcortical volume, and fractional anisotropy (all decreased), and mean diffusivity (increased) after age 55 years. Covariance analyses revealed strong limbic associations between white matter tracts and subcortical structures with cortical regions.",

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common form of medically intractable epilepsy. Although seizures originate in mesial temporal structures, there are widespread abnormalities of gray and white matter beyond the temporal lobes that negatively impact functional networks and cognition. Previous studies have focused either on the global impact on functional networks, or on the functional correlates of specific cognitive abilities. Here, we use a two-pronged approach to evaluate the link between whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) anomalies to overall cognitive performance, and how such abnormal connectivity alters the fronto-parietal brain regions involved in working memory (WMem), a cognitive disability often reported by TLE patients. We evaluated 31 TLE patients and 35 healthy subjects through extensive cognitive testing, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), and task-based fMRI using Sternberg's task to evaluate WMem. As a group, TLE patients displayed cognitive abnormalities across different domains, although considerable within-group variability was identified. TLE patients showed disruptions of functional networks between and within the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive networks (TPN) resulting in associations with cognitive performance. Furthermore, during the WMem task, TLE patients showed abnormal activity of fronto-parietal regions that were associated with other forms of memory, and alterations of seed-based connectivity analyses. Our results show that different degrees of abnormal functional brain activity and connectivity are related to the severity of disabilities across cognitive spheres. Differential co-activation patterns between patients and healthy subjects suggest potential compensatory mechanisms to preserve adequate cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Septo-hippocampal pathway, crucial for physiological functions and involved in epilepsy. Clinical monitoring during epileptogenesis is complicated. We aim to evaluate tissue changes after lesioning the medial septum (MS) of normal rats and assess how the depletion of specific neuronal populations alters the animals' behavior and susceptibility to establishing a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected into the MS with vehicle or saporins (to deplete GABAergic or cholinergic neurons; n\u2009=\u200916 per group). Thirty-two animals were used for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); scanned before surgery and 14 and 49\u00a0days post-injection. Fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient were evaluated in the fimbria, dorsal hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, dorso-medial thalamus, and amygdala. Between scans 2 and 3, animals were submitted to diverse behavioral tasks. Stainings were used to analyze tissue alterations. Twenty-four different animals received pilocarpine to evaluate the latency and severity of the status epilepticus 2\u00a0weeks after surgery. Additionally, eight different animals were only used to evaluate the neuronal damage inflicted on the MS 1\u00a0week after the molecular surgery. Progressive changes in DTI parameters in both white and gray matter structures of the four evaluated groups were observed. Behaviorally, the GAT1-saporin injection impacted spatial memory formation, while 192-IgG-saporin triggered anxiety-like behaviors. Histologically, the GABAergic toxin also induced aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, tissue damage, and neuronal death. Regarding the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, this agent provoked an increased mortality rate. Selective septo-hippocampal modulation impacts the integrity of limbic regions crucial for certain behavioral skills and could represent a precursor for epilepsy development.",

    "abstract": "The ILAE Neuroimaging Task Force publishes educational case reports that highlight basic aspects of neuroimaging in epilepsy consistent with the ILAE's educational mission. Subcortical laminar heterotopia, also known as subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) or \"double cortex,\" is an intriguing and rare congenital malformation of cortical development. SBH lesions are part of a continuum best designated as agyria-pachygyria-band-spectrum. The malformation is associated with epilepsy that is often refractory, as well as variable degrees of developmental delay. Moreover, in an increasing proportion of cases, a distinct molecular-genetic background can be found. Diagnosing SBH can be a major challenge for many reasons, including more subtle lesions, and \"non-classic\" or unusual MRI-appearances. By presenting an illustrative case, we address the challenges and needs of diagnosing and treating SBH patients in epilepsy, especially the value of high-resolution imaging and specialized MRI-protocols.",

    "abstract": "We describe a pericapillary organ in the rat forebrain and cerebellar cortex. It consists of a series of tripartite synapses with synaptic extensions enveloped by astrocytic endfeet that are linked to the capillary wall by synaptic extensions. Reciprocal specializations of the pericyte-capillary blood vessel (CBV) with such specialized synapses suggest a mechanoreceptor role. In Golgi-impregnated and 3D reconstructions of the cerebral cortex and thalamus, a series of TSs appear to be sequentially ordered in a common dendrite, paralleled by synaptic outgrowths termed golf club synaptic extensions (GCE) opposed to a longitudinal crest (LC) from the capillary basal lamina (BL). Our results show that, in the cerebellar cortex, afferent fibers and interneurons display microanatomical structures that strongly suggest an interaction with the capillary wall. Afferent mossy fiber (MF) rosettes and ascending granule cell axons and their dendrites define the pericapillary passage interactions that are entangled by endfeet. The presence of mRNA of the mechanosensitive channel Piezo1 in the MF rosettes, together with the surrounding end-feet and the capillary wall form mechanosensory units. The ubiquity of such units to modulate synaptic transmission is also supported by Piezo1 mRNA expressing pyramidal isocortical and thalamic neurons. This scenario suggests that ascending impulses to the cerebellar and cortical targets are presynaptically modulated by the reciprocal interaction with the mechanosensory pericapillary organ that ultimately modulates the vasomotor response.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an open access, multimodal neuroimaging dataset comprising simultaneously and independently collected Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from twenty healthy, young male individuals (mean age\u00a0=\u00a026 years; SD\u00a0=\u00a03.8 years). The dataset adheres to the BIDS standard specification and is structured into two components: 1) EEG data recorded outside the Magnetic Resonance (MR) environment, inside the MR scanner without image collection and during simultaneous functional MRI acquisition (EEG-fMRI) and 2) Functional MRI data acquired with and without simultaneous EEG recording and structural MRI data obtained with and without the participants wearing the EEG cap. EEG data were recorded with an MR-compatible EEG recording system (GES 400 MR, Electrical Geodesics Inc.) using a 32-channel sponge-based EEG cap (Geodesic Sensor Net). Eyes-closed resting-state EEG data were recorded for two minutes in both the outside and inside scanner conditions and for ten minutes during simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Eyes-open resting-state EEG data were recorded for two minutes under each condition. Participants also performed an eyes opening-eyes closure block-design task outside the scanner (two minutes) and during simultaneous EEG-fMRI (four minutes). The EEG data recorded outside the scanner provides a reference signal devoid of MR-related artifacts. The data collected inside the scanner without image acquisition captures the contribution of the ballistocardiographic (BCG) without the gradient artifact, making it suitable for testing and validating BCG artifact correction methods. The EEG-fMRI data is affected by both the gradient and BCG artifacts. Brain images were acquired using a 3T GE MR750-Discovery MR scanner equipped with a 32-channel head coil. Whole-brain functional images were obtained using a GRE-EPI T2* weighted sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a02000\u00a0ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0ms, 35 interleaved axial slices with 4\u00a0mm isometric voxels). Structural images were acquired using an SPGR sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a08.1\u00a0ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a03.2\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a012\u00b0, 176 sagittal slices with 1\u00a0mm isometric voxels). This stands as one of the largest open access EEG-fMRI datasets available, which allows researchers to: 1) Assess the impact of gradient and BCG artifacts on EEG data, 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of novel artifact removal techniques to minimize artifact contribution and preserve EEG signal integrity, 3) Conduct hardware/setup comparison studies, 4) Evaluate the quality of structural and functional MRI data obtained with this particular EEG system, and 5) Implement and validate multimodal integrative analysis approaches on simultaneous EEG-fMRI data.",

    "abstract": "Segesterone acetate (SA) or Nestorone, a fourth-generation progestogen, is a synthetic compound with high progestational activity and no androgenic, glucocorticoid, or anabolic effects. However, due to its oral inactivity, SA must be used by other routes, such as subcutaneous. Thus, considering its peculiar properties, the SA subdermal implant is successfully used in female contraception and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In recent years, its potential uses in endometriosis, polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCOS), and a new therapeutic possibility for neuroprotection have made this treatment extremely interesting. However, the absence of a standardized dose and the long-term safety of SA implant therapy in women is still controversial. Here, we present the possible indications, doses, limitations, and side effects of SA implant therapy.",

    "abstract": "Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are malformations of cortical development that often result in medically refractory epilepsy, with a greater incidence in the pediatric population. The relationship between the disturbed cortical morphology and epileptogenic activity of FCDs remains unclear. We used the BCNU (carmustine 1-3-bis-chloroethyl-nitrosourea) animal model of cortical dysplasia to evaluate neuronal and laminar alterations and how these result in altered activity of intracortical networks in early life. We corroborated the previously reported morphological anomalies characteristic of the BCNU model, comprising slightly larger and rounder neurons and abnormal cortical lamination. Next, the neuronal activity of live cortical slices was evaluated through large field-of-view calcium imaging as well as the neuronal response to a stimulus that leads to cortical hyperexcitability (pilocarpine). Examination of the joint activity of neuronal calcium time series allowed us to identify intracortical communication patterns and their response to pilocarpine. The baseline power density distribution of neurons in the cortex of BCNU-treated animals was different from that of control animals, with the former showing no modulation after stimulus. Moreover, the intracortical communication pattern differed between the two groups, with cortexes from BCNU-treated animals displaying decreased inter-layer connectivity as compared to control animals. Our results indicate that the altered anatomical organization of the cortex of BCNU-treated rats translates into altered functional networks that respond abnormally to a hyperexcitable stimulus and highlight the role of network dysfunction in the pathophysiology of cortical dysplasia.",

    "abstract": "Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is endemic in non-developed regions of the world. Two forms of NCC have been described, for which neurological morbidity depends on the location of the lesion, which can be either within the cerebral parenchyma or in extraparenchymal spaces. The extraparenchymal form (EXP-NCC) is considered the most severe form of NCC. EXP-NCC often requires several cycles of cysticidal treatment and the concomitant use of glucocorticoids to prevent increased inflammation, which could lead to intracranial hypertension and, in rare cases, to death. Thus, the improvement of EXP-NCC treatment is greatly needed.\nAn experimental murine model of EXP-NCC, as an adequate model to evaluate new therapeutic approaches, and the parameters that support it are described. EXP-NCC was established by injecting 30 \nCyst implantation and infection progression were monitored by detecting the HP10 antigen and anti-cysticercal antibodies in the serum and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of infected rats and by magnetic resonance imaging. Higher HP10 levels were observed in CSF than in the sera, as in the case of human EXP-NCC. Low cell recruitment levels were observed surrounding established cysticerci in histological analysis, with a modest increase in GFAP and Iba1 expression in the parenchyma of female animals. Low cellularity in CSF and low levels of C-reactive protein are consistent with a weak inflammatory response to this infection. After 150 days of infection, EXP-NCC is accompanied by reduced levels of mononuclear cell proliferation, resembling the human disease. EXP-NCC does not affect the behavior or general status of the rats.\nThis model will allow the evaluation of new approaches to control neuroinflammation and immunomodulatory treatments to restore and improve the specific anti-cysticercal immunity in EXP-NCC.",

    "results": "Cyst implantation and infection progression were monitored by detecting the HP10 antigen and anti-cysticercal antibodies in the serum and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of infected rats and by magnetic resonance imaging. Higher HP10 levels were observed in CSF than in the sera, as in the case of human EXP-NCC. Low cell recruitment levels were observed surrounding established cysticerci in histological analysis, with a modest increase in GFAP and Iba1 expression in the parenchyma of female animals. Low cellularity in CSF and low levels of C-reactive protein are consistent with a weak inflammatory response to this infection. After 150 days of infection, EXP-NCC is accompanied by reduced levels of mononuclear cell proliferation, resembling the human disease. EXP-NCC does not affect the behavior or general status of the rats.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a non-invasive technique that is sensitive to microstructural geometry in neural tissue and is useful for the detection of neuropathology in research and clinical settings. Tensor-valued diffusion encoding schemes (b-tensor) have been developed to enrich the microstructural data that can be obtained through DW-MRI. These advanced methods have proven to be more specific to microstructural properties than conventional DW-MRI acquisitions. Additionally, machine learning methods are particularly useful for the study of multidimensional data sets. In this work, we have tested the reach of b-tensor encoding data analyses with machine learning in different histopathological scenarios. We achieved this in three steps: 1) We induced different levels of white matter damage in rodent optic nerves. 2) We obtained ex vivo DW-MRI data with b-tensor encoding schemes and calculated quantitative metrics using Q-space trajectory imaging. 3) We used a machine learning model to identify the main contributing features and built a voxel-wise probabilistic classification map of histological damage. Our results show that this model is sensitive to characteristics of microstructural damage. In conclusion, b-tensor encoded DW-MRI data analyzed with machine learning methods, have the potential to be further developed for the detection of histopathology and neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Focal cortical dysplasias are a type of malformations of cortical development that are a common cause of drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Surgical treatment is a viable option for some of these patients, with their outcome being highly related to complete surgical resection of lesions visible in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, subtle lesions often go undetected on conventional imaging. Several methods to analyze MRI have been proposed, with the common goal of rendering subtle cortical lesions visible. However, most image-processing methods are targeted to detect the macroscopic characteristics of cortical dysplasias, which do not always correspond to the microstructural disarrangement of these cortical malformations. Quantitative analysis of diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) enables the inference of tissue characteristics, and novel methods provide valuable microstructural features of complex tissue, including gray matter. We investigated the ability of advanced dMRI descriptors to detect diffusion abnormalities in an animal model of cortical dysplasia. For this purpose, we induced cortical dysplasia in 18 animals that were scanned at 30 postnatal days (along with 19 control animals). We obtained multi-shell dMRI, to which we fitted single and multi-tensor representations. Quantitative dMRI parameters derived from these methods were queried using a curvilinear coordinate system to sample the cortical mantle, providing inter-subject anatomical correspondence. We found region- and layer-specific diffusion abnormalities in experimental animals. Moreover, we were able to distinguish diffusion abnormalities related to altered intra-cortical tangential fibers from those associated with radial cortical fibers. Histological examinations revealed myelo-architectural abnormalities that explain the alterations observed through dMRI. The methods for dMRI acquisition and analysis used here are available in clinical settings and our work shows their clinical relevance to detect subtle cortical dysplasias through analysis of their microstructural properties.",

    "abstract": "Estimating structural connectivity from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is a challenging task, partly due to the presence of false-positive connections and the misestimation of connection weights. Building on previous efforts, the MICCAI-CDMRI Diffusion-Simulated Connectivity (DiSCo) challenge was carried out to evaluate state-of-the-art connectivity methods using novel large-scale numerical phantoms. The diffusion signal for the phantoms was obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. The results of the challenge suggest that methods selected by the 14 teams participating in the challenge can provide high correlations between estimated and ground-truth connectivity weights, in complex numerical environments. Additionally, the methods used by the participating teams were able to accurately identify the binary connectivity of the numerical dataset. However, specific false positive and false negative connections were consistently estimated across all methods. Although the challenge dataset doesn't capture the complexity of a real brain, it provided unique data with known macrostructure and microstructure ground-truth properties to facilitate the development of connectivity estimation methods.",

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common pharmaco-resistant epilepsies in adults. While hippocampal pathology is the hallmark of this condition, emerging evidence indicates that brain alterations extend beyond the mesiotemporal epicenter and affect macroscale brain function and cognition. We studied macroscale functional reorganization in TLE, explored structural substrates, and examined cognitive associations. We investigated a multisite cohort of 95 patients with pharmaco-resistant TLE and 95 healthy controls using state-of-the-art multimodal 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We quantified macroscale functional topographic organization using connectome dimensionality reduction techniques and estimated directional functional flow using generative models of effective connectivity. We observed atypical functional topographies in patients with TLE relative to controls, manifesting as reduced functional differentiation between sensory/motor networks and transmodal systems such as the default mode network, with peak alterations in bilateral temporal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. TLE-related topographic changes were consistent in all three included sites and reflected reductions in hierarchical flow patterns between cortical systems. Integration of parallel multimodal MRI data indicated that these findings were independent of TLE-related cortical grey matter atrophy, but mediated by microstructural alterations in the superficial white matter immediately beneath the cortex. The magnitude of functional perturbations was robustly associated with behavioral markers of memory function. Overall, this work provides converging evidence for macroscale functional imbalances, contributing microstructural alterations, and their associations with cognitive dysfunction in TLE.",

    "abstract": "The ILAE Neuroimaging Task Force aimed to publish educational case reports highlighting basic aspects related to neuroimaging in epilepsy consistent with the educational mission of the ILAE. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is highly endemic in resource-limited countries and increasingly more often seen in non-endemic regions due to migration. Cysts with larva of the tapeworm Taenia solium lodge in the brain and cause several neurological conditions, of which seizures are the most common. There is great heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of neurocysticercosis because cysts vary in number, larval stage, and location among patients. We here present two illustrative cases with different clinical features to highlight the varying severity of symptoms secondary to this parasitic infestation. We also present several examples of imaging characteristics of the disease at various stages, which emphasize the central role of neuroimaging in the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis.",

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common pharmacoresistant epilepsy in adults. Here we profiled local neural function in TLE in vivo, building on prior evidence that has identified widespread structural alterations. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), we mapped the whole-brain intrinsic neural timescales (INT), which reflect temporal hierarchies of neural processing. Parallel analysis of structural and diffusion MRI data examined associations with TLE-related structural compromise. Finally, we evaluated the clinical utility of INT.\nWe studied 46 patients with TLE and 44 healthy controls from two independent sites, and mapped INT changes in patients relative to controls across hippocampal, subcortical, and neocortical regions. We examined region-specific associations to structural alterations and explored the effects of age and epilepsy duration. Supervised machine learning assessed the utility of INT for identifying patients with TLE vs controls and left- vs right-sided seizure onset.\nRelative to controls, TLE showed marked INT reductions across multiple regions bilaterally, indexing faster changing resting activity, with strongest effects in the ipsilateral medial and lateral temporal regions, and bilateral sensorimotor cortices as well as thalamus and hippocampus. Findings were similar, albeit with reduced effect sizes, when correcting for structural alterations. INT reductions in TLE increased with advancing disease duration, yet findings differed from the aging effects seen in controls. INT-derived classifiers discriminated patients vs controls (balanced accuracy, 5-fold: 76%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.65%; cross-site, 72%-83%) and lateralized the focus in TLE (balanced accuracy, 5-fold: 96%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.10%; cross-site, 95%-97%), with high accuracy and cross-site generalizability. Findings were consistent across both acquisition sites and robust when controlling for motion and several methodological confounds.\nOur findings demonstrate atypical macroscale function in TLE in a topography that extends beyond mesiotemporal epicenters. INT measurements can assist in TLE diagnosis, seizure focus lateralization, and monitoring of disease progression, which emphasizes promising clinical utility.",

INT-derived classifiers discriminated patients vs controls (balanced accuracy, 5-fold: 76%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.65%; cross-site, 72%-83%) and lateralized the focus in TLE (balanced accuracy, 5-fold: 96%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.10%; cross-site, 95%-97%), with high accuracy and cross-site generalizability. Findings were consistent across both acquisition sites and robust when controlling for motion and several methodological confounds.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) data quality is severely compromised when recorded inside the magnetic resonance (MR) environment. Here we characterized the impact of the ballistocardiographic (BCG) artifact on resting-state EEG spectral properties and compared the effectiveness of seven common BCG correction methods to preserve EEG spectral features. We also assessed if these methods retained posterior alpha power reactivity to an eyes closure-opening (EC-EO) task and compared the results from EEG-informed fMRI analysis using different BCG correction approaches.\nElectroencephalographic data from 20 healthy young adults were recorded outside the MR environment and during simultaneous fMRI acquisition. The gradient artifact was effectively removed from EEG-fMRI acquisitions using Average Artifact Subtraction (AAS). The BCG artifact was corrected with seven methods: AAS, Optimal Basis Set (OBS), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), OBS followed by ICA, AAS followed by ICA, PROJIC-AAS and PROJIC-OBS. EEG signal preservation was assessed by comparing the spectral power of traditional frequency bands from the corrected rs-EEG-fMRI data with the data recorded outside the scanner. We then assessed the preservation of posterior alpha functional reactivity by computing the ratio between the EC and EO conditions during the EC-EO task. EEG-informed fMRI analysis of the EC-EO task was performed using alpha power-derived BOLD signal predictors obtained from the EEG signals corrected with different methods.\nThe BCG artifact caused significant distortions (increased absolute power, altered relative power) across all frequency bands. Artifact residuals/signal losses were present after applying all correction methods. The EEG reactivity to the EC-EO task was better preserved with ICA-based correction approaches, particularly when using ICA feature extraction to isolate alpha power fluctuations, which allowed to accurately predict hemodynamic signal fluctuations during the EEG-informed fMRI analysis.\nCurrent software solutions for the BCG artifact problem offer limited efficiency to preserve the EEG spectral power properties using this particular EEG setup. The state-of-the-art approaches tested here can be further refined and should be combined with hardware implementations to better preserve EEG signal properties during simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Existing and novel BCG artifact correction methods should be validated by evaluating signal preservation of both ERPs and spontaneous EEG spectral power.",

    "abstract": "Pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) are fundamental elements for motor control. However, it is largely unknown if PTNs are segregated into different subtypes with distinct characteristics.\nUsing anatomical and electrophysiological tools, we analyzed in mice motor cortex PTNs projecting to red and pontine midbrain nuclei, which are important hubs connecting cerebral cortex and cerebellum playing a critical role in the regulation of movement.\nWe reveal that the vast majority of M1 neurons projecting to the red and pontine nuclei constitutes different populations. Corticopontine neurons have higher conduction velocities and morphologically, a most homogeneous dendritic and spine distributions along cortical layers.\nThe results indicate that cortical neurons projecting to the red and pontine nuclei constitute distinct anatomical and functional pathways which may contribute differently to sensorimotor integration.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal exposure to high-energy diets primes brain alterations that increase the risk of developing behavioral and cognitive failures. Alterations in the structure and connectivity of brain involved in learning and memory performance are found in adult obese murine models and in humans. However, the role of prenatal exposure to high-energy diets in the modulation of the brain's structure and function during cognitive decline remains unknown. We used female C57BL6 mice (n\u00a0=\u00a010) exposed to a high-energy diets (Cafeteria diet (CAF)) or Chow diet for 9\u00a0weeks (before, during and after pregnancy) to characterize their effect on brain structural organization and learning and memory performance in the offspring at two-month-old (n\u00a0=\u00a017). Memory and learning performance were evaluated using the Y-maze test including forced and spontaneous alternation, novel object recognition (NORT), open field and Barnes maze tests. We found no alterations in the short- or long-time spatial memory performance in male offspring prenatally exposed to CAF diet when compared to the control, but they increased time spent in the edges resembling anxiety-like behavior. By using deformation-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging analysis we found that male offspring exposed to CAF diet showed increased volume in primary somatosensory cortex and a reduced volume of fimbria-fornix, which correlate with alterations in its white matter integrity. Biological modeling revealed that prenatal exposure to CAF diet predicts low volume in the fimbria-fornix, which was associated with anxiety in the offspring. The findings suggest that prenatal exposure to high-energy diets prime brain structural alterations related to anxiety in the offspring.",

    "abstract": "Wounds result from different causes (e.g., trauma, surgeries, and diabetic ulcers), requiring even extended periods of intensive care for healing, according to the patient's organism and treatment. Currently, wound dressings generated by polymeric fibers at micro and nanometric scales are promising for healing the injured area. They offer great surface area and porosity, mimicking the fibrous extracellular matrix structure, facilitating cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, and accelerating the wound healing process. Such properties resulted in countless applications of these materials in biomedical and tissue engineering, also as drug delivery systems for bioactive molecules to help tissue regeneration. The techniques used to engineer these fibers include spinning methods (electro-, rotary jet-), airbrushing, and 3D printing. These techniques have important advantages, such as easy-handle procedure and process parameters variability (type of polymer), but encounter some scalability problems. RJS is described as a simple and low-cost technique resulting in high efficiency and yield for fiber production, also capable of bioactive agents' incorporation to improve the healing potential of RJS wound dressings. This review addresses the use of RJS to produce polymeric fibers, describing the concept, type of configuration, comparison to other spinning techniques, most commonly used polymers, and the relevant parameters that influence the manufacture of the fibers, for the ultimate use in the development of wound dressings.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has accelerated human neuroscience by fostering the analysis of brain microstructure, geometry, function, and connectivity across multiple scales and in living brains. The richness and complexity of multimodal neuroimaging, however, demands processing methods to integrate information across modalities and to consolidate findings across different spatial scales. Here, we present micapipe, an open processing pipeline for multimodal MRI datasets. Based on BIDS-conform input data, micapipe can generate i) structural connectomes derived from diffusion tractography, ii) functional connectomes derived from resting-state signal correlations, iii) geodesic distance matrices that quantify cortico-cortical proximity, and iv) microstructural profile covariance matrices that assess inter-regional similarity in cortical myelin proxies. The above matrices can be automatically generated across established 18 cortical parcellations (100-1000 parcels), in addition to subcortical and cerebellar parcellations, allowing researchers to replicate findings easily across different spatial scales. Results are represented on three different surface spaces (native, conte69, fsaverage5), and outputs are BIDS-conform. Processed outputs can be quality controlled at the individual and group level. micapipe was tested on several datasets and is available at https://github.com/MICA-MNI/micapipe, documented at https://micapipe.readthedocs.io/, and containerized as a BIDS App http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/apps/. We hope that micapipe will foster robust and integrative studies of human brain microstructure, morphology, function, cand connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows obtaining anatomical and functional information of the brain in the same subject at different times. Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) uses manganese ions to identify brain activity, although in high doses it might produce neurotoxic effects. Our aims were to identify a manganese dose that does not affect motivated behaviors such as sexual behavior, running wheel and the rotarod test. The second goal was to determine the optimal dose of chloride manganese (MnCl2) that will allow us to evaluate activation of brain regions after females mated controlling (pacing) the sexual interaction. To achieve that, two experiments were performed. In experiment 1 we evaluated the effects of two doses of MnCl2, 8 and 16 mg/kg. Subjects were injected with one of the doses of MnCl2 24 hours before the test on sessions 1, 5 and 10 and immediately thereafter scanned. Female sexual behavior, running wheel and the rotarod were evaluated once a week for 10 weeks. In experiment 2 we followed a similar procedure, but females paced the sexual interaction once a week for 10 weeks and were injected with one of the doses of MnCl2 24 hours before the test and immediately thereafter scanned on sessions 1, 5 and 10. The results of experiment 1 show that neither dose of MnCl2 induces alterations on sexual behavior, running wheel and rotarod. Experiment 2 demonstrated that MEMRI allow us to detect activation of different brain regions after sexual behavior, including the olfactory bulb (OB), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), the amygdala (AMG), the medial preoptic area (MPOA), the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), the striatum (STR) and the hippocampus (Hipp) allowing the identification of changes in brain circuits activated by sexual behavior. The socio sexual circuit showed a higher signal intensity on session 5 than the reward circuit and the control groups indicating that even with sexual experience the activation of the reward circuit requires the activation of the socio sexual circuit. Our study demonstrates that MEMRI can be used repeatedly in the same subject to evaluate the activation of brain circuits after motivated behaviors and how can this activation change with experience.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is associated with genetic risk factors and cortico-subcortical network alterations, but associations between neurobiological mechanisms and macroscale connectomics remain unclear. This multisite ENIGMA-Epilepsy study examined whole-brain structural covariance networks in patients with epilepsy and related findings to postmortem epilepsy risk gene expression patterns. Brain network analysis included 578 adults with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), 288 adults with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), and 1328 healthy controls from 18 centres worldwide. Graph theoretical analysis of structural covariance networks revealed increased clustering and path length in orbitofrontal and temporal regions in TLE, suggesting a shift towards network regularization. Conversely, people with IGE showed decreased clustering and path length in fronto-temporo-parietal cortices, indicating a random network configuration. Syndrome-specific topological alterations reflected expression patterns of risk genes for hippocampal sclerosis in TLE and for generalized epilepsy in IGE. These imaging-transcriptomic signatures could potentially guide diagnosis or tailor therapeutic approaches to specific epilepsy syndromes.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to evaluate superficial-white matter (WM) and deep-WM magnetic resonance imaging diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics and identify distinctive patterns of microstructural abnormalities in focal epilepsies of diverse etiology, localization, and response to antiseizure medication (ASM).\nWe examined DTI data for 113 healthy controls and 113 patients with focal epilepsies: 51 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) refractory to ASM, 27 with pharmacoresponsive TLE-HS, 15 with temporal lobe focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), and 20 with frontal lobe FCD. To assess WM microstructure, we used a multicontrast multiatlas parcellation of DTI. We evaluated fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD), and assessed within-group differences ipsilateral and contralateral to the epileptogenic lesion, as well as between-group differences, in regions of interest (ROIs).\nThe TLE-HS groups presented more widespread superficial- and deep-WM diffusion abnormalities than both FCD groups. Concerning superficial WM, TLE-HS groups showed multilobar ipsilateral and contralateral abnormalities, with less extensive distribution in pharmacoresponsive patients. Both the refractory TLE-HS and pharmacoresponsive TLE-HS groups also presented pronounced changes in ipsilateral frontotemporal ROIs (decreased FA and increased MD, RD, and AD). Conversely, FCD patients showed diffusion changes almost exclusively adjacent to epileptogenic areas.\nOur findings add further evidence of widespread abnormalities in WM diffusion metrics in patients with TLE-HS compared to other focal epilepsies. Notably, superficial-WM microstructural damage in patients with FCD is more restricted around the epileptogenic lesion, whereas TLE-HS groups showed diffuse WM damage with ipsilateral frontotemporal predominance. These findings suggest the potential of superficial-WM analysis for better understanding the biological mechanisms of focal epilepsies, and identifying dysfunctional networks and their relationship with the clinical-pathological phenotype. In addition, lobar superficial-WM abnormalities may aid in the diagnosis of subtle FCDs.",

Concerning superficial WM, TLE-HS groups showed multilobar ipsilateral and contralateral abnormalities, with less extensive distribution in pharmacoresponsive patients. Both the refractory TLE-HS and pharmacoresponsive TLE-HS groups also presented pronounced changes in ipsilateral frontotemporal ROIs (decreased FA and increased MD, RD, and AD). Conversely, FCD patients showed diffusion changes almost exclusively adjacent to epileptogenic areas.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that people with common epilepsies have characteristic patterns of cortical thinning, and that these changes may be progressive over time. Leveraging a large multicenter cross-sectional cohort, we investigated whether regional morphometric changes occur in a sequential manner, and whether these changes in people with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) correlate with clinical features.\nWe extracted regional measures of cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical brain volumes from T1-weighted (T1W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans collected by the ENIGMA-Epilepsy consortium, comprising 804 people with MTLE-HS and 1625 healthy controls from 25 centers. Features with a moderate case-control effect size (Cohen d\u2009\u2265\u2009.5) were used to train an event-based model (EBM), which estimates a sequence of disease-specific biomarker changes from cross-sectional data and assigns a biomarker-based fine-grained disease stage to individual patients. We tested for associations between EBM disease stage and duration of epilepsy, age at onset, and antiseizure medicine (ASM) resistance.\nIn MTLE-HS, decrease in ipsilateral hippocampal volume along with increased asymmetry in hippocampal volume was followed by reduced thickness in neocortical regions, reduction in ipsilateral thalamus volume, and finally, increase in ipsilateral lateral ventricle volume. EBM stage was correlated with duration of illness (Spearman \u03c1\u2009=\u00a0.293, p\u00a0=\u00a07.03\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nFrom cross-sectional MRI, we reconstructed a disease progression model that highlights a sequence of MRI changes that aligns with previous longitudinal studies. This model could be used to stage MTLE-HS subjects in other cohorts and help establish connections between imaging-based progression staging and clinical features.",

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy, a common drug-resistant epilepsy in adults, is primarily a limbic network disorder associated with predominant unilateral hippocampal pathology. Structural MRI has provided an in vivo window into whole-brain grey matter structural alterations in temporal lobe epilepsy relative to controls, by either mapping (i) atypical inter-hemispheric asymmetry; or (ii) regional atrophy. However, similarities and differences of both atypical asymmetry and regional atrophy measures have not been systematically investigated. Here, we addressed this gap using the multisite ENIGMA-Epilepsy dataset comprising MRI brain morphological measures in 732 temporal lobe epilepsy patients and 1418 healthy controls. We compared spatial distributions of grey matter asymmetry and atrophy in temporal lobe epilepsy, contextualized their topographies relative to spatial gradients in cortical microstructure and functional connectivity calculated using 207 healthy controls obtained from Human Connectome Project and an independent dataset containing 23 temporal lobe epilepsy patients and 53 healthy controls and examined clinical associations using machine learning. We identified a marked divergence in the spatial distribution of atypical inter-hemispheric asymmetry and regional atrophy mapping. The former revealed a temporo-limbic disease signature while the latter showed diffuse and bilateral patterns. Our findings were robust across individual sites and patients. Cortical atrophy was significantly correlated with disease duration and age at seizure onset, while degrees of asymmetry did not show a significant relationship to these clinical variables. Our findings highlight that the mapping of atypical inter-hemispheric asymmetry and regional atrophy tap into two complementary aspects of temporal lobe epilepsy-related pathology, with the former revealing primary substrates in ipsilateral limbic circuits and the latter capturing bilateral disease effects. These findings refine our notion of the neuropathology of temporal lobe epilepsy and may inform future discovery and validation of complementary MRI biomarkers in temporal lobe epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies demonstrate that arsenic exposure is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Experimental arsenic exposure models showed learning and memory deficits and molecular changes resembling the functional and pathologic neurodegeneration features. The present work focuses on hippocampal pathological changes in Wistar rats induced by continuous arsenic exposure from in utero up to 12\u00a0months of age, evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging along with immunohistochemistry. Diffusion-weighted images revealed age-related lower fractional anisotropy and higher radial-axial and mean diffusivity at 6 and 12\u00a0months, indicating that arsenic exposure leads to hippocampal demyelination. These structural alterations were paralleled by immunohistochemical changes that showed a significant loss of myelin basic protein in CA1 and CA3 regions accompanied by increased glial fibrillary acidic protein expression at all time-points studied. Concomitantly, arsenic exposure induced an altered morphology of astrocytes at all studied ages, whereas increased synaptogenesis was only observed at two months of age. These results suggest that environmental arsenic exposure is linked to impaired hippocampal connectivity and perhaps early glial senescence, which together might resemble a premature aging phenomenon leading to cognitive deficits.",

    "abstract": "We present an illustrative case to address anterior temporal lobe atrophy with poor delineation of the temporopolar gray-white matter interface based on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy associated with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS). A 52-year-old woman with pharmacoresistant seizures since the age of six months underwent a previous MRI scan using a suboptimal protocol which was reported as unremarkable. MRI performed according to an epilepsy protocol showed classic signs of left HS and ipsilateral temporal polar atrophy with blurring of the gray-white matter boundary on FLAIR images. She underwent a left amygdalohippocampectomy and anterior temporal resection and remains seizure-free after 24 months. Histopathological analyses showed HS and no signs of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). Blurring and atrophy of the ipsilateral temporal pole are common in TLE-HS and often misinterpreted as FCD. This relates to delayed myelination in patients with seizures before the age of two, is more pronounced on FLAIR sequences, and gives a false impression of cortical thickening. However, the T1-weighted images show a relatively well-demarcated cortical-subcortical transition and normal cortical thickness. By contrast, the cortical thickening in FCD is observed on both T1-weighted and FLAIR images. Since FCD also occurs in temporal lobe regions, it is important to differentiate the extra-hippocampal MRI abnormalities in TLE-HS from those likely to be FCD. This case highlights the importance of evaluation based on detailed imaging, which should always be conducted considering the EEG, seizure semiology, and other clinical information.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous recovery after a stroke accounts for a significant part of the neurological recovery in patients. However limited, the spontaneous recovery is mechanistically driven by axonal restorative processes for which several molecular cues have been previously described. We report the acceleration of spontaneous recovery in a preclinical model of ischemia/reperfusion in rats via a single intracerebroventricular administration of extracellular vesicles released from primary cortical astrocytes. We used magnetic resonance imaging\u00a0and confocal and multiphoton microscopy to correlate the structural remodeling of the corpus callosum and striatocortical circuits with neurological performance during 21\u00a0days. We also evaluated the functionality of the corpus callosum by repetitive recordings of compound action potentials to show that the recovery facilitated by astrocytic extracellular vesicles was both anatomical and functional. Our data provide compelling evidence that astrocytes can hasten the basal recovery that naturally occurs post-stroke through the release of cellular mediators contained in extracellular vesicles.",

    "abstract": "White matter bundle segmentation using diffusion MRI fiber tractography has become the method of choice to identify white matter fiber pathways in vivo in human brains. However, like other analyses of complex data, there is considerable variability in segmentation protocols and techniques. This can result in different reconstructions of the same intended white matter pathways, which directly affects tractography results, quantification, and interpretation. In this study, we aim to evaluate and quantify the variability that arises from different protocols for bundle segmentation. Through an open call to users of fiber tractography, including anatomists, clinicians, and algorithm developers, 42 independent teams were given processed sets of human whole-brain streamlines and asked to segment 14 white matter fascicles on six subjects. In total, we received 57 different bundle segmentation protocols, which enabled detailed volume-based and streamline-based analyses of agreement and disagreement among protocols for each fiber pathway. Results show that even when given the exact same sets of underlying streamlines, the variability across protocols for bundle segmentation is greater than all other sources of variability in the virtual dissection process, including variability within protocols and variability across subjects. In order to foster the use of tractography bundle dissection in routine clinical settings, and as a fundamental analytical tool, future endeavors must aim to resolve and reduce this heterogeneity. Although external validation is needed to verify the anatomical accuracy of bundle dissections, reducing heterogeneity is a step towards reproducible research and may be achieved through the use of standard nomenclature and definitions of white matter bundles and well-chosen constraints and decisions in the dissection process.",

    "abstract": "The causes of distinct patterns of reduced cortical thickness in the common human epilepsies, detectable on neuroimaging and with important clinical consequences, are unknown. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of cortical thinning using a systems-level analysis.\nImaging-based cortical structural maps from a large-scale epilepsy neuroimaging study were overlaid with highly spatially resolved human brain gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Cell-type deconvolution, differential expression analysis and cell-type enrichment analyses were used to identify differences in cell-type distribution. These differences were followed up in post-mortem brain tissue from humans with epilepsy using Iba1 immunolabelling. Furthermore, to investigate a causal effect in cortical thinning, cell-type-specific depletion was used in a murine model of acquired epilepsy.\nWe identified elevated fractions of microglia and endothelial cells in regions of reduced cortical thickness. Differentially expressed genes showed enrichment for microglial markers and, in particular, activated microglial states. Analysis of post-mortem brain tissue from humans with epilepsy confirmed excess activated microglia. In the murine model, transient depletion of activated microglia during the early phase of the disease development prevented cortical thinning and neuronal cell loss in the temporal cortex. Although the development of chronic seizures was unaffected, the epileptic mice with early depletion of activated microglia did not develop deficits in a non-spatial memory test seen in epileptic mice not depleted of microglia.\nThese convergent data strongly implicate activated microglia in cortical thinning, representing a new dimension for concern and disease modification in the epilepsies, potentially distinct from seizure control.",

    "results": "We identified elevated fractions of microglia and endothelial cells in regions of reduced cortical thickness. Differentially expressed genes showed enrichment for microglial markers and, in particular, activated microglial states. Analysis of post-mortem brain tissue from humans with epilepsy confirmed excess activated microglia. In the murine model, transient depletion of activated microglia during the early phase of the disease development prevented cortical thinning and neuronal cell loss in the temporal cortex. Although the development of chronic seizures was unaffected, the epileptic mice with early depletion of activated microglia did not develop deficits in a non-spatial memory test seen in epileptic mice not depleted of microglia.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has recently gained popularity across different medical fields to aid in the detection of diseases based on pathology samples or medical imaging findings. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key assessment tool for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The role of machine learning and artificial intelligence to increase detection of brain abnormalities in TLE remains inconclusive. We used support vector machine (SV) and deep learning (DL) models based on region of interest (ROI-based) structural (n\u00a0=\u00a0336) and diffusion (n\u00a0=\u00a0863) brain MRI data from patients with TLE with (\"lesional\") and without (\"non-lesional\") radiographic features suggestive of underlying hippocampal sclerosis from the multinational (multi-center) ENIGMA-Epilepsy consortium. Our data showed that models to identify TLE performed better or similar (68-75%) compared to models to lateralize the side of TLE (56-73%, except structural-based) based on diffusion data with the opposite pattern seen for structural data (67-75% to diagnose vs. 83% to lateralize). In other aspects, structural and diffusion-based models showed similar classification accuracies. Our classification models for patients with hippocampal sclerosis were more accurate (68-76%) than models that stratified non-lesional patients (53-62%). Overall, SV and DL models performed similarly with several instances in which SV mildly outperformed DL. We discuss the relative performance of these models with ROI-level data and the implications for future applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence in epilepsy care.",

    "abstract": "Amphibians are an important vertebrate model system to understand anatomy, genetics and physiology. Importantly, the brain and spinal cord of adult urodels (salamanders) have an incredible regeneration capacity, contrary to anurans (frogs) and the rest of adult vertebrates. Among these amphibians, the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) has gained most attention because of the surge in the understanding of central nervous system (CNS) regeneration and the recent sequencing of its whole genome. However, a complete comprehension of the brain anatomy is not available. In the present study we created a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) atlas of the in vivo neuroanatomy of the juvenile axolotl brain. This is the first MRI atlas for this species and includes three levels: (1) 82 regions of interest (ROIs) and a version with 64 ROIs; (2) a division of the brain according to the embryological origin of the neural tube, and (3) left and right hemispheres. Additionally, we localized the myelin rich regions of the juvenile brain. The atlas, the template that the atlas was derived from, and a masking file, can be found on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4595016 . This MRI brain atlas aims to be an important tool for future research of the axolotl brain and that of other amphibians.",

    "abstract": "The brain is one of the most sensitive organs damaged during aging due to its susceptibility to the aging-related oxidative stress. Hence, in this study, the sensory nerve pathway integrity and the memory were evaluated and related to the redox state, the antioxidant enzymes function, and the protein oxidative damage in the brain cortex (Cx) and the hippocampus (Hc) of young (4-month-old) and old (24-month-old) male and female Wistar rats. Evoked potentials (EP) were performed for the auditory, visual, and somatosensory pathways. In both males and females, the old rat groups' latencies were larger in almost all waves when compared to the young same-sex animals. The novel object test was performed to evaluate memory. The superoxide dismutase and catalase antioxidant activity, as well as the protein oxidative damage, and the redox state were evaluated. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to obtain the diffusion tensor imaging, and the brain volume, while MR spectroscopy was used to obtain the brain metabolite concentrations (glutamine, glutamate, Myo-inositol, N-acetyl-aspartate, creatine) in the Cx and the Hc of young and old females. Our data suggest that, although there are limited variations regarding memory and nerve conduction velocity by sex, the differences concerning the redox status might be important to explain the dissimilar reactions during brain aging between males and females. Moreover, the increment in Myo-inositol levels in the Hc of old rats and the brain volume decrease suggest that redox state alterations might be correlated to neuroinflammation during brain aging.",

    "abstract": "Accurate extraction of the cortical brain surface is critical for cortical thickness estimation and a key element to perform multimodal imaging analysis, where different metrics are integrated and compared in a common space. While brain surface extraction has become widespread practice in human studies, several challenges unique to neuroimaging of non-human primates (NHP) have hindered its adoption for the study of macaques. Although, some of these difficulties can be addressed at the acquisition stage, several common artifacts can be minimized through image preprocessing. Likewise, there are several image analysis pipelines for human MRIs, but very few automated methods for extraction of cortical surfaces have been reported for NHPs and none have been tested on data from diverse sources. We present PREEMACS, a pipeline that standardizes the preprocessing of structural MRI images (T1- and T2-weighted) and carries out an automatic surface extraction of the macaque brain. Building upon and extending pre-existing tools, the first module performs volume orientation, image cropping, intensity non-uniformity correction, and volume averaging, before skull-stripping through a convolutional neural network. The second module performs quality control using an adaptation of MRIqc method to extract objective quality metrics that are then used to determine the likelihood of accurate brain surface estimation. The third and final module estimates the white matter (wm) and pial surfaces from the T1-weighted volume (T1w) using an NHP customized version of FreeSurfer aided by the T2-weighted volumes (T2w). To evaluate the generalizability of PREEMACS, we tested the pipeline using 57 T1w/T2w NHP volumes acquired at 11 different sites from the PRIME-DE public dataset. Results showed an accurate and robust automatic brain surface extraction from images that passed the quality control segment of our pipeline. This work offers a robust, efficient and generalizable pipeline for the automatic standardization of MRI surface analysis on NHP.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is increasingly conceptualized as a network disorder. In this cross-sectional mega-analysis, we integrated neuroimaging and connectome analysis to identify network associations with atrophy patterns in 1021 adults with epilepsy compared to 1564 healthy controls from 19 international sites. In temporal lobe epilepsy, areas of atrophy colocalized with highly interconnected cortical hub regions, whereas idiopathic generalized epilepsy showed preferential subcortical hub involvement. These morphological abnormalities were anchored to the connectivity profiles of distinct disease epicenters, pointing to temporo-limbic cortices in temporal lobe epilepsy and fronto-central cortices in idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Negative effects of age on atrophy further revealed a strong influence of connectome architecture in temporal lobe, but not idiopathic generalized, epilepsy. Our findings were reproduced across individual sites and single patients and were robust across different analytical methods. Through worldwide collaboration in ENIGMA-Epilepsy, we provided deeper insights into the macroscale features that shape the pathophysiology of common epilepsies.",

    "abstract": "Optic neuritis (ON) is an inflammatory condition of the optic nerve, which leads to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss. A subset of RGCs expressing the photopigment melanopsin regulates non-image-forming visual system (NIFVS) functions such as pupillary light reflex (PLR) and circadian rhythms. Melatonin is a chronobiotic agent able to regulate the circadian system. We analyzed the effect of ON on the NIFVS, and the effect of melatonin on the NIFVS alterations induced by ON. For this purpose, optic nerves from male Wistar rats received vehicle or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and one group of animals received a subcutaneous pellet of melatonin or a sham procedure. The NIFVS was analyzed in terms of: i) blue light-evoked PLR, ii) the communication between the retina and the suprachiasmatic nuclei (by anterograde transport, and ex vivo magnetic resonance images), iii) locomotor activity rhythm, and iv) Brn3a(+) and melanopsin(+) RGC number (by immunohistochemistry). Experimental ON significantly decreased the blue light-evoked PLR, induced a misconnection between the retina and the suprachiasmatic nuclei, decreased Brn3a(+) RGCs, but not melanopsin(+) RGC number. A bilateral injection of LPS significantly increased the light (but not dark) phase locomotor activity, rhythm periodicity, and time of offset activity. Melatonin prevented the decrease in blue light-evoked PLR, and locomotor activity rhythm alterations induced by ON. These results support that ON provoked alterations of the circadian physiology, and that melatonin could restore the circadian system misalignment.",

    "abstract": "Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, induces long-term hippocampal damage and hyperexcitability. On the other hand, studies support that propylparaben (PPB) induces hippocampal neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases.\nExperiments were designed to evaluate the effects of subchronic treatment with PPB on TBI-induced changes in the hippocampus of rats.\nSevere TBI was induced using the lateral fluid percussion model. Subsequently, rats received subchronic administration with PPB (178\u200amg/kg, TBI+PPB) or vehicle (TBI+PEG) daily for 5 days. The following changes were examined during the experimental procedure: sensorimotor dysfunction, changes in hippocampal excitability, as well as neuronal damage and volume.\nTBI+PEG group showed sensorimotor dysfunction (p\u200a<\u200a0.001), hyperexcitability (64.2%, p\u200a<\u200a0.001), and low neuronal preservation ipsi- and contralateral to the trauma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis revealed lower volume (17.2%; p\u200a<\u200a0.01) and great damage to the ipsilateral hippocampus. TBI+PPB group showed sensorimotor dysfunction that was partially reversed 30 days after trauma. This group showed hippocampal excitability and neuronal preservation similar to the control group. However, MRI analysis revealed lower hippocampal volume (p\u200a<\u200a0.05) when compared with the control group.\nThe present study confirms that post-TBI subchronic administration with PPB reduces the long-term consequences of trauma in the hippocampus. Implications of PPB as a neuroprotective strategy to prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease as consequence of TBI are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The epilepsies are commonly accompanied by widespread abnormalities in cerebral white matter. ENIGMA-Epilepsy is a large quantitative brain imaging consortium, aggregating data to investigate patterns of neuroimaging abnormalities in common epilepsy syndromes, including temporal lobe epilepsy, extratemporal epilepsy, and genetic generalized epilepsy. Our goal was to rank the most robust white matter microstructural differences across and within syndromes in a multicentre sample of adult epilepsy patients. Diffusion-weighted MRI data were analysed from 1069 healthy controls and 1249 patients: temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (n\u2009=\u2009599), temporal lobe epilepsy with normal MRI (n\u2009=\u2009275), genetic generalized epilepsy (n\u2009=\u2009182) and non-lesional extratemporal epilepsy (n\u2009=\u2009193). A harmonized protocol using tract-based spatial statistics was used to derive skeletonized maps of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity for each participant, and fibre tracts were segmented using a diffusion MRI atlas. Data were harmonized to correct for scanner-specific variations in diffusion measures using a batch-effect correction tool (ComBat). Analyses of covariance, adjusting for age and sex, examined differences between each epilepsy syndrome and controls for each white matter tract (Bonferroni corrected at P\u2009<\u20090.001). Across 'all epilepsies' lower fractional anisotropy was observed in most fibre tracts with small to medium effect sizes, especially in the corpus callosum, cingulum and external capsule. There were also less robust increases in mean diffusivity. Syndrome-specific fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity differences were most pronounced in patients with hippocampal sclerosis in the ipsilateral parahippocampal cingulum and external capsule, with smaller effects across most other tracts. Individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy and normal MRI showed a similar pattern of greater ipsilateral than contralateral abnormalities, but less marked than those in patients with hippocampal sclerosis. Patients with generalized and extratemporal epilepsies had pronounced reductions in fractional anisotropy in the corpus callosum, corona radiata and external capsule, and increased mean diffusivity of the anterior corona radiata. Earlier age of seizure onset and longer disease duration were associated with a greater extent of diffusion abnormalities in patients with hippocampal sclerosis. We demonstrate microstructural abnormalities across major association, commissural, and projection fibres in a large multicentre study of epilepsy. Overall, patients with epilepsy showed white matter abnormalities in the corpus callosum, cingulum and external capsule, with differing severity across epilepsy syndromes. These data further define the spectrum of white matter abnormalities in common epilepsy syndromes, yielding more detailed insights into pathological substrates that may explain cognitive and psychiatric co-morbidities and be used to guide biomarker studies of treatment outcomes and/or genetic research.",

    "abstract": "Prelemniscal radiations (Raprl) are composed of different fiber tracts, connecting the brain stem and cerebellum with basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. In Parkinson disease (PD), lesions in Raprl induce improvement of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia in some patients, while others show improvement of only 1 or 2 symptoms, suggesting different fiber tracts mediate different symptoms.\nTo search for correlations between improvements of specific symptoms with surgical lesions of specific fiber tract components of Raprl in patients with PD.\nA total of 10 patients were treated with unilateral radiofrequency lesions directed to Raprl. The improvement for tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, posture, and gait was evaluated at 24 to 33 mo after operation through the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, and the precise location and extension of lesions through structural magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography at 6 to 8 mo postsurgery. Correlation between percentage of fiber tract involvement and percentage of UPDRS-III score improvement was evaluated through Spearman's correlation coefficient.\nGroup average improvement was 86% for tremor, 62% for rigidity, 56% for bradykinesia, and 45% for gait and posture. Improvement in global UPDRS score correlated with extent of lesions in fibers connecting with contralateral cerebellar cortex and improvement of posture and gait with fibers connecting with contralateral deep cerebellar nuclei. Lesion of fibers connecting the globus pallidum with pedunculopontine nucleus induced improvement of gait and posture over other symptoms.\nPartial lesion of Raprl fibers resulted in symptom improvement at 2-yr follow-up. Lesions of selective fiber components may result in selective improvement of specific symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous ventriculomegaly has been observed in rats that were presumed normal. Because the external phenotype of these animals is unremarkable, they can be inadvertently included in behavioral experiments, despite the considerable enlargement of the ventricular system, reduced cortical thickness, and hippocampal atrophy upon imaging. Given the role of such structures in memory consolidation, we evaluated long-term memory retention while decision making in rats with spontaneous ventriculomegaly.\nWe studied adult male Sprague Dawley rats, identified as having spontaneous ventriculomegaly, while performing baseline magnetic resonance imaging scanning intended for a different research protocol. Control (n\u00a0=\u00a07) and experimental (n\u00a0=\u00a06) animals were submitted to a delayed-alternation task (no delay, 30, 60, and 180\u00a0s) and an object-in-context recognition task. During the first task, we evaluated the number of correct choices as well as the latency to reach any of the cavities located at the end of each branch arm during each trial. The second task assessed the rodents' ability to remember where they had previously encountered a specific object, calculating the context recognition index.\nWhen compared to control animals, rats with spontaneous ventriculomegaly required significantly more training sessions to reach the 80% criterion during the training phase. Moreover, they showed reduced delayed-alternation performance in the evaluated times, reaching significance only at 180\u00a0s. Increased latencies while trying to reach the cavity were also observed. Evaluation of the long-term memory formation during the object-in-context recognition task showed that subjects with ventriculomegaly spent less time investigating the familiar object, resulting in a significantly decreased recognition index value.\nOur results are the first to show how spontaneous ventriculomegaly-induced cerebral structural damage affects decision-making behaviors, particularly when comparing between immediate and delayed trials. Moreover, this lesion disrupts the animals' ability to recall or express contextual information.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a common and serious neurological disorder, with many different constituent conditions characterized by their electro clinical, imaging, and genetic features. MRI has been fundamental in advancing our understanding of brain processes in the epilepsies. Smaller-scale studies have identified many interesting imaging phenomena, with implications both for understanding pathophysiology and improving clinical care. Through the infrastructure and concepts now well-established by the ENIGMA Consortium, ENIGMA-Epilepsy was established to strengthen epilepsy neuroscience by greatly increasing sample sizes, leveraging ideas and methods established in other ENIGMA projects, and generating a body of collaborating scientists and clinicians to drive forward robust research. Here we review published, current, and future projects, that include structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and that employ advanced methods including structural covariance, and event-based modeling analysis. We explore age of onset- and duration-related features, as well as phenomena-specific work focusing on particular epilepsy syndromes or phenotypes, multimodal analyses focused on understanding the biology of disease progression, and deep learning approaches. We encourage groups who may be interested in participating to make contact to further grow and develop ENIGMA-Epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Inorganic arsenic is among the major contaminants of groundwater in the world. Worldwide population-based studies demonstrate that chronic arsenic exposure is associated with poor cognitive performance among children and adults, while research in animal models confirms learning and memory deficits after arsenic exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of environmentally relevant arsenic exposure in the myelination process of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and corpus callosum (CC). A longitudinal study with repeated follow-up assessments was performed in male Wistar rats exposed to 3\u202fppm sodium arsenite in drinking water. Animals received the treatment from gestation until 2, 4, 6, or 12\u202fmonths of postnatal age. The levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry/histology and immunoblotting from the PFC and CC. As plausible alterations associated with demyelination, we considered mitochondrial mass (VDAC) and two axonal damage markers: amyloid precursor protein (APP) level and phosphorylated neurofilaments. To analyze the microstructure of the CC in vivo, we acquired diffusion-weighted images at the same ages, from which we derived metrics using the tensor model. Significantly decreased levels of MBP were found in both regions together with significant increases of mitochondrial mass and slight axonal damage at 12\u202fmonths in the PFC. Ultrastructural imaging demonstrated arsenic-associated decreases of white matter volume, water diffusion anisotropy, and increases in radial diffusivity. This study indicates that arsenic exposure is associated with a significant and persistent negative impact on microstructural features of white matter tracts.",

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is known to affect large-scale structural networks and cognitive function in multiple domains. The study of complex relations between structural network organization and cognition requires comprehensive analytical methods and a shift towards multivariate techniques. Here, we sought to identify multidimensional associations between cognitive performance and structural network topology in TLE.\nWe studied 34 drug-resistant adult TLE patients and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Participants underwent a comprehensive neurocognitive battery and multimodal MRI, allowing for large-scale connectomics, and morphological evaluation of subcortical and neocortical regions. Using canonical correlation analysis, we identified a multivariate mode that links cognitive performance to a brain structural network. Our approach was complemented by bootstrap-based hierarchical clustering to derive cognitive subtypes and associated patterns of macroscale connectome anomalies.\nBoth methodologies provided converging evidence for a close coupling between cognitive impairments across multiple domains and large-scale structural network compromise. Cognitive classes presented with an increasing gradient of abnormalities (increasing cortical and subcortical atrophy and less efficient white matter connectome organization in patients with increasing degrees of cognitive impairments). Notably, network topology characterized cognitive performance better than morphometric measures did.\nOur multivariate approach emphasized a close coupling of cognitive dysfunction and large-scale network anomalies in TLE. Our findings contribute to understand the complexity of structural connectivity regulating the heterogeneous cognitive deficits found in epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question regarding music processing is its degree of independence from speech processing, in terms of their underlying neuroanatomy and influence of cognitive traits and abilities. Although a straight answer to that question is still lacking, a large number of studies have described where in the brain and in which contexts (tasks, stimuli, populations) this independence is, or is not, observed. We examined the independence between music and speech processing using functional magnetic resonance imagining and a stimulation paradigm with different human vocal sounds produced by the same voice. The stimuli were grouped as Speech (spoken sentences), Hum (hummed melodies), and Song (sung sentences); the sentences used in Speech and Song categories were the same, as well as the melodies used in the two musical categories. Each category had a scrambled counterpart which allowed us to render speech and melody unintelligible, while preserving global amplitude and frequency characteristics. Finally, we included a group of musicians to evaluate the influence of musical expertise. Similar global patterns of cortical activity were related to all sound categories compared to baseline, but important differences were evident. Regions more sensitive to musical sounds were located bilaterally in the anterior and posterior superior temporal gyrus (planum polare and temporale), the right supplementary and premotor areas, and the inferior frontal gyrus. However, only temporal areas and supplementary motor cortex remained music-selective after subtracting brain activity related to the scrambled stimuli. Speech-selective regions mainly affected by intelligibility of the stimuli were observed on the left pars opecularis and the anterior portion of the medial temporal gyrus. We did not find differences between musicians and non-musicians Our results confirmed music-selective cortical regions in associative cortices, independent of previous musical training.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is widely used to infer microstructural characteristics of tissue, particularly in cerebral white matter. Histological validation of the metrics derived from dMRI methods are needed to fully characterize their ability to capture biologically-relevant histological features non-invasively. The data described here were used to correlate metrics derived from dMRI and quantitative histology in an animal model of axonal degeneration (\"Histological validation of per-bundle water diffusion metrics within a region of fiber crossing following axonal degeneration\" [1]). Unilateral retinal ischemia/reperfusion was induced in 10 rats, by the elevation of pressure of the anterior chamber of the eye for 90 min. Five rats were used as controls. After five weeks, injured animals were intracardially perfused to analyze the optic nerves and chiasm with dMRI and histology. This resulted in 15 brain scans, each with 80 diffusion-sensitizing gradient directions with b\u00a0=\u00a02000 and 2500 s/mm",

    "abstract": "Micro-architectural characteristics of white matter can be inferred through analysis of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). The diffusion-dependent signal can be analyzed through several methods, with the tensor model being the most frequently used due to its straightforward interpretation and low requirements for acquisition parameters. While valuable information can be gained from the tensor-derived metrics in regions of homogeneous tissue organization, this model does not provide reliable microstructural information at crossing fiber regions, which are pervasive throughout human white matter. Several multiple fiber models have been proposed that seem to overcome the limitations of the tensor, with few providing per-bundle dMRI-derived metrics. However, biological interpretations of such metrics are limited by the lack of histological confirmation. To this end, we developed a straightforward biological validation framework. Unilateral retinal ischemia was induced in ten rats, which resulted in axonal (Wallerian) degeneration of the corresponding optic nerve, while the contralateral was left intact; the intact and injured axonal populations meet at the optic chiasm as they cross the midline, generating a fiber crossing region in which each population has different diffusion properties. Five rats served as controls. High-resolution ex vivo dMRI was acquired five weeks after experimental procedures. We correlated and compared histology to per-bundle descriptors derived from three methodologies for dMRI analysis (constrained spherical deconvolution and two multi-tensor representations). We found a tight correlation between axonal density (as evaluated through automatic segmentation of histological sections) with per-bundle apparent fiber density and fractional anisotropy (derived from dMRI). The multi-fiber methods explored were able to correctly identify the damaged fiber populations in a region of fiber crossings (chiasm). Our results provide validation of metrics that bring substantial and clinically useful information about white-matter tissue at crossing fiber regions. Our proposed framework is useful to validate other current and future dMRI methods.",

    "abstract": "Remyelination is common under physiological conditions and usually occurs as a response to a pathological demyelinating event. Its potentiation is an important goal for the development of therapies against pathologies such as multiple sclerosis and white matter injury. Visualization and quantification in vivo of demyelination and remyelination processes are essential for longitudinal studies that will allow the testing and development of pro-myelinating strategies. In this study, ethidium bromide (EB) was stereotaxically injected into the caudal cerebellar peduncle (c.c.p.) in rats to produce demyelination; the resulting lesion was characterized (i) transversally through histology using Black-Gold II (BGII) staining, and (ii) longitudinally through diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), by computing fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity parameters to detect microstructural changes. Using this characterization, we evaluated, in the lesioned c.c.p., the effect of N-butyl-\u03b2-carboline-3-carboxylate (\u03b2-CCB), a potentiator of GABAergic signaling in oligodendrocytes. The dMRI analysis revealed significant changes in the anisotropic and diffusivity properties of the c.c.p. A decreased FA and increased radial diffusivity (\u03bb",

    "abstract": "We describe a set of perivascular interneurons (PINs) with series of fibro-vesicular complexes (FVCs) throughout the gray matter of the adult rabbit and rat brains. PIN-FVCs are ubiquitous throughout the brain vasculature as detected in Golgi-impregnated specimens. Most PINs are small, aspiny cells with short or long (>\u20091\u00a0mm) axons that split and travel along arterial blood vessels. Upon ramification, axons form FVCs around the arising vascular branches; then, paired axons run parallel to the vessel wall until another ramification ensues, and a new FVC is formed. Cytologically, FVCs consist of clusters of perivascular bulbs (PVBs) encircling the precapillary and capillary wall surrounded by end-feet and the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells and pericytes. A PVB contains mitochondria, multivesicular bodies, and granules with a membranous core, similar to Meissner corpuscles and other mechanoreceptors. Some PVBs form asymmetrical, axo-spinous synapses with presumptive adjacent neurons. PINs appear to correspond to the type 1 nNOS-positive neurons whose FVCs co-label with markers of sensory fiber-terminals surrounded by astrocytic end-feet. The PIN is conserved in adult cats and rhesus monkey specimens. The location, ubiquity throughout the vasculature of the mammalian brain, and cytological organization of the PIN-FVCs suggests that it is a sensory receptor intrinsic to the mammalian neurovascular unit that corresponds to an afferent limb of the sensorimotor feed-back mechanism controlling local blood flow.",

    "abstract": "A better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in retinal hydro-mineral homeostasis imbalance during diabetic macular edema (DME) is needed to gain insights into retinal (patho-)physiology that will help elaborate innovative therapies with lower health care costs. Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily vanilloid member 4 (TRPV4) plays an intricate role in homeostatic processes that needs to be deciphered in normal and diabetic retina. Based on previous findings showing that TRPV4 antagonists resolve blood-retina barrier (BRB) breakdown in diabetic rats, we evaluated whether TRPV4 channel inhibition prevents and reverts retinal edema in streptozotocin(STZ)-induced diabetic mice. We assessed retinal edema using common metrics, including retinal morphology/thickness (histology) and BRB integrity (albumin-associated tracer), and also by quantifying water mobility through apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measures. ADC was measured by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), acquired ex vivo at 4 weeks after STZ injection in diabetes and control groups. DWI images were also used to assess retinal thickness. TRPV4 was genetically ablated or pharmacologically inhibited as follows: left eyes were used as vehicle control and right eyes were intravitreally injected with TRPV4-selective antagonist GSK2193874, 24 h before the end of the 4 weeks of diabetes. Histological data show that retinal thickness was similar in nondiabetic and diabetic wt groups but increased in diabetic Trpv4-/- mice. In contrast, DWI shows retinal thinning in diabetic wt mice that was absent in diabetic Trpv4-/- mice. Disorganized outer nuclear layer was observed in diabetic wt but not in diabetic Trpv4-/- retinas. We further demonstrate increased water diffusion, increased distances between photoreceptor nuclei, reduced nuclear area in all nuclear layers, and BRB hyperpermeability, in diabetic wt mice, effects that were absent in diabetic Trpv4-/- mice. Retinas of diabetic mice treated with PBS showed increased water diffusion that was not normalized by GSK2193874. ADC maps in nondiabetic Trpv4-/- mouse retinas showed restricted diffusion. Our data provide evidence that water diffusion is increased in diabetic mouse retinas and that TRPV4 function contributes to retinal hydro-mineral homeostasis and structure under control conditions, and to the development of BRB breakdown and increased water diffusion in the retina under diabetes conditions. A single intravitreous injection of TRPV4 antagonist is however not sufficient to revert these alterations in diabetic mouse retinas.",

    "abstract": "Progressive functional decline in the epilepsies is largely unexplained. We formed the ENIGMA-Epilepsy consortium to understand factors that influence brain measures in epilepsy, pooling data from 24 research centres in 14 countries across Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Australia. Structural brain measures were extracted from MRI brain scans across 2149 individuals with epilepsy, divided into four epilepsy subgroups including idiopathic generalized epilepsies (n =367), mesial temporal lobe epilepsies with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE; left, n = 415; right, n = 339), and all other epilepsies in aggregate (n = 1026), and compared to 1727 matched healthy controls. We ranked brain structures in order of greatest differences between patients and controls, by meta-analysing effect sizes across 16 subcortical and 68 cortical brain regions. We also tested effects of duration of disease, age at onset, and age-by-diagnosis interactions on structural measures. We observed widespread patterns of altered subcortical volume and reduced cortical grey matter thickness. Compared to controls, all epilepsy groups showed lower volume in the right thalamus (Cohen's d = -0.24 to -0.73; P < 1.49 \u00d7 10-4), and lower thickness in the precentral gyri bilaterally (d = -0.34 to -0.52; P < 4.31 \u00d7 10-6). Both MTLE subgroups showed profound volume reduction in the ipsilateral hippocampus (d = -1.73 to -1.91, P < 1.4 \u00d7 10-19), and lower thickness in extrahippocampal cortical regions, including the precentral and paracentral gyri, compared to controls (d = -0.36 to -0.52; P < 1.49 \u00d7 10-4). Thickness differences of the ipsilateral temporopolar, parahippocampal, entorhinal, and fusiform gyri, contralateral pars triangularis, and bilateral precuneus, superior frontal and caudal middle frontal gyri were observed in left, but not right, MTLE (d = -0.29 to -0.54; P < 1.49 \u00d7 10-4). Contrastingly, thickness differences of the ipsilateral pars opercularis, and contralateral transverse temporal gyrus, were observed in right, but not left, MTLE (d = -0.27 to -0.51; P < 1.49 \u00d7 10-4). Lower subcortical volume and cortical thickness associated with a longer duration of epilepsy in the all-epilepsies, all-other-epilepsies, and right MTLE groups (beta, b < -0.0018; P < 1.49 \u00d7 10-4). In the largest neuroimaging study of epilepsy to date, we provide information on the common epilepsies that could not be realistically acquired in any other way. Our study provides a robust ranking of brain measures that can be further targeted for study in genetic and neuropathological studies. This worldwide initiative identifies patterns of shared grey matter reduction across epilepsy syndromes, and distinctive abnormalities between epilepsy syndromes, which inform our understanding of epilepsy as a network disorder, and indicate that certain epilepsy syndromes involve more widespread structural compromise than previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between cognitive performance and white matter (WM) integrity in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS).\nWe included 26 patients with TLE (10 right, 16 left onset) as well as 24 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and years of education. In addition to quantitative hippocampal volume and transverse relaxation (T2) evaluation, whole-brain WM was analyzed using fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, derived from the diffusion tensor model. Average FA values were obtained from 38 regions of interest (ROI) of the main WM fascicles using an atlas-based approach. All subjects underwent extensive coFignitive assessments, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-IV). Fractional anisotropy was correlated with neuropsychological scores, and group effects were evaluated. Finally, patients were clustered based on their cognitive performance to evaluate if clinical and structural variables relate to specific cognitive profiles.\nPatients had differential alterations in the integrity of the WM dependent on seizure laterality and presence of hippocampal sclerosis. Patients with TLE showed, on average, lower scores in most of the cognitive assessments. Correlations between cognition and WM followed specific trajectories per group with TLE, particularly in Left-TLE, in which we found a marked association between cognitive abilities and WM abnormalities. Cluster analysis of cognitive performance revealed three cognitive profiles, which were associated with the degree and spread of WM abnormalities.\nWhite matter diffusion characteristics differ between patients, particularly in relation to seizure laterality and hippocampal damage. Moreover, WM abnormalities are associated with cognitive performance. The extent of WM alterations leads to disrupted cerebral intercommunication and therefore negatively affects cognition.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence highlights the importance of white matter in the pathogenesis of focal epilepsy. Ex vivo and post-mortem studies show pathological changes in epileptic patients in white matter myelination, axonal integrity, and cellular composition. Diffusion-weighted MRI and its analytical extensions, particularly diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), have been the most widely used technique to image the white matter in vivo for the last two decades, and have shown microstructural alterations in multiple tracts both in the vicinity and at distance from the epileptogenic focus. These techniques have also shown promising ability to predict cognitive status and response to pharmacological or surgical treatments. More recently, the hypothesis that focal epilepsy may be more adequately described as a system-level disorder has motivated a shift towards the study of macroscale brain connectivity. This review will cover emerging findings contributing to our understanding of white matter alterations in focal epilepsy, studied by means of histological and ultrastructural analyses, diffusion MRI, and large-scale network analysis. Focus is put on temporal lobe epilepsy and focal cortical dysplasia. This topic was addressed in a special interest group on neuroimaging at the 70th annual meeting of the American Epilepsy Society, held in Houston December 2-6, 2016.",

    "abstract": "The descending corticospinal (CS) projection has been considered a key element for motor control, which results from direct and indirect modulation of spinal cord pre-motor interneurons in the intermediate gray matter of the spinal cord, which, in turn, influences motoneurons in the ventral horn. The CS tract (CST) is also involved in a selective and complex modulation of sensory information in the dorsal horn. However, little is known about the spinal network engaged by the CST and the organization of CS projections that may encode different cortical outputs to the spinal cord. This study addresses the issue of whether the CS system exerts parallel control on different spinal networks, which together participate in sensorimotor integration. Here, we show that in the adult rat, two different and partially intermingled CS neurons in the sensorimotor cortex activate, with different time latencies, distinct spinal cord neurons located in the dorsal horn and intermediate zone of the same segment. The fact that different populations of CS neurons project in a segregated manner suggests that CST is composed of subsystems controlling different spinal cord circuits that modulate motor outputs and sensory inputs in a coordinated manner.",

    "abstract": "The visual system classifies objects into categories, and distinct populations of neurons within the temporal lobe respond preferentially to objects of a given perceptual category. We can also classify the objects we recognize with the sense of touch, but less is known about the neuronal correlates underlying this cognitive function. To address this question, we performed a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) activity to identify the cortical areas that can be used to decode the category of objects explored with the hand. We observed that tactile object category can be decoded from the activity patterns of somatosensory and parietal areas. Importantly, we found that categories can also be decoded from the lateral occipital complex (LOC), which is a multimodal region known to be related to the representation of object shape. Furthermore, a hyperalignment analysis showed that activity patterns are similar across subjects. Our results thus indicate that tactile object recognition generates category-specific patterns of activity in a multisensory area known to encode objects, and that these patterns have a similar functional organization across individuals.",

    "abstract": "Dogs have a rich social relationship with humans. One fundamental aspect of it is how dogs pay close attention to human faces in order to guide their behavior, for example, by recognizing their owner and his/her emotional state using visual cues. It is well known that humans have specific brain regions for the processing of other human faces, yet it is unclear how dogs' brains process human faces. For this reason, our study focuses on describing the brain correlates of perception of human faces in dogs using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We trained seven domestic dogs to remain awake, still and unrestrained inside an MRI scanner. We used a visual stimulation paradigm with block design to compare activity elicited by human faces against everyday objects. Brain activity related to the perception of faces changed significantly in several brain regions, but mainly in the bilateral temporal cortex. The opposite contrast (i.e., everyday objects against human faces) showed no significant brain activity change. The temporal cortex is part of the ventral visual pathway, and our results are consistent with reports in other species like primates and sheep, that suggest a high degree of evolutionary conservation of this pathway for face processing. This study introduces the temporal cortex as candidate to process human faces, a pillar of social cognition in dogs.",

    "abstract": "To characterize the anatomical connectivity of the prelemniscal radiations (Raprl), a white matter region within the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) that is an effective neurosurgical target for treating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Diffusion-weighted images were acquired from twelve healthy subjects using a 3T scanner. Constrained spherical deconvolution, a method that allows the distinction of crossing fibers within a voxel, was used to compute track-density images with sufficient resolution to accurately delineate distinct PSA regions and probabilistic tractography of Raprl in both hemispheres. Raprl connectivity was reproducible across all subjects and showed fibers traversing through this region towards primary and supplementary motor cortices, the orbitofrontal cortex, ventrolateral thalamus, and the globus pallidus, cerebellum and dorsal brainstem. All brain regions reached by Raprl fibers are part of motor circuits involved in the pathophysiology of PD; while these fiber systems converge at the level of the PSA, they can be spatially segregated. Fibers of distinct and specific motor control networks are identified within Raprl. The description of this anatomical crossroad suggests that, in the future, tractography could allow deep brain stimulation or lesional therapies in white matter targets according to individual patient's symptoms.",

However, it appears in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) phenotype. This situation is caused by an acute, reversible dysfunction of the beta cell in individuals with insulin resistance. Once the acute stage subsides, patients behave as having a DM2 and do not require insulin treatment. They should be kept on a diet and oral hypoglycemic drugs due to their susceptibility to have recurrent acute ketotic decompensations.",

Materialand Methods: Five patients with PD and predominant unilateral tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) in contralateral Raprl that improved symptoms from 82.4 to 94.5%. 18F-FDG PET studies were performed before electrode implantation and after DBS therapy. Changes in metabolic activity in PET were evaluated by the maximal standardized uptake value (MSUV) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) for regions of interest (ROIs) ipsilateral and contralateral to the stimulation site. ROIs were derived from a preoperative probabilistic tractography and included primary motor, supplementary motor and orbitofrontal cortices: Raprl, ventrolateral thalamus, putamen and cerebellum.\nNo significant MSUV changes occurred in ROIs contralateral to Raprl-DBS. In contrast, MSUV decreased ipsilateral to DBS in Raprl, the thalamus, and the primary and supplementary motor cortices. SPM analysis showed metabolic changes which were significantly different after DBS therapy in all ROIs ipsilateral to DBS compared to those in the contralateral side.\nRaprl-DBS decreases the metabolic activity of areas anatomically related to its fiber composition. Improvement of symptoms may result from a decrease in pathological overactivity of circuits related to the ROIs.",

    "abstract": "Using magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to measure the behavior of diffusing water molecules, and the metrics derived can be used as indirect markers of tissue micro-architectural properties. Numerous reports have demonstrated that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have water diffusion abnormalities in several white matter structures located within and beyond the epileptogenic temporal lobe, showing that TLE is not a focal disorder, but rather a brain network disease. Differences in severity and spatial extent between patients with or without mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), as well as differences related to hemispheric seizure onset, are suggestive of different pathophysiological mechanisms behind different forms of TLE, which in turn result in specific cognitive disabilities. The biological interpretation of diffusion abnormalities is based on a wealth of information from animal models of white matter damage, and is supported by recent reports that directly correlate diffusion metrics with histological characteristics of surgical specimens of TLE patients. Thus, there is now more evidence showing that the increased mean diffusivity (MD) and concomitant reductions of diffusion anisotropy that are frequently observed in several white matter bundles in TLE patients reflect reduced axonal density (increased extra-axonal space) due to smaller-caliber axons, and abnormalities in the myelin sheaths of the remaining axons. Whether these histological and diffusion features are a predisposing factor for epilepsy or secondary to seizures is still uncertain; some reports suggest the latter. This article summarizes recent findings in this field and provides a synopsis of the histological features seen most frequently in post-surgical specimens of TLE patients in an effort to aid the interpretation of white matter diffusion abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have identified, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a region within the superior temporal gyrus that preferentially responds to musical stimuli. However, in most cases, significant responses to other complex stimuli, particularly human voice, were also observed. Thus, it remains unknown if the same neurons respond to both stimulus types, albeit with different strengths, or whether the responses observed with fMRI are generated by distinct, overlapping neural populations. To address this question, we conducted an fMRI experiment in which short music excerpts and human vocalizations were presented in a pseudo-random order. Critically, we performed an adaptation-based analysis in which responses to the stimuli were analyzed taking into account the category of the preceding stimulus. Our results confirm the presence of a region in the anterior STG that responds more strongly to music than voice. Moreover, we found a music-specific adaptation effect in this area, consistent with the existence of music-preferred neurons. Lack of differences between musicians and non-musicians argues against an expertise effect. These findings provide further support for neural separability between music and speech within the temporal lobe.",

    "abstract": "Information processing of all acoustic stimuli involves temporal lobe regions referred to as auditory cortices, which receive direct afferents from the auditory thalamus. However, the perception of music (as well as speech or spoken language) is a complex process that also involves secondary and association cortices that conform a large functional network. Using different analytical techniques and stimulation paradigms, several studies have shown that certain areas are particularly sensitive to specific acoustic characteristics inherent to music (e.g., rhythm). This chapter reviews the functional anatomy of the auditory cortices, and highlights specific experiments that suggest the existence of distinct cortical networks for the perception of music and speech.",

    "abstract": "Music and speech are two of the most relevant and common sounds in the human environment. Perceiving and processing these two complex acoustical signals rely on a hierarchical functional network distributed throughout several brain regions within and beyond the auditory cortices. Given their similarities, the neural bases for processing these two complex sounds overlap to a certain degree, but particular brain regions may show selectivity for one or the other acoustic category, which we aimed to identify. We examined 53 subjects (28 of them professional musicians) by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using a paradigm designed to identify regions showing increased activity in response to different types of musical stimuli, compared to different types of complex sounds, such as speech and non-linguistic vocalizations. We found a region in the anterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) (planum polare) that showed preferential activity in response to musical stimuli and was present in all our subjects, regardless of musical training, and invariant across different musical instruments (violin, piano or synthetic piano). Our data show that this cortical region is preferentially involved in processing musical, as compared to other complex sounds, suggesting a functional role as a second-order relay, possibly integrating acoustic characteristics intrinsic to music (e.g., melody extraction). Moreover, we assessed whether musical experience modulates the response of cortical regions involved in music processing and found evidence of functional differences between musicians and non-musicians during music listening. In particular, bilateral activation of the planum polare was more prevalent, but not exclusive, in musicians than non-musicians, and activation of the right posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (planum temporale) differed between groups. Our results provide evidence of functional specialization for music processing in specific regions of the auditory cortex and show domain-specific functional differences possibly correlated with musicianship.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the relationship between structural characteristics (area) and microstructure (apparent diffusion coefficient; ADC) of the corpus callosum (CC) in 57 healthy children aged 7.0 to 9.1 years, with diverse cognitive and academic abilities as well as executive functions evaluated with a neuropsychological battery for children. The CC was manually delineated and sub-segmented into six regions, and their ADC and area were measured. There were no significant differences between genders in the callosal region area or in ADC. The CC area and ADC, mainly of anterior regions, correlated with different cognitive abilities for each gender. Our results suggest that the relationship between cognitive abilities and CC characteristics is different between girls and boys and between the anterior and posterior regions of the CC. Furthermore, these findings strenghten the idea that regardless of the different interhemispheric connectivity schemes per gender, the results of cognitive tasks are very similar for girls and boys throughout childhood.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between limbic white matter microstructure and neuropsychological function in temporal-lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Twenty-one adult TLE patients, including 7 non-lesional (nlTLE) and 14 with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (uTLE), were studied with both DTI and hippocampal T2 relaxometry. Correlations were performed between fractional anisotropy (FA) of the bilateral fornix and cingulum, hippocampal T2, neuropsychological tests. Positive correlations were observed in the whole group for the left fornix and processing speed index. In contrast, memory tests did not show significant correlations with DTI findings. Subgroup analysis demonstrated an association between the left fornix and processing speed in nlTLE but not uTLE. No correlations were observed between hippocampal T2 and test scores in either the TLE group as a whole or after subgroup analysis. Our findings suggest that integrity of the left fornix specifically is an important anatomical correlate of cognitive function in TLE patients, in particular patients with nlTLE.",

    "abstract": "We routinely identify objects with our hands, and the physical attributes of touched objects are often held in short-term memory to aid future decisions. However, the brain structures that selectively process tactile information to encode object shape are not fully identified. In this article we describe the areas within the human cerebral cortex that specialize in encoding, short-term memory, and decision-making related to the shape of objects explored with the hand. We performed event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging in subjects performing a shape discrimination task in which two sequentially presented objects had to be explored to determine whether they had the same shape or not. To control for low-level and nonspecific brain activations, subjects performed a temperature discrimination task in which they compared the temperature of two spheres. Our results show that although a large network of brain structures is engaged in somatosensory processing, it is the areas lining the intraparietal sulcus that selectively participate in encoding, maintaining, and deciding on tactile information related to the shape of objects.",

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity in childhood is associated with negative physical and psychological effects. It has been proposed that obesity increase the risk for developing cognitive deficits, dementia and Alzheimer's disease and that it may be associated with marked differences in specific brain structure volumes.\nThe purpose of this study was a neurobiopsychological approach to examine the association between overweight and obesity, brain structure and a paediatric neuropsychological assessment in Mexican children between 6 and 8\u2009years of age.\nWe investigated the relation between the body mass index (BMI), brain volumetric segmentation of subcortical gray and white matter regions obtained with magnetic resonance imaging and the Neuropsychological Assessment of Children standardized for Latin America. Thirty-three healthy Mexican children between 6 and 8 years of age, divided into normal weight (18 children) and overweight/obese (15 children) groups.\nOverweight/obese children showed reduced executive cognitive performance on neuropsychological evaluations (i.e. verbal fluidity, P\u2009=\u20090.03) and presented differences in brain structures related to learning and memory (reduced left hippocampal volumes, P\u2009=\u20090.04) and executive functions (larger white matter volumes in the left cerebellum, P\u2009=\u20090.04 and mid-posterior corpus callosum, P\u2009=\u20090.03). Additionally, we found a positive correlation between BMI and left globulus pallidus (P\u2009=\u20090.012, \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.43) volume and a negative correlation between BMI and neuropsychological evaluation scores (P\u2009=\u20090.033, \u03c1\u2009=\u2009-0.37).\nThe findings contribute to the idea that there is a relationship between BMI, executive cognitive performance and brain structure that may underlie the causal chain that leads to obesity in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic emotional expressions such as those communicated by faces and vocalizations have been shown to engage specific brain regions, such as the amygdala. Although music constitutes another powerful means to express emotions, the neural substrates involved in its processing remain poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown whether brain regions typically associated with processing 'biologically relevant' emotional expressions are also recruited by emotional music. To address this question, we conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study in 47 healthy volunteers in which we directly compared responses to basic emotions (fear, sadness and happiness, as well as neutral) expressed through faces, non-linguistic vocalizations and short novel musical excerpts. Our results confirmed the importance of fear in emotional communication, as revealed by significant blood oxygen level-dependent signal increased in a cluster within the posterior amygdala and anterior hippocampus, as well as in the posterior insula across all three domains. Moreover, subject-specific amygdala responses to fearful music and vocalizations were correlated, consistent with the proposal that the brain circuitry involved in the processing of musical emotions might be shared with the one that have evolved for vocalizations. Overall, our results show that processing of fear expressed through music, engages some of the same brain areas known to be crucial for detecting and evaluating threat-related information.",

    "abstract": "The present experiment was designed to test if sustained attention directed to the spontaneous sensations of the right or left thumb in the absence of any external stimuli is able to activate corresponding somatosensory brain areas. After verifying in 34 healthy volunteers that external touch stimuli to either thumb effectively activate brain contralateral somatosensory areas, and after subtracting attention mechanisms employed in both touch and spontaneous-sensation conditions, fMRI evidence was obtained that the primary somatosensory cortex (specifically left BA 3a/3b) becomes active when an individual is required to attend to the spontaneous sensations of either thumb in the absence of external stimuli. In addition, the left superior parietal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, motor and premotor cortex, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Broca's area, and occipital cortices were activated. Moreover, attention to spontaneous-sensations revealed an increased connectivity between BA 3a/3b, superior frontal gyrus (BA 9) and anterior cingulate cortex (BA 32), probably allowing top-down activations of primary somatosensory cortex. We conclude that specific primary somatosensory areas in conjunction with other left parieto-frontal areas are involved in processing proprioceptive and interoceptive bodily information that underlies own body-representations and that these networks and cognitive functions can be modulated by top-down attentional processes.",

    "abstract": "Since its introduction in the early 1990s, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a crucial role in the non-invasive evaluation of tissue microstructure of brain parenchyma in vivo. Diffusion anisotropy, in particular, has been extensively used to infer histological changes due to brain maturation and pathology, as it shows a clear dependence on tissue architecture. Although the resolution used in most studies lies in the macroscopic range, the information provided originates at the microscopic level and, as such, diffusion MRI serves as a microscope that can reveal profound details of tissue with direct clinical and research applications. The interpretation of diffusion parameters of white matter rests on what is known to drive diffusion anisotropy, namely axonal membranes, density and coherence, as well as myelin sheaths. However, these factors interact to modulate anisotropy, making interpretations potentially difficult. While there are numerous publications that report diffusion changes in response to particular, histologically confirmed tissue abnormalities in animal models of disease, the microscopic correlates of altered diffusion parameters due to neurological disorders in humans have been difficult to characterize. Animal models may provide insight into the mechanisms involved, but do not necessarily provide accurate representations of the human condition, making human diffusion MRI studies with direct histological confirmation crucial for our understanding of tissue changes secondary to neurodevelopment and disease. This work provides a synopsis of tissue characteristics that give rise to highly informative, specific diffusion patterns, and also of how methodological and artifactual aspects can provide erroneous diffusion measurements that do not accurately reflect tissue and may lead to misinterpretation of results. Examples of diffusion changes due to human conditions are provided to illustrate the wealth of applications of diffusion MRI in clinical and research fields.",

In this paper, a new denoising methodology is proposed that takes into consideration the multicomponent nature of multi-directional DWI datasets such as those employed in diffusion imaging. This new filter reduces random noise in multicomponent DWI by locally shrinking less significant Principal Components using an overcomplete approach. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods using synthetic and real clinical MR images, showing improved performance in terms of denoising quality and estimation of diffusion parameters.",

    "abstract": "Numerous animal studies have shown the applicability of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to track Wallerian degeneration that occurs after injury to the neural fiber. Non-invasive biomarkers that may differentiate the early axonal breakdown and later myelin degradation have been attributed to either reduced parallel and elevated perpendicular diffusivity, respectively. While several human DTI studies have shown this potential at subacute and chronic time points, the diffusion changes that occur within the first week are unknown. Anterior temporal lobectomy (i.e. resection of hippocampus) is the standard surgical treatment of medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. The concomitant transection of the fimbria-fornix serves as a unique opportunity to examine the process of Wallerian degeneration since the timing is known. Six temporal lobe epilepsy patients underwent brain DTI before the surgery, three to four times within the first week post-operatively, and at one to four months following surgery. Both parallel and perpendicular diffusivities decreased markedly by a similar amount in the ipsilateral fornix within the first two days post-surgery. Approaching the end of the first week, perpendicular (but not parallel) diffusivity pseudo-recovered towards its pre-surgical value, but then increased dramatically months later. Fractional anisotropy, as a result of the combined action of the parallel and perpendicular diffusivities, stayed relatively stable within the first week and only reduced drastically at the chronic stage. DTI demonstrated acute water diffusion changes within days of transection that are not just limited to parallel diffusivity. While the chronic diffusion changes in the fornix are compatible with myelin degradation, the acute changes may reflect beading and swelling of axolemma, granular disintegration of the axonal neurofilaments, ischemia induced cytotoxic edema, and/or changes in the extra-axonal space including inflammatory changes and gliosis.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography has shown tract-specific pathology in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This technique normally yields a single value per diffusion parameter per tract, potentially reducing the sensitivity for the detection of focal changes. Our goal was to spatially characterize diffusion abnormalities of fasciculi carrying temporal lobe connections.\nWe studied 30 patients with drug-resistant TLE and 21 healthy control subjects. Twenty-four patients underwent DTI toward the end of video-EEG telemetry, with an average of 50 \u00b1 54 hours between the last seizure and DTI examination. After manual dissection of the uncinate and inferior longitudinal and arcuate bundle, they were spatially matched based on their distance to the temporal lobe, providing between-subject correspondence of tract segments. We evaluated point-wise differences in diffusion parameters along each tract at group and subject levels.\nOur approach localized increased mean diffusivity restricted to or more prominent within the ipsilateral temporal lobe. These abnormalities tapered off as tracts exited the temporal lobe. We observed that the shorter the interval between the last seizure and DTI, the higher the mean diffusivity (MD) of the ipsilateral tracts. Linear discriminant analysis of tract segments correctly lateralized 87% of patients.\nThe centrifugal pattern of white matter diffusion abnormalities probably reflects astrogliosis and microstructure derangement related to seizure activity in the vicinity of the focus. The negative correlation between the interval from last seizure and MD suggests a role for postictal vasogenic edema. The ability to assess tracts segmentally may contribute to a better understanding of the extent of white matter pathology in epilepsy and assist in the presurgical evaluation of patients with TLE, particularly those with unremarkable conventional imaging results.",

However, comparatively less is known about the white matter integrity of TLE patients without MTS (non-lesional TLE, nl-TLE). The purpose of the study was to investigate the diffusion properties of thirteen major white matter tracts in patients with TLE\u00a0+\u00a0uMTS and nl-TLE. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed on 23 TLE\u00a0+\u00a0uMTS (15 left MTS and 8 right MTS), 15\u00a0nl-TLE and 21 controls. Thirteen tracts were delineated by tractography and their diffusion parameters compared for the two TLE groups relative to controls, with left and right hemispheres combined per tract. A subgroup analysis investigated left and right MTS separately. Compared to controls, reduced anisotropy was detected in ten tracts for TLE\u00a0+\u00a0uMTS, but only the parahippocampal cingulum and tapetum for nl-TLE. Right MTS subgroup showed reduced anisotropy in 7 tracts bilaterally (3 limbic, 3 association, 1 projection) and 2 tracts ipsilaterally (1 association, 1 projection) and the body of the corpus callosum whereas the left MTS subgroup showed reduced anisotropy in 4 tracts bilaterally (2 limbic, 1 association, 1 projection) and 2 tracts ipsilaterally (1 limbic, 1 association). Diffusion abnormalities in tracts were observed within and beyond the temporal lobe in TLE\u00a0+\u00a0uMTS and were more widespread than in nl-TLE. Patients with right MTS had more extensive, bilateral abnormalities in comparison to left MTS. These findings suggest different dysfunctional networks in TLE patients with and without MTS.",

    "abstract": "By definition idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) is not associated with structural abnormalities on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, recent quantitative studies suggest white and gray matter alterations in IGE. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there are white and/or gray matter structural differences between controls and two subsets of IGE, namely juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and IGE with generalized tonic-clonic seizures only (IGE-GTC).\nWe assessed white matter integrity and gray matter volume using diffusion tensor tractography-based analysis of fractional anisotropy and voxel-based morphometry, respectively, in 25 patients with IGE, all of whom had experienced generalized tonic-clonic convulsions. Specifically, 15 patients with JME and 10 patients with IGE-GTC were compared to two groups of similarly matched controls separately. Correlations between total lifetime generalized tonic-clonic seizures and fractional anisotropy were investigated for both groups.\nTractography revealed lower fractional anisotropy in specific tracts including the crus of the fornix, body of corpus callosum, uncinate fasciculi, superior longitudinal fasciculi, anterior limb of internal capsule, and corticospinal tracts in JME with respect to controls, whereas there were no fractional anisotropy differences in IGE-GTC. No correlation was found between fractional anisotropy and total lifetime generalized tonic-clonic seizures for either JME or IGE-GTC. Although false discovery rate-corrected voxel-based morphometry (VBM) showed no gray matter volume differences between patient and control groups, spatial extent cluster-corrected VBM analysis suggested a trend of gray matter volume reduction in frontal and central regions in both patient groups, more lateral in JME and more medial in IGE-GTC.\nThe findings support the idea that the clinical syndromes of JME and IGE-GTC have unique anatomic substrates. The fact that the primary clinical difference between JME and IGE-GTC is the occurrence of myoclonus in the former raises the possibility that disruption of white matter integrity may be the underlying mechanism responsible for myoclonus in JME. The cross-sectional study design and relatively small number of subjects limits the conclusions that can be drawn here; however, the absence of a correlation between fractional anisotropy and lifetime seizures is suggestive that the white matter abnormalities observed in JME may not be secondary to seizures.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD) cell loss in the substantia nigra is known to result in motor symptoms; however widespread pathological changes occur and may be associated with non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment. Diffusion tensor imaging is a quantitative imaging method sensitive to the micro-structure of white matter tracts.\nTo measure fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values in the corpus callosum and cingulum pathways, defined by diffusion tensor tractography, in patients with PD, PD with dementia (PDD) and controls and to determine if these measures correlate with Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores in parkinsonian patients.\nPatients with PD (17 Males [M], 12 Females [F]), mild PDD (5 M, 1 F) and controls (8 M, 7 F) underwent cognitive testing and MRI scans. The corpus callosum was divided into four regions and the cingulum into two regions bilaterally to define tracts using the program DTIstudio (Johns Hopkins University) using the fiber assignment by continuous tracking algorithm. Volumetric MRI scans were used to measure white and gray matter volumes.\nGroups did not differ in age or education. There were no overall FA or MD differences between groups in either the corpus callosum or cingulum pathways. In PD subjects the MMSE score correlated with MD within the corpus callosum. These findings were independent of age, sex and total white matter volume.\nThe data suggest that the corpus callosum or its cortical connections are associated with cognitive impairment in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "To assess the reproducibility of neocortical atrophy and its clinical significance across the spectrum of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), in particular with respect to postsurgical outcome.\nMRI-based cortical thickness measurement was obtained in 105 patients. A total of 58 had hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance volumetry (TLE-HA) and 47 had normal hippocampal volumes (TLE-NV). Twenty-seven patients had repeated scans with a mean interval of 28 months. Patients were compared to 48 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We used linear models to assess cortical thinning and the effect of seizure control after surgery. Reproducibility of finding cortical atrophy was statistically evaluated using bootstrap simulations.\nCross-sectional and longitudinal analyses revealed highly similar topology and rates of neocortical thinning in both TLE groups, predominantly in frontocentral, temporal, and cingulate regions. Bootstrap methods showed that at least 20 subjects per group were necessary to reliably observe these patterns of atrophy in TLE. Moreover, power analysis showed that even with sample sizes of 80 subjects per group, differences in thickness between TLE-HA and TLE-NV would be marginal. With respect to postsurgical outcome, we found an association between residual seizures and atrophy in temporopolar and insular cortices in TLE-HA, and in the posterior quadrant in TLE-NV.\nWe demonstrated with a high degree of confidence that static and dynamic effects of epilepsy impact similarly the neocortex of patients with hippocampal atrophy and patients with normal hippocampal volumes. On the contrary, areas predicting unfavorable postsurgical outcome were distinct, suggesting different configurations of epileptogenic networks in these 2 groups.",

    "abstract": "While diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been extensively used to infer micro-structural characteristics of cerebral white matter in human conditions, correlations between human in vivo DTI and histology have not been performed. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) have abnormal DTI parameters of the fimbria-fornix (relative to TLE patients without MTS) which are presumed to represent differences in axonal/myelin integrity. Medically intractable TLE patients who undergo temporal lobe resection including the fimbria-fornix provide a unique opportunity to study the anatomical correlates of water diffusion abnormalities in freshly excised tissue. Eleven patients with medically intractable TLE were recruited (six with and five without MTS) for presurgical DTI followed by surgical excision of a small specimen of the fimbria-fornix which was processed for electron microscopy. Blinded quantitative analysis of the microphotographs included axonal diameter, density and area, cumulative axon membrane circumference, and myelin thickness and area. As predicted by DTI the fimbria-fornix of TLE patients with MTS had increased extra-axonal fraction, and reduced cumulative axonal membrane circumference and myelin area. Consistent with the animal literature, water diffusion anisotropy over the crus of the fimbria-fornix was strongly correlated with axonal membranes (cumulative membrane circumference) within the surgical specimen (approximately 15% of what was analyzed with DTI). The demonstration of a correlation between histology and human in vivo DTI, in combination with the observation that in vivo DTI accurately predicted white matter abnormalities in a human disease condition, provides strong validation of the application of DTI as a noninvasive marker of white matter pathology.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to characterize the structural and metabolic changes of the corticospinal tract (CST) in ALS patients using combined diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Fourteen patients (male:female, 6:8; mean age, 54 years) and 14 controls (male:female, 8:6; mean age, 53 years) underwent imaging. Four regions of the CST were evaluated: precentral gyrus, corona radiata, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and cerebral peduncle. DTI and MRSI indices tested included fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and the ratio of N-acetylaspartate to choline (NAA/Cho) and creatine (NAA/Cr). In the precentral gyrus, NAA/Cho was reduced 18% (p<0.001), NAA/Cr was reduced 9% (p=0.01), and FA was reduced 3% (p=0.02). NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr were reduced in the corona radiata (p<0.001). Reduced NAA/Cho in the precentral gyrus correlated with shorter symptom duration (r=0.66, p=0.02) and faster disease progression (r=-0.65, p=0.008). Increased spasticity correlated with higher ADC in the precentral gyrus (R=0.52, p=0.005). In conclusion, both MRSI and DTI provided in vivo evidence of intracranial degeneration of the CST in ALS that was most prominent rostrally in the precentral gyrus.",

    "abstract": "Although epilepsy is considered a grey-matter disorder, changes in the underlying brain connectivity have important implications in seizure generation and propagation. Abnormalities in the temporal and extratemporal white matter of patients with temporal-lobe epilepsy (TLE) and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) have previously been identified. Patients with TLE but without MTS often show a different course of the disorder and worse surgical outcome than patients with MTS. The purpose of this study was to determine if said white-matter abnormalities are related to the presence of MTS or if they are also present in non-lesional TLE.\nSeventeen patients with TLE and MTS (TLE+uMTS), 13 patients with non-lesional TLE (nl-TLE) and 25 controls were included in the study. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to assess tract integrity of the fornix, cingulum, external capsules and the corpus callosum.\nThe white-matter abnormalities seen in the fornix appear to be exclusive to patients with MTS. Although the cingulum showed an abnormally high overall diffusivity in both TLE groups, its anisotropy was decreased only in the TLE+uMTS group in a pattern similar to the fornix. The frontal and temporal components of the corpus callosum, as well as the external capsules, demonstrated reduced anisotropy in TLE regardless of MTS.\nWhile some white-matter bundles are affected equally in both forms of TLE, abnormalities of the bundles directly related to the mesial temporal structures (ie, the fornix and cingulum) appear to be unique to TLE+uMTS.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides the opportunity to study white matter tracts in vivo. The goal was to estimate the reliability of DTI tractography for the analysis of limbic and paralimbic white matter. Normative data from 24 healthy subjects and reliability data from four healthy and four depressed subjects were acquired at 1.5 Tesla, using twice-refocused spin-echo, echoplanar DTI and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) DTI sequences. Fiber tracking was performed using the Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking algorithm. Fractional Anisotropy (FA), trace Apparent Diffusion Coefficient and tract volumes were calculated. The inter-rater (and intra-rater) intraclass correlation coefficients for FA values were as follows: rostral cingulum 0.89 (0.87), dorsal cingulum 0.85 (0.90), parahippocampal cingulum 0.85 (0.95), uncinate fasciculus 0.85 (0.87), medial prefrontal white matter 0.97 (0.99), ventromedial prefrontal white matter 0.92 (0.93), crus of fornix 0.80 (0.81). The reported DTI protocol provides a reliable method to analyze limbic and paralimbic white matter tracts relevant to psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of the topological architecture of complex networks underlying the structural and functional organization of the brain is a basic challenge in neuroscience. However, direct evidence for anatomical connectivity networks in the human brain remains scarce. Here, we utilized diffusion tensor imaging deterministic tractography to construct a macroscale anatomical network capturing the underlying common connectivity pattern of human cerebral cortex in a large sample of subjects (80 young adults) and further quantitatively analyzed its topological properties with graph theoretical approaches. The cerebral cortex was divided into 78 cortical regions, each representing a network node, and 2 cortical regions were considered connected if the probability of fiber connections exceeded a statistical criterion. The topological parameters of the established cortical network (binarized) resemble that of a \"small-world\" architecture characterized by an exponentially truncated power-law distribution. These characteristics imply high resilience to localized damage. Furthermore, this cortical network was characterized by major hub regions in association cortices that were connected by bridge connections following long-range white matter pathways. Our results are compatible with previous structural and functional brain networks studies and provide insight into the organizational principles of human brain anatomical networks that underlie functional states.",

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is considered primarily a limbic disorder. Our purpose was to map limbic network organization in TLE and to statistically relate it to neocortical atrophy. We performed MRI-based cortical thickness analysis in 110 TLE patients (including 68 patients with hippocampal atrophy and 42 patients with normal hippocampal volume) and 46 healthy controls. Limbic connectivity was statistically inferred by correlating mean thickness of the entorhinal cortex (EC) with thickness at each vertex across the entire neocortex. The EC was chosen as seed region since it is the link between the neocortex and the hippocampal formation. Patients showed cortical thinning mainly in temporal and fronto-central neocortices, with a prevalence of atrophy in up to 35%. In controls, EC networks corresponded closely to known anatomical connections. In TLE the pattern of correlations was similar to controls, suggesting that pathological processes in the EC affect the same networks that co-vary with the EC in the healthy brain. Nevertheless, we found decreases in correlations mainly in the temporal lobe and increases mainly in orbitofrontal cortices. Although our analysis indicated alterations in the temporo-limbic network in TLE, there was no association between mesiotemporal connectivity and atrophy across the entire cortical surface. This divergence underlines the complexity of the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to neocortical atrophy in TLE.",

Also the timing of previously reported fornix abnormalities in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is unknown. We report longitudinal volumetic MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings of the hippocampus and fornix in a patient following status epilepticus. Left hippocampal atrophy demonstrated progression beyond 6 months poststatus epilepticus while the right hippocampus and bilateral fornices demonstrated stable volumetric and diffusion abnormalities throughout the study. Our findings provide evidence that status epilepticus can induce permanent hippocampal damage with the delayed timing of the structural changes being consistent with programmed cell death.",

    "abstract": "As an important connection within the limbic system, considerable attention has been paid to thalamic pathology in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric studies have yielded variable results and have largely been focused on TLE with mesial temporal sclerosis (TLE+). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides unique information on microstructure based on the measurement of water diffusion. To date, DTI properties of thalamus have not been well characterized in adult TLE patients with unilateral MTS or without MTS (TLE-). The purpose of this study was to investigate the status of thalamic integrity by using DTI as well as volumetric MRI in adult TLE+ and TLE- patients.\nIn 17 unilateral TLE+ patients, 10 TLE- patients and 26 controls, the thalamus was segmented by using an automated atlas-based method. Mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA) and volume were then quantified from DTI and 3D T1-weighted scans.\nNo significant changes were found in either DTI parameters or volume of thalamus in TLE- patients, as compared to healthy controls. However, both DTI parameters and MRI volumetry showed bilateral thalamic pathology in TLE+ patients, as compared to healthy controls. Also, TLE+ patients showed significant reduction of thalamic volume as compared to TLE- patients. In addition, thalamic FA ipsilateral to seizure focus showed significant correlation with age at onset of epilepsy in TLE+ patients.\nOur finding demonstrates bilateral pathology of thalamus in unilateral TLE+ patients. The discrepancy in thalamic pathology between TLE+ and TLE- patients suggests that along with differences in mesial temporal pathology, TLE+ and TLE- have unique extratemporal structural abnormalities.",

We performed a longitudinal study in patients with unilateral MTS who were seizure-free for 1 year after surgery to determine whether the observed presurgical white matter diffusion abnormalities were reversible.\nEight TLE patients with unilateral MTS who were seizure-free after anterior temporal resection and 22 healthy subjects were recruited. DTI was performed before surgery and at 1-year follow-up. Tractography and region-of-interest (ROI) analyses were performed in the fornix, cingulum, genu, and splenium of the corpus callosum and external capsules. Diffusion tensor parameters were compared between groups and before and after surgery in the patient group.\nThe fornix, cingulum, and external capsules showed preoperative bilateral abnormal diffusion parameters (i.e., decreased diffusion anisotropy and increased mean and perpendicular diffusivities). The fornix and cingulum ipsilateral to the resected mesial temporal structures showed signs of wallerian degeneration at 1-year follow-up. The contralateral tracts of the fornix, cingulum, and external capsules, as well as the genu of the corpus callosum, failed to show a normalization of their diffusion parameters.\nThe irreversibility of the white matter DTI abnormalities on seizure freedom suggests underlying structural abnormalities (e.g., axonal/myelin degradation) as opposed to functional changes (e.g., fluid shifts due to seizures) in the white matter.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated bilateral white matter abnormalities in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). The purpose of this project was to determine whether abnormalities of water diffusion are seen in extratemporal white matter of patients with TLE and pathologically confirmed MTS and to determine whether these findings are associated with worse surgical outcome.\nEleven patients with TLE and unilateral MTS confirmed in surgical specimens and 14 controls were studied by using cerebrospinal fluid-suppressed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 relaxometry.\nHippocampal T2 signal for patients was significantly elevated both ipsilateral (p<0.001) and contralateral (p=0.006) to MTS. DTI demonstrated reduced fractional anisotropy of the genu of the corpus callosum (p=0.003) and external capsule (p=0.02) and elevated mean diffusivity of the genu (p=0.005), splenium (p=0.03), and external capsule (p<0.001). For both the genu and external capsule, parallel diffusion of patients was not different from that of controls (genu, p=0.81; external capsule, p=0.45), whereas perpendicular diffusion was elevated (genu, p=0.001; external capsule, p<0.001). With mean postsurgical follow-up of 18.5 months, eight of 11 patients were entirely seizure free and the remaining three had all experienced a worthwhile reduction in seizure frequency.\nOur findings suggest that although patients with TLE and MTS have extensive bilateral and extratemporal pathology, these findings may not be associated with a worse postsurgical outcome.",

    "abstract": "Axonal degeneration of white matter fibers is a key consequence of neuronal or axonal injury. It is characterized by a series of time-related events with initial axonal membrane collapse followed by myelin degradation being its major hallmarks. Standard imaging cannot differentiate these phenomena, which would be useful for clinical investigations of degeneration, regeneration and plasticity. Animal models suggest that diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is capable of making such distinction. The applicability of this technique in humans would permit inferences on white matter microanatomy using a non-invasive technique. The surgical bisection of the anterior 2/3 of the corpus callosum for the palliative treatment of certain types of epilepsy serves as a unique opportunity to assess this method in humans. DTI was performed on three epilepsy patients before corpus callosotomy and at two time points (1 week and 2-4 months) after surgery. Tractography was used to define voxels of interest for analysis of mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy and eigenvalues. Diffusion anisotropy was reduced in a spatially dependent manner in the genu and body of the corpus callosum at 1 week and remained low 2-4 months after the surgery. Decreased anisotropy at 1 week was due to a reduction in parallel diffusivity (consistent with axonal fragmentation), whereas at 2-4 months, it was due to an increase in perpendicular diffusivity (consistent with myelin degradation). DTI is capable of non-invasively detecting, staging and following the microstructural degradation of white matter following axonal injury.",

    "abstract": "The limbic system, relevant to memory and emotion, is an interesting subject of study in healthy and diseased individuals. It consists of a network of gray matter structures interconnected by white matter fibers. Although gray matter components of this system have been studied by using MR imaging, the connecting fibers have not been analyzed to the same degree. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal intensity contamination of the fornix and cingulum, the 2 major white matter tracts of the limbic system, can alter diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) measurements and affect tractography. We investigated the effect of CSF signal intensity suppression on fiber tracking of the limbic connections and characterized the diffusion properties of these structures in healthy volunteers.\nNine healthy individuals were scanned with standard and CSF-suppressed DTI. Tractography of the fornix and cingulum was performed for both acquisition methods. We report mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy measurements of the crus, body, and columns of the fornix, and descending, superior, and anterior portions of the cingulum.\nDiffusion measurements were improved and tractography was facilitated by using CSF-suppressed DTI. In particular, tract volume increased, whereas decreases of the mean diffusivity and increases of diffusion anisotropy more accurately represented the underlying tissue by minimizing deleterious partial volume averaging from CSF. This was particularly true for the fornix because it is in closest contact to CSF. Diffusion measurements throughout the limbic connections were consistent in healthy volunteers.\nWe recommend the use of CSF suppression when performing diffusion-tensor tractography of the limbic system.",

    "abstract": "Reading is a complex cognitive skill that requires the coordination of multiple brain regions. Although functional neuroimaging studies highlight the cortical brain regions associated with a specific cognitive task like reading, they do not directly address the underlying neural connections necessary for efficient performance of this task. Adults with reading disability have demonstrated lower regional white matter connectivity, but it is not known whether this relationship between neuronal wiring and reading performance also holds in younger readers. Using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) that highlights the structural integrity of the brain wiring, we show that regional brain connectivity in the left temporo-parietal white matter correlates with a wide range of reading ability in children as young as 8-12 years old. Diffusion tensor tractography suggests that the posterior limb of the internal capsule is consistent with the location of the largest cluster of correlation between reading ability (Word Identification subtest) and fractional anisotropy. The maturation of the white matter may play a key role in the development of cognitive processes such as reading.",

We therefore sought to determine whether the anti-thyroid antibodies seen in patients with urticaria were of the IgE class. Using commercial ELISA kits for measuring serum IgG anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, we modified the procedure to detect IgE antibodies. We examined sera from 20 patients with urticaria who had IgG anti-thyroid antibodies and from 12 patients with IgG antithyroid antibodies who did not have urticaria. Only 2 of 20 patients with urticaria and IgG anti-thyroid antibodies had detectable IgE anti-thyroid antibodies: 1 patient had anti-thyroid peroxidase IgE antibody and 1 patient had anti-thyroglobulin IgE. IgE anti-thyroid antibodies do not appear to play a causal role in urticaria in the majority of patients.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging can acquire quantitative information on the microstructural integrity of white matter structures and depict brain connectivity in vivo based on the behavior of water diffusion. Diffusion tensor imaging-derived tractography has been used for virtual dissection of the fornix and cingulum in healthy subjects, but not in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Eight patients with medically intractable TLE and unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis and nine healthy control subjects were imaged using diffusion tensor imaging. Fiber tracking was performed to delineate the fornix and cingulum, which were quantitatively analyzed. Bilateral symmetrical reduction in fractional anisotropy was observed in the fornix of patients with TLE, together with an increase in water mobility perpendicular to the axis of the fibers. The findings in the cingulum are similar to those of the fornix with the exception of significantly increased bulk diffusivity in the latter. We observed strikingly symmetrical bilateral abnormalities of axonal integrity in the fornix and cingulum in a series of patients with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis. Our findings suggest that TLE with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis is associated with bilateral limbic system pathology.",

    "abstract": "The absorption and disposition kinetics of lithium carbonate administered to eight healthy volunteers in two dosage forms were studied. A conventional immediate release tablet and a controlled release preparation, developed in our laboratory and containing the drug into a hydrophilic matrix, were employed in the study. Lithium carbonate confers upon the body the distinct characteristics of a two-compartment open model with a mean slow disposition rate constant (beta) of 0.0435 h-1 +/- 0.0086 SD, corresponding to a mean biological half-life of 16.49 h +/- 2.95 SD. The mean half-life of the distributory alpha-phase was 1.40 h +/- 0.27 SD. The apparent volume of distribution (Vdarea) was 0.539 l kg-1 +/- 0.130 SD and the volume of the central compartment (Vl) was 0.224 l/kg-1 +/- 0.066 SD, about one half that of the volume at steady state (Vdss) which was 0.445 l/kg-1 +/- 0.106 SD. Total body clearance (ClB) was 0.0241 l/kg-1 h +/- 0.0102 SD. The administration of the controlled release preparations to the same subjects gave the expected smooth serum lithium concentration curves. Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) was 22% lower and the time at which this concentration was attained (tpeak) was delayed from 1.44 h to 4.25 h when compared with the conventional tablet. Bioavailability, estimated as the total amount of lithium excreted in the urine, was 90.2 for the controlled release preparation and 94.5 for the immediate release tablet.",
