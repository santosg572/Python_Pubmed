    "abstract": "Studies suggest severe mental disorders (SMDs), such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, are associated with common alterations in brain activity, albeit with a graded level of impairment. However, discrepancies between study findings likely to results from both small sample sizes and the use of different functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks. To address these issues, data-driven meta-analytic approach designed to identify homogeneous brain co-activity patterns across tasks was conducted to better characterize the common and distinct alterations between these disorders.\nA hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted to identify groups of studies reporting similar neuroimaging results, independent of task type and psychiatric diagnosis. A traditional meta-analysis (activation likelihood estimation) was then performed within each of these groups of studies to extract their aberrant activation maps.\nA total of 762 fMRI study contrasts were targeted, comprising 13 991 patients with SMDs. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified 5 groups of studies (meta-analytic groupings; MAGs) being characterized by distinct aberrant activation patterns across SMDs: (1) emotion processing; (2) cognitive processing; (3) motor processes, (4) reward processing, and (5) visual processing. While MAG1 was mostly commonly impaired, MAG2 was more impaired in schizophrenia, while MAG3 and MAG5 revealed no differences between disorder. MAG4 showed the strongest between-diagnoses differences, particularly in the striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.\nSMDs are characterized mostly by common deficits in brain networks, although differences between disorders are also present. This study highlights the importance of studying SMDs simultaneously rather than independently.",

    "abstract": "Depressive disorders are associated with alterations in brain function, affecting processes such as affective and reward processing and emotion regulation. However, the influence of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) on the neuronal patterns remains inadequately understood. Therefore, this review systematically summarizes longitudinal fMRI brain activity changes in depressive patients treated with CBT and their association with symptom remission.\nThis systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. Out of 2149 results of the literature search, N\u00a0=\u00a014 studies met the inclusion criteria (e.g., diagnosis of a current depressive disorder, assessment of longitudinal task-based fMRI, and the analysis of functional changes before and after CBT).\nThe findings reveal (1) diminished limbic reactivity following CBT across various tasks, (2) increased striatal activity during reward processing, but decreased activity during affective processing and future thinking, and (3) alterations in cingulate and prefrontal cortex activity across tasks. Partially, these results are associated with symptom remission, especially in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex.\nThere are heterogenous results especially in cortical areas that might partially be due to methodological issues like differences across the studies in terms of task content, statistical evaluation, and interventions. Thus, future research should focus on the standardization of methodologies.\nThe results indicate that CBT partially normalizes the neural patterns of depressive patients, particularly within regions involved in affective and reward processing and the development of negative cognitive biases. Overall, potential neural mechanisms underlying CBT were identified, underscoring its effectiveness on an objective neurobiological basis.",

    "abstract": "Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful tool for studying brain function, but neuroimaging research produces ongoing concerns regarding small-sample studies and how to interpret them. Although it is well understood that larger samples are preferable, many situations require researchers to make judgments from small studies, including reviewing the existing literature, analyzing pilot data, or assessing subsamples. Quantitative guidance on how to make these judgments remains scarce. To address this, we leverage the Human Connectome Project's Young Adult dataset to survey various analyses-from regional activation maps to predictive models. We find that, for some classic analyses such as detecting regional activation or cluster peak location, studies with as few as 40 subjects are adequate, although this depends crucially on effect sizes. For predictive modeling, similar sizes can be adequate for detecting whether features are predictable, but at least an order of magnitude more (at least hundreds) may be required for developing consistent predictions. These results offer valuable insights for designing and interpreting fMRI studies, emphasizing the importance of considering effect size, sample size, and analysis approach when assessing the reliability of findings. We hope that this survey serves as a reference for identifying which kinds of research questions can be reliably answered with small-scale studies.", 
    "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging has contributed substantially to understanding brain function but is dominated by group analyses that index only a fraction of the variation in these data. It is increasingly clear that parsing the underlying heterogeneity is crucial to understand individual differences and the impact of different task manipulations. We estimate large-scale (N\u2009=\u20097728) normative models of task-evoked activation during the Emotional Face Matching Task, which enables us to bind heterogeneous datasets to a common reference and dissect heterogeneity underlying group-level analyses. We apply this model to a heterogenous patient cohort, to map individual differences between patients with one or more mental health diagnoses relative to the reference cohort and determine multivariate associations with transdiagnostic symptom domains. For the face>shapes contrast, patients have a higher frequency of extreme deviations which are spatially heterogeneous. In contrast, normative models for faces>baseline have greater predictive value for individuals' transdiagnostic functioning. Taken together, we demonstrate that normative modelling of fMRI task-activation can be used to illustrate the influence of different task choices and map replicable individual differences, and we encourage its application to other neuroimaging tasks in future studies.", 
    "abstract": "While cortical regions involved in processing binocular disparities have been studied extensively, little is known on how the human visual system adapts to changing disparity magnitudes. In this paper, we investigate causal mechanisms of coarse and fine binocular disparity processing using fMRI with a clinically validated, custom anaglyph-based stimulus. We make use of Granger causality and graph measures to reveal the existence of distinct rich and diverse clubs across different disparity magnitudes. We demonstrate that Middle Temporal area (MT) plays a specialized role with overlapping rich and diverse characteristics. Next, we show that subtle interhemispheric differences exist across various brain regions, despite an overall right hemisphere dominance. Finally, we pass the graph measures through the decision tree and found that the diverse clubs outperform rich clubs in decoding disparity magnitudes. Our study sets the stage for conducting further investigations on binocular disparity processing, particularly in the context of neuro-ophthalmic disorders with binocular impairments.",

The technique has become widely adopted in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, where it has provided cognitive neuroscientists with abundant information on how brain regions interact to support complex cognition.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the functional changes associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using independent component analysis (ICA) with the word generation task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state fMRI.\nIn this study 17 patients with MCI and age and education-matched 17 healthy individuals as control group are investigated. All participants underwent resting-state fMRI and task-based fMRI while performing the word generation task. ICA was used to identify the appropriate independent components (ICs) and their associated networks. The Dice Coefficient method was used to determine the relevance of the ICs to the networks of interest.\nIC-14 was found relevant to language network in both resting-state and task-based fMRI, IC-4 to visual, and IC-28 to dorsal attention network (DAN) in word generation task-based fMRI by Sorento-Dice Coefficient. ICA showed increased activation in language network, which had a larger voxel size in resting-state functional MRI than word generation task-based fMRI in the bilateral lingual gyrus. Right temporo-occipital fusiform cortex, right hippocampus, and right thalamus were also activated in the task-based fMRI.

    "abstract": "A lack of empathy, and particularly its affective components, is a core symptom of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Visual exposure to images of a needle pricking a hand (pain condition) and Q-tips touching a hand (control condition) is an established functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm used to investigate empathy for pain (EFP; pain condition minus control condition). EFP has been associated with increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in regions known to become atrophic in the early stages in bvFTD, including the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate. We therefore hypothesized that patients with bvFTD would display altered empathy processing in the EFP paradigm. Here we examined empathy processing using the EFP paradigm in 28 patients with bvFTD and 28 sex and age matched controls. Participants underwent structural MRI, task-based and resting-state fMRI. The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) was used as a measure of different facets of empathic function outside the scanner. The EFP paradigm was analysed at a whole brain level and using two regions-of-interest approaches, one based on a metanalysis of affective perceptual empathy versus cognitive evaluative empathy and one based on the contro\u013as activation pattern. In controls, EFP was linked to an expected increase of BOLD signal that displayed an overlap with the pattern of atrophy in the bvFTD patients (insula and anterior cingulate). Additional regions with increased signal were the supramarginal gyrus and the occipital cortex. These latter regions were the only ones that displayed increased BOLD signal in bvFTD patients. BOLD signal increase under the affective perceptual empathy but not the cognitive evaluative empathy region of interest was significantly greater in controls than in bvFTD patients. The contro\u013as rating on their empathic concern subscale of the IRI was significantly correlated with the BOLD signal in the EFP paradigm, as were an informant\u015b ratings of the patient\u015b empathic concern subscale. This correlation was not observed on other subscales of the IRI or when using the patient's self-ratings. Finally, controls and patients showed different connectivity patterns in empathy related networks during resting-state fMRI, mainly in nodes overlapping the ventral attention network. Our results indicate that reduced neural activity in regions typically affected by pathology in bvFTD is associated with reduced empathy processing, and a predictor of patient\u015b capacity to experience affective empathy.", 
    "abstract": "The occurrence of suicidal behaviors increases during adolescence. Hypersensitivity to negative social signals and deficits in cognitive control are putative mechanisms of suicidal behaviors, which necessitate confirmation in youths. Multidomain functional neuroimaging could enhance the identification of patients at suicidal risk beyond standard clinical measures. Three groups of adolescents (N\u2009=\u200996; 78% females, age\u2009=\u200911.6-18.1) were included: patients with depressive disorders and previous suicide attempts (SA, n\u2009=\u200929); patient controls with depressive disorders but without any\u00a0suicide attempt history (PC, n\u2009=\u200935); and healthy controls (HC, n\u2009=\u200932). We scanned participants with 3T-MRI during social inclusion/exclusion (Cyberball Game) and response inhibition (Go-NoGo) tasks. Neural activation was indexed by the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) of the hemodynamic response during three conditions in the Cyberball Game (\"Control condition\", \"Social Inclusion\", and \"Social Exclusion\"), and two conditions in Go-NoGo task (\"Go\" and \"NoGo\" blocks). ANCOVA-style analysis identified group effects across three whole-brain contrasts: 1) NoGo vs. Go, 2) Social inclusion vs. control condition, 3) Social exclusion vs. control condition. We found that SA had lower activation in the left insula during social inclusion vs. control condition compared to PC and HC. Moreover, SA compared to PC had higher activity in the right middle prefrontal gyrus during social exclusion vs. control condition, and in bilateral precentral gyri during NoGo vs. Go conditions. Task-related behavioral and self-report measures (Self-reported emotional reactivity in the Cyberball Game, response times and number of errors in the Go-NoGo Task) did not discriminate groups. In conclusion, adolescent suicidal behaviors are likely associated with neural alterations related to the processing of social perception and response inhibition. Further research, involving prospective designs and diverse cohorts of patients, is necessary to explore the potential of neuroimaging as a tool in understanding the emergence and progression of suicidal behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Working memory, which is regarded as the foundation of cognitive processes, is a system that stores, processes, and manipulates information in short intervals of time that are actually needed for daily functioning. This study aimed to assess the brain activity of healthy controls (HC) while performing the N-back task, which is one of the most popularly used tests for evaluating working memory along with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this regard, we collected fMRI data from right-handed individuals in a 3.0 T scanner during the Persian version of the visual variant N-back task performance with three levels of complexity varied throughout the experiment (1, 2, and 3-back conditions) to increase the cognitive demands. The statistical parametric mapping (SPM12) software was used to analyze fMRI data for the identification of cognitive load-dependent activation patterns based on contrast images obtained from different levels of task difficulty. Our findings showed that as cognitive complexity increased, the number of significant activation clusters and cluster extent increased in several areas distributed in the cerebellum, frontoparietal lobes, insula, SMA, and lenticular nucleus, the majority of which are recognized for their role in working memory. Furthermore, deactivation patterns during 1-, 2-, and 3-back vs. 0-back contrasts revealed significant clusters in brain regions that are mostly described as being part of the default mode network (DMN). Based on previous research, our results supported the recognized involvement of the mentioned cortical and subcortical areas in various types or levels of N-back tasks. This study found that altering activation patterns by increasing task difficulty could aid in evaluating the various stages of cognitive dysfunction in many brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease by comparing controls in future studies to apply early appropriate treatment strategies.", 
    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a valuable tool for the presurgical evaluation of patients undergoing neurosurgeries. Although many pre-processing steps have been modified according to advances in recent years, statistical analysis has remained largely the same since the first days of fMRI. In this study, we examined the ability of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to separate the activation of a language task in fMRI, and we compared it with the results of the General Lineal Model (GLM).\nSixty patients undergoing evaluation for brain surgery due to various brain lesions and/or epilepsy and 20 control subjects completed an fMRI language mapping protocol that included three tasks, resulting in 259 fMRI scans. Depending on brain lesion characteristics, patients were allocated to (1) static/chronic not-expanding lesions (Group 1) and (2) progressive/expanding lesions (Group 2). GLM and ICA statistical maps were evaluated by fMRI experts to assess the performance of each technique.\nIn the control group, ICA and GLM maps were similar without any superiority of either technique. In Group 1 and Group 2, ICA performed statistically better than GLM, with a \nICA may be slightly more advantageous, compared to GLM, in patients with brain lesions, across the range of pathologies included in our population and independent of symptoms chronicity. Our findings suggest that GLM analysis may be more susceptible to brain activity perturbations induced by a variety of lesions or scanner-induced artifacts due to motion or other factors.

    "abstract": "The analysis of task-related fMRI data at the level of individual participants is commonly based on general linear modeling (GLM), which allows us to estimate the extent to which the BOLD signal can be explained by the task response predictors specified in the event model. The predictors are constructed by convolving the hypothesized time course of neural activity with an assumed hemodynamic response function (HRF). However, our assumptions about the components of brain activity, including their onset and duration, may be incorrect. Their timing may also differ across brain regions or from person to person, leading to inappropriate or suboptimal models, poor fit of the model to actual data, and invalid estimates of brain activity. Here, we present an approach that uses theoretically driven models of task response to define constraints on which the final model is computationally derived using actual fMRI data. Specifically, we developed autohrf-an R package that enables the evaluation and data-driven estimation of event models for GLM analysis. The highlight of the package is the automated parameter search that uses genetic algorithms to find the onset and duration of task predictors that result in the highest fitness of GLM based on the fMRI signal under predefined constraints. We evaluated the usefulness of the autohrf package on two original datasets of task-related fMRI activity, a slow event-related spatial working memory study and a mixed state-item study using the flanker task, and on a simulated slow event-related working memory data. Our results suggest that autohrf can be used to efficiently construct and evaluate better task-related brain activity models to gain a deeper understanding of BOLD task response and improve the validity of model estimates. Our study also highlights the sensitivity of fMRI analysis with GLM to precise event model specification and the need for model evaluation, especially in complex and overlapping event designs.",

We hypothesize that both processes share a common brain network which may play a significant role in more complex cognitive processes. The main goal of this proof-of-concept study is to describe the pattern of brain activity involved in TD and oddball detection (OD) paradigms, and in processes requiring higher cognitive effort.\nWe designed an experimental task, including an auditory test tool to assess TD and OD paradigms, which was conducted under functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 14 healthy participants. We added a cognitive control component into both paradigms in our test tool. We used the general linear model (GLM) to analyze the individual fMRI data images and the random effects model for group inference.\nWe defined the areas of brain activation related to TD and OD paradigms. We performed a conjunction analysis of contrast TD (task > control) and OD (task > control) patterns, finding both similarities and significant differences between them.\nWe conclude that change detection and other cognitive processes requiring an increase in cognitive effort require participation of overlapping functional and neuroanatomical components, suggesting the presence of a common time and change detection network.

    "abstract": "Significant heterogeneity in network structures reflecting individuals' dynamic processes can exist within subgroups of people (e.g., diagnostic category, gender). This makes it difficult to make inferences regarding these predefined subgroups. For this reason, researchers sometimes wish to identify subsets of individuals who have similarities in their dynamic processes regardless of any predefined category. This requires unsupervised classification of individuals based on similarities in their dynamic processes, or equivalently, in this case, similarities in their network structures of edges. The present paper tests a recently developed algorithm, S-GIMME, that takes into account heterogeneity across individuals with the aim of providing subgroup membership and precise information about the specific network structures that differentiate subgroups. The algorithm has previously provided robust and accurate classification when evaluated with large-scale simulation studies but has not yet been validated on empirical data. Here, we investigate S-GIMME's ability to differentiate, in a purely data-driven manner, between brain states explicitly induced through different tasks in a new fMRI dataset. The results provide new evidence that the algorithm was able to resolve, in an unsupervised data-driven manner, the differences between different active brain states in empirical fMRI data to segregate individuals and arrive at subgroup-specific network structures of edges. The ability to arrive at subgroups that correspond to empirically designed fMRI task conditions, with no biasing or priors, suggests this data-driven approach can be a powerful addition to existing methods for unsupervised classification of individuals based on their dynamic processes.", 
    "abstract": "The potential negative impact of head movement during fMRI has long been appreciated. Although a variety of prospective and retrospective approaches have been developed to help mitigate these effects, reducing head movement in the first place remains the most appealing strategy for optimizing data quality. Real-time interventions, in which participants are provided feedback regarding their scan-to-scan motion, have recently shown promise in reducing motion during resting state fMRI. However, whether feedback might similarly reduce motion during task-based fMRI is an open question. In particular, it is unclear whether participants can effectively monitor motion feedback while attending to task-related demands. Here we assessed whether a combination of real-time and between-run feedback could reduce head motion during task-based fMRI. During an auditory word repetition task, 78 adult participants (aged 19-81) were pseudorandomly assigned to receive feedback or not. Feedback was provided FIRMM software that used real-time calculation of realignment parameters to estimate participant motion. We quantified movement using framewise displacement (FD). We found that motion feedback resulted in a statistically significant reduction in participant head motion, with a small-to-moderate effect size (reducing average FD from 0.347 to 0.282). Reductions were most apparent in high-motion events. We conclude that under some circumstances real-time feedback may reduce head motion during task-based fMRI, although its effectiveness may depend on the specific participant population and task demands of a given study.",

Therefore, we emphasize that besides the brain's executive and reward systems, the social brain network might be the next candidate to be involved in the pathogenesis of PIU&ESU.", 
    "abstract": "The emergence of flow is a situation of high salience because externally oriented attention on the task and access to resources for goal-directed behavior are enhanced, while internally oriented or self-related cognition is decreased. The right anterior insula has been reported as a causal out-flow hub of the salience resting-state network, orchestrating the engagement of the central executive network (CEN) and the disengagement of the default-mode network (DMN) during a functional challenge. In the present study, we employed a combined task-based activation and connectivity analysis to investigate the role of the right anterior insula during the emergence of flow. A sample of 41 healthy male subjects was confronted with a functional challenge that permitted the emergence of flow during BOLD-based functional magnetic resonance imaging. Comparing connectivity changes in the right anterior insula during the flow condition against connectivity changes associated with control conditions of boredom and overload, relatively increased couplings were observed with the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Activation data for these regions did, however, not show the flow-typical inverted U-shaped (invU) response pattern. Relatively decreased functional couplings encompassed ventral aspects of the striatum, but neither the amygdala nor the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). For the ventral striatum, activation data were consistent with the flow-typical U-shaped activation pattern, which supports the notion that under the high salience of autotelic situations, the anterior insula is much less positively coupled with the ventral striatum than under boundary conditions of boredom and overload. Taken together, present functional connectivity results were in alignment with the assumed role of the right anterior insula under conditions of different salience. However, this particular region does not appear to mediate the most typical flow-associated activation patterns.", 
    "abstract": "Increasing time spent on the task (i.e., the time-on-task (ToT) effect) often results in mental fatigue. Typical effects of ToT are decreasing levels of task-related motivation and the deterioration of cognitive performance. However, a massive body of research indicates that the detrimental effects can be reversed by extrinsic motivators, for example, providing rewards to fatigued participants. Although several attempts have been made to identify brain areas involved in mental fatigue and related reward processing, the neural correlates are still less understood. In this study, we used the psychomotor vigilance task to induce mental fatigue and blood oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural correlates of the ToT effect and the reward effect (i.e., providing extra monetary reward after fatigue induction) in a healthy young sample. Our results were interpreted in a recently proposed neurocognitive framework. The activation of the right middle frontal gyrus, right insula and right anterior cingulate gyrus decreased as fatigue emerged and the cognitive performance dropped. However, after providing an extra reward, the cognitive performance, as well as activation of these areas, increased. Moreover, the activation levels of all of the mentioned areas were negatively associated with reaction times. Our results confirm that the middle frontal gyrus, insula and anterior cingulate cortex play crucial roles in cost-benefit evaluations, a potential background mechanism underlying fatigue, as suggested by the neurocognitive framework.",

However, it can often be challenging in task-based fMRI experiments to provide a robust stimulus within the MRI environment while using hardware (an RF coil and restraint system) that is compatible with awake imaging.\nHere we present an RF coil and restraint system that permits unimpeded access to an awake marmoset's head subsequent to immobilization, thereby permitting the setup of peripheral devices and stimuli proximal to the head.\nAs an example application, an fMRI experiment probing whole-brain activation in response to marmoset vocalizations was conducted-this paradigm showed significant bilateral activation in the inferior colliculus, medial lateral geniculate nucleus, and auditory cortex.\nThe coil performance was evaluated and compared to a previously published restraint system with integrated RF coil. The image and temporal SNR were improved by up to 58 % and 27 %, respectively, in the peripheral cortex and by 30 % and 3 % in the centre of the brain. The restraint-system topology limited head motion to less than 100\u00a0\u00b5m of translation and 0.30\u00b0 of rotation when measured over a 15-minute acquisition.\nThe proposed hardware solution provides a versatile approach to awake-marmoset imaging and, as demonstrated, can facilitate task-based fMRI.", 
    "abstract": "Subject motion during fMRI can affect our ability to accurately measure signals of interest. In recent years, frame censoring-that is, statistically excluding motion-contaminated data within the general linear model using nuisance regressors-has appeared in several task-based fMRI studies as a mitigation strategy. However, there have been few systematic investigations quantifying its efficacy. In the present study, we compared the performance of frame censoring to several other common motion correction approaches for task-based fMRI using open data and reproducible workflows. We analyzed eight publicly available datasets representing 11 distinct tasks in child, adolescent, and adult participants. Performance was quantified using maximum ", 
    "abstract": "This study investigates a locally low-rank (LLR) denoising algorithm applied to source images from a clinical task-based functional MRI (fMRI) exam before post-processing for improving statistical confidence of task-based activation maps.\nTask-based motor and language fMRI was obtained in eleven healthy volunteers under an IRB approved protocol. LLR denoising was then applied to raw complex-valued image data before fMRI processing. Activation maps generated from conventional non-denoised (control) data were compared with maps derived from LLR-denoised image data. Four board-certified neuroradiologists completed consensus assessment of activation maps; region-specific and aggregate motor and language consensus thresholds were then compared with nonparametric statistical tests. Additional evaluation included retrospective truncation of exam data without and with LLR denoising; a ROI-based analysis tracked \nfMRI activation maps generated from LLR-denoised data predominantly exhibited statistically significant (\nLLR denoising affords robust increases in ", 
    "abstract": "Capturing individual differences in cognition is central to human neuroscience. Yet our ability to estimate cognitive abilities via brain MRI is still poor in both prediction and reliability. Our study tested if this inability can be improved by integrating MRI signals across the whole brain and across modalities, including task-based functional MRI (tfMRI) of different tasks along with other non-task MRI modalities, such as structural MRI, resting-state functional connectivity. Using the Human Connectome Project (n\u00a0=\u00a0873, 473 females, after quality control), we directly compared predictive models comprising different sets of MRI modalities (e.g., seven tasks vs. non-task modalities). We applied two approaches to integrate multimodal MRI, stacked vs. flat models, and implemented 16 combinations of machine-learning algorithms. The stacked model integrating all modalities via stacking Elastic Net provided the best prediction (r\u00a0=\u00a00.57), relatively to other models tested, as well as excellent test-retest reliability (ICC=\u223c.85) in capturing general cognitive abilities. Importantly, compared to the stacked model integrating across non-task modalities (r\u00a0=\u00a00.27), the stacked model integrating tfMRI across tasks led to significantly higher prediction (r\u00a0=\u00a00.56) while still providing excellent test-retest reliability (ICC=\u223c.83). The stacked model integrating tfMRI across tasks was driven by frontal and parietal areas and by tasks that are cognition-related (working-memory, relational processing, and language). This result is consistent with the parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence. Accordingly, our results contradict the recently popular notion that tfMRI is not reliable enough to capture individual differences in cognition. Instead, our study suggests that tfMRI, when used appropriately (i.e., by drawing information across the whole brain and across tasks and by integrating with other modalities), provides predictive and reliable sources of information for individual differences in cognitive abilities, more so than non-task modalities.", 
    "abstract": "Task fMRI provides an opportunity to analyze the working mechanisms of the human brain during specific experimental paradigms. Deep learning models have increasingly been applied for decoding and encoding purposes study to representations in task fMRI data. More recently, graph neural networks, or neural networks models designed to leverage the properties of graph representations, have recently shown promise in task fMRI decoding studies. Here, we propose an end-to-end graph convolutional network (GCN) framework with three convolutional layers to classify task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project dataset. We compared the predictive performance of our GCN model across four of the most widely used node embedding algorithms-NetMF, RandNE, Node2Vec, and Walklets-to automatically extract the structural properties of the nodes in the functional graph. The empirical results indicated that our GCN framework accurately predicted individual differences (0.978 and 0.976) with the NetMF and RandNE embedding methods, respectively. Furthermore, to assess the effects of individual differences, we tested the classification performance of the model on sub-datasets divided according to gender and fluid intelligence. Experimental results indicated significant differences in the classification predictions of gender, but not high/low fluid intelligence fMRI data. Our experiments yielded promising results and demonstrated the superior ability of our GCN in modeling task fMRI data.", 
    "abstract": "Functional MRI (fMRI) has been widely used to examine changes in neuronal activity during cognitive tasks. Commonly used measures of gray matter macrostructure (e.g., cortical thickness, surface area, volume) do not consistently appear to serve as structural correlates of brain function. In contrast, gray matter microstructure, measured using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), enables the estimation of indices of neurite density (neurite density index; NDI) and organization (orientation dispersion index; ODI) in gray matter. Our study explored the relationship among neurite architecture, BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) fMRI, and cognition, using a large sample (n\u00a0=\u00a0750) of young adults of the human connectome project (HCP) and two tasks that index more cortical (working memory) and more subcortical (emotion processing) targeting of brain functions. Using NODDI, fMRI, structural MRI and task performance data, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that higher working memory- and emotion processing-evoked BOLD activity was related to lower ODI in the right DLPFC, and lower ODI and NDI values in the right and left amygdala, respectively. Common measures of brain macrostructure (i.e., DLPFC thickness/surface area and amygdala volume) did not explain any additional variance (beyond neurite architecture) in BOLD activity. A moderating effect of neurite architecture on the relationship between emotion processing task-evoked BOLD response and performance was observed. Our findings provide evidence that neuro-/social-affective cognition-related BOLD activity is partially driven by the local neurite organization and density with direct impact on emotion processing. In vivo gray matter microstructure represents a new target of investigation providing strong potential for clinical translation.", 
    "abstract": "Stomach 36 (ST36, \nLiterature searches were conducted on online databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, WeiPu database, and China Biology Medicine, for task-based fMRI studies of acupuncture at ST36 in healthy subjects. Brain regions activated by ST36 acupuncture were systematically evaluated and subjected to seed-based \nA total of sixteen studies, involving a total of 401 right-handed healthy participants, that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included in the present meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncturing on ST36 positively activates the opercular part of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG.R), left superior temporal gyrus (STG.L), and right median cingulate/paracingulate gyri (MCG.R) regions. Needle retention time in an acupuncture session positively correlates with the activation of the left olfactory cortex, as shown in meta-regression analysis. Subgroup analysis revealed that EA stimulation may be a source of heterogeneity in the pooled results. Functional network mappings showed that the activated areas were mapped to the auditory network and salience network. Further functional decoding analysis showed that acupuncture on ST36 was associated with pain, secondary somatosensory, sound and language processing, and mood regulation.\nAcupuncture at ST36 in healthy individuals positively activates the opercular part of IFG.R, STG.L, and MCG.R. The left olfactory cortex may exhibit positive needle retention time-dependent activities. Our findings may have clinical implications for acupuncture in analgesia, language processing, and mood disorders.\nhttps://inplasy.com/inplasy-2021-12-0035.", 
    "abstract": "Childhood irritability, operationalized as disproportionate and frequent temper tantrums and low frustration tolerance relative to peers, is a transdiagnostic symptom across many pediatric disorders. Studies using task-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe neural dysfunction in irritability have increased. However, an integrated review summarizing the published methods and synthesized fMRI results remains lacking.\nWe conducted a systematic search using irritability terms and task functional neuroimaging in key databases in March 2021, and identified 30 studies for our systematic review. Sample characteristics and fMRI methods were summarized. A subset of 28 studies met the criteria for extracting coordinate-based data for quantitative meta-analysis. Ten activation-likelihood estimations were performed to examine neural convergence across irritability measures and fMRI task domains.\nSystematic review revealed small sample sizes (median\u00a0= 58, mean age range\u00a0= 8-16 years) with heterogeneous sample characteristics, irritability measures, tasks, and analytical procedures. Meta-analyses found no evidence for neural activation convergence of irritability across neurocognitive functions related to emotional reactivity, cognitive control, and reward processing, or within each domain. Sensitivity analyses partialing out variances driven by heterogeneous tasks, irritability measures, stimulus types, and developmental ages all yielded null findings. Results were compared with a review on irritability-related structural anomalies from 11 studies.\nThe lack of neural convergence suggests a need for common, standardized irritability assessments and more homogeneous fMRI tasks. Thoughtfully designed fMRI studies probing commonly defined neurocognitive functions may be more fruitful to elucidate the neural mechanisms of irritability. Open science practices, data mining in large neuroscience databases, and standardized analytical methods promote meaningful collaboration in irritability research.",

Awake craniotomy was performed in 14 cases. Preoperative mapping was performed according to special MRI protocol (T1, tb-fMRI, rs-fMRI).\nMachine learning system was built on open source data from The Human Connectome Project. MR data of 200 healthy subjects from this database were used for system pre-training. Further, this system was trained on the data of our patients with gliomas.\nIn DCS, we obtained 332 stimulations including 173 with positive response. According to comparison of functional activations between rs-fMRI and tb-fMRI, there were more positive DCS responses predicted by rs-fMRI (132 vs 112). Non-response stimulation sites (negative) prevailed in tb-fMRI activations (69 vs 44).\nThe developed method with machine learning based on resting state fMRI showed greater sensitivity compared to

    "abstract": "Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is a well-established first-line intervention for anxiety-related disorders, including specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder/agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Several neural predictors of CBT outcome for anxiety-related disorders have been proposed, but previous results are inconsistent.\nWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating whole-brain predictors of CBT outcome in anxiety-related disorders (17 studies, \nAcross different tasks, we observed that brain response in a network of regions involved in salience and interoception processing, encompassing fronto-insular (the right inferior frontal gyrus-anterior insular cortex) and fronto-limbic (the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex-dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) cortices was strongly associated with a positive CBT outcome.\nOur results suggest that there are robust neural predictors of CBT outcome in anxiety-related disorders that may eventually lead (probably in combination with other data) to develop personalized approaches for the treatment of these mental disorders.", 
    "abstract": "Parallel transmission (pTx) is an approach to improve image uniformity for ultra-high field imaging. In this study, we modified an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence to design subject-specific pTx pulses online. We compared its performance against EPI with conventional circularly polarised (CP) pulses.\nWe compared the pTx-EPI and CP-EPI sequences in a short EPI acquisition protocol and for two different functional paradigms in six healthy volunteers (2 female, aged 23-36\u00a0years, mean age 29.2\u00a0years). We chose two paradigms that are typically affected by signal dropout at 7\u00a0T: a visual objects localiser to determine face/scene selective brain regions and a semantic-processing task.\nAcross all subjects, pTx-EPI improved whole-brain mean temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) by 11.0% compared to CP-EPI. We also compared the ability of pTx-EPI and CP-EPI to detect functional activation for three contrasts over the two paradigms: face > object and scene > object for the visual objects localiser and semantic association > pattern matching for the semantic-processing paradigm. Across all three contrasts, pTx-EPI showed higher median z-scores and detected more active voxels in relevant areas, as determined from previous 3\u00a0T studies.\nWe have demonstrated a workflow for EPI acquisitions with online per-subject pulse calculations. We saw improved performance in both tSNR and functional acquisitions from pTx-EPI. Thus, we believe that online calculation pTx-EPI is robust enough for future fMRI studies, especially where activation is expected in brain areas liable to significant signal dropout.", 
    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate brain plasticity by somatosensory stimulation (SS) and sensory observation (SO) based on mirror neuron and embodied cognition theory. Action observation therapy has been widely adopted for motor function improvement in post-stroke patients. However, it is uncertain whether the SO approach can also contribute to the recovery of sensorimotor function after stroke. In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of SO for sensorimotor dysfunction and provided new evidence for neurorehabilitation.\nTwenty-six healthy right-handed adults (12 men and 14 women), aged 18-27 (mean, 22.12; SD, 2.12) years were included. All subjects were evaluated with task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to discover the characteristics and differences in brain activation between SO and SS. We adopted a block design with two conditions during fMRI scanning: observing a sensory video of brushing (task condition A, defined as SO) and brushing subjects' right forearms while they watched a nonsense string (task condition B, defined as SS). One-sample \nThe task-based fMRI showed that the bilateral postcentral gyrus, left precentral gyrus, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus, and left supplementary motor area were significantly activated during SO or SS. In addition to these brain regions, SO could also activate areas containing mirror neurons, like the left inferior parietal gyrus.\nSO could activate mirror neurons and sensorimotor network-related brain regions in healthy subjects like SS. Therefore, SO may be a promising novel therapeutic approach for sensorimotor dysfunction recovery in post-stroke patients.", 
    "abstract": "Internet use disorder (IUD) is generally conceptualized as a fast-growing behavioral addiction. Several structural and functional brain alterations have been revealed in this condition, but previous behavioral studies indicated that language systems may also be impaired. We used a silent word generation task to induce brain activation in Broca's area and other parts of the language system. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent activation analysis and psychophysiological interaction analysis were applied to assess functional brain changes. IUD was measured by the Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire and two additional questions concerning usage time and subjective rating of addiction. According to our key findings, areas strongly related to the default mode network were altered in IUD during the task. Moreover, Broca's area showed altered functional connectivity with other language network and occipital areas in IUD. These findings may address the neural background of decreased verbal fluency performance previously reported in the literature, and we emphasize that beside the brain's reward and inhibitory control systems, the language system is the next candidate to be involved in the pathogenesis of IUD.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of costly research, we still cannot accurately predict individual differences in cognition from task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, aiming for methods with higher prediction is not sufficient. To understand brain-cognition relationships, we need to explain how these methods draw brain information to make the prediction. Here we applied an explainable machine-learning (ML) framework to predict cognition from task-based fMRI during the n-back working-memory task, using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (n\u00a0=\u20093,989). We compared 9 predictive algorithms in their ability to predict 12 cognitive abilities. We found better out-of-sample prediction from ML algorithms over the mass-univariate and ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression. Among ML algorithms, Elastic Net, a linear and additive algorithm, performed either similar to or better than nonlinear and interactive algorithms. We explained how these algorithms drew information, using SHapley Additive explanation, eNetXplorer, Accumulated Local Effects, and Friedman's H-statistic. These explainers demonstrated benefits of ML over the OLS multiple regression. For example, ML provided some consistency in variable importance with a previous study and consistency with the mass-univariate approach in the directionality of brain-cognition relationships at different regions. Accordingly, our explainable-ML framework predicted cognition from task-based fMRI with boosted prediction and explainability over standard methodologies.", 
    "abstract": "While much research has highlighted phenotypic heterogeneity in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), less work has focused on heterogeneity in neural activity. Conventional neuroimaging approaches rely on group averages that assume homogenous patient populations. If subgroups are present, these approaches can increase variability and can lead to discrepancies in the literature. They can also obscure differences between various subgroups. To address this issue, we used unsupervised machine learning to identify subgroup clusters of patients with OCD who were assessed by task-based fMRI. We predominantly focused on activation of cognitive control and performance monitoring neurocircuits, including three large-scale brain networks that have been implicated in OCD (the frontoparietal network, cingulo-opercular network, and default mode network). Participants were patients with OCD (n\u2009=\u2009128) that included both adults (ages 24-45) and adolescents (ages 12-17), as well as unaffected controls (n\u2009=\u200964). Neural assessments included tests of cognitive interference and error processing. We found three patient clusters, reflecting a \"normative\" cluster that shared a brain activation pattern with unaffected controls (65.9% of clinical participants), as well as an \"interference hyperactivity\" cluster (15.2% of clinical participants) and an \"error hyperactivity\" cluster (18.9% of clinical participants). We also related these clusters to demographic and clinical correlates. After post-hoc correction for false discovery rates, the interference hyperactivity cluster showed significantly longer reaction times than the other patient clusters, but no other between-cluster differences in covariates were detected. These findings increase precision in patient characterization, reframe prior neurobehavioral research in OCD, and provide a starting point for neuroimaging-guided treatment selection.",

    "abstract": "The reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging has led to an increased demand for standardized data processing workflows. Within the ENIGMA consortium, we developed HALFpipe (Harmonized Analysis of Functional MRI pipeline), an open-source, containerized, user-friendly tool that facilitates reproducible analysis of task-based and resting-state fMRI data through uniform application of preprocessing, quality assessment, single-subject feature extraction, and group-level statistics. It provides state-of-the-art preprocessing using fMRIPrep without the requirement for input data in Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. HALFpipe extends the functionality of fMRIPrep with additional preprocessing steps, which include spatial smoothing, grand mean scaling, temporal filtering, and confound regression. HALFpipe generates an interactive quality assessment (QA) webpage to rate the quality of key preprocessing outputs and raw data in general. HALFpipe features myriad post-processing functions at the individual subject level, including calculation of task-based activation, seed-based connectivity, network-template (or dual) regression, atlas-based functional connectivity matrices, regional homogeneity (ReHo), and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), offering support to evaluate a combinatorial number of features or preprocessing settings in one run. Finally, flexible factorial models can be defined for mixed-effects regression analysis at the group level, including multiple comparison correction. Here, we introduce the theoretical framework in which HALFpipe was developed, and present an overview of the main functions of the pipeline. HALFpipe offers the scientific community a major advance toward addressing the reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging, providing a workflow that encompasses preprocessing, post-processing, and QA of fMRI data, while broadening core principles of data analysis for producing reproducible results. Instructions and code can be found at https://github.com/HALFpipe/HALFpipe.", 
    "abstract": "This study features an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) hyperscanning experiment from 2 sites, 305\u00a0km apart. The experiment contains 2 conditions: the dyad collaborated to win and then split the reward in the cooperation condition, whereas the winner took all the reward in the competition condition, thereby resulting in dynamic strategic interactions. To calculate the cerebral coherence in such jittered event-related fMRI tasks, we first iteratively estimated the feedback-related blood oxygenation level-dependent responses of each trial, using 8 finite impulse response functions (16\u00a0s) and then concatenated the beta volume series. With the right temporal-parietal junction (rTPJ) as the seed, the interpersonal connected brain areas were separately identified: the right superior temporal gyrus (rSTG) (cooperation) and the left precuneus (lPrecuneus) (competition), both peaking at the designated frequency bin (1/16\u00a0s\u2009=\u20090.0625\u00a0Hz), but not in permuted pairs. In addition, the extended coherence analyses on shorter and longer concatenated volumes verified that only in the optimal trial frequency did the rTPJ-rSTG and rTPJ-lPrecuneus couplings peak. In sum, our approach both showcases a flexible analysis method that widens the applicability of interpersonal coherence in the rapid event-related fMRI hyperscanning and reveals a context-based inter-brain coupling between interacting pairs during cooperation and during competition.", 
    "abstract": "Numerous studies have stressed the importance of exercise in promoting physical and mental health and for aiding in cognition. Encouragingly, physical exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and to mitigate hemiparesis experienced by stroke patients. Additionally, today where over 1.9 billion are overweight, physical exercise is imperative to save lives and to mitigate the burden on the healthcare system. Although the benefits of physical exercise have been explored, the underlying mechanisms to enact these benefits have not been well-characterized. Here we review exercise-induced changes in regional brain activation and modulation. Paradigms differing in intensity, duration, and type of motor movement have been used to assess exercise effects on memory, cognition, and disease mitigation in youth and elderly populations. To evaluate exercise-induced changes in neural activity, the noninvasive imaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is employed. fMRI is recorded either during or after exercise intervention. Post-exercise fMRI is often paired with in-bore tests of cognition to provide insight into the associated brain regions. Whereas, during intervention, fMRI is used to detail muscle-associated neural activation profiles. Characterization of the region and magnitude of brain activation has been used to perform comparative studies and identify specific characteristics from individuals with varying motor and cognitive abilities. Further fMRI and exercise research, with the use of these metrics, could facilitate the development of tools for disease diagnosis or to assess level of dysfunction or progression.", 
    "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging modalities have enhanced our understanding of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) underlying neural mechanisms. Due to its non-invasive, sensitive and analytical nature, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides valuable insights into relevant functional brain networks and their segregation and integration properties. We systematically reviewed the contribution of resting-state and task-based fMRI to the current understanding of the pathophysiology and the patterns of seizure propagation in JME Altogether, despite some discrepancies, functional findings suggest that corticothalamo-striato-cerebellar network along with default-mode network and salience network are the most affected networks in patients with JME. However, further studies are required to investigate the association between JME's main deficiencies, e.g., motor and cognitive deficiencies and fMRI findings. Moreover, simultaneous electroencephalography-fMRI (EEG-fMRI) studies indicate that alterations of these networks play a role in seizure modulation but fall short of identifying a causal relationship between altered functional properties and seizure propagation. This review highlights the complex pathophysiology of JME, which necessitates the design of more personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in this group.", 
    "abstract": "Body integrity dysphoria (BID), a long-lasting desire for the amputation of physically healthy limbs, is associated with reduced fMRI resting-state functional connectivity of somatosensory cortices. Here, we used fMRI to evaluate whether these findings could be replicated and expanded using a task-based paradigm. We measured brain activations during somatosensory stimulation and motor tasks for each of the four limbs in ten individuals with a life-long desire for the amputation of the left leg and fourteen controls. For the left leg, BID individuals had reduced brain activation in the right superior parietal lobule for somatosensory stimulation and in the right paracentral lobule for the motor task, areas where we previously found reduced resting-state functional connectivity. In addition, for somatosensory stimulation only, we found a robust reduction in activation of somatosensory areas SII bilaterally, mostly regardless of the stimulated body part. Areas SII were regions of convergent activations for signals from all four limbs in controls to a significantly greater extent than in subjects with BID. We conclude that BID is associated with altered integration of somatosensory and, to a lesser extent, motor signals, involving limb-specific cortical maps and brain regions where the first integration of body-related signals is achieved through convergence.", 
    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by lingual and social disabilities. The autism diagnostic observation schedule is the current gold standard for ASD diagnosis. Developing objective computer aided technologies for ASD diagnosis with the utilization of brain imaging modalities and machine learning is one of main tracks in current studies to understand autism. Task-based fMRI demonstrates the functional activation in the brain by measuring blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) variations in response to certain tasks. It is believed to hold discriminant features for autism. A novel computer aided diagnosis (CAD) framework is proposed to classify 50 ASD and 50 typically developed toddlers with the adoption of CNN deep networks. The CAD system includes both local and global diagnosis in a response to speech task. Spatial dimensionality reduction with region of interest selection and clustering has been utilized. In addition, the proposed framework performs discriminant feature extraction with continuous wavelet transform. Local diagnosis on cingulate gyri, superior temporal gyrus, primary auditory cortex and angular gyrus achieves accuracies ranging between 71% and 80% with a four-fold cross validation technique. The fused global diagnosis achieves an accuracy of 86% with 82% sensitivity, 92% specificity. A brain map indicating ASD severity level for each brain area is created, which contributes to personalized diagnosis and treatment plans.",

    "abstract": "Background Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a potential alternative to task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) for somatomotor network (SMN) identification. Brain networks can also be generated from tb-fMRI by using independent component analysis (ICA). Purpose To investigate whether the SMN can be identified by using ICA from a language task without a motor component, the sentence completion functional MRI (sc-fMRI) task, compared with rs-fMRI. Materials and Methods The sc-fMRI and rs-fMRI scans in patients who underwent presurgical brain mapping between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed, using the same imaging parameters (other than scanning time) on a 3.0-T MRI scanner. ICA was performed on rs-fMRI and sc-fMRI scans with use of a tool to separate data sets into their spatial and temporal components. Two neuroradiologists independently determined the presence of the dorsal SMN (dSMN) and ventral SMN (vSMN) on each study. Groups were compared by using ", 
    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has significant potential to evaluate changes in brain network activity after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and enable early prognosis of potential functional (e.g., motor, cognitive, behavior) deficits. In this study, resting-state and task-based fMRI (rs- and tb-fMRI) were utilized to examine network changes in a pediatric porcine TBI model that has increased predictive potential in the development of novel therapies. rs- and tb-fMRI were performed one day post-TBI in piglets. Activation maps were generated using group independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse dictionary learning (sDL). Activation maps were compared to pig reference functional connectivity atlases and evaluated using Pearson spatial correlation coefficients and mean ratios. Nonparametric permutation analyses were used to determine significantly different activation areas between the TBI and healthy control groups. Significantly lower Pearson values and mean ratios were observed in the visual, executive control, and sensorimotor networks for TBI piglets compared to controls. Significant differences were also observed within several specific individual anatomical structures within each network. In conclusion, both rs- and tb-fMRI demonstrate the ability to detect functional connectivity disruptions in a translational TBI piglet model, and these disruptions can be traced to specific affected anatomical structures.", 
    "abstract": "Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) is suggested to be a viable option for pre-operative mapping for patients with brain tumours. However, it remains an open issue whether the tool is useful in the clinical setting compared to task-based fMRI (T-fMRI) and intraoperative mapping. Thus, a systematic review was conducted to investigate the usefulness of this technique.\nA systematic literature search of rs-fMRI methods applied as a pre-operative mapping tool was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Library electronic databases following PRISMA guidelines.\nResults demonstrated that 50% (six out of twelve) of the studies comparing rs-fMRI and T-fMRI showed good concordance for both language and sensorimotor networks. In comparison to intraoperative mapping, 86% (six out of seven) studies found a good agreement to rs-fMRI. Finally, 87% (twenty out of twenty-three) studies agreed that rs-fMRI is a suitable and useful pre-operative mapping tool.\nrs-fMRI is a promising technique for pre-operative mapping in assessing the functional brain areas. However, the agreement between rs-fMRI with other techniques, including T-fMRI and intraoperative maps, is not yet optimal. Studies to ascertain and improve the sophistication in pre-processing of rs-fMRI imaging data are needed.", 
    "abstract": "Task-based fMRI (TfMRI) is a diagnostic imaging modality for observing the effects of a disease or other condition on the functional activity of the brain. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder associated with impairments in social and linguistic abilities. Machine learning algorithms have been widely utilized for brain imaging aiming for objective ASD diagnostics. Recently, deep learning methods have been gaining more attention for fMRI classification. The goal of this paper is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to help in global diagnosis of ASD using TfMRI data that are collected from a response to speech experiment.\nTo achieve this goal, the proposed framework adopts a novel imaging marker integrating both spatial and temporal information that are related to the functional activity of the brain. The developed pipeline consists of three main components. In the first step, the collected TfMRI data are preprocessed and parcellated using the Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlas included with the fMRIB Software Library (FSL). Second, a group analysis using FSL is performed between ASD and typically developing (TD) children to identify significantly activated brain areas in response to the speech task. In order to reduce brain spatial dimensionality, a K-means clustering technique is performed on such significant brain areas. Informative blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals are extracted from each cluster. A compression step for each extracted BOLD signal using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been proposed. The adopted wavelets are similar to the expected hemodynamic response which enables DWT to compress the BOLD signal while highlighting its activation information. Finally, a deep learning 2D CNN network is used to classify the patients as ASD or TD based on extracted features from the previous step.\nPreliminary results on 100 TfMRI dataset (50 ASD, 50 TD) obtain 80% correct global classification using tenfold cross validation (with sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a084%, specificity\u00a0=\u00a076%).\nThe experimental results show the high accuracy of the proposed framework and hold promise for the presented framework as a helpful adjunct to currently used ASD diagnostic tools.", 
    "abstract": "Similarity analysis is one of the crucial steps in most fMRI studies. Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) can measure similarities of neural signatures generated by different cognitive states. This paper develops Deep Representational Similarity Learning (DRSL), a deep extension of RSA that is appropriate for analyzing similarities between various cognitive tasks in fMRI datasets with a large number of subjects, and high-dimensionality - such as whole-brain images. Unlike the previous methods, DRSL is not limited by a linear transformation or a restricted fixed nonlinear kernel function - such as Gaussian kernel. DRSL utilizes a multi-layer neural network for mapping neural responses to linear space, where this network can implement a customized nonlinear transformation for each subject separately. Furthermore, utilizing a gradient-based optimization in DRSL can significantly reduce runtime of analysis on large datasets because it uses a batch of samples in each iteration rather than all neural responses to find an optimal solution. Empirical studies on multi-subject fMRI datasets with various tasks - including visual stimuli, decision making, flavor, and working memory - confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art RSA algorithms.", 
    "abstract": "Observation of a goal-directed motor action can excite the respective mirror neurons, and this is the theoretical basis for action observation (AO) as a novel tool for functional recovery during stroke rehabilitation. To explore the therapeutic potential of AO for dysphagia, we conducted a task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to identify the brain areas activated during observation and execution of swallowing in healthy participants.\nTwenty-nine healthy volunteers viewed the following stimuli during fMRI scanning: an action-video of swallowing (condition 1, defined as AO), a neutral image with a Chinese word for \"watching\" (condition 2), and a neutral image with a Chinese word for \"swallowing\" (condition 3). Action execution (AE) was defined as condition 3 minus condition 2. One-sample \nMany brain regions were activated during AO, including the middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, pre- and postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, hippocampus, brainstem, and pons. AE resulted in activation of motor areas as well as other brain areas, including the inferior parietal lobule, vermis, middle frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. Two brain areas, BA6 and BA21, were activated with both AO and AE.\nThe left supplementary motor area (BA6) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA21), which contains mirror neurons, were activated in both AO and AE of swallowing. In this study, AO activated mirror neurons and the swallowing network in healthy participants, supporting its potential value in the treatment of dysphagia.", 
    "abstract": "The spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is fundamentally limited by effects from large draining veins. Here we describe an analysis method that provides data-driven estimates of these effects in task-based fMRI. The method involves fitting a one-dimensional manifold that characterizes variation in response timecourses observed in a given dataset, and then using identified early and late timecourses as basis functions for decomposing responses into components related to the microvasculature (capillaries and small venules) and the macrovasculature (large veins), respectively. We show the removal of late components substantially reduces the superficial cortical depth bias of fMRI responses and helps eliminate artifacts in cortical activity maps. This method provides insight into the origins of the fMRI signal and can be used to improve the spatial accuracy of fMRI.", 
    "abstract": "This review aims to establish the cognitive processing of patients with attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) across age. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on children and adult populations were conducted, thus delineating deficits that could have been maintained and ameliorated across age. This allowed for the examination of the correlation between patterns of brain activation and the corresponding development of functional heterogeneity in ADHD. A systematic literature search of fMRI studies on ADHD was conducted using the PubMed and Scopus electronic databases based on PRISMA guidelines. References and citations were verified in Scopus database. The present study has identified 14 studies on children, 16 studies on adults, and one study on both populations of ADHD consisting of 1371 participants. Functional heterogeneity is present in ADHD across age, which can manifest either as different brain activation patterns, intra-subject variability, or both. This is shown in the increased role of the frontal regions and the specialized network in adults with ADHD from inefficient non-specific activation in childhood. Functional heterogeneity may manifest when delayed maturation is insufficient to normalize frontal lobe functions.", 
    "abstract": "It has been shown that deep neural networks are powerful and flexible models that can be applied on fMRI data with superb representation ability over traditional methods. However, a challenge of neural network architecture design has also attracted attention: due to the high dimension of fMRI volume images, the manual process of network model design is very time-consuming and not optimal. To tackle this problem, we proposed an unsupervised neural architecture search (NAS) framework on a deep belief network (DBN) that models volumetric fMRI data, named NAS-DBN. The NAS-DBN framework is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) where the swarms of neural architectures can evolve and converge to a feasible optimal solution. The experiments showed that the proposed NAS-DBN framework can quickly find a robust architecture of DBN, yielding a hierarchy organization of functional brain networks (FBNs) and temporal responses. Compared with 3 manually designed DBNs, the proposed NAS-DBN has the lowest testing loss of 0.0197, suggesting an overall performance improvement of up to 47.9 %. For each task, the NAS-DBN identified 260 FBNs, including task-specific FBNs and resting state networks (RSN), which have high overlap rates to general linear model (GLM) derived templates and independent component analysis (ICA) derived RSN templates. The average overlap rate of NAS-DBN to GLM on 20 task-specific FBNs is as high as 0.536, indicating a performance improvement of up to 63.9 % in respect of network modeling. Besides, we showed that the NAS-DBN can simultaneously generate temporal responses that resemble the task designs very well, and it was observed that widespread overlaps between FBNs from different layers of NAS-DBN model form a hierarchical organization of FBNs. Our NAS-DBN framework contributes an effective, unsupervised NAS method for modeling volumetric task fMRI data.", 
    "abstract": "Replicating results (i.e. obtaining consistent results using a new independent dataset) is an essential part of good science. As replicability has consequences for theories derived from empirical studies, it is of utmost importance to better understand the underlying mechanisms influencing it. A popular tool for non-invasive neuroimaging studies is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While the effect of underpowered studies is well documented, the empirical assessment of the interplay between sample size and replicability of results for task-based fMRI studies remains limited. In this work, we extend existing work on this assessment in two ways. Firstly, we use a large database of 1400 subjects performing four types of tasks from the IMAGEN project to subsample a series of independent samples of increasing size. Secondly, replicability is evaluated using a multi-dimensional framework consisting of 3 different measures: (un)conditional test-retest reliability, coherence and stability. We demonstrate not only a positive effect of sample size, but also a trade-off between spatial resolution and replicability. When replicability is assessed voxelwise or when observing small areas of activation, a larger sample size than typically used in fMRI is required to replicate results. On the other hand, when focussing on clusters of voxels, we observe a higher replicability. In addition, we observe variability in the size of clusters of activation between experimental paradigms or contrasts of parameter estimates within these.", 
    "abstract": "In this study, a deep neural network (DNN) is proposed to reduce the noise in task-based fMRI data without explicitly modeling noise. The DNN artificial neural network consists of one temporal convolutional layer, one long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, one time-distributed fully-connected layer, and one unconventional selection layer in sequential order. The LSTM layer takes not only the current time point but also what was perceived in a previous time point as its input to characterize the temporal autocorrelation of fMRI data. The fully-connected layer weights the output of the LSTM layer, and the output denoised fMRI time series is selected by the selection layer. Assuming that task-related neural response is limited to gray matter, the model parameters in the DNN network are optimized by maximizing the correlation difference between gray matter voxels and white matter or ventricular cerebrospinal fluid voxels. Instead of targeting a particular noise source, the proposed neural network takes advantage of the task design matrix to better extract task-related signal in fMRI data. The DNN network, along with other traditional denoising techniques, has been applied on simulated data, working memory task fMRI data acquired from a cohort of healthy subjects and episodic memory task fMRI data acquired from a small set of healthy elderly subjects. Qualitative and quantitative measurements were used to evaluate the performance of different denoising techniques. In the simulation, DNN improves fMRI activation detection and also adapts to varying hemodynamic response functions across different brain regions. DNN efficiently reduces physiological noise and generates more homogeneous task-response correlation maps in real data.", 
    "abstract": "Subjective well-being (SWB) is the eternal pursuit of all mankind. Individual differences in SWB may reflect the way of emotional processing. Neuroimaging studies have partly examined the neural mechanism of the individual differences in SWB using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the individual differences in SWB and brain functional connectivity during facial emotion processing task. Here, we applied negative facial emotion processing task-based fMRI to explore the brain functional basis of the individual differences in SWB. Results showed that SWB is positively correlated with the activation of right posterior cingulate cortex, left interior temporal gyrus and left angular gyrus for the comparison of negative stimulus and neutral stimulus, revealing that happy individuals may be more proactive to use attention transfer and behavioral inhibition strategies to decrease negative experiences during negative emotional processing. In addition, high SWB is associated with strong functional connectivity between high-level cognitive networks (e.g., frontal-parietal network) and low-level perceptual networks (e.g., sensorimotor network), and weak functional connectivity within default mode network and within low-level perceptual networks, indicating that the self-reflection, emotional regulation and cognitive control during negative facial emotion processing underlies the individual differences in SWB. These findings provide a novel insight to characterize the brain functional basis of the individual differences in SWB.",

    "abstract": "Saccadic tasks are often used to index aberrations of cognitive function in patient populations, with several neuropsychiatric and neurologic disorders characterized by saccadic dysfunction. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has received recent attention as an additional primate model for studying the neural basis of these dysfunctions - marmosets are amenable to a host of genetic manipulation techniques and have a lissencephalic cortex, which is well suited for a variety of recording techniques (e.g., calcium imaging, laminar electrophysiology). Because the marmoset cortex is mostly lissencephalic, however, the locations of frontal saccade-related regions (e.g., frontal eye fields (FEF)) are less readily identified than in Old World macaque monkeys. Further, although high quality histology-based atlases do exist for marmosets, identifying these regions based on histology alone is not always accurate, with the cytoarchitectonic boundaries often inconsonant with functional boundaries. As such, there is a need to map the functional location of these regions directly. Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is of utility in this regard, allowing for detection of whole-brain signal changes in response to moving stimuli. Here, we conducted task-based fMRI in marmosets at ultra-high field (9.4\u202fT) during a free-viewing visuo-saccadic task. We also conducted the same task in humans at ultra-high field (7\u202fT) to validate that our simple task was indeed evoking the visuo-saccadic circuitry we expected (as defined by a meta-analysis of fMRI saccade studies). In the marmosets, we found that the task evoked a robust visuo-saccadic topology, with visual cortex (V1, V2, V3, V4) activation extending ventrally to MT, MST, FST and dorsally into V6, 19M, 23V. This topology also included putative cingulate eye field (area 32 and 24d), posterior parietal cortex (with strongest activation in lateral intraparietal area (LIP)), and a frontolateral peak in area 8\u202faV in marmosets, extending into 45, 46, 8aD, 6DR, 8c, 6\u202faV, 6DC. Overall, these results support the view that marmosets are a promising preclinical modelling species for studying saccadic dysfunction related to neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative human brain diseases.", 
    "abstract": "Single subject task-based fMRI analyses generally suffer from low detection sensitivity with parameter estimates from the general linear model (GLM) lying below the significance threshold especially for similar contrasts or conditions. In this paper, we present a shape-based approach for alignment of condition-specific time course activity for single subject task-based fMRI. Our approach extracts signals for each condition from the entire time course, constructs an unbiased average of those signals, and warps each signal to the mean. As the warping is diffeomorphic, non-linear and allows large deformations of time series if required, we term this approach as elastic functional registration. On a single subject level, our method significantly detects more clusters and more activated voxels in relevant subcortical regions in healthy controls.", 
    "abstract": "To better characterize the neural correlates of the full spectrum of reading ability, this fMRI study examined how variations in reading ability correlate with task-based brain activity during reading among a large community sample of adolescents (N\u2009=\u2009234). In addition, complimentary approaches taking advantage of empirical as well as independent meta-analytic information were employed to isolate neural substrates of domain-general executive processes that are predictive of reading ability. Age-related differences in brain activity were also examined. Better reading was associated with increased activation in left anterior and inferior temporal regions and parts of orbitofrontal cortex, along with reduced activation in the thalamus and left frontal eye field (FEF). Converging evidence suggests that FEF activity corresponds to executive processes during reading. In contrast, activity in temporal regions is likely to reflect cognitive processes specific to reading. Older adolescents also demonstrated increased activation in an orbitofrontal region that overlaps with the aforementioned age-independent, reading-related regions, along with reduced activity in parietal and occipital regions. These results suggest that comparedto poor readers, proficient readers benefit from efficient reading-specific processes and require less executive effort, implemented via the FEF, during a reading comprehension task.", 
    "abstract": "Our aim is to investigate whether rs-fMRI can be used as an effective technique to study language lateralization. We aim to find out the most appropriate language network among different networks identified using ICA.\nFifteen healthy right-handed subjects, sixteen left, and sixteen right temporal lobe epilepsy patients prospectively underwent MR scanning in 3T MRI (GE Discovery\u2122 MR750w), using optimized imaging protocol. We obtained task-fMRI data using a visual-verb generation paradigm. Rs-fMRI and language-fMRI analysis were conducted using FSL software. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to estimate rs-fMRI networks. Dice coefficient was calculated to examine the similarity in activated voxels of a common language template and the rs-fMRI language networks. Laterality index (LI) was calculated from the task-based language activation and rs-fMRI language network, for a range of LI thresholds at different z scores.\nMeasurement of hemispheric language dominance with rs-fMRI was highly concordant with task-fMRI results. Among the evaluated z scores for a range of LI thresholds, rs-fMRI yielded a maximum accuracy of 95%, a sensitivity of 83%, and specificity of 92.8% for z\u2009=\u20092 at 0.05 LI threshold.\nThe present study suggests that rs-fMRI networks obtained using ICA technique can be used as an alternative for task-fMRI language laterality.

    "abstract": "This study investigated how attending to auditory and visual information systematically changes graph theoretical measures of integration and functional connectivity between three network modules: auditory, visual, and a joint task core. Functional MRI BOLD activity was recorded while healthy volunteers attended to colour and/or pitch information presented within an audiovisual stimulus sequence. Network nodes and modules were based on peak voxels of BOLD contrasts, including colour and pitch sensitive brain regions as well as the dorsal attention network. Network edges represented correlations between nodes' activity and were computed separately for each condition. Connection strength was increased between the task and the visual module when participants attended to colour, and between the task and the auditory module when they attended to pitch. Moreover, several nodal graph measures showed consistent changes to attentional modulation in form of stronger integration of sensory regions in response to attention. Together, these findings corroborate dynamical adjustments of both modality-specific and modality-independent functional brain networks in response to task demands and their representation in graph theoretical measures.",

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of fMRI big data offers researchers an unprecedented opportunity to explore functional brain networks. However, this opportunity has not been fully explored yet due to the lack of effective and efficient tools for handling such fMRI big data. One major challenge is that computing capabilities still lag behind the growth of large-scale fMRI databases, e.g., it takes many days to perform dictionary learning and sparse coding of whole-brain fMRI data for an fMRI database of average size. Therefore, how to reduce the data size but without losing important information becomes a more and more pressing issue. To address this problem, we propose a signal sampling approach for significant fMRI data reduction before performing structurally-guided dictionary learning and sparse coding of whole brain's fMRI data. We compared the proposed structurally guided sampling method with no sampling, random sampling and uniform sampling schemes, and experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) task fMRI data demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve more than 15 times speed-up without sacrificing the accuracy in identifying task-evoked functional brain networks.", 
    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated neural responses during resting-state and reward-task-based fMRI and how these related to individual differences in self-reported reward sensitivity. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from 191 college students, and 60 of these individuals further finished a reward-related fMRI task. Self-reported reward-approach tendencies were assessed using the behavioral activation scale. Behavioral activation scale scores were positively correlated with brain activations in the striatum bilaterally during reward processing. During rest, behavioral activation scale scores were positively correlated with functional connectivity between the left and right striatum and with functional connectivity between the right striatum and right middle frontal gyrus. Positive correlations were found between task-based striatal activations and the functional connectivity between the left and right striatum at rest. These results suggest a relationship between striatal task-based reward-related activations and resting connectivity strengths that relate to individual differences in reward-approach tendencies.",

Therefore, availability and application of new data acquisition protocols allowing the shortening of scan time without compromising the data quality and statistical power are of major importance.\nHigher order category-selective visual cortical areas were identified individually, and rapid event-related fMRI design was used to compare three different sampling rates (TR\u2009=\u20092000, 1000, and 410\u00a0ms, using state-of-the-art simultaneous multislice imaging) and four different scanning lengths to match the statistical power of the traditional scanning methods to high sampling-rate design.\nThe results revealed that ~\u20094\u00a0min of the scan time with 1\u00a0Hz (TR\u2009=\u20091000\u00a0ms) sampling rate and ~\u20092\u00a0min scanning at ~\u20092.5\u00a0Hz (TR\u2009=\u2009410\u00a0ms) sampling rate provide similar localization sensitivity and selectivity to that obtained with 11-min session at conventional, 0.5\u00a0Hz (TR\u2009=\u20092000\u00a0ms) sampling rate.\nOur findings suggest that task-based fMRI examination of clinical population prone to distress such as presurgical mapping experiments might substantially benefit from the reduced (20-40%) scanning time that can be achieved by the application of simultaneous multislice sequences.", 
    "abstract": "Hypercoupling of activity in speech-perception-specific brain networks has been proposed to play a role in the generation of auditory-verbal hallucinations (AVHs) in schizophrenia; however, it is unclear whether this hypercoupling extends to nonverbal auditory perception. We investigated this by comparing schizophrenia patients with and without AVHs, and healthy controls, on task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data combining verbal speech perception (SP), inner verbal thought generation (VTG), and nonverbal auditory oddball detection (AO). Data from two previously published fMRI studies were simultaneously analyzed using group constrained principal component analysis for fMRI (group fMRI-CPCA), which allowed for comparison of task-related functional brain networks across groups and tasks while holding the brain networks under study constant, leading to determination of the degree to which networks are common to verbal and nonverbal perception conditions, and which show coordinated hyperactivity in hallucinations. Three functional brain networks emerged: (a) auditory-motor, (b) language processing, and (c) default-mode (DMN) networks. Combining the AO and sentence tasks allowed the auditory-motor and language networks to separately emerge, whereas they were aggregated when individual tasks were analyzed. AVH patients showed greater coordinated activity (deactivity for DMN regions) than non-AVH patients during SP in all networks, but this did not extend to VTG or AO. This suggests that the hypercoupling in AVH patients in speech-perception-related brain networks is specific to perceived speech, and does not extend to perceived nonspeech or inner verbal thought generation.",

Here we review the current state of test-retest reliability for child and adolescent fMRI studies (ages 5-18 years) as indexed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).

    "abstract": "Recently, a growing body of studies have demonstrated the simultaneous existence of diverse brain activities, e.g., task-evoked dominant response activities, delayed response activities and intrinsic brain activities, under specific task conditions. However, current dominant task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRI) analysis approach, i.e., the general linear model (GLM), might have difficulty in discovering those diverse and concurrent brain responses sufficiently. This subtraction-based model-driven approach focuses on the brain activities evoked directly from the task paradigm, thus likely overlooks other possible concurrent brain activities evoked during the information processing. To deal with this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel hybrid framework, called extendable supervised dictionary learning (E-SDL), to explore diverse and concurrent brain activities under task conditions. A critical difference between E-SDL framework and previous methods is that we systematically extend the basic task paradigm regressor into meaningful regressor groups to account for possible regressor variation during the information processing procedure in the brain. Applications of the proposed framework on five independent and publicly available tfMRI datasets from human connectome project (HCP) simultaneously revealed more meaningful group-wise consistent task-evoked networks and common intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). These results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed framework in identifying the diversity of concurrent brain activities in tfMRI datasets.", 
    "abstract": "Here we report an exploratory within-subject variance decomposition analysis conducted on a task-based fMRI dataset with an unusually large number of repeated measures (i.e., 500 trials in each of three different subjects) distributed across 100 functional scans and 9 to 10 different sessions. Within-subject variance was segregated into four primary components: variance across-sessions, variance across-runs within a session, variance across-blocks within a run, and residual measurement/modeling error. Our results reveal inhomogeneous and distinct spatial distributions of these variance components across significantly active voxels in grey matter. Measurement error is dominant across the whole brain. Detailed evaluation of the remaining three components shows that across-session variance is the second largest contributor to total variance in occipital cortex, while across-runs variance is the second dominant source for the rest of the brain. Network-specific analysis revealed that across-block variance contributes more to total variance in higher-order cognitive networks than in somatosensory cortex. Moreover, in some higher-order cognitive networks across-block variance can exceed across-session variance. These results help us better understand the temporal (i.e., across blocks, runs and sessions) and spatial distributions (i.e., across different networks) of within-subject natural variability in estimates of task responses in fMRI. They also suggest that different brain regions will show different natural levels of test-retest reliability even in the absence of residual artifacts and sufficiently high contrast-to-noise measurements. Further confirmation with a larger sample of subjects and other tasks is necessary to ensure generality of these results.", 
    "abstract": "Multi-echo fMRI, particularly the multi-echo independent component analysis (ME-ICA) algorithm, has previously proven useful for increasing the sensitivity and reducing false positives for functional MRI (fMRI) based resting state connectivity studies. Less is known about its efficacy for task-based fMRI, especially at the single subject level. This work, which focuses exclusively on individual subject results, compares ME-ICA to single-echo fMRI and a voxel-wise T2(\u204e) weighted combination of multi-echo data for task-based fMRI under the following scenarios: cardiac-gated block designs, constant repetition time (TR) block designs, and constant TR rapid event-related designs. Performance is evaluated primarily in terms of sensitivity (i.e., activation extent, activation magnitude, percent detected trials and effect size estimates) using five different tasks expected to evoke neuronal activity in a distributed set of regions. The ME-ICA algorithm significantly outperformed all other evaluated processing alternatives in all scenarios. Largest improvements were observed for the cardiac-gated dataset, where ME-ICA was able to reliably detect and remove non-neural T1 signal fluctuations caused by non-constant repetition times. Although ME-ICA also outperformed the other options in terms of percent detection of individual trials for rapid event-related experiments, only 46% of all events were detected after ME-ICA; suggesting additional improvements in sensitivity are required to reliably detect individual short event occurrences. We conclude the manuscript with a detailed evaluation of ME-ICA outcomes and a discussion of how the ME-ICA algorithm could be further improved. Overall, our results suggest that ME-ICA constitutes a versatile, powerful approach for advanced denoising of task-based fMRI, not just resting-state data.", 
    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) continues to develop as a clinical tool for patients with brain cancer, offering data that may directly influence surgical decisions. Unfortunately, routine integration of preoperative fMRI has been limited by concerns about reliability. Many pertinent studies have been undertaken involving healthy controls, but work involving brain tumor patients has been limited. To develop fMRI fully as a clinical tool, it will be critical to examine these reliability issues among patients with brain tumors. The present work is the first to extensively characterize differences in activation map quality between brain tumor patients and healthy controls, including the effects of tumor grade and the chosen behavioral testing paradigm on reliability outcomes.\nTest-retest data were collected for a group of low-grade (n = 6) and high-grade glioma (n = 6) patients, and for matched healthy controls (n = 12), who performed motor and language tasks during a single fMRI session. Reliability was characterized by the spatial overlap and displacement of brain activity clusters, BOLD signal stability, and the laterality index. Significance testing was performed to assess differences in reliability between the patients and controls, and low-grade and high-grade patients; as well as between different fMRI testing paradigms.\nThere were few significant differences in fMRI reliability measures between patients and controls. Reliability was significantly lower when comparing high-grade tumor patients to controls, or to low-grade tumor patients. The motor task produced more reliable activation patterns than the language tasks, as did the rhyming task in comparison to the phonemic fluency task.\nIn low-grade glioma patients, fMRI data are as reliable as healthy control subjects. For high-grade glioma patients, further investigation is required to determine the underlying causes of reduced reliability. To maximize reliability outcomes, testing paradigms should be carefully selected to generate robust activation patterns.", 
    "abstract": "Optimal contrast to noise ratio of the BOLD signal in neonatal and foetal fMRI has been hard to achieve because of the much longer T2(\u204e) values in developing brain tissue in comparison to those in the mature adult brain. The conventional approach of optimizing fMRI sequences would suggest matching the echo time (TE) and the T2(\u204e) of the neonatal and foetal brain. However, the use of a long echo time would typically increase the minimum repetition time (TR) resulting in inefficient sampling. Here we apply the concept of echo shifting to task based neonatal fMRI in order to achieve an improved contrast to noise ratio and efficient data sampling at the same time. Echo shifted EPI (es-EPI) is a modification of a standard 2D-EPI sequence which enables echo times longer than the time between consecutive excitations (TE>TS=TRNS, where NS is the number of acquired slices and TS the inter-slice repetition time). The proposed method was tested on neonatal subjects using a passive sensori-motor task paradigm. Dual echo EPI datasets with an identical readout structure to es-EPI were also acquired and used as control data to assess BOLD activation. From the results of the latter analysis, an average increase of 78\u00b141% in contrast to noise ratio was observable when comparing late to short echoes. Furthermore, es-EPI allowed the acquisition of data with an identical contrast to the late echo, but more efficiently since a higher number of slices could be acquired in the same amount of time.", 
    "abstract": "The growth of functional MRI has led to development of human brain atlases derived by parcellating resting-state connectivity patterns into functionally independent regions of interest (ROIs). All functional atlases to date have been derived from resting-state fMRI data. But given that functional connectivity between regions varies with task, we hypothesized that an atlas incorporating both resting-state and task-based fMRI data would produce an atlas with finer characterization of task-relevant regions than an atlas derived from resting-state alone. To test this hypothesis, we derived parcellation atlases from twenty-nine healthy adult participants enrolled in the Cognitive Connectome project, an initiative to improve functional MRI's translation into clinical decision-making by mapping normative variance in brain-behavior relationships. Participants underwent resting-state and task-based fMRI spanning nine cognitive domains: motor, visuospatial, attention, language, memory, affective processing, decision-making, working memory, and executive function. Spatially constrained n-cut parcellation derived brain atlases using (1) all participants' functional data (Task) or (2) a single resting-state scan (Rest). An atlas was also derived from random parcellation for comparison purposes (Random). Two methods were compared: (1) a parcellation applied to the group's mean edge weights (mean), and (2) a two-stage approach with parcellation of individual edge weights followed by parcellation of mean binarized edges (two-stage). The resulting Task and Rest atlases had significantly greater similarity with each other (mean Jaccard indices JI=0.72-0.85) than with the Random atlases (JI=0.59-0.63; all p<0.001 after Bonferroni correction). Task and Rest atlas similarity was greatest for the two-stage method (JI=0.85), which has been shown as more robust than the mean method; these atlases also better reproduced voxelwise seed maps of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during rest and performing the n-back working memory task (r=0.75-0.80) than the Random atlases (r=0.64-0.72), further validating their utility. We expected regions governing higher-order cognition (such as frontal and anterior temporal lobes) to show greatest difference between Task and Rest atlases; contrary to expectations, these areas had greatest similarity between atlases. Our findings indicate that atlases derived from parcellation of task-based and resting-state fMRI data are highly comparable, and existing resting-state atlases are suitable for task-based analyses. We introduce an anatomically labeled fMRI-derived whole-brain human atlas for future Cognitive Connectome analyses.", 
    "abstract": "Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) is a frequent neurological disorder characterized by the production of tics, and frequently associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The aim of this article is to summarize the contribution of imaging activation techniques to the study of the syndrome.\nGTS has been studied with a variety of functional MRI (fMRI)/PET activation paradigms to characterize the origin of tics or their suppression, and how they compare physiologically with voluntary actions or response inhibitions. Current studies indicate overactivations of prefrontal and premotor cortices, including the supplementary motor area, and subcortical structures. Resting state functional connectivity studies complement activation studies in showing perturbed connectivity of cortico-subcortical networks. Several such findings correlate with the severity of the disease.\nfMRI activation techniques are contributing a system-level neurophysiological description of GTS and bridge the gap between animal models and clinical observations. fMRI clarifies brain networks involved in different aspects of GTS phenomenology with some good clinical face validity. A future generation of fMRI studies should have higher ambitions and contribute, for example, to treatment optimization including the identification of ideal targets for deep brain stimulation in drug-resistant cases; however, such goals will be achieved only through controlled large-scale cooperative studies.", 
    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that require high-resolution whole-brain coverage have long scan times that are primarily driven by the large number of thin slices acquired. Two-dimensional multiband echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences accelerate the data acquisition along the slice direction and therefore represent an attractive approach to such studies by improving the temporal resolution without sacrificing spatial resolution. In this work, a 2D multiband EPI sequence was optimized for 1.5mm isotropic whole-brain acquisitions at 3T with 10 healthy volunteers imaged while performing simultaneous visual and motor tasks. The performance of the sequence was evaluated in terms of BOLD sensitivity and false-positive activation at multiband (MB) factors of 1, 2, 4, and 6, combined with in-plane GRAPPA acceleration of 2\u00d7 (GRAPPA 2), and the two reconstruction approaches of Slice-GRAPPA and Split Slice-GRAPPA. Sensitivity results demonstrate significant gains in temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) and t-score statistics for MB 2, 4, and 6 compared to MB 1. The MB factor for optimal sensitivity varied depending on anatomical location and reconstruction method. When using Slice-GRAPPA reconstruction, evidence of false-positive activation due to signal leakage between simultaneously excited slices was seen in one instance, 35 instances, and 70 instances over the ten volunteers for the respective accelerations of MB 2\u00d7GRAPPA 2, MB 4\u00d7GRAPPA 2, and MB 6\u00d7GRAPPA 2. The use of Split Slice-GRAPPA reconstruction suppressed the prevalence of false positives significantly, to 1 instance, 5 instances, and 5 instances for the same respective acceleration factors. Imaging protocols using an acceleration factor of MB 2\u00d7GRAPPA 2 can be confidently used for high-resolution whole-brain imaging to improve BOLD sensitivity with very low probability for false-positive activation due to slice leakage. Imaging protocols using higher acceleration factors (MB 3 or MB 4\u00d7GRAPPA 2) can likely provide even greater gains in sensitivity but should be carefully optimized to minimize the possibility of false activations.", 
    "abstract": "The neural substrates of visual hallucinations remain an enigma, due primarily to the difficulties associated with directly interrogating the brain during hallucinatory episodes.\nTo delineate the functional patterns of brain network activity and connectivity underlying visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.\nIn this study, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a behavioral task capable of eliciting visual misperceptions, a confirmed surrogate for visual hallucinations, in 35 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. We then applied an independent component analysis to extract time series information for large-scale neuronal networks that have been previously implicated in the pathophysiology of visual hallucinations. These data were subjected to a task-based functional connectivity analysis, thus providing the first objective description of the neural activity and connectivity during visual hallucinations in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nCorrect performance of the task was associated with increased activity in primary visual regions; however, during visual misperceptions, this same visual network became actively coupled with the default mode network (DMN). Further, the frequency of misperception errors on the task was positively correlated with the strength of connectivity between these two systems, as well as with decreased activity in the dorsal attention network (DAN), and with impaired connectivity between the DAN and the DMNs, and ventral attention networks. Finally, each of the network abnormalities identified in our analysis were significantly correlated with two independent clinical measures of hallucination severity.\nTogether, these results provide evidence that visual hallucinations are due to increased engagement of the DMN with the primary visual system, and emphasize the role of dysfunctional engagement of attentional networks in the pathophysiology of hallucinations.", 
    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series are subject to corruption by many noise sources, especially physiological noise and motion. Researchers have developed many methods to reduce physiological noise, including RETROICOR, which retroactively removes cardiac and respiratory waveforms collected during the scan, and CompCor, which applies principal components analysis (PCA) to remove physiological noise components without any physiological monitoring during the scan.\nWe developed four variants of the CompCor method. The optimized CompCor method applies PCA to time series in a noise mask, but orthogonalizes each component to the BOLD response waveform and uses an algorithm to determine a favorable number of components to use as \"nuisance regressors.\" Whole brain component correction (WCompCor) is similar, except that it applies PCA to time-series throughout the whole brain. Low-pass component correction (LCompCor) identifies low-pass filtered components throughout the brain, while high-pass component correction (HCompCor) identifies high-pass filtered components.\nWe compared the new methods with the original CompCor method by examining the resulting functional contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), sensitivity, and specificity.\n(1) The optimized CompCor method increased the CNR and sensitivity compared to the original CompCor method and (2) the application of WCompCor yielded the best improvement in the CNR and sensitivity.\nThe sensitivity of the optimized CompCor, WCompCor, and LCompCor methods exceeded that of the original CompCor method. However, regressing noise signals showed a paradoxical consequence of reducing specificity for all noise reduction methods attempted.", 
    "abstract": "Simulation studies on emotion have shown that facial actions can initiate and modulate particular emotions. However, the neural mechanisms of these initiating and modulating functions are unclear. In this study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and task-based fMRI to explore these processes by examining spontaneous cerebral activities and brain activations under two conditions: holding a pen using only the teeth (HPT: facilitating the muscles typically associated with smiling) and holding a pen using only the lips (HPL: inhibiting the muscles typically associated with smiling). The resting-state fMRI results showed that compared with the HPL condition, significant increases in the amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations were found in the right posterior cingulate gyrus [PCG; Brodmann area 31 (BA31)] and in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG; BA9) in the HPT condition. These findings might be related to the initiation of positive emotions (PCG) and to the control and allocation of attention (MFG). The task-based fMRI results showed that the inferior parietal lobule, left supplementary motor area, superior parietal lobule, precuneus, and bilateral middle cingulum were active when facial manipulation influenced the recognition of emotional facial expressions. These results demonstrate that facial actions might not only initiate a particular emotion and draw attention, but also influence face-based emotion recognition.", 
    "abstract": "Patients with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) commonly demonstrate motor impairments, suggesting that frontal lobe seizures affect motor function. However, the underlying mechanisms of these deficits are not known, nor has any study systematically examined motor organization in these patients. We therefore examined cortical motor organization in a group of adult patients with FLE, using task-based fMRI.\nEleven right FLE patients, six left FLE patients, and ten control subjects underwent task-based fMRI. Two tasks were performed using the right and left hands separately, and both hands together. The first task was a finger-tapping task and the second task was a more complex coordination task. Functional MR data were compared between patient groups and controls. A laterality index of brain activation was also calculated between the epileptic and healthy hemisphere to determine hemispheric dominance during task performance to explore its relationship with a variety of patient-specific epilepsy factors.\nOverall, right FLE patients demonstrated decreased BOLD activity in the epileptic hemisphere and increased BOLD activity in the healthy hemisphere compared to controls (p<0.05). The comparison of left FLE patients to controls provided less conclusive differences, possibly due to the low number of left FLE patients studied. Laterality indices of the coordination task were positively correlated to the number of months since the last seizure in both patient groups (right FLE: rs=0.779, left FLE: rs=0.943). Patients that had experienced a recent seizure relied more on the sensorimotor cortex of the healthy hemisphere during task performance, compared to those that were relatively seizure free (p<0.05).\nPatients with FLE exhibited changes in motor BOLD activity that was dependent on the duration of seizure freedom. These results demonstrate the presence of seizure-related alteration of cortical motor organization in FLE, which may underlie the motor deficits seen in these patients.", 
    "abstract": "Traditional task-based fMRI activation detection methods, e.g., the widely used general linear model (GLM), assume that the brain's hemodynamic responses follow the block-based or event-related stimulus paradigm. Typically, these activation detections are performed voxel-wise independently, and then are usually followed by statistical corrections. Despite remarkable successes and wide adoption of these methods, it remains largely unknown how functional brain regions interact with each other within specific networks during task performance blocks and in the baseline. In this paper, we present a novel algorithmic pipeline to statistically infer and sparsely represent higher-order functional interaction patterns within the working memory network during task performance and in the baseline. Specifically, a collection of higher-order interactions are inferred via the greedy equivalence search (GES) algorithm for both task and baseline blocks. In the next stage, an effective online dictionary learning algorithm is utilized for sparse representation of the inferred higher-order interaction patterns. Application of this framework on a working memory task-based fMRI data reveals interesting and meaningful distributions of the learned sparse dictionary atoms in task and baseline blocks. In comparison with traditional voxel-wise activation detection and recent pair-wise functional connectivity analysis, our framework offers a new methodology for representation and exploration of higher-order functional activities in the brain.", 
    "abstract": "In task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers seek to measure fMRI signals related to a given task or condition. In many circumstances, measuring this signal of interest is limited by noise. In this study, we present GLMdenoise, a technique that improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by entering noise regressors into a general linear model (GLM) analysis of fMRI data. The noise regressors are derived by conducting an initial model fit to determine voxels unrelated to the experimental paradigm, performing principal components analysis (PCA) on the time-series of these voxels, and using cross-validation to select the optimal number of principal components to use as noise regressors. Due to the use of data resampling, GLMdenoise requires and is best suited for datasets involving multiple runs (where conditions repeat across runs). We show that GLMdenoise consistently improves cross-validation accuracy of GLM estimates on a variety of event-related experimental datasets and is accompanied by substantial gains in SNR. To promote practical application of methods, we provide MATLAB code implementing GLMdenoise. Furthermore, to help compare GLMdenoise to other denoising methods, we present the Denoise Benchmark (DNB), a public database and architecture for evaluating denoising methods. The DNB consists of the datasets described in this paper, a code framework that enables automatic evaluation of a denoising method, and implementations of several denoising methods, including GLMdenoise, the use of motion parameters as noise regressors, ICA-based denoising, and RETROICOR/RVHRCOR. Using the DNB, we find that GLMdenoise performs best out of all of the denoising methods we tested.", 
    "abstract": "The large-scale sharing of task-based functional neuroimaging data has the potential to allow novel insights into the organization of mental function in the brain, but the field of neuroimaging has lagged behind other areas of bioscience in the development of data sharing resources. This paper describes the OpenFMRI project (accessible online at http://www.openfmri.org), which aims to provide the neuroimaging community with a resource to support open sharing of task-based fMRI studies. We describe the motivation behind the project, focusing particularly on how this project addresses some of the well-known challenges to sharing of task-based fMRI data. Results from a preliminary analysis of the current database are presented, which demonstrate the ability to classify between task contrasts with high generalization accuracy across subjects, and the ability to identify individual subjects from their activation maps with moderately high accuracy. Clustering analyses show that the similarity relations between statistical maps have a somewhat orderly relation to the mental functions engaged by the relevant tasks. These results highlight the potential of the project to support large-scale multivariate analyses of the relation between mental processes and brain function.", 
    "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric disorder affecting 5% of children. Methylphenidate (MPH) is a common medication for ADHD. Studies examining MPH's effect on pediatric ADHD patients' brain function using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have not been compiled. The goals of this systematic review were to determine (1) which areas of the brain in pediatric ADHD patients are modulated by a single dose of MPH, (2) whether areas modulated by MPH differ by task type performed during fMRI data acquisition, and (3) whether changes in brain activation due to MPH relate to clinical improvements in ADHD-related symptoms.\nWe searched the electronic databases PubMed and PsycINFO (1967-2011) using the following terms: ADHD AND (methylphenidate OR MPH OR ritalin) AND (neuroimaging OR MRI OR fMRI OR BOLD OR event related), and identified 200 abstracts, 9 of which were reviewed based on predefined criteria.\nIn ADHD patients the middle and inferior frontal gyri, basal ganglia, and cerebellum were most often affected by MPH. The middle and inferior frontal gyri were frequently affected by MPH during inhibitory control tasks. Correlation between brain regions and clinical improvement was not possible due to the lack of symptom improvement measures within the included studies.\nThroughout nine task-based fMRI studies investigating MPH's effect on the brains of pediatric patients with ADHD, MPH resulted in increased activation within frontal lobes, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. In most cases, this increase \"normalized\" activation of at least some brain areas to that seen in typically developing children.", 
    "abstract": "In task-based fMRI, the generalized linear model (GLM) is widely used to detect activated brain regions. A fundamental assumption in the GLM model for fMRI activation detection is that the brain's response, represented by the blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals of volumetric voxels, follows the shape of stimulus paradigm. Based on this same assumption, we use the dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) curves between two ends of a white matter fiber, instead of the BOLD signal, to represent the brain's response, and apply the GLM to detect Activated Fibers (AFs). Our rational is that brain regions connected by white matter fibers tend to be more synchronized during stimulus intervals than during baseline intervals. Therefore, the DFC curves for fibers connecting active brain regions should be positively correlated with the stimulus paradigm, which is verified by our extensive experiments using multimodal task-based fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Our results demonstrate that the detected AFs connect not only most of the activated brain regions detected via traditional voxel-based GLM method, but also many other brain regions, suggesting that the voxel-based GLM method may be too conservative in detecting activated brain regions.",
