    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with limited pharmacologic therapies. Recent animal studies and one large retrospective study have found NSAIDs to be protective against the development of PD. We decided to test this hypothesis by conducting a nested case-control study using the Saskatchewan drug plan database. Entry to the cohort was defined as the first prescription of an antihypertensive agent between 1980 and 1987 and followed until 1999. Cases were defined as those having received three prescriptions for a dopamine agonist within a year. For each case, ten controls were selected matched to the case by age, calendar time and index date. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate rate ratios adjusting for gender, previous use of arthritis medication and previous antipsychotic use. Current users of NSAIDs had a slightly higher risk of developing PD (RR=1.49 [95% CI, 1.11-2.01]). This effect was not seen with past users (RR=1.18 [95% CI, 0.89-1.59]). Based on the results of our study current users of NSAIDs may be at a slightly higher risk of developing PD. More studies are needed to confirm this finding.",

    "abstract": "This review addresses the literature surrounding Parkinson's disease (PD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It discusses the neuropsychological, pharmaceutical, and pathological overlap, the socioeconomic impact of PD and MCI, and the value of recognizing, understanding, and treating MCI in PD. It is concluded from this review that MCI in PD does exist and should be considered in clinical and research investigations. Due to the lack of accepted clinical criteria, an inclusive operating definition of MCI in PD is proposed. Research guidelines for studying the presence of MCI in PD and evaluating the efficacy of pharmaceutical interventions are also suggested.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with motor fluctuations that have been shown to improve when stable plasma levodopa levels are achieved with continuous levodopa infusions. Many patients also develop mood fluctuations. In this pilot study, we gathered preliminary information about the relationship between changing mood states and plasma levodopa levels.\nSix patients with idiopathic PD and histories of motor and mood fluctuations participated in a double-blind levodopa infusion study. Subjects received active oral carbidopa/levodopa and a placebo levodopa infusion on one day and placebo oral carbidopa/levodopa and an active levodopa infusion on the other day, in a randomly determined order. Evaluations included serial plasma levodopa levels and assessments of mood and motor states.\nOnly 4 of the 6 subjects demonstrated mood fluctuations on at least one of the treatment days. All subjects achieved more stable plasma levodopa levels on the active infusion day. Two subjects experienced fewer mood fluctuations on the active infusion day and two experienced fewer on the oral day. Conclusions The results of this pilot study suggest that the relationship between mood state and plasma levodopa level may vary among PD patients.",

    "abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that left versus right deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) would have differential effects on speech. Twenty right-handed individuals with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) underwent unilateral STN DBS. Ten were operated on the right and 10 on the left hemisphere as indicated by severity of nonspeech motor function. Speech was evaluated before surgery and 3 to 6 months after surgery with stimulator-off and with stimulator-on, with all participants off anti-parkinsonian medication for 12 hours before evaluation. Evaluators and patient speakers were blinded to the stimulator status at the postsurgery evaluations. Motor performance was assessed with UPDRS-III. Each participant produced three samples of diadochokinetic syllables. Syllable rate, syllable and vowel duration, VOT, and F0 were obtained. The diadochokinetic syllables were rated for articulatory accuracy and speaking rate. Twenty graduate clinicians served as judges. The samples were randomly presented via headphones. A mixed ANOVA with repeated measures was used to assess the significance of the changes in UPRS-III scores and speech measures. The results indicated that unilateral STN DBS produced improvement in nonspeech motor function regardless of the side of stimulation. In contrast, the changes in articulatory accuracy and syllable rate associated with the STN DBS were hemisphere specific.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has long been associated with dementia. This has been found to correlate with participant age, age at onset of PD and severity of PD. In addition, a large corpus of research points to the fact that participants with, as well as without, dementia can be impaired in a variety of cognitive tasks. Among these, set-shifting and dual-tasking skills have received particular focus. Most studies report that a reduction in attentional resources can lead to problems with these tasks. However, none have been able to determine exactly which systems are involved in these skills and which neurological impairments underlie the observed cognitive deficits. The current study set out to investigate how performance on tasks requiring set-shifting and dual tasking related to each other, as well as overall measures of cognition gained across a variety of tasks. Fifteen participants with PD and 12 control participants underwent screening tests for dementia, as well as specific tests to assess attention, set-shifting and dual tasking. The results indicate that set-shifting ability correlated well with other measures of cognitive performance, whereas dual-tasking skills did not. This could suggest that set-shifting and dual tasking are not necessarily controlled by the same process, or that a particular process is involved to different degrees. In addition, many participants showed individual performance variations and dissociations between tasks that were not necessarily evident from the statistical analysis. This indicates that it can be difficult to make assumptions on overall cognitive performance from specific tasks and vice versa. This observation has implications for clinical practice as well as research methodology.",

    "abstract": "Incidence of parkinsonism prior age 40 is observed in only 5% of total number of patients, under age of 20 it's very rare.\nMale patient, age of 16 was hospitalized at Neurology Clinic regarding depression and anxiety, social withdrawal, studyng difficulties, lack of concentration, hands tremor and impaired balance. Difficulties started slow, three years before hospitalisation with affective symptoms. There was no history of similar disease in patient's family. During neurological examination signs which suggested extrapyramidal lesion were found (tremor, Cogwheel type of rigor, postural difficulties). Diagnosis of juvenile form of parkinsonism was set. Basic laboratory findings including serum caeruloplasmin and cooper level were normal. Neuroradiological investigations were without pathological signs, and visual evoked potentials were patological with left side lateralisation. Psychological tests suggested anxious personality characteristics with high emotional sensitivity, mental control and memory difficulties. Pharmacological approach with direct dopamine agonist (Bromocriptine) was started. On 7.5 mg daily significant reduction of symptoms was observed.\nIn affective disturbances at younger population differential diagnosis rare form of juvenile parkinsonism should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammatory processes play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Epidemiologic, animal, human, and therapeutic studies all support the presence of an neuroinflammatory cascade in disease. This is highlighted by the neurotoxic potential of microglia . In steady state, microglia serve to protect the nervous system by acting as debris scavengers, killers of microbial pathogens, and regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses. In neurodegenerative diseases, activated microglia affect neuronal injury and death through production of glutamate, pro-inflammatory factors, reactive oxygen species, quinolinic acid amongst others and by mobilization of adaptive immune responses and cell chemotaxis leading to transendothelial migration of immunocytes across the blood-brain barrier and perpetuation of neural damage. As disease progresses, inflammatory secretions engage neighboring glial cells, including astrocytes and endothelial cells, resulting in a vicious cycle of autocrine and paracrine amplification of inflammation perpetuating tissue injury. Such pathogenic processes contribute to neurodegeneration in PD. Research from others and our own laboratories seek to harness such inflammatory processes with the singular goal of developing therapeutic interventions that positively affect the tempo and progression of human disease.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a finger taps acceleration measurement system for the quantitative diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The system was composed of two 3-axis piezoelectric element accelerometers, a pair of touch sensors made of thin stainless steel sheets, an analog-digital(AD) converter and a personal computer (PC). Fingerstalls,with these sensors, were attached to subject's index finger and thumb. The acceleration and output of the touch sensors were recorded using the PC during the finger taps movements. Intervals between the single finger taps movements were calculated from the measured output of the touch sensors. Velocities during the single finger taps movements were calculated by integrating the measured acceleration. The amplitudes were calculated by integrating the velocities. The standard deviation of the single finger taps intervals, average of maximum single finger taps velocities and average of maximum single finger taps amplitudes were calculated from them. They were used as features for the quantitative diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The developed system was used to conduct finger taps tests employing 27 normal subjects and 16 Parkinson's diseases subjects. The subjects were asked to execute continuous finger taps movement for 60 s. It was shown that the acceleration and output of the touch sensors could be measured and the features could be extracted.",

    "abstract": "Fluctuating Parkinson's disease (PD) represents a clinical management challenge. The primary utility of levodopa in patients with PD is moderated by the \"wearing off\" phenomena seen with long-term use. COMT inhibitors slow down the rapid metabolism of levodopa, resulting in a more-sustained response to dopaminergic therapy. Tolcapone is a selective, reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, shown to have both peripheral and central effects. In clinical trials, tolcapone has been shown to reduce \"off\" time, increase \"on\" time, improve patient and clinician assessments of disease severity, and improve patient quality of life. In a SWITCH study, tolcapone was associated with greater duration of \"on\" time than remaining on entacapone. Adverse effects of tolcapone are related to the class, with the exception of rare cases of hepatotoxicity. Tolcapone has been recently reintroduced on the European market and recent guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration has reduced the hepatic monitoring requirements for patients initiating tolcapone therapy. With proper monitoring, tolcapone is an effective, well-tolerated drug useful in the management of patients with fluctuating PD.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of PD can be difficult in elderly patients because some of the key PD symptoms also may be manifestations of normal aging. Asymmetrical symptom onset, resting tremor,and sustained response to levodopa are key features that suggest a diagnosis of PD. For most patients, PD progresses fairly slowly. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms, thereby allowing quality of life and functional ability to be maintained. Pharmacologic therapies are primarily targeted at stimulating dopaminergic receptors, either by increasing the levels of dopamine or by using dopamine agonists. Levodopa, the main therapy for PD and a precursor of dopamine, has a short half-life and is quickly metabolized.Accordingly, decarboxylase inhibitors, like carbidopa, are almost always administered with levodopa to prevent breakdown in the periphery. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)inhibitors, which increase dopamine levels by inhibiting the metabolism of levodopa and dopamine, recently have become available, including a tablet containing carbidopa, levodopa,and entacapone. Other pharmaceutical therapies for PD include dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, anticholinergic agents, and amantadine. Dopamine agonists, anticholinergic agents, and amantadine are associated with an increased risk of hallucinations or other adverse events in elderly patients; therefore, use of these should be avoided in this population. Surgical management, particularly deep brain stimulation(DBS), is an option for patients who are refractory to pharmaceutical therapy. Although patients may not need levodopa as an initial treatment, over time most patients will require this drug to control symptoms. With chronic levodopa therapy, patients ultimately experience a wearing off in levodopa response and other motor complications. Management of wearing off is a significant challenge in the treatment of patients with advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have been performed with automatic motion analysis techniques to investigated the locomotor disorders of patients with severe Parkinson's disease (PD). These are mainly related to steady-state walking. Aim of the present study was to investigate the presence and the degree of these disorders in patients at early stages of PD. For this purpose a group of patients with mild PD (H&Y < or =2) and a group of age-matched controls were assessed by means of multifactorial analysis of kinematic and kinetic variables, during the execution of the following motor tasks: steady-state walking, gait initiation and turning around an obstacle. Results showed that PD patients did not differ from controls in steady-state walking, while significant differences emerged in gait initiation and turning strategies. Main differences consisted in a limitation of the amplitude of the imbalance phase and of the first step, and, for the turning task, in a delayed initiation of the turning movement, with an altered head-trunk rotational strategy. It is concluded that patients in early stages of PD do not reveal, during steady state walking, consistent impairments of kinematic and kinetic patterns typical of severe PD patients. Nevertheless, they present significant alterations in transient conditions such as gait initiation and change of walking direction. The above results suggest that a quantitative analysis of locomotor tasks which imply the transition from one condition to another, could provide parameters useful for the characterization of early stage PD patients and, potentially, markers for a precox differential diagnosis respect other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by parkinsonisms.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, gait dysfunction, and postural instability. Several genes have been identified for monogenic disorders that variably resemble Parkinson's disease. Here, we focus on PARK7, a gene relates to an autosomal recessive form of early-onset Parkinsonism and encodes a protein named DJ-1. Though the exact role of DJ-1 needs to be elucidated, it is generally thought to be functioned as a molecular chaperone and an oxidative sensor (or antioxidative factor). We will review the protective role of DJ-1 to prevent dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) from degeneration and how its dysfunction would lead to neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Objective To observe the influence of rotenone on the distribution of alpha-synuclein (ASN) in rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups and received 2 mg/kg rotenone (s.c.) or sunflower oil (as control group) for about 4 weeks. The hippocampus, substantia nigra and striatum of brain were observed. Hematoxylin and eosin stain were used to observe the Lewy body like inclusion. The expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or ASN protein was determined by anti-TH or anti-alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results In control rats, ASN protein distributed widely in brain, especially in hippocampus, cortex and striatum. Rotenone obviously increased TH positive neurons and fibers loss in substantia nigra and striatum (P < 0.05). In rotenone treated rats, ASN positive cells increased in global brain but not distributed in an even manner. In substantia nigra, ASN positive stuff was found aggregate in both cytoplasm and nucleus, and some formed spherical inclusion; in striatum, ASN positive neurites end aggregated and agglomerated around neurons; and in hippocampus, few dot-like ASN were aggregated in cell body, and no notable change was found in nucleus. Conclusion In rotenone administrated PD rats, ASN protein aggregated in several brain regions but most obviously in striatum and substantia nigra, and the distribution region of ASN was changed from peri-synapse to the cytoplasm and nucleus of dopaminergic neuron.",

    "abstract": "In a paper entitled Bundle-branch block with short P-R interval in healthy young people prone to paroxysmal tachycardia (Am Heart J 1930; 5: 685-704), Dr. Louis Wolff (1898-1972), Sir John Parkinson (1885-1976) and Paul Dudley White (1886-1973) described an intricate syndrome. Prior case reports had already pointed out the essentials of this entity, which has borne the eponym (WPW syndrome) since the publication by Levine and Beeson (Am Heart J 1941; 22: 401-409). It was long thought that the first patient with a short PR interval, delta-wave-induced widening of the QRS complex and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) was described by Cohn and Fraser in the prestigious cardiological journal edited by Sir Thomas Lewis (1881-1945) in London, UK (Heart 1913/1914; 5: 93-107). Shortly afterwards, Dr J\u00e1nos Angy\u00e1n (1886-1969), a school-founder chairman of medicine (1923-1959) at the University of P\u00e9cs, Hungary, also published a clear-cut case of intermittent WPW syndrome in the German periodical Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Herz- und Gef\u00e4sskrankheiten (1914; 6: 345-349]. In fact, Angy\u00e1n should be considered the first Hungarian \"cardiologist\" who dealt steadily with heart diseases and rhythm disturbances. Quite reently, thanks to the activities of Dr Georg von Knorre, Rostock (PACE 2005; 28: 228-230) we have learnt that the earliest documented case of ECGs with ventricular preexcitation and PSVT (\"Herzjagen\") was published by August Hoffmann (1862-1929) in the 2 Nov 1909 issue of M\u00fcnchener Medizinische Wochenschrift (56: 2259-2262; Figures 10 and 11). Hoffmann worked as an internist/neurologist and was director of the university hospital in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. The first successful surgical division of an atrioventricular accessory pathway (bundle of Kent), by Sealy and his coworkers at the Duke University Medical Center in 1967, led to the modern era of curative transcatheter ablation for WPW patients by radiofrequency alternative current or, nowadays, by transvenous cryoablative catheter techniques. Our current knowledge and day-to-day clinical practice is the result of marvelous contributions from numerous dedicated scientists in diverse disciplines in many countries.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic stem (ES) cells are genetically normal, continuous cell lines that can give rise to a variety of somatic cells in culture. These include the midbrain dopaminergic neurons, a major cell type lost in Parkinson's disease. With the promising outcome of mesencephalic fetal transplantation in some Parkinson's disease patients, the establishment of human ES cells has sparked much attention in both the scientific and general community regarding their potential as an alternative to aborted fetal tissue for cell replacement therapies. There is also great interest in developing the ES cell system as a platform for pharmaceutical and toxicological screening. Progress has been made in developing protocols for dopaminergic neuronal specification in ES cell development. Research to define the criteria for the 'right' category of therapeutic dopaminergic cells is underway. However, the promise of human ES cells rests largely on our ability to expand stem cells without genetic and epigenetic compromise, and to direct stem cell differentiation with absolute phenotypic fidelity. The delivery of these goals will require a much better understanding of the control of ES cell self-renewal, proliferation and the commitment of differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The consequences of short phases of restricted cerebral blood flow and iron enrichment of striatal tissues resulted in an animal model that could correspond to the basic features of a model for Parkinson's disease. An automatic and computerized hole-board offers simultaneous data on learning and cognitive memory capabilities, learning of distinct patterns of distributed food pellets found and eaten in a given time, switches between different locations of food in the holes and in different layout patterns. Wistar rats after 60 min of bilateral clamping of the carotid arteries (BCCA) under pentobarbital anesthesia received 1.5 microg FeCl3 injected one week after BCCA unilaterally into the ventrolateral striatum. The experiments showed that reduced cerebral blood flow and increased iron within the striatal tissue had the effect of retarding reactions. Rats after BCCA and iron need 180 s to find pellets deep inside holes that are distributed in a distinct pattern. During only 60 or 30s BCCA plus iron rats are no longer able to find the same number of pellets as over 180s. Rats after BCCA plus NaCl do not show such reduced success. These results point to the idea that cerebral oligemia and increased iron in the striatum stimulate the pathological symptoms of Parkinson's disease which need also more time to have reaction and success (see Fig. 5). The data covering abbreviated time-spans show how heavily the BCCA + Fe animals are dependent on longer times.",

    "abstract": "Owing to its ability to undergo one-electron reactions, iron transforms the mild oxidant hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radical, one of the most reactive species in nature. Deleterious effects of iron accumulation are dramatically evidenced in several neurodegenerative diseases. The work of Youdim and collaborators has been fundamental in describing the accumulation of iron confined to the substantia nigra (SN) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and to clarify iron toxicity pathways and oxidative damage in dopaminergic neurons. Nevertheless, how the mechanisms involved in normal neuronal iron homeostasis are surpassed, remain largely undetermined. How nigral neurons survive or succumb to iron-induced oxidative stress are relevant questions both to know about the etiology of the disease and to design neuroprotective strategies. In this work, we review the components of neural iron homeostasis and we summarize evidence from recent studies aimed to unravel the molecular basis of iron accumulation and dyshomeostasis in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This neuronal degeneration is associated with a strong microglial activation and iron accumulation in the affected brain structures. The increased iron content may result from an increased iron penetration into the brain parenchyma due to a higher expression of lactoferrin and lactoferrin receptors at the level of the blood vessels and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in PD. Iron may also accumulate in microglial cells after phagocytosis of dopaminergic neurons. These effects may be reinforced by a lack of up-regulation of the iron storage protein ferritin, as suggested by an absence of change in iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP-1) control of ferritin mRNA translation in PD. Thus, a dysregulation of the labile iron pool may participate in the degenerative process affecting dopaminergic neurons in PD.",

    "abstract": "An important goal in Parkinson's Disease research is to identify neuroprotective therapy, and the interaction between basic science and clinical research is needed to discover drugs that can slow or halt the disorder progression. At present there is not a perfect animal model of PD to test neuroprotective strategies, however the models that portray the basic characteristics needed are toxin-induced and gene-based models. The first group comprehends 6-OHDA e MPTP and recently rotenone, paraquat and epoxomicin treated animals that shows some of human disease characteristics. Gene-based models are various and, even if with limits, they seem suitable models to test neuroprotection in PD since they present replicable lesions, a predictable pattern of neurodegeneration and a well-characterized behavior, biochemistry and morphology to assist in the understanding of induced changes. In clinical trials researchers have first used as marker of disease progression clinical scores and motor tasks which are limited by the potential symptomatic effect of tested drugs and are not useful in the pre-clinical phases of PD. Recently has emerged the important role of neuroimaging (Dopamine Transporter SPECT, 18FDopa-PET) as surrogate biomarker of PD progression. Even if there are still concerns about the influence of regulatory effects of tested drugs, neuroimaging features could represent a good outcome measure to evaluate PD progression and putative neuroprotective effect of pharmacological and non-pharmacological manipulations.",

    "abstract": "Neuroprotective therapy is a pivotal aim in the treatment of the relentlessly progressive disorder Parkinson's disease. However, more than 60% of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra have already degenerated, when the diagnosis may be established. At this \"advanced stage\" neuroprotective strategies will - if at all - only have limited effect. It is, therefore, essential to establish markers to identify subjects at risk before motor manifestation. A number of such \"premotor\" signs have been discovered and investigated lately. Such signs include a genetic vulnerability and hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra as well as premotor symptoms like olfactory and autonomic dysfunction, depression, REM sleep behaviour disorder, visual and neuropsychological impairment. Moreover, first signs of affection of the substantia nigra like PET and SPECT abnormalities and slight motor signs can be included, as they may be detected before a definite diagnosis can be made. Although most of these signs and symptoms are unspecific if singularly evaluated a combination of these features may indeed be valuable to detect a subgroup of the population at risk for PD. However, future studies are necessary to establish the predictive value of these \"markers\" singularly and in combination.",

    "abstract": "Although still a disorder of unknown etiology, Parkinson's disease (PD) has provided a number of clues that have led to clinical trials of neuroprotection. For example, defects in mitochondrial metabolism and evidence for oxidative stress in PD have fostered therapeutic interventions aimed at slowing disease progression. More than a dozen compounds already have been tested in PD for disease modification, and others are in planning stages for clinical trials. The challenge is to find a highly effective therapy halting disease progression (beyond the relatively modest clinical effect exemplified by recent findings with coenzyme Q-10 treatment administered at 1200mg/day). Clinical exam-based ratings and disability assessments still serve at providing the primary evidence of efficacy. However, with surrogate biomarkers such as radiotracer neuroimaging of the dopaminergic system, the pace of clinical investigation can be increased. Recent years have seen the utilization of more sensitive study methods in PD neuroprotection research, such as staggered wash-in, 2 x 2 factorial, and \"futility\" trial designs. The results of several ongoing PD neuroprotection trials are planned for release in the near future.",

Urinary isatin concentrations in patients with Parkinson's disease tend to increase according to the severity of disease. We have developed a rat model of Parkinson's disease induced by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The distribution of the pathological lesions of JEV-rats resemble those found in Parkinson's disease. Significant behavioral improvement was observed in JEV-rats after isatin, L-DOPA and selegiline administration using a pole test. Both isatin and selegiline prevented the decrease in striatum DA levels of JEV-rats. The increased turnover of DA (DOPAC/DA) induced by JEV was significantly inhibited by isatin, but not selegiline. These findings suggest that JEV-infected rats may serve as a model of Parkinson's disease and that exogenously administered isatin and selegiline can improve JEV-induced parkinsonism by increasing DA concentrations in the striatum.",

    "abstract": "Monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO A and MAO B) are the major enzymes that catalyze the oxidative deamination of monoamine neurotaransmitters such as dopamine (DA), noradrenaline, and serotonin in the central and peripheral nervous systems. MAO B is mainly localized in glial cells. MAO B also oxidizes the xenobiotic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to a parkinsonism-producing neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP+). MAO B may be closely related to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), in which neuromelanin-containing DA neurons in the substantia nigra projecting to the striatum in the brain selectively degenerate. MAO B degrades the neurotransmitter DA that is deficient in the nigro-striatal region in PD, and forms H2O2 and toxic aldehyde metabolites of DA. H2O2 produces highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) by Fenton reaction that is catalyzed by iron and neuromelanin. MAO B inhibitors such as L-(-)-deprenyl (selegiline) and rasagiline are effective for the treatment of PD. Concerning the mechanism of the clinical efficacy of MAO B inhibitors in PD, the inhibition of DA degradation (a symptomatic effect) and also the prevention of the formation of neurotoxic DA metabolites, i.e., ROS and dopamine derived aldehydes have been speculated. As another mechanism of clinical efficacy, MAO B inhibitors such as selegiline are speculated to have neuroprotective effects to prevent progress of PD. The possible mechanism of neuroprotection of MAO B inhibitors may be related not only to MAO B inhibition but also to induction and activation of multiple factors for anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis: i.e., catalase, superoxide dismutase 1 and 2, thioredoxin, Bcl-2, the cellular poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, and binding to glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Furthermore, it should be noted that selegiline increases production of neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrphic factor (GDNF), possibly from glial cells, to protect neurons from inflammatory process.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress has been associated with damage and progressive cell death that occurs in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant capacity in postmortem motor cortex (MC), nucleus caudatus (NC), gyrus temporalis (GT) and substantia nigra (SN) from controls (C) and patients with PD and AD. The initial samples consisted of 68 subjects of PD, AD and C. Brains were matched for age, sex and postmortem time. Brain tissue was homogenized in a phosphate buffer pH 7.3 and separated with two-step centrifugation at 15,000rpm for 30 min and 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 degrees C. Antioxidant capacity in the supernatants was measured using the oxygen radical absorbance assay (ORAC). The results showed that in the SN of parkinsonian's brain the balance between production of free radicals and the neutralization by a complex antioxidant system is disturbed. No changes in the antioxidant capacity of postmortem MC and NC of parkinsonian's brain in comparison with C were found. In the SN of parkinsonian's brain, antioxidant capacity seems to be lower in comparison with C (p < 0.05). Antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radical showed that MC of AD patients was lower than in the MC of C (p < 0.005). In NC of AD patients the antioxidant capacity against hydroxyl radical was increased in comparison with C (p < 0.04). No changes in the antioxidant capacity were found in brain tissues of AD in comparison with C, when CuSO4 was used as a free radical generator.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase improves symptoms of dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Dementia in PD has a cumulative incidence of up to 80% and is mainly caused by a distinct cholinergic deficit. Objectives of this investigator initiated multicenter open label trial were to confirm the efficacy of donepezil in the treatment of dementia in PD patients and to investigate the tolerability and safety of donepezil. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)-score significantly increased in patients, who finished the trial. A detailed analysis of the various items of the MMSE revealed, that only task performance of orientation and recall significantly improved. Scores of the short syndrome test and the Clinical Global Impression Scale improved, motor impairment did not increase. Only 14 out of 24 PD patients finished the trial due to predominant onset of vomiting, nausea, dizziness and confusion. This may result from the titration regime of donepezil, that allows only 5 and 10 mg dosages. Participants with premature study termination had a significant longer duration of PD, less motivation and sleep disturbances at night. Treatment with donepezil was only effective in PD patients with dementia, who experience nearly no side effects from the drug.",

    "abstract": "1202 patients suffering from Parkinson's disease switched from other dopamine agonists to pramipexole under open conditions either abruptly or in an overlapping, gradual manner. Mostly insufficient effectiveness motivated the switch. The investigators gave equal preference to either an abrupt or an overlapping switch to pramipexole in this observational study. There was a tendency in favour of the overlapping switch procedure in those patients who were on a relatively higher dose of a dopamine agonist before the switch. The switch was performed because the investigators expected the effect of pramipexole on tremor, motor functions and depression/anhedonia to be better compared with previous dopamine agonists. The main reasons for switching to pramipexole (anti-tremor effect, anti-depressive/anti-anhedonic effect) as given by the physicians at baseline came up to expectations. The switch to pramipexole mostly yielded further improvements irrespective of the mode of switching.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa is the most efficacious drug to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and is widely considered the \"gold standard\" by which to compare other therapies, including surgical therapy. Response to levodopa is one of the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of PD. A major limiting factor in levodopa therapy is the development of motor complications, namely dyskinesias and motor fluctuations. The ELLDOPA study was designed to determine if levodopa affected the progression of PD. This double-blind randomized study showed that the subjects treated with levodopa for 40 weeks had less severe parkinsonism than the placebo treated subjects even after a 2-week washout of medications, with the highest dose group showing the greatest benefit. Thus, levodopa may actually have neuroprotective value, but the result was not conclusive of slowing disease progression, because the same result could have arisen from a very long-lasting symptomatic benefit of levodopa.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a slowly, progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, which affects about ten million people world-wide, is currently treated symptomatically. Current treatment aim i. e. to balance the decreased dopamine turnover in striatal neurons. Chronic exposure to dopaminergic agents, however, supports onset of motor complications and dyskinesia in the long term. Dyskinesia appear mainly as chorea, athetosis, dystonia, stereotypia, ballism or a combination. Sometimes excessive abnormal facial, body and limb movements depend on the overall dosage of dopaminergic substitution. This is why the main therapy is based on reducing the total dosage of dopaminergic substances. Either alternative or additional well-tried substances like apomorphine, amantadine or clozapine are used. New possibilities in treatment emerge from substances like sarizotan, istradefylline, fipampezol or talampanel. Even so disability and reduced quality of life in PD patients and their caregivers may exist. This survey describes the major clinical features, aetiology and demographics of treatment-associated dyskinesia in PD.",

Parkinson's disease is the neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic cell loss in the compact part of substantia nigra. It is treated pharmacologically or surgically. The surgical treatment is the supplement to the pharmacological one in severe and drug resistant cases. In this study the common methods of surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease: ablative lesions and deep brain stimulation procedures in globus pallidus internus, thalamus and subthalamic nucleus and also the intrastriatal transplantation ofdopaminergic cells (into the striatum) were described.",

    "abstract": "Reliable measures are needed to document functional status and disease progression for people with Parkinson disease (PD). We, therefore, evaluated the reliability of the Physical Performance Test (PPT) for people with PD.\nFourteen community-dwelling subjects with PD participated: 8 males, 6 females; modified Hoehn and Yahr Stages 2 and 2.5; mean age 62.4 years (+6.3). The test was administered twice, 1 week apart. The 7-item and 9-item summary scores of the PPT were each compared between sessions using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and method error (ME) were calculated to further assess reliability.\nBetween sessions, 7- and 9-item summed scores were not statistically different. The range of summed scores fell in the midst of the available score range for both the 7- and 9-item tests suggesting resistance to floor and ceiling effects. The ICCs showed good agreement (7-item = 0.818; 9-item = 0.895) indicating test reliability for this population. Based on the ME, an examiner can expect a 6% variation for the 7-item summary score and a 4% variation for the 9-item score summary between testing sessions.\nThe 7- and 9-item PPTs were demonstrated to be reliable objective measures in individuals with PD. Simple props and brief administration time (10-15 minutes) make the test practical to use.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes in regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRGlu) induced by bilateral subthalamic nucleurs (STN) stimulation in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET data obtained before and one month after stimulation were analyzed with statistical parametric mapping (SPM). As a result of clinically effective bilateral STN stimulation, rCMRGlu increased in lateral globus pallidus (GP), upper brain stem, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal-occipital cortex, and decreased in the orbital frontal cortex and parahippocampus gyrus (p < 0.001). We conclude that the alleviation of clinical symptoms in advanced PD by bilateral STN stimulation may be the result of activation of both ascending and descending pathways from STN and of restoration of the impaired higher-order cortex functions.",

All of them were evaluated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) parts II-V before surgery and 4-45 months after surgery. The amelioration of miscellaneous symptoms and decrease of medication dose, respectively, were compared. Main side effects were observed.\nAfter surgery, both the score of activities of daily living (ADL) and the UPDRS motor score decreased significantly (p < 0.001). Among the PD symptoms, tremor was improved best. Rigidity, bradykinesia, axial symptoms, facial expression and dyskinesia were all improved, although to a lesser extent, while speech was not improved. Medication dose was decreased significantly (p < 0.001). According to the time of follow-up, 4 groups were classified (4-12 months, 13-24 months. 25-36 months and 37-45 months group). ADL, UPDRS motor score and dyskinesia subscore improvement were compared among these groups. No significant difference existed. No life threatening complications occurred. Main side effects included hypophonia, dyskinesia, confusion, depression.\nBilateral STN-DBS is a satisfying surgical method for the treatment of advanced PD. It can improve the cardinal PD symptoms up to 45 months. Complications and side effects were rare and usually temporary or reversible.",

    "abstract": "When microelectrode recording of single cell activity is employed for targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN), multiple sampling of single cells is needed to determine whether the electrode has passed through the ventral boundaries of the STN. In contrast, stepwise recording of multiple cell activities by a semimicroelectrode reveals robust changes in such activities at the dorsal and ventral boundaries. We attempted to quantify changes in multiple cell activities by computing multiple-cell spike density (MSD). We analyzed MSD in 60 sides of 30 patients with Parkinson's disease. Neural noise level was defined as the lowest cut-off level at which neural noise is separated from larger amplitude spikes. MSD was analyzed at cut-off levels ranging from 1.2 to 2.0-fold the neural noise level in the white matter in each trajectory. Both the dorsal and ventral boundaries were clearly identified by an increase and a decrease (p < 0.0001) in MSD, respectively, in all the 60 sides. The cut-off level of 1.2-fold showed the clearest change in MSD between the STN and the pars reticulata of substantia nigra. MSD analysis by semimicroelectrode recording represents the most practical means of identifying the boundaries of STN.",

The rat rotational behavior analysis and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry were performed to assess the change of dopaminergic neurons. Our results showed that the rats receiving Ad-VEGF injection displayed a significant improvement in apomorphine-induced rotational behavior and a significant preservation of TH-positive neurons and fibers compared with control animals. It is concluded that intrastriatal gene transfer by Ad-VEGF may rescue the dopaminergic neurons from degeneration in a rat model of PD.",

    "abstract": "The experiment was to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of transplanted bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) transfected with a kind of neurotrophic factor gene, neurturin (NTN) gene, in treating the rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). The 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were assigned to one of three groups, those receiving BMSCs transfected with NTN gene, those receiving untransfected BMSCs containing a void plasmid and those receiving phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Treatments were injected into the right striatum (6-OHDA-lesioned side). One to six months post-transplantation, apomorphine-induced rotational behavior was observed. One month after transplantation, green fluorescent protein (GFP)/NTN, GFP/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), GFP/neuron specific enolase (NSE) and GFP/tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) fluorescence determinations of brain sections were carried out. One to six months after transplantation, brain sections containing striatum and substantia nigra were stained for TH. In situ hybridization and Western blots were used to determine NTN mRNA and protein concentration, respectively, in affected brain regions. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to measure the dopamine (DA) content in the lesioned striatum 1 and 3 month(s) post-transplantation. The results were shown that: in the first 3 months after transplantation, the number of rotations was lower in NTN-transplant group than the void vector group, and during 1-6 months post-transplantation, the number of rotations was lower in both transplant groups than that in the PBS group (P<0.05). One month after transplantation, we detected GFP/NTN-, GFP/GFAP- and GFP/NSE-labeled cells in the transplantation area of the NTN-transplanted group, but no obvious GFP/TH labeled cells were found. Quantitative analysis of TH-positive cells 1 to 6 months after transplantation indicated that there were no significant differences between groups in survival rates of TH-positive neurons in the lesioned substantia nigra (P>0.05). In situ hybridization and Western blot identified NTN mRNA and protein expression in the transplantation area of the NTN-transplanted group. After transplantation of NTN-expressing cells, DA content in the lesioned striatum was significantly higher in the transgenic group than that in the void vector group or the PBS group (P<0.05). The overall therapeutic effects of the NTN-transplanted group were superior to those of the void plasmid group and the PBS group. The mechanisms by which transgenic therapy treats PD might involve functional enhancement of residual dopaminergic neurons by NTN, which significantly reduces the number of rotations in animals, but not increase the numbers of existing dopaminergic neurons.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. The primary cause of PD is still unknown, but oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated as important contributors to neuronal death in substantia nigra (SN) of PD. Considering neurons as post-mitotic cells, neurons could have error-avoiding mechanism against oxidative DNA damage. Indeed, several DNA repairing enzymes such as MTH1, OGG1, and MUTYH express in human brain. All the three enzymes up-regulated in the SN of PD patients, suggesting these three enzymes cooperate in mitochondrial DNA repairing in PD brain.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews the chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, tolerability, drug-interaction potential, indications, dosing, and potential role of rasagiline mesylate, a new selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B (MAO-B) inhibitor, in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\nA MEDLINE/PUBMED search (1986 through September 2006) was conducted to identify studies involving rasagiline written in English. Additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of these studies. All studies evaluating any aspect of rasagiline, including in vitro, in vivo (animal), and human studies, were reviewed.\nRasagiline mesylate was developed with the goal of producing a selective MAO-B inhibitor that is not metabolized to (presumed) toxic metabolites (eg, amphetamine and methamphetamine, which are byproducts of the metabolism of selegiline, another selective MAO-B inhibitor). In vitro and in vivo data have confirmed the drug's selectivity for MAO-B. Rasagiline is almost completely eliminated by oxidative metabolism (catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 [CYP] isozyme 1A2) followed by renal excretion of conjugated parent compound and metabolites. Drug clearance is sufficiently slow to allow once-daily dosing. Several studies have documented its efficacy as monotherapy for early-stage disease and as adjunctive therapy in L-dopa recipients with motor fluctuations. As monotherapy, rasagiline is well tolerated with an adverse-effect profile similar to that of placebo. As adjunctive therapy, it exhibits the expected adverse effects of dopamine excess, which can be ameliorated by reducing the L-dopa dosage. CYP1A2 inhibitors slow the elimination of rasagiline and mandate dosage reduction. Hepatic impairment has an analogous effect. The recommended dosage regimens for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy are 1 and 0.5 mg PO QD, respectively.\nDespite the well-documented selectivity of rasagiline, the manufacturer recommends virtually all of the dietary (vis-\u00e0-vis tyramine) and drug restrictions of the nonselective MAO inhibitors. Although useful, selective MAO-B inhibitors have a limited role in Parkinson's disease. Of greater interest is the potential neuroprotective effect of rasagiline and its major metabolite, 1(R)-aminoindan, which may have great utility in a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders of aging. In addition, bifunctional molecules combining selective MAO-B inhibition (based on the active moiety of rasagiline) with acetylcholinesterase inhibition or iron chelation may eventually be useful in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of Parkinson disease is symptomatic and does not influence disease progression. It is thus prescribed only when motor symptoms begin to interfere with functioning. Choice of initial treatment is crucial, and delaying introduction of levodopa can delay the occurrence of motor complications. In the elderly (older than 70 years), levodopa is preferred for initial treatment because it is more effective and better tolerated. In young patients (younger than 60 years), dopamine agonists are a better choice because, although they are less effective and have more side effects, they delay the onset of motor complications. In patients in their 60s, the choice of initial treatment depends on general health, cognitive status, and medical history. Regardless of the choice, the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy must be clearly explained to the patient. Initial prescription and subsequent modifications depend on functional problems and must be progressive. Regular physical exercise and physical therapy must be encouraged.",

    "abstract": "The role of some chemical elements in neurodegeneration was suggested by various authors. To obtain a profile of chemical elements and oxidative status in complex neurological diseases, an unbiased \"omics\" approach, i.e., quantification of 26 elements and oxidative stress parameters (serum oxidative status (SOS) and serum anti-oxidant capacity (SAC)), combined with multivariate statistical procedures (forward discriminant analysis, FDA) to analyse the vast amount of data, was applied to four groups of subjects (53 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 71 with Parkinson disease (PD), 60 with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 124 healthy individuals). Descriptive statistics revealed numerous differences between each disease and healthy status. A concordant imbalance (reduction in Fe, Zn and SAC, and increase in SOS) was shared by AD, PD and MS. The FDA yielded three significant discriminant functions based on age, SOS, Ca, Fe, Si, Sn, V, Zn and Zr, and identified disease-specific profiles of element imbalances, thus showing the appropriateness of the \"omics\" approach. It may help assess the contribution of chemical elements and oxidative stress to disease causation and may provide complex predictors of disease evolution or treatment response.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from experimental and epidemiological studies suggests a role of sex hormones in the pathogenic process leading to neurodegenerative diseases, (i.e., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease). The effects of sexual steroid hormones are complex and vary with the events of women's fertile life. Estrogens are supposed to influence dopamine synthesis, metabolism, and transport; however, there is no consensus regarding the direction, locus, and mechanism of the effect of estrogens on the dopaminergic system. A neuroprotective effect of estrogens has been demonstrated in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Epidemiological studies indicate gender differences regarding the onset and the prognosis of PD. Most of the analytical studies explored the relationship between PD and exogenous estrogens. Only three studies investigated the role of endogenous estrogens in the risk of developing PD. These studies reported an increased risk of PD in conditions causing an early reduction in endogenous estrogens (early menopause, reduced fertile life length). Longer cumulative length of pregnancies has also been associated with an increased PD risk. A lack of consensus still exists on the effect of the type of menopause (surgical vs. natural) on PD risk. Finally, the effect of postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy is still debated. Inconsistencies across studies are in part explained by the complexity of the mechanisms of action of sexual hormones and by the paucity of analytical studies.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (alphaSN) is implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) and is the major component of Lewy bodies (LBs). Although alphaSN is mainly expressed in neuronal cells and exists as a cytoplasmic protein, it has been found in body fluids including cerebrospinal fluid and blood. This study explored plasma alphaSN as a diagnostic marker for PD. Western blot analysis was used to characterize plasma alphaSN compared to brain alphaSN. Plasma alphaSN of 16 kDa migrates with the same mobility as its brain counterpart and recombinant alphaSN on denatured polyacrylamide gels and reacted with three different antibodies against the C-terminal and NAC regions of the alphaSN protein. The alphaSN levels in plasma from PD subjects are significantly lower than that in age-matched controls (p=0.001), and the alphaSN levels in patients with early-onset PD are lower than that in both late-onset PD and controls. This initial study indicates that measurement of alphaSN in plasma can provide support for a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and warrants further study in a larger population.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) motility is governed by enteric nervous system being under surveillance of central and autonomic representation. In Parkinson's disease (PD) GI dysmotility has been attributed in part to peripheral action of neurotoxines. We evaluated the effect of chronic salsolinol administration on intestinal myoelectrical activity (IMA) during fasting and in response to gastric distension (GD) in rats. Fasting IMA recordings didn't reveal differences in frequency of migrating myoelectrical complexes (MMC) (p = 0.06) and dominant frequency (DF) of slow waves (p = 0.1) between salsolinol and saline group. However in response to gastrointestinal stimulation with GD in the salsolinol group DF of IMA remained unchanged whereas in the controls increased (p = 0.04). The results suggest the direct effect of salsolinol on gastro-duodenal reflexes in PD rats.",

However, none of these has been able to explain in a convincing manner the physiological mechanisms underlying DBS. Can these models really contribute to improving our understanding? The model by Rubin and Terman [31] represents one of the most comprehensive and biologically plausible models of DBS published recently. We examined the validity of the model, replicated its simulations and tested its robustness. While our simulations partially reproduced the results presented by Rubin and Terman [31], several issues were raised including the high complexity of the model in its non simplified form, the lack of robustness of the model with respect to small perturbations, the nonrealistic representation of the thalamus and the absence of time delays. Computational models are indeed necessary, but they may not be sufficient in their current forms to explain the effect of chronic electrical stimulation on the activity of the basal ganglia (BG) network in PD.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia are thought to participate in implicit sequence learning. However, the exact nature of this role has been difficult to determine in light of the conflicting evidence on implicit learning in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). We examined the performance of PD subjects using a modified form of the serial reaction time task, which ensured that learning remained implicit. Subjects with predominantly right-sided symptoms were trained on a 12-element sequence using the right hand. Although there was no evidence of sequence learning on the basis of response time savings, the subjects showed knowledge of the sequence when performance was assessed in terms of the number of errors made. This effect transferred to the left (untrained) hand as well. Thus, these data demonstrate that PD patients are not impaired at implicitly learning sequential order, but rather at the translation of sequence knowledge into rapid motor performance. Furthermore, the results suggest that the basal ganglia are not essential for implicit sequence learning in PD.",

    "abstract": "For individuals with advanced Parkinson disease (PD), stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) reduces tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, but the effects of stimulation on gait and mobility are not fully understood. The purpose of this paper is to describe the effects of unilateral and bilateral STN stimulation on gait following staged stimulator implantations in a series of individuals with PD.\nParticipants were 6 individuals with PD who underwent staged stimulator implantation surgeries. The effects of stimulation on gait were assessed in the optimally medicated state using items from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) related to gait and self-reported mobility, time to complete the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and quantitative gait analysis. Gait was evaluated with stimulation turned off and with stimulation turned on after unilateral stimulator implantation and again after implantation of the second stimulator.\nVariable effects of unilateral and bilateral STN stimulation on gait were observed on UPDRS self-reported mobility, TUG time, and gait velocity, but changes were not detected using the UPDRS gait item. Minimal gait changes, either positive or negative, were detected with unilateral stimulation. With bilateral stimulation, gait improved for 3 individuals but worsened for the other 3 individuals.\nThe ability to detect changes in gait after STN stimulation using the UPDRS gait item was limited, but variable effects were detected by self-report, TUG time, and gait velocity. For half of the individuals studied, bilateral stimulation improved these measures, but gait worsened for the remaining individuals. Future research is needed to better understand factors that influence the effect of STN stimulation on walking, and assessment of gait changes in people with PD should include self-report and performance-based measures, such as the TUG test or gait velocity.",

A content-analysis approach was used to interpret and analyze individual and family interviews from 27 families. Participants primarily were Caucasian dyads representing different geographic areas and socioeconomic statuses. Findings revealed that the ways persons with PD and their families managed the chronic illness were influenced by belief and faith, purpose and meaning, prayer, the support of family and friends, and hope. Healthcare providers need to understand the role of spirituality in influencing ways that persons with PD and their families define and manage the disease and to support people in their efforts.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine frontal lobe function of non-dementia Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We examined the neuropsychological and behavioral evaluation (Stroop reaction time: SRT). Target image (20%) and non-target image (80%) were presented to PD patients, healthy elderly controls, and healthy young subjects at random. We instructed subjects that the button should pressed on the target image. This study was designed to investigate the mental set under three conditions. The Stroop test, Word Fluency Test (WFT), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were used to assess cognitive function. The SRT of PD were congruent condition and incongruent condition increased compared with simple condition. The delay of a similar SRT was seen in the healthy elderly control and young groups. However, the SRT of PD patients was slower under incongruent condition than under congruent condition. It appears that PD spent time on judgment in under incongruent condition because the meaning of the character did not correspond to the color of the character. Because, there were no significant between PD and healthy elderly subjects in Stroop test, WFT, and GDS, frontal lobe function had a partial deficit. The SRT of PD was increased by the partial deficit in information processing ability in addition to movement dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Experimental and clinical data suggest that genetic variations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene may affect risk for Parkinson's disease (PD). We performed a case-control association analysis of BDNF in three independent Caucasian cohorts (Greek, North American, and Finnish) of PD using eight tagging SNPs and five constructed haplotypes. No statistically significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies were found between cases and controls in all series. A relatively rare BDNF haplotype showed a trend towards association in the Greek (p=0.02) and the Finnish (p=0.03) series (this haplotype was not detected in the North American series). However, given the large number of comparisons these associations are considered non-significant. In conclusion, our results do not provide statistically significant evidence that common genetic variability in BDNF would associate with the risk for PD in the Caucasian populations studied here.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Current therapies are symptomatic and, although these therapies are efficacious during the early stages of the disease, they present important side effects when they are used for a long time. The ideal therapy would be the one that would slow down or stop the progression of the disease. This can be achieved, for instance, with neuroprotective and neurorestorative therapies. Among them, cell therapy and therapy with trophic factors such as glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) are the most challenging and promising ones for the scientific community. Although the use of GDNF as a treatment for Parkinson s disease was proposed several years ago, it is necessary to develop alternative strategies to deliver GDNF appropriately to concrete areas of the brain. Here, the use of microspheres as the most suitable tool for the administration of this neurotrophic factor is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies in patients with Parkinson's disease have reported that a single session of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can improve some or all of the motor symptoms for 30 to 60 minutes. A recent study suggested that repeated sessions of rTMS lead to effects that can last for at least 1 month. Here we report data that both confirm and extend this work. Fifty-five unmedicated PD patients were classified into four groups: two groups (early and late PD) received 25 Hz rTMS bilaterally on the motor arm and leg areas; other groups acted as control for frequency (10 Hz) and for site of stimulation (occipital stimulation). All patients received six consecutive daily sessions (3,000 pulses for each session). The first two groups then received a further three booster sessions (3 consecutive days of rTMS) after 1, 2, and 3 months, while the third group had only one additional session after the first month. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), walking time, key-tapping speed, and self-assessment scale were measured for each patient before and after each rTMS session and before and after the monthly sessions. Compared to occipital stimulation, 25 Hz rTMS over motor areas improved all measures in both early and late groups; the group that received 10 Hz rTMS improved more than the occipital group but less than the 25 Hz groups. The effect built up gradually during the sessions and was maintained for 1 month after, with a slight reduction in efficacy. Interestingly, the effect was restored and maintained for the next month by the booster sessions. We conclude that 25 Hz rTMS can lead to cumulative and long-lasting effects on motor performance.",

    "abstract": "The study was designed to investigate the possible occurrence of \"wearing-off\" (WO) during dopamine agonist (DA) monotherapy. Sixty patients with \"de novo\" idiopathic PD were randomised into one of two DA monotherapy branches to receive oral ropinirole at 15 mg per day, or pramipexole at 2.1 mg per day. DA doses could be increased in the following two years but levodopa could not be added until the study ended. WO was assessed by self-evaluation charts confirmed by a blinded observation of a 30% or greater deterioration in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score. Proc Mixed and Kaplan-Meier curves evaluated treatment variables as a function of time. T-tests were used to compare post-hoc variables reclassified according to WO occurrence. Thirty patients received ropinirole, and 30 pramipexole monotherapy. Eighteen patients (30%) experienced \"wearing-off\" 15-21 months after beginning monotherapy. No differences were observed between treatments. WO phenomena was observed 3.4+/-0.3 hours after intake of the morning or afternoon dose and consisted of UPDRS score worsening by 11.1+/-2.1 points (69-111% more than \"on\" score). Statistical evaluation gave evidence of differences between patients who experienced WO and those who did not: UPDRS motor scores obtained at admission to the study were higher (by 3.4+/-0.2 points, p=0.01 t-test) and DA doses at 6-12 months were higher in fluctuating patients. UPDRS motor scores deteriorated, however. similarly and there were no differences, in UPDRS scores recorded in ON conditions, between fluctuating and non-fluctuating patients at the end of the study. Our findings provide evidence of WO phenomena in patients with early PD receiving non-ergolinic DA monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "We explored the effects of random whole-body vibration on leg proprioception in Parkinson's disease (PD). In earlier studies it was found that this treatment leads to improved postural control in these patients. Thus, one could speculate that these effects result from modified proprioceptive capabilities. Twenty-eight PD patients were subdivided in one experimental and one control group. Proprioceptive performance was analyzed using a tracking task basing on knee extension and flexion movements. Treatment consisted of 5 series of random whole-body vibration taking 60 seconds each. Control subjects had a rest period instead. Prominent over- and undershooting errors were found in both groups representing proprioceptive impairments. No significant differences became evident, however, either between pre- and post-tests or between experimental and control group. One might therefore conclude that spontaneous improvements in postural control are not directly connected with proprioceptive changes. Nevertheless, one also should keep in mind the general aspects and difficulties of analyzing proprioception.",

    "abstract": "In a search for novel target genes related to Parkinson's disease (PD), two full-length cDNA libraries were constructed from a human normal substantia nigra (SN) and a PD patient's SN. An analysis of the gene expression profiles between them was done using the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) frequency. Data for the differently expressed genes were verified by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemical analysis and a cell death assay. Among the 76 genes identified with a significant difference (P > 0.9), 21 upregulated genes and 13 downregulated genes were confirmed to be differentially expressed in human PD tissues and/or in an MPTP-treated mice model by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Among those genes, an immunohistochemical analysis using an MPTP mice model for alpha-tubulin including TUBA3 and TUBA6 showed that the protein levels are downregulated, as well as the RNA levels. In addition, MBP, PBP and GNAS were confirmed to accelerate cell death activity, whereas SPP1 and TUBA3 to retard this process. Using an analysis of ESTs frequency, it was possible to identify a large number of genes related to human PD. These new genes, MBP, PBP, GNAS, SPP1 and TUBA3 in particular, represent potential biomarkers for PD and could serve as useful targets for elucidating the molecular mechanisms associated with PD.",

Growth hormone stimulation tests have been recently reported to be useful in the differential diagnosis between IPD and MSA. Both clonidine, an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, and arginine, an amino acid activating the cholinergic system, have been used to assess growth hormone response in patients with IPD and MSA. This review summarizes the results of several studies and discusses the validity of these tests in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonisms.",

    "abstract": "We used qualitative visual assessment and semiquantitative measures of striatal DAT binding using [(123)I]FP-CIT-SPET in 85 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared these two assessments and their correlation with PD clinical progression. SPET imaging was visually classified by a nuclear medicine physician as normal or abnormal pattern grade I, II and III, in relation to a different degree of radioligand reduction uptake. Nineteen patients presented abnormal grade I (group 1), 53 grade II (group 2) and 13 grade III (group 3). The UPDRS III motor score, the H-Y score, the rigidity and bradykinesia subscores were significantly different among the three groups. Post hoc analysis showed that all values of these clinical parameters were higher in group 3 than in 2 and 1. All clinical indices were also significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1. This means that groups 3 and 2 were clinically more severely affected. No significant differences among the 3 groups were observed for age or duration of disease. Values of the mean striatum uptake were also significantly different among the three groups. Post hoc analysis revealed significantly lower values of the mean striatum uptake in group 3 with respect to groups 2 and 1; values were also significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1. We conclude that our findings of good consistency between visual and semi-quantitative assessment may help simplify the evaluation of striatal DAT binding in PD in a clinical routine setting.",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) from Parkinson disease (PD) may be difficult, particularly in the early stages, because the characteristic vertical supranuclear eye movement abnormalities of PSP may be absent or delayed until late in the course of the disease. In this study we investigated the usefulness of comparing the square wave jerk rate (SWJR) and blink rate (BR) in the differentiation of these two disorders.\nWe studied 10 patients with PD (PD group) and 5 patients with PSP (PSP group) who met published diagnostic criteria. The SWJR and BR were measured from video recordings and were used to calculate a ratio (SWJR:BR).\nThe PSP group exhibited a significantly higher SWJR, higher SWJR:BR, and lower BR than did the PD group. No patient with PSP exhibited a SWJR:BR of < 3; however, one patient with PD had a SWJR:BR of 5.3, creating overlap between the two groups.\nThe SWJR:BR is a simple and reasonably useful clinical measure to distinguish established PSP from PD. Determining the value of this measure in differentiating early PSP from PD requires a prospective study.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the pathomechanism of essential (ET) and parkinsonian tremor (PT) by studying the correlation between tremor severity and movement-related beta rhythm changes of the human electroencephalogram.\nWe recorded the electroencephalogram of 10 patients with essential tremor, 10 with Parkinsonian tremor and 10 controls. In a preliminary session we determined the side with lower and higher tremor intensity (T+, T++ respectively), using accelerometry. Subjects pressed an on-off switch in a self-paced manner with left and right thumb. After digitalization of the EEG from Cz, C3, C4 electrodes, the movement reactive beta frequency (MRBF), its minimum/maximum peak power values and their latencies triggered to movement offset were determined.\nThe time course and amplitude of movement related beta desynchronization (ERD) were similar in each group regardless of tremor intensity. In ET tremor severity did not influence post-movement beta synchronization (PMBS) amplitude (PMBS(ET+) = 100.98 +/- 48.874%, PMBS(ET++) = 135.1 +/- 92.87%; p = 0.231), however it was significantly delayed after the movement of the more tremulous hand (latPMBS(ET+) = 1.26 +/- 0.566 s, latPMBS(ET++) = 1.57 +/- 0.565 s, p = 0.003). In the PT group on the side of pronounced tremor the amplitude of PMBS decreased but it was not delayed, compared to the less affected hand (PMBS(PT+) = 115.19 +/- 72.131%, PMBS(PT++) = 77.84 +/- 53.101%, p = 0.0028; latPMBS(PT+) = 1.4 +/- 0.74 s, latPMBS(PT++) = 1.25 +/- 0.797 s, p = 0.191). In controls the power and latency of PMBS was similar on both sides.\nThe results suggest that neuronal mechanisms underlying PMBS generation are differently affected by ET and PT.

    "abstract": "Heat shock proteins (HSPs), known as molecular chaperone to assist protein folding, have recently become a research focus in Parkinson's disease (PD) because the pathogenesis of this disease is highlighted by the intracellular protein misfolding and inclusion body formation. The present review will focus on the functions of different HSPs and their protective roles in PD. It is postulated that HSPs may serve as protein folding machinery and work together with ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to assist in decomposing aberrant proteins. Failure of UPS is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of PD. In addition, HSPs may possess anti-apoptotic effects and keep the homeostasis of dopaminergic neurons against stress conditions. The critical role of HSPs and recent discovery of some novel HSPs inducers suggest that HSPs may be potential therapeutic targets for PD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting mainly the elderly. One of the most important hallmarks of Parkinson's disease is the loss of neuronal cell bodies containing neuromelanin in the substantia nigra zona compacta, and subsequently, loss of dopamine terminals in basal ganglia nuclei of the brain. The discovery by Hornykiewicz and co-workers that levodopa could successfully treat Parkinson's disease in humans was one of the most important events of medicine in the 20th century. Since loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic function is the basic underlying pathophysiology of this disease, drugs that enhance dopaminergic function in the striatum, including the exogenous precursor levodopa, remain the most effective symptomatic agents in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, there are some areas of controversy about levodopa-evoked motor complications (dyskinesias, on-off phenomena) as well as neuroprotective or neurotoxic activity of this drug, etc. In this article the authors try to clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in levodopa action, such as volume transmission - a crucial process for successful levodopa therapy, evidence that serotoninergic neurons may accumulate levodopa and convert it into dopamine as well as some aspects of neuroprotective action of levodopa.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia form a forebrain system that collects signals from a large part of the neocortex, redistributes these cortical inputs both with respect to one another and with respect to inputs from the limbic system, and then focuses the inputs of this redistributed, integrated signals into particular regions of the frontal lobes and brainstem involved in aspects of motor planning and motor memory. Movement disorders associated with basal ganglia dysfunction comprise a spectrum of abnormalities that range from the hypokinetic disorder (from which Parkinson's disease, PD, is the best-known-example) at one extreme to the hyperkinetic disorder (exemplified by Huntington's disease and hemiballism) at the other. In addition to disorders of movement, major mental disorders including schizophrenic-like states and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been linked to abnormalities in the basal ganglia and their allied nuclei. In this paper we discuss recent evidence indicating that a dopamine-induced dysbalance of basal ganglia neurocircuitries may be an important pathophysiological component in PD, schizophrenia and ADHD. According to our model, the deprivation of dopaminergic nigro-striatal input, as in PD, reduces the positive feedback via the direct system, and increases the negative feedback via the indirect system. The critical consequences are an overactivity of the basal ganglia output sites with the resulting inhibition of thalamo-cortical drive. In schizophrenia the serious cognitive deficits might be partly a result of a hyperactivity of the inhibitory dopamine D(2) transmission system. Through this dysinhibition, the thalamus exhibits hyperactivity that overstimulates the cortex resulting in dysfunctions of perception, attention, stimulus distinction, information processing and affective regulation (inducing hallucinations and delusions) and motor disabilities. Recent studies have strongly suggested that a disturbance of the dopaminergic system is also involved in the pathophysiology of ADHD. The most convincing evidence comes from the demonstration of the efficacy of psychostimulants such as the dopamine transporter (DAT) blocker methylphenidate in the symptomatic treatment of ADHD. Genetic studies have shown an association between ADHD and genes involved in dopaminergic neurotransmission (for example the dopamine receptor genes DRD4 and DRD5, and the DAT gene DAT1). DAT knockout mice display a phenotype with increased locomotor activity, which is normalized by psychostimulant treatment. Finally, imaging studies demonstrated an increased density of DAT in the striatum of ADHD patients. Which system is disturbed and whether this system is hyper- or hypoactive is not unambiguously known yet.",

The application of this technique, particularly as a surrogate marker for therapeutic and neuroprotective trials in Parkinsonism, however, is dependent on pathological validation. In the absence of human studies, we used 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) primate models of Parkinsonism to verify correlation between the SPECT, immunohistochemical and behavioural data. The DAT SPECT data correlated strongly and significantly with the substantia nigra pars compacta tyrosine hydroxylase and Nissl cell counts as well as the behavioural scores. Within the limitations of small numbers inherent to such studies, this data provides the first attempt at pathological validation of SPECT in primates.",

We now demonstrate that T cells isolated from lymph nodes and spleens of Cop-1 immunized animals protect the nigrostriatal system from MPTP-induced neurodegeneration in a dose-dependent manner. CD4+ T cells elicited the most significant neuroprotective response while high titers of anti-Cop-1 antibodies showed no effect. These data further support the use of immunomodulatory strategies for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "There was increasing evidence suggesting that angiotensin I-converting enzyme may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. Our former study has shown that angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene (ACE) may confer a susceptibility for the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). Meanwhile, recent studies have emphasized that genetic factors may involve in the occurrence of the adverse effects of chronic L-dopa therapy in PD patients. This study was designed to assess whether genetic polymorphism of the ACE could be a predictor of L-dopa-induced adverse effects in PD. There were 251 patients included in this study and their mean age at onset of disease was 63.3+/-11.4 years. The duration of disease and the treatment with L-dopa was 6.3+/-5.1 and 5.0+/-4.3 years, respectively. The frequency of the homozygote ACE-II genotype of the ACE in PD patients with L-dopa-induced psychosis was significantly higher than that in PD patients without the adverse effect (63.3% vs 43.0%; chi(2)=6.347, OR=1.435, 95%CI=1.105-1.864, p=0.012). However, the ACE polymorphism was not associated with the risk to develop dyskinesia or motor fluctuation induced by L-dopa. Furthermore, a logistic regression analysis confirmed that the ACE-II genotype was an independent risk factor for L-dopa-induced psychosis in PD patients (OR=2.542, p=0.012). In conclusion, results of the study showed that ACE-II genotype might confer a primary predictor for the occurrence of psychosis in L-dopa-treated PD.",

    "abstract": "We have recently demonstrated that two plant-derived cannabinoids, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol (CBD), are neuroprotective in an animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD), presumably because of their antioxidant properties. To further explore this issue, we examined the neuroprotective effects of a series of cannabinoid-based compounds, with more selectivity for different elements of the cannabinoid signalling system, in rats with unilateral lesions of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons caused by local application of 6-hydroxydopamine. We used the CB1 receptor agonist arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide (ACEA), the CB2 receptor agonist HU-308, the non-selective agonist WIN55,212-2, and the inhibitors of the endocannabinoid inactivation AM404 and UCM707, all of them administered i.p. Daily administration of ACEA or WIN55,212-2 did not reverse 6-hydroxydopamine-induced dopamine (DA) depletion in the lesioned side, whereas HU-308 produced a small recovery that supports a possible involvement of CB2 but not CB1 receptors. AM404 produced a marked recovery of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced DA depletion and tyrosine hydroxylase deficit in the lesioned side. Possibly, this is caused by the antioxidant properties of AM404, which are derived from the presence of a phenolic group in its structure, rather than by the capability of AM404 to block the endocannabinoid transporter, because UCM707, another transporter inhibitor devoid of antioxidant properties, did not produce the same effect. None of these effects were observed in non-lesioned contralateral structures. We also examined the timing for the effect of CBD to provide neuroprotection in this rat model of PD. We found that CBD, as expected, was able to recover 6-hydroxydopamine-induced DA depletion when it was administered immediately after the lesion, but it failed to do that when the treatment started 1 week later. In addition, the effect of CBD implied an upregulation of mRNA levels for Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, a key enzyme in endogenous defenses against oxidative stress. In summary, our results indicate that those cannabinoids having antioxidant cannabinoid receptor-independent properties provide neuroprotection against the progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons occurring in PD. In addition, the activation of CB2 (but not CB1) receptors, or other additional mechanisms, might also contribute to some extent to the potential of cannabinoids in this disease.",

    "abstract": "GSTs are a family of inducible phase II enzymes that may play a neuroprotective role in Parkinson's disease (PD). GSTs may also modify PD risk by metabolizing compounds in cigarettes, as cigarette smoking is generally found to be associated with a decrease in PD risk. Using a population-based case-control study design, we examined polymorphisms of the mu, omega, pi, and theta classes of GST to elucidate the main effects and smoking-GST interactions on PD risk. From three rural California counties, we recruited 289 incident idiopathic PD cases, clinically confirmed by our study neurologist, and 270 population controls, marginally matched by age, gender, and race. We assessed main gene polymorphism associations and evaluated interactions between smoking and GST polymorphisms as departures from a multiplicative scale adjusting for age, gender, and race. We also restricted analyses to Caucasian subjects to address the potential for population stratification (n=235 cases, 220 controls). Among Caucasians, we observed a risk reduction in subjects carrying at least one variant allele for GSTO1 (OR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.47-0.98) and also GSTO2 (OR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.44-0.93); both genes were in strong linkage disequilibrium. No main gene effects were observed for the remaining polymorphisms. We noted a multiplicative interaction between ever having smoked regularly and GSTO1 (OR(interaction)=0.55, 95% CI: 0.33-0.92) and GSTO2 (OR(interaction)=0.54, 95% CI: 0.32-0.90). Results were similar when combining all races. These findings and the paucity of similar studies suggest a need for further inquiry into the association between GSTs, smoking, and PD risk.",

    "abstract": "Combining large-scale gene expression approaches and bioinformatics may provide insights into the molecular variability of biological processes underlying neurodegeneration. To identify novel candidate genes and mechanisms, we conducted a multiregional gene expression analysis in postmortem brain. Gene arrays were performed utilizing Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 gene chips. Brain specimens from 21 different brain regions were taken from Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 22) and normal aged (n = 23) brain donors. The rationale for conducting a multiregional survey of gene expression changes was based on the assumption that if a gene is changed in more than one brain region, it may be a higher probability candidate gene compared to genes that are changed in a single region. Although no gene was significantly changed in all of the 21 brain regions surveyed, we identified 11 candidate genes whose pattern of expression was regulated in at least 18 out of 21 regions. The expression of a gene encoding the mitochondria ribosomal protein S6 (MRPS6) had the highest combined mean fold change and topped the list of regulated genes. The analysis revealed other genes related to apoptosis, cell signaling, and cell cycle that may be of importance to disease pathophysiology. High throughput gene expression is an emerging technology for molecular target discovery in neurological and psychiatric disorders. The top gene reported here is the nuclear encoded MRPS6, a building block of the human mitoribosome of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). Impairments in mitochondrial OXPHOS have been linked to the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "The overlap in the clinical and pathological features of tauopathies and synucleinopathies raises the possibility that the tau protein may be important in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Several MAPT polymorphisms that define the tau H1 haplotype have been investigated for an association with PD with conflicting results; however, two meta-analyses support an association between haplotype H1 and PD.\nIn this study, we recruited 508 patients and 611 healthy controls from Greek, Finnish and Taiwanese populations. We examined the possible genetic role of variation within MAPT in PD using haplotype-tagging single polymorphisms (SNPs) in these ethnically different PD populations.\nWe identified a moderate association at SNP rs3785883 in the Greek cohort for both allele and genotype frequency (p = 0.01, p = 0.05, respectively) as well as for SNP rs7521 (genotype p = 0.02) and rs242557 (p = 0.01 genotypic, p = 0.04 allelic) in the Finnish population. There were no significant differences in genotype or allele distribution between cases and controls in the Taiwanese cohort.\nWe failed to demonstrate a consistent association between the MAPT H1 haplotype (delineated by intron 9 ins/del) and PD in three ethnically diverse populations. However, the data presented here suggest that subhaplotypes of haplotype H1 may confer susceptibility to PD, and that either allelic heterogeneity or different haplotype composition explain the divergent haplotype results.",

    "abstract": "Within the central nervous system, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for dopamine and serotonin synthesis. In addition, BH4 is now established to be an essential cofactor for all isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Inborn errors of metabolism affecting BH4 availability are well documented and the clinical presentation can be attributed to a paucity of dopamine, serotonin, and nitric oxide (NO) generation. In this article, we have focussed upon the sensitivity of BH4 to oxidative catabolism and the observation that when BH4 is limiting some cellular sources of NOS may generate superoxide whilst other BH4 saturated NOS enzymes may be generating NO. Such a scenario could favor peroxynitrite generation. If peroxynitrite is not scavenged, e.g., by antioxidants such as reduced glutathione, irreversible damage to critical cellular enzymes could ensue. Such targets include components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and possibly pyruvate dehydrogenase. Such a cascade of events is hypothesized, in this article, to occur in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Polymorphisms in the glutathione S-transferase pi gene (GSTP1), encoding GSTP1-1, a detoxification enzyme, may increase the risk of Parkinson disease (PD) with exposure to pesticides. Using the GenePD Study sample of familial PD cases, we explored whether GSTP1 polymorphisms were associated with the age at onset of PD symptoms and whether that relation was modified by exposure to herbicides.\nSeven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped and tested for association with PD onset age in men in three strata: no exposure to herbicides, residential exposure to herbicides, and occupational exposure to herbicides. Haplotypes were similarly evaluated in stratified analyses.\nThree SNPs were associated with PD onset age in the group of men occupationally exposed to herbicides. Three additional SNPs had significant trends for the association of PD onset age across the herbicide exposure groups. Haplotype results also provided evidence that the relation between GSTP1 and onset age is modified by herbicide exposure. One haplotype was associated with an approximately 8-years-earlier onset in the occupationally exposed group and a 2.8-years-later onset in the nonexposed group.\nHerbicide exposure may be an effect modifier of the relation between glutathione S-transferase pi gene polymorphisms and onset age in familial PD.",

    "abstract": "In the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), oxidative and nitrosative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and excitotoxicity are involved, i.e., processes in which osteopontin (OPN) may also play a role. We have studied in PD patients serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of OPN, its immunohistochemical presence in substantia nigra (SN) and tested in OPN-null mice the impact of this protein on MPTP-induced neurodegeneration. PD was accompanied by increased OPN levels in the body fluids. Higher serum levels were associated with more severe motor symptoms. CSF levels were positively associated with concomitant dementia and negatively associated with dopaminergic treatment. In human SN, OPN was expressed in neurons, in their Lewy bodies and in microglia. Loss of tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive cells in the SN and of dopaminergic fibers in the striatum was reduced 3 weeks after MPTP intoxication in OPN-null mice. These data suggest that OPN is involved in PD-associated neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that dopaminergic mechanisms in the basal ganglia (BG) are important in the learning of sequential associations. To test the specificity of this hypothesis, we assessed never-medicated patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) using a chaining task. In the training phase of the chaining task, each link in a sequence of stimuli leading to reward is trained step-by-step using feedback after each decision, until the complete sequence is learned. In the probe phase of the chaining task, the context of stimulus-response associations must be used (the position of the associations in the sequence). Results revealed that patients with PD showed impaired learning during the training phase of the chaining task, but their performance was spared in the probe phase. In contrast, patients with aMCI with prominent medial temporal lobe (MTL) dysfunctions showed intact learning during the training phase of the chaining task, but their performance was impaired in the probe phase of the chaining task. These results indicate that when dopaminergic mechanisms in the BG are dysfunctional, series of stimulus-response associations are less efficiently acquired, but their sequential manner is maintained. In contrast, MTL dysfunctions may result in a non-sequential learning of associations, which may indicate a loss of contextual information.",

    "abstract": "Hypothetic mechanism of the individual vulnerability to oxidative stress through metabolism of environmental xenobiotics and genotypic polymorphisms has been considered to promote the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this case-control study, we determined the role of manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) genes in PD risk in a population with high prevalence of pesticide exposure.\nFrom southwestern region of Taiwan, we enrolled 153 patients with idiopathic PD and 155 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex and origin. Detailed questionnaires of face-to-face interviews among these subjects were collected. PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays were used to determine the genotypes of MnSOD (-9 T>C) and NQO1 (609 C>T) genes.\nExposure to pesticides associated with PD was significant among patients with an increased odds ratio (OR) of 1.69 (95%CI, 1.07-2.65), and this association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and cigarette smoking (aOR=1.68, 95%CI, 1.03-2.76, P=0.023). Considering genetic factors, there were no significant differences in frequencies of both genotypes of MnSOD and NQO1 polymorphisms between PD patients and the control subjects (P>0.05). However, this difference in genotype distribution was significant among subjects who had been exposed to pesticide, with aOR of 2.49 (95%CI, 1.18-5.26, P=0.0072) for MnSOD C allele and aOR of 2.42 (95%CI, 1.16-4.76, P=0.0089) for NQO1 T allele, respectively. Moreover, among subjects exposed to pesticide, the combined MnSOD/NQO1 variant genotype was significantly associated with a 4.09-fold increased risk of PD (95%CI, 1.34-10.64, P=0.0052).\nSusceptible variants of MnSOD and NQO1 genes may interact with occupational pesticide exposure to increase PD risk in southwestern Taiwanese.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, characterized clinically by resting tremor, bradykinesia, postural instability and rigidity. The prevalence of PD is approximately 2% of the population over 65 years of age and 1.7 million PD patients (age > or = 55 years) live in China. Recently, a common LRRK2 variant Gly2385Arg was reported in ethnic Chinese PD population in Taiwan. We analyzed the frequency of this variant in our independent PD case-control population of Han Chinese from Taiwan.\n305 patients and 176 genetically unrelated healthy controls were examined by neurologists and the diagnosis of PD was based on the published criteria. The region of interest was amplified with standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR fragments then were directly sequenced in both forward and reverse directions. Differences in genotype frequencies between groups were assessed by the X2 test, while X2 analysis was used to test for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\nOf the 305 patients screened we identified 27 (9%) with heterozygous G2385R variant. This mutation was only found in 1 (0.5%) in our healthy control samples (odds ratio = 16.99, 95% CI: 2.29 to 126.21, p = 0.0002). Sequencing of the entire open reading frame of LRRK2 in G2385R carriers revealed no other variants.\nThese data suggest that the G2385R variant contributes significantly to the etiology of PD in ethnic Han Chinese individuals. With consideration of the enormous and expanding aging Chinese population in mainland China and in Taiwan, this variant is probably the most common known genetic factor for PD worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Challenge with low-dose apomorphine causes a rise in growth hormone (GH) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We studied 18 patients with early PD, who showed an increase of GH in the low-dose apomorphine test, by means of [(123)I] FP-CIT-SPECT. The mean specific dopamine transporter binding of the 18 patients was 1.50 +/- 0.56 in the striatum, 1.20 +/- 0.59 in the putamen, and 1.76 +/- 0.59 in the caudate nucleus. The increase of GH (1.05 +/- 1.01 ng/ml at baseline to 9.46 +/- 6.36 ng/ml 45 min after apomorphine injection; p < 0.001) was significant. There was a significant negative correlation of the increase of GH with the mean specific dopamine transporter binding in all three regions (r between -0.490 and -0.587; p between 0.04 and 0.01). Challenge with low-dose apomorphine may therefore be used as an indirect tool to measure the extent of nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in early PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder that can cause significant disability and decreased quality of life. The cardinal physical signs of the disease are distal resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and asymmetric onset. Levodopa is the primary treatment for Parkinson's disease; however, its long-term use is limited by motor complications and drug-induced dyskinesia. Dopamine agonists are options for initial treatment and have been shown to delay the onset of motor complications. However, dopamine agonists are inferior to levodopa in controlling motor symptoms. After levodopa-related motor complications develop in advanced Parkinson's disease, it is beneficial to initiate adjuvant therapy with dopamine agonists, catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitors, or monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has been shown to ameliorate symptoms in patients with advanced disease. Depression, dementia, and psychosis are common psychiatric problems associated with Parkinson's disease. Psychosis is usually drug induced and can be managed initially by reducing antiparkinsonian medications. The judicious use of psychoactive agents may be necessary. Consultation with a subspecialist is often required.",

    "abstract": "Several epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between Parkinson's disease (PD) and exposure to heavy metals using subjective exposure measurements.\nWe investigated the association between objective chronic occupational lead exposure and the risk of PD.\nWe enrolled 121 PD patients and 414 age, sex, and race, frequency-matched controls in a case-control study. As an indicator of chronic Pb exposure, we measured concentrations of tibial and calcaneal bone Pb stores using 109Cadmium excited K-series X-ray fluorescence. As an indicator of recent exposure, we measured blood Pb concentration. We collected occupational data on participants from 18 years of age until the age at enrollment, and an industrial hygienist determined the duration and intensity of environmental Pb exposure. We employed physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling to combine these data, and we estimated wholebody lifetime Pb exposures for each individual. Logistic regression analysis produced estimates of PD risk by quartile of lifetime Pb exposure.\nRisk of PD was elevated by > 2-fold [odds ratio = 2.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.13-4.55); p = 0.021] for individuals in the highest quartile for lifetime lead exposure relative to the lowest quartile, adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking history, and coffee and alcohol consumption. The associated risk of PD for the second and third quartiles were elevated but not statistically significant at the alpha = 0.05 level.\nThese results provide an objective measure of chronic Pb exposure and confirm our earlier findings that occupational exposure to Pb is a risk factor for PD.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to establish how Parkinson's disease (PD) affects working capacity. Altogether, 937 (70%) of 1,343 working-aged members of the Finnish Parkinson Association participated in a questionnaire study. The ages of the subjects were between 29 and 65 years, median 59.0 years; 508 (54%) were men. The median (quartile range) duration of PD symptoms was 7.3 (4.3-11.3) years, and the median self-estimated severity of the disease on the Hoehn & Yahr scale was 2. Only 150 of 937 subjects (16%) were still working: 112 (12%) full-time and 38 (4%) part-time. Among those 343 (37%) who had retired purely because of PD at a median age of 53.4 years, the median working time was 1.7 years after established diagnosis. In part-time work, PD patients had been able to continue for a median of 4.3 years. PD often leads to early retirement; compared with the general Finnish population of similar age, PD patients had retired on the average 6 years earlier. Young age, mild symptoms, and short duration of the disease as well as adjustments enabling easier employment were associated with the possibility to continue longer in the work force.",

The identification of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene mutations as a cause of Parkinson's disease has greatly expanded our knowledge of the genetic and molecular pathogenesis of this disorder. By denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and gene sequencing in patients and controls, we identified a novel frequent heterozygous 2264C-->T substitution, which causes a proline-to-leucine mutation (P755L) in LRRK2 gene. In our sample of 598 patients of Chinese Han ancestry, 12 cases carried the same LRRK2 mutation. Our results indicated that this single mutation was implicated in 2% of sporadic patients. We suggest that testing for this mutation will be important in the management and genetic counseling of patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "To explore the driving problems associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to ascertain whether any clinical features or tests predict driver safety.\nThe driving ability of 154 individuals with PD referred to a driving assessment centre was determined by a combination of clinical tests, reaction times on a test rig and an in-car driving test.\nThe majority of cases (104, 66%) were able to continue driving although 46 individuals required an automatic transmission and 10 others needed car modifications. Ability to drive was predicted by the severity of physical disease, age, presence of other associated medical conditions, particularly dementia, duration of disease, brake reaction, time on a test rig and score on a driving test (all p<0.001). The level of drug treatment and the length of driving history were not correlated. Discriminant analysis revealed that the most important features in distinguishing safety to drive were severe physical disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage 3), reaction time, moderate disease associated with another medical condition and high score on car testing.\nMost individuals with PD are safe to drive, although many benefit from car modifications or from using an automatic transmission. A combination of clinical tests and in-car driving assessment will establish safety to drive, and a number of clinical correlates can be shown to predict the likely outcome and may assist in the decision process. This is the largest series of consecutive patients seen at a driving assessment centre reported to date, and the first to devise a scoring system for on-road driving assessment.",

    "abstract": "The integrity of frontal systems responsible for voluntary control and their interaction with subcortical regions involved in reflexive responses were studied in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have shown that patients with PD have impaired executive function, including deficits in attention, motor planning and decision making.\nExecutive function was measured through eye movements: reflexive (stimulus driven) prosaccades and voluntary (internally guided) antisaccades. Patients with advanced idiopathic PD, off and on their optimal levodopa therapy, were tested on a prosaccade and an antisaccade task and compared with matched controls.\nLevodopa significantly increased response time for reflexive prosaccades and reduced error rate for voluntary antisaccades.\nConsistent with our proposed model, patients with PD in the medicated state are better able to plan and execute voluntary eye movements. These findings suggest levodopa improves function of the voluntary frontostriatal system, which is deficient in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), while primarily associated with degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, is now increasingly recognized to have more widespread cell loss and so the most effective cell replacement therapy should target all these neuronal losses. Neural precursor cells might be ideal in this regard as in certain circumstances they have been shown to migrate widely following transplantation into the CNS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether transplanted human expanded neural precursor cells (hENPs) could migrate to sites of established or evolving pathology in the adult brain using the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD. hENPs were grafted into the striatum prior to, at the same time as, or after the animals received a 6-OHDA lesion to the medial forebrain bundle. The presence of donor cells was then assessed in a distant site of cell loss (substantia nigra) or sites where cell death would not be expected (frontal cortex and globus pallidus). Donor cells were found distant from the site of implantation but the migration of these hENPs was not significantly greater in the 6-OHDA-lesioned brain and the cells did not specifically target the site of cell loss in the substantia nigra. The temporal relationship of grafting relative to the lesion, and therefore dopaminergic cell death, did not affect the migration of hENPs nor their differentiation. We conclude that while transplanted hENPs are capable of migration away from the site of implantation, they show no specific tropism for sites of ongoing or established nigral dopaminergic cell loss in this lesion model. Therefore, the use of such cells to replace the range of neurons lost in PD is likely to require a deeper understanding of the migratory cues in the damaged adult brain and some manipulation of these cells prior to transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Single-chain Fv and single-domain antibodies retain the binding specificity of full-length antibodies but they can be cloned, selected, engineered, and manipulated as genes. When expressed intracellularly in mammalian cells these intracellular antibodies, or intrabodies, have the potential to alter the folding, interactions, modifications, or subcellular localization of their targets. These reagents have previously been developed as therapeutics against cancer and HIV. Since misfolded and accumulated intracellular proteins characterize several major neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington disease (HD) and Parkinson disease, these disorders are prime candidates for intrabody therapy. In this article we review the extension of intrabody technology to the nervous system. Studies of HD have been used to develop the approach and anti-synuclein strategies are in the early stages of development. Such neurodegenerative diseases are therefore poised for engineered antibody approaches, which can provide a pipeline of novel therapeutics and new drug discovery tools.",

In the current study, the frequency of CARD15/NOD2 gene variants (R702W, G908R, L1007fs), previously associated with Crohn's disease--a common inflammatory bowel disease, have been examined in a group of 308 sporadic PD patients and 220 healthy controls. Significantly higher frequency of total CARD15 variant alleles in PD patients (13.0%) compared to the controls (8.0%, p<0.02) was observed. 24.0% of PD patients carried at least one CARD15 variant allele compared to 15.5% of healthy controls (p<0.02, OR=1.73). The results of the study suggest, that the polymorphism in CARD15/NOD2 gene may be a risk factor for sporadic PD development, and support the concept of inflammatory pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Recent discoveries of disease-causing genes in Parkinson's disease (PD) have generated considerable interest regarding genetic testing in PD. The attitudes toward genetic testing are largely influenced by knowledge and preconceived notions.\nWe investigated the relationship between knowledge of and attitude towards predictive genetic testing of PD in two independent centers in America and Asia involving PD patients and caregivers.\nIn a prospective study involving 515 subjects comprising of PD patients and their caregivers in two independent centers in America and Asia, the level of knowledge about genetic testing and patients' attitudes towards such testing were evaluated using a standardized questionnaire.\nAmerican PD patients had a higher level of knowledge of PD genetics than Asian PD (31.1% vs. 12.3%, p=0.0002). A greater number of American PD patients and caregivers reported a positive attitude towards the potential medical benefits of genetic testing compared to their Asian counterparts (85.4% vs. 42.2%, 92.2% vs. 32.1%, p<0.00005), but a more negative attitude towards potential compromise in getting health and life insurance (43.7% vs. 25.8%, p=0.0002). However, in the Asian cohort, multivariate analysis revealed that a high level of genetics knowledge was associated with a positive attitude response regarding the potential medical benefits of testing (p<0.0005), but a negative attitude towards compromises in healthcare and life insurance, getting a job and starting a family (p<0.0005). These associations were not observed amongst American subjects.\nThe relationship between level of genetic knowledge and attitude towards potential risks and benefits of predictive genetic testing in PD was distinctly different in two independent, racially and culturally different PD populations and caregivers. These observations have clinical implications in the development of PD genetic counseling programs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a severe, age-related neurodegenerative disorder in which a loss of substantia nigra-derived dopaminergic pathways to the striatum triggers profound motor perturbation, as well as cognitive, sensory and mood deficits. Although the dopamine precursor, L-dopa, is effective in the short-term in relieving motor dysfunction, it does not stop the progressive disappearance of dopaminergic neurons, encouraging interest in alternative therapeutic strategies. Dopaminergic agonists, such as pramipexole, appear to have neuroprotective and neurorestorative actions based on clinical and, most convincingly, experimental work. The role of specific dopaminergic receptor subtypes is an important issue, especially with respect to new drug development. Of particular interest, dopamine D3 receptors contribute to the beneficial influence of dopaminergic agonists for the protection and restoration of dopaminergic pathways in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Motor fluctuations and dyskinesias can cause disability and reduce quality of life for patients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nTo evaluate factors associated with the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias and to assess the sequence in which they occur in individual patients.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial comparing pramipexole dihydrochloride and levodopa as initial treatment for PD. Subjects were followed up for 48 to 58 months and evaluated at 3-month intervals for the presence of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias.\nAcademic and private practices. Patients Three hundred one patients with early Parkinson disease were enrolled in this study between October 2, 1996, and August 21, 1997, and were observed through August 24, 2001, when the last patient enrolled completed 4 years of follow-up.\nOrder of appearance of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, time to the first occurrence of motor fluctuations, and time to the first occurrence of dyskinesias.\nOne hundred eighty-nine subjects (62.8%) developed motor complications. Of these, 71 (37.6%) developed fluctuations but not dyskinesias, 23 (12.2%) developed dyskinesias but not fluctuations, 48 (25.4%) developed fluctuations before dyskinesias, 33 (17.5%) developed dyskinesias before fluctuations, and 14 (7.4%) developed both at the same time. Factors significantly associated with earlier occurrence of dyskinesia were Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2 or higher, cumulative levodopa dose, cumulative levodopa equivalent dose (levodopa plus pramipexole), and occurrence of motor fluctuations. Pramipexole treatment was associated with later occurrence of dyskinesias. Factors associated with earlier occurrence of motor fluctuations were cumulative levodopa dose, cumulative levodopa equivalent dose, and occurrence of dyskinesias. Factors associated with later occurrence of motor fluctuations were age at onset of 65 years or older and pramipexole treatment.\nHigher cumulative levodopa doses and higher cumulative levodopa equivalent doses (levodopa plus pramipexole) were associated with the earlier occurrence of motor complications. Motor fluctuations and dyskinesias appear to be interrelated because the presence of one is associated with the earlier development of the other.",

Main Outcomes Measures We compared the extent of dopamine loss in different regions relative to levels of noradrenaline found in healthy brain, with special attention devoted to the dopamine-rich nucleus accumbens, which has noradrenaline-rich and noradrenaline-poor subdivisions.\nAmong 20 brain areas, dopamine loss in PD was negatively correlated with healthy noradrenaline levels (r = 0.83), with regions rich in noradrenaline (eg, the noradrenaline-rich portion of the nucleus accumbens) spared from dopamine loss. However, within the striatum, noradrenaline levels in the caudate and putamen were similar, despite dopamine's being more markedly reduced in the putamen.\nOur postmortem data are consistent with animal findings suggesting that noradrenaline might affect dopamine neuron loss in PD and that a noradrenergic approach (although not aimed at the as yet unknown primary cause of PD) could be neuroprotective. This possibility should also be considered when noradrenergic therapy is provided for symptomatic purposes in PD.",

    "abstract": "The derivation of dopamine neurons is one of the best examples of the clinical potential of embryonic stem (ES) cells, but the long-term function of the grafted neurons has not been established. Here, we show that, after transplantation into an animal model, neurons derived from mouse ES cells survived for over 32 weeks, maintained midbrain markers, and had sustained behavioral effects. Microdialysis in grafted animals showed that dopamine (DA) release was induced by depolarization and pharmacological stimulants. Positron emission tomography measured the expression of presynaptic dopamine transporters in the graft and also showed that the number of postsynaptic DA D(2) receptors was normalized in the host striatum. These data suggest that ES cell-derived neurons show DA release and reuptake and stimulate appropriate postsynaptic responses for long periods after implantation. This work supports continued interest in ES cells as a source of functional DA neurons.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the precise mechanism for an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under pathological conditions is not yet fully understood. We have recently demonstrated an implication of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a tumor suppressor, in ROS generation and neuronal apoptosis induced by staurosporine. These findings raised further interest whether PTEN functions as a common mediator of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative processes. To address this issue, neural cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP(+)), which mimic cerebral ischemia and Parkinson's disease, respectively. OGD for 4 h followed by 16 h of reoxygenation or incubation with MPP(+) (250 microM) for 48 h induced 33% and 45% neuronal death in rat hippocampal and in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y neurons, respectively, accompanied by a gradual increase in the intracellular level of ROS. The increase in ROS by OGD and by MPP(+) did not cause oxidative inactivation of PTEN and thus, PTEN remains constitutively active. In support, the protein level of PTEN was not reduced in both cell cultures after challenging with OGD or MPP(+). Importantly, the elevated intracellular ROS levels and the neuronal death caused by OGD or by MPP(+) toxicity were significantly inhibited when PTEN was downregulated by a specific antisense oligonucleotide or by siRNA. Because SOD2 protein level is not altered either by knockdown of PTEN nor by an inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signalling, we suggest that SOD2 do not contribute to the pathomechanism of oxidative stress induced by PTEN or by inhibiting the related Akt signalling. The present study highlights PTEN as a crucial and common mediator of ROS generation and neuronal death and suggests that PTEN could become a potential therapeutic target for interfering with neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a heterogeneous clinical picture and a variable rate of progression. PD is characterized by degeneration of the pigmented neuromelanin bearing cells of the pars compacta of the substantia nigra that leads to a severe dopaminergic denervation of the striatum. Current treatments for PD rely on dopamine replacement therapy, most commonly with the dopamine precursor levodopa. Despite the many recent advances in the symptomatic treatment of PD, there is still no realistic prospect for a cure. In recent years, new data support the idea of a relevant role for the cannabinoid system in PD. As cannabinoids have neuroprotective properties, they have been proposed as potentially useful neuroprotective substances in PD, as well as to alleviate some symptoms in specific circumstances (i.e. parkinsonian tremor associated with overactivity to the subthalamic nucleus; levodopa-induced dyskinesia). By contrast, CB(1) receptor antagonists might be useful to reduce bradykinesia in patients refractory to classic levodopa treatment. The present article will review all data about the relationship between PD and the cannabinoid system including: i) the usefulness of cannabinoid-related compounds to alleviate some PD symptoms; ii) that cannabinoid-based compounds might provide protection against the progression of neuronal injury characteristic of this disease; iii) the influence of cannabinoids on local inflammatory events associated with the pathogenesis in PD. Collectively, all these evidence support that the management of the cannabinoid system might represent a new approach to the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic use of enzyme inhibitors in treatment of neurodegenerative diseases has its origin in the anti Parkinson action of the selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitor, l-deprenyl (selegiline ), a failed anti depressant in 1975. This led to further development of MAO- A and B, catechol-O-methyltansferase and cholinestrerase inhibitors as anti Parkinson and Alzheimer drugs. One of the main reasons for the cognitive deficit in dementia of the Alzheimer' type (AD) and in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is degeneration of cholinergic cortical neurones and synaptic plasticity. This led to a correlation that similar to Parkinson's Disease (PD), cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) may also have therapeutic activity in AD. Significant percentage of AD and DLB subjects also nigrostriatal dopaminergic, locus ceruleous noradrenergic and raphe nucleus serotoninergic neurones. The present ChEI anti AD drugs have limited symptomatic activity and devoid of neuroprotective property that is needed for disease modifying action. It is becoming clear that there are no magic bullets for neurodegenerative disorders and shut gun approach is needed either as polypharmacology or drugs with multiple activity at different target sites in the CNS. The complex pathology of AD as well as cascade of events that leads to the neurodegenerative process has led us to develop several multifunctional neuroprotective drugs with several CNS targets with possible disease modifying activity. Employing the pharamcophore of our antiparkinson drug rasagiline (Azilect, Agilect, N-propagrgyl-1R-aminoindan) we have developed a novel multifunctional neuroprotective drug, ladostigil [TV-3326 (N-propargyl-3R-aminoindan-5yl)-ethyl methylcarbamate)], with both cholinesterase-butyrylesterase (Ch-BuE) and brain selective monoamine-oxidase (MAO) AB inhibitory activities possessing the neuroprotective-neurescue propargyl moiety, as potential treatment of AD and DLB and PD with dementias. Since brain MAO and iron increase in AD, PD and ageing, that could lead to iron dependent oxidative stress neurodegeneration, we have developed another series of multifunctional drugs (M30 HLA-20 series) which are brain permeable iron chelators- brain selective MAO inhibitors and possess the propargyl neuroprotective moiety. These series of drugs have the ability of regulating and processing APP (amyloid precursor protein) and reducing Abeta peptide, since APP is a metaloprotein, with an iron responsive element 5d'UTR similar to transferring and ferritin.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in DJ-1 lead to early onset Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study was to elucidate further the underlying mechanisms leading to neuronal cell death in DJ-1 deficiency in vivo and determine whether the observed cell loss could be prevented pharmacologically. Inactivation of DJ-1 in zebrafish, Danio rerio, resulted in loss of dopaminergic neurons after exposure to hydrogen peroxide and the proteasome inhibitor MG132. DJ-1 knockdown by itself already resulted in increased p53 and Bax expression levels prior to toxin exposure without marked neuronal cell death, suggesting subthreshold activation of cell death pathways in DJ-1 deficiency. Proteasome inhibition led to a further increase of p53 and Bax expression with widespread neuronal cell death. Pharmacological p53 inhibition either before or during MG132 exposure in vivo prevented dopaminergic neuronal cell death in both cases. Simultaneous knockdown of DJ-1 and the negative p53 regulator mdm2 led to dopaminergic neuronal cell death even without toxin exposure, further implicating involvement of p53 in DJ-1 deficiency-mediated neuronal cell loss. Our study demonstrates the utility of zebrafish as a new animal model to study PD gene defects and suggests that modulation of downstream mechanisms, such as p53 inhibition, may be of therapeutic benefit.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction and abnormalities of olfactory brain structures are found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and a number of studies have reported that olfactory dysfunction is caused by abnormalities of the central olfactory systems. We previously analyzed electroencephalograms (EEGs) and respiration simultaneously in normal subjects while testing for detection and recognition of odors. We identified changes in respiration pattern in response to odor stimuli and found inspiratory phase-locked alpha oscillations (I-alpha). The genesis of I-alpha were identified in olfactory-related areas including the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdale and orbitofrontal cortex with an EEG dipole tracing method. In the present study, we used the same protocol in PD patients and compared results of PD with those of age-matched controls. All PD patients detected odor, but 5 out of 10 showed impaired odor recognition. Changes in breathing pattern associated with emotional changes during exposure to odor stimuli were not observed in PD patients. I-alpha waveforms were not observed; however, positive waves followed by negative waves were identified approximately 100ms after inspiration onset. Dipoles of this component were localized in the entorhinal cortex for odor detection in all patients and in the entorhinal cortex and middle temporal gyrus for PD patients who could discriminate odors. Odor recognition in PD could be subserved by a different neural circuit from that of normal subjects, done through the temporal association cortex as a subsystem for recognizing the odor; however, the system may not be associated with the odor-induced emotions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease is characterized by selective degeneration of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, and endogenous dopamine may play a pivotal role in the degenerative processes. Using primary cultured mesencephalic neurons, we found that glutamate, an excitotoxin, caused selective dopaminergic neuronal death depending on endogenous dopamine content. Pramipexole, a dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist used clinically in the treatment of Parkinson disease, did not affect glutamate-induced calcium influx but blocked dopaminergic neuronal death induced by glutamate. Pramipexole reduced dopamine content but did not change the levels of total or phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis. The neuroprotective effect of pramipexole was independent of dopamine receptor stimulation because it was not abrogated by domperidone, a dopamine D2-type receptor antagonist. Moreover, both active S(-)- and inactive R(+)-enantiomers of pramipexole as a dopamine D2-like receptor agonist equally suppressed dopaminergic neuronal death. These results suggest that pramipexole protects dopaminergic neurons from glutamate neurotoxicity by the reduction of intracellular dopamine content, independently of dopamine D2-like receptor activation.",

    "abstract": "The unilateral and intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine is commonly used to provide a partial lesion model of Parkinson's disease in the investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis and to assess new neuroprotective treatments. Its capacity to induce neurodegeneration has been related to its ability to undergo autoxidation in the presence of oxygen and consequently to generate oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate the time course of brain oxidative damage induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6 microg in 5 microl of sterile saline containing 0.2% ascorbic acid) injection in the right striatum of the rat. The results of this study show that the indices of both lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and protein oxidation (carbonyl and free thiol contents) increase simultaneously in the ipsilateral striatum and ventral midbrain, reaching a peak value at 48-h post-injection for both TBARS and protein carbonyl content, and at 24 h for protein free thiol content. A lower but significant increase was also observed in the contralateral side (striatum and ventral midbrain). The indices of oxidative stress returned to values close to those found in controls at 7-day post-injection. These data show that the oxidative stress is a possible triggering factor for the neurodegenerative process and the retrograde neurodegeneration observed after 1-week post-injection is a consequence of the cell damage caused during the first days post-injection. The optimal time to assess brain indices of oxidative stress in this model is 48-h post-injection.",

    "abstract": "The recent identification of a common genetic variant (LRRK2 G2385R) which is associated with a two-fold increased risk of sporadic Parkinson's Disease (PD) in two independent Chinese populations in Singapore and Taiwan has generated considerable excitement. Thus far, this variant appears specific for the Asian population, emphasising further that ethnic-specific effects should be considered in genetic association studies. Cautious optimism is advised as we await more scientific studies and clarification if this risk variant is specific to ethnic Chinese race. Our in-vitro studies suggest the Gly2385Arg variant is biologically relevant and it might act through pro-apoptotic mechanisms, especially under cellular stresses. This may provide a partial explanation why some carriers develop the disease while others do not. The presence of other epigenetic factors, gene-gene and gene-environmental interaction could modulate the phenotype expression. Further validation of these findings would be needed to confirm this variant as the single most important common genetic risk factor in ethnic Chinese and/or Asian PD patients. The identification of the LRRK2 Gly2385Arg variant could potentially facilitate the development of clinical, bioimaging, genetic and biological biomarkers, useful in the monitoring and neuroprotective therapy in asymptomatic individuals.",

Two previous studies reported an association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1060826) with PD. A replication study of 340 German patients and 680 controls showed no significant association between 12 genotyped polymorphisms and PD.

    "abstract": "The cause of selective dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in Parkinson disease has still not been resolved, but it has been hypothesized that oxidative stress and the ubiquitin-proteasome system are important in the pathogenesis. In this report, we investigated the effect of proteasome inhibition on oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells, an in vitro model of Parkinson disease. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors provided significant protection against toxicity by 6-hydroxydopamine and H(2)O(2) in a concentration-dependent manner. The measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate demonstrated that lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor, significantly reduced 6-hydroxydopamineand H(2)O(2)-induced reactive oxygen species production. Proteasome inhibitors elevated the amount of glutathione and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) prior to glutathione elevation. The treatment with lactacystin induced the nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased the level of mRNA for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, a rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis. Furthermore, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, abolished glutathione elevation and cytoprotection by lactacystin. These data suggest that proteasome inhibition afforded cytoprotection against oxidative stress by the elevation of glutathione content, and its elevation was mediated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) suggest that cognitive deficits accompany the classically recognized motor symptoms, and that these cognitive deficits may result from damage to frontal-basal ganglia circuits. PD patients are impaired on ordering events and action components into coherent sequences. In this study, we examined early-stage, nondemented, medicated PD subjects and matched control subjects during a semantic event sequencing task using functional MRI (fMRI). The task required subjects to examine four pictures of meaningful events, determine the correct temporal relationship between each picture, and re-order the pictures into a coherent sequence. There were two main findings. First, we found abnormal activation within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the \"default\" network in the PD group. Distinct areas of the PFC showed both hypoactivation and hyperactivation, whereas the \"default\" network showed reduced levels of resting activation in PD. Secondly, we observed left caudate hyperactivation in the PD group. The findings are discussed in relationship to how more activation may be compensatory, but does not necessarily mean efficient and correlated brain function.",

    "abstract": "One of the perceptual abnormalities observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a deficit in the suppression of reflexive saccades that are automatically triggered by the onset of a peripheral target. Impairment of substantia nigra function is thought to lead to this reduced ability to suppress reflexive saccades.\nThe present study examined whether this perceptual deficit is also present in early stage PD when using hardly noticeable task-irrelevant stimuli. Eleven non-demented de novo, untreated PD patients (mean age 57 yr, range 44-70) participated in the study as well as 12 age-matched controls. Performance on an 'oculomotor capture' task, in which in half of the trials an irrelevant stimulus with sudden onset was added to the display, was compared between patients and controls. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed with group (patients/controls) and age (< 61 yrs/> or = 61 yrs) as independent factors and type of trial (control/distracter) as repeated measurements factor. The factor sex was used as covariate.\nWith respect to Reaction Time (RT), a significant interaction between group and condition was found. RTs increased under the 'irrelevant stimulus' condition in both groups, the patients exhibiting a significantly larger increase in RTs than the control group. Also, a significant interaction effect between group and condition for number of correct responses was found. The number of correct responses was reduced in the onset distracter condition, the reduction being larger in the patients. In the patient group, contrary to the control group, a higher age was associated with fewer correct responses at baseline and in the onset distracter condition, suggesting that perceptual functions in PD are highly susceptible to the effects of ageing. The increased reaction times and larger number of incorrect responses of the PD patients in the onset distracter condition may be related to impairments of substantia nigra function and lower brain stem.\nThe capture task seems to be a sensitive instrument to detect early perceptual deficits in PD. The magnitude of the observed deficits suggests that perceptual functions in early stage PD are so substantially impaired that this may interfere with daily activities.",

Also, a significant interaction effect between group and condition for number of correct responses was found. The number of correct responses was reduced in the onset distracter condition, the reduction being larger in the patients. In the patient group, contrary to the control group, a higher age was associated with fewer correct responses at baseline and in the onset distracter condition, suggesting that perceptual functions in PD are highly susceptible to the effects of ageing. The increased reaction times and larger number of incorrect responses of the PD patients in the onset distracter condition may be related to impairments of substantia nigra function and lower brain stem.",

    "abstract": "Numerous factors contribute to substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine (DA) neuron death in Parkinson's disease (PD), thus complicating the search for effective neuroprotective agents for this disease. Although the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mouse has been widely used for assessing neuroprotective agents for PD, the pathological processes resulting from MPTP exposure can vary greatly depending upon the MPTP administration protocol. This study assessed the degree to which the neuroprotective efficacy of particular agents may depend upon the MPTP administration protocol (i.e. acute vs. subacute toxin administration). Endpoints analysed were changes in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and NeuN cell numbers in the SNc, striatal DA and metabolite levels, and striatal TH+ fiber density. The efficacy of putative neuroprotective agents [i.e. LIGA 20, nicotinamide and pramipexole (PPX)] varied depending upon the MPTP administration protocol. LIGA 20 spared striatal DA levels in both MPTP models, while nicotinamide was only effective in the acute toxin administration model and PPX was only effective in the subacute model. In both MPTP models, LIGA 20 and nicotinamide significantly spared DAergic neurons; PPX only spared DAergic neurons in the subacute model. Only acute MPTP-treated mice that received nicotinamide had a significant sparing of striatal DAergic fibers. These results underscore the need to assess putative neuroprotective agents for PD in multiple animal models using multiple endpoints. This strategy may better identify compounds with broad neuroprotective/neurorestorative profiles that may be more likely to be clinically effective.",

    "abstract": "The neuronal protein alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) has been suggested to be one of the factors linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). Several organisms, including the rat, mouse, worm, and fruit fly, are being used to study alpha-syn pathobiology. A new model organism was recently added to this armamentarium: the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The yeast system recapitulates many of the findings made with higher eukaryotes. For example, yeast cells expressing alpha-syn accumulate lipid droplets, have vacuolar/lysosomal defects, and exhibit markers of apoptosis, including the externalization of phosphatidylserine, the release of cytochrome c, and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. This MiniReview focuses on the mechanisms by which alpha-syn induces oxidative stress and the mechanisms by which yeast cells respond to this stress. Three classes of therapeutics are discussed.",

The patient was a 73-year-old woman who had been diagnosed as Parkinson's disease for one and half year. The severity of her disease was categorized as Hoehn & Yahr 2nd degree and she had taken 0.25 mg/day of Pramipexole. Four days after the addition of 10 mg/day of Paroxetine for the treatment of her depression, she developed consciousness disturbance, severe muscular rigidity, tremor, fever, hyperhidrosis, incontinence and elevated serum creatine kinase level. According to diagnostic criteria, she was diagnosed as neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably induced by Paroxetine. Her clinical symptoms and laboratory data were improved seven days after intravenous drip infusion. We should recognize that SSRI could induce neuroleptic malignant syndrome in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

We examined whether surgery at an early stage would maintain quality of life as well as improve motor function.\nTwenty patients with PD of short duration (time elapsed since first symptom +/- SD: 6.8 +/- 1.0 years) with mild to moderate motor signs (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III \"off\" medication: 29 +/- 12) who responded well to levodopa treatment were included in pairs, matched for age, duration and severity of disease, and impairment in socioprofessional functioning. Patients were prospectively randomized to undergo bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation (n = 10) or receive optimized medical treatment (n = 10). Parkinsonian motor scores, quality of life, cognition, and psychiatric morbidity were assessed at inclusion and at 6, 12, and 18 months after randomization.\nQuality of life was improved by 24% in surgical and 0% in nonsurgical patients (p < 0.05). After 18 months, the severity of parkinsonian motor signs \"off\" medication, levodopa-induced motor complications, and daily levodopa dose were reduced by 69%, 83%, and 57% in operated patients and increased by 29%, 15%, and 12% in the group with medical treatment only (p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) has become an accepted therapeutic modality in selected Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with severe levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) and on-off motor fluctuations. In comparison to subthalamic nucleus DBS there is a paucity of data on GPi DBS outcomes. We present our experience with a group of 20 PD patients (9 unilateral, 11 bilateral) who underwent GPi stimulation. PD motor symptoms were assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III scores and subscores, and dyskinesia using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), UPDRS part IVa, and clinical global impression (CGI). At mean follow-up time of 7 months, bilateral stimulation reduced off-period motor scores by a mean of 46% and on-period motor scores by 18%. Unilateral stimulation reduced off-period motor scores by 18%. Dyskinesia severity was reduced by 76%, which was maintained after a mean follow-up time of 35 months. Antiparkinsonian medication dosage was unchanged. No major adverse effects were seen. Unilateral and bilateral GPi DBS provides lasting benefit in PD patients with severe LID. Beneficial effects on off-period motor symptoms are greater with bilateral stimulation; however, with maintenance of dopaminergic medication, unilateral procedures can also provide important and sustained benefits.",

Former evidence showed that individuals carrying risk alleles displayed broader patterns of brain activity during behavioural and cognitive tasks, despite being clinically comparable to non-carriers. This suggests the presence of compensatory brain mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated this effect in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients carrying the DRD2 TaqIA A1 allelic variant. This variant may confer an increased risk of developing the disease and/or influence the clinical presentation. During a complex sequential motor task, we evidenced by functional magnetic resonance imaging that A1 allele carriers activated a larger network of bilateral cerebral areas than non-carriers, including cerebellar and premotor regions. Both groups had similar clinical and demographic measures. In addition, their motor performance during the functional magnetic resonance experiment was comparable. Therefore, our conclusions, pending replication in a larger sample, seem to reflect the recruitment of compensatory cerebral resources during motor processing in PD patients carrying the A1 allele.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have longer reaction time (RT) than age-matched control subjects. During the last decades, conflicting results have been reported regarding the source of this deficit. Here, we addressed the possibility that experimental inconsistencies originated in the composite nature of RT responses. To investigate this idea, we examined the effect of PD on different processes that compose RT responses. Three variables were manipulated: the signal quality, the stimulus-response compatibility and the foreperiod duration. These variables have been shown to affect, respectively, the ability to extract the relevant features of the stimulus (perceptual stage), the intentional selection of the motor response (cognitive stage) and the implementation of the muscle command (motor stage). Sixteen PD patients were tested on and off-medication and compared with an age and gender-matched control group. Results indicated that degrading the legibility of the response stimulus affected the latency of simple key-press movements more dramatically in the off-medication PD group than in the control population. The stimulus-response compatibility and the foreperiod duration had similar effects in the two groups. Interestingly, the response slowing associated with the degradation of the stimulus was the same whether the patients were on or off dopaminergic medication. This suggests that the high-level perceptual deficits observed in the present study do not have a dopaminergic origin.",

    "abstract": "Successful adaptation to novel sensorimotor contexts critically depends on efficient sensory processing and integration mechanisms, particularly those required to combine visual and proprioceptive inputs. If the basal ganglia are a critical part of specialized circuits that adapt motor behavior to new sensorimotor contexts, then patients who are suffering from basal ganglia dysfunction, as in Parkinson's disease should show sensorimotor learning impairments. However, this issue has been under-explored. We tested the ability of 8 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), off medication, ten healthy elderly subjects and ten healthy young adults to reach to a remembered 3D location presented in an immersive virtual environment. A multi-phase learning paradigm was used having four conditions: baseline, initial learning, reversal learning and aftereffect. In initial learning, the computer altered the position of a simulated arm endpoint used for movement feedback by shifting its apparent location diagonally, requiring thereby both horizontal and vertical compensations. This visual distortion forced subjects to learn new coordinations between what they saw in the virtual environment and the actual position of their limbs, which they had to derive from proprioceptive information (or efference copy). In reversal learning, the sign of the distortion was reversed. Both elderly subjects and PD patients showed learning phase-dependent difficulties. First, elderly controls were slower than young subjects when learning both dimensions of the initial biaxial discordance. However, their performance improved during reversal learning and as a result elderly and young controls showed similar adaptation rates during reversal learning. Second, in striking contrast to healthy elderly subjects, PD patients were more profoundly impaired during the reversal phase of learning. PD patients were able to learn the initial biaxial discordance but were on average slower than age-matched controls in adapting to the horizontal component of the biaxial discordance. More importantly, when the biaxial discordance was reversed, PD patients were unable to make appropriate movement corrections. Therefore, they showed significantly degraded learning indices relative to age-matched controls for both dimensions of the biaxial discordance. Together, these results suggest that the ability to adapt to a sudden biaxial visuomotor discordance applied in three-dimensional space declines in normal aging and Parkinson disease. Furthermore, the presence of learning rate differences in the PD patients relative to age-matched controls supports an important contribution of basal ganglia-related circuits in learning novel visuomotor coordinations, particularly those in which subjects must learn to adapt to sensorimotor contingencies that were reversed from those just learned.",

    "abstract": "Treatment-related motor fluctuations (MFs) and dyskinesias are considered one of the most important problems in the long-term management of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, only a few studies have focused on their characteristics during advanced and end stages of the disease. We therefore assessed MFs and dyskinesias in a cohort of 61 late/end stage patients with a clinical and pathological diagnosis of PD and investigated the influence of disease- and treatment-related variables on their occurrence. A total of 62.3% of our patients experienced \"wearing-off\" phenomena, 68.9% \"on-off\" motor fluctuations and 60.7% dyskinesias at advanced/end stage disease. Age at disease onset and disease duration were significantly associated with dyskinesias. A substantial number of patients experienced spontaneous resolution of their motor complications during the last two years of their disease without treatment modifications. The clinical heterogeneity of treatment-related motor complications in PD points towards a complex mechanism for their etiopathogenesis. Although advanced disease and L-dopa administration are closely tied to their development, other mechanisms involving synaptic aging, altered neuronal plasticity and post-synaptic degeneration may be involved.",

    "abstract": "The causes of the selective neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are unknown and commonalities among these and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases continue to be sought. Morphologic, biochemical, molecular genetic, and cell/animal model studies suggest that mitochondria might be a convergence point for neurodegeneration. The functions and properties of mitochondria might render subsets of selectively vulnerable neurons intrinsically susceptible to cellular aging and stress. In PD, mutations in putative mitochondrial proteins have been identified recently and mitochondrial DNA mutations have been found in nigral neurons. In ALS, changes occur in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes and in mitochondrial cell death proteins, indicative of an activation of programmed cell death pathways. Mouse models are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria in neuronal death processes ranging from apoptosis to necrosis. This review presents how malfunctioning mitochondria might contribute to neuronal death in PD and ALS.",

However, neuropsychiatric complications, including mood and anxiety disorders, fatigue, apathy, psychosis, cognitive impairment, dementia, sleep disorders and addictions, frequently complicate the course of the illness. The pathophysiologic features of these complications are multifaceted and include neuropathophysiologic changes of a degenerative disease, exposure to antiparkinsonian treatments and emotional reactions to having a disabling chronic illness. Changes in mental status have profound implications for the well-being of patients with Parkinson's disease and of their caregivers. Treatment is often efficacious but becomes a challenge in advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. In this article, we review the key clinical features of neuropsychiatric complications in Parkinson's disease as well as what is known about their epidemiologic characteristics, risk factors, pathophysiologic features and management.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from clinical and experimental studies supports the hypothesis of free radical-mediated damage of dopaminergic neurons in the pathology of Parkin's disease (PD). The present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of nitric oxide and oxidative stress in PD. Estimation of the stable metabolites of nitric oxide (NO, nitrite, nitrate) and malondialdehyde (MDA), an acceptable marker of lipid peroxidation, can provide indirect evidence of involvement of free radicals. Nitrite and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were estimated in the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 20 controls and 21 patients with PD. Nitrite and MDA content was not significantly altered in the CSF of PD patients as compared to the controls. Nitrite and MDA levels in CSF of PD patients exhibited no correlation with age, duration of disease, and severity of illness (measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score). There was no correlation between the CSF nitrite and MDA level. Findings of the present study do not provide evidence for the involvement of nitric oxide and oxidative stress in PD.",

    "abstract": "Deep-brain stimulation is currently the most effective surgical treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease. The relevant targets to date are the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus internus, although the thalamus (ventralis intermedius nucleus) is preferred in tremor-dominant, aged Parkinson's disease patients. Long-term benefit in cardinal parkinsonian signs, motor fluctuations and dyskinesia has been reported in 5-year follow-up studies of subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation. However, some psychiatric consequences have raised important issues and emphasized the need for an experienced deep-brain stimulation surgical team. This team should be multidisciplinary and involve movement disorder neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists and psychiatrists. The recent observation that deep-brain stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus improves axial signs, possibly even in those less responsive to levodopa, brings new hope to the management of advanced Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic (Stn) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a valid surgical therapy for the treatment of severe Parkinson's disease. In recent years, StnDBS has been proposed for patients who previously received other surgical treatments, such as thalamotomy and pallidotomy. Nonetheless, there is no consensus about the indications of DBS in patients who previously underwent surgery. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of a patient treated with DBS after previous thalamotomy and adrenal grafting.\nA 62-year-old man with a long history (more than 30 yr) of Parkinson's disease received unilateral thalamotomy and autologous adrenal graft on two independent occasions. Thalamotomy led to a significant improvement, although limited to the control of contralateral tremor. The autologous adrenal graft was of no benefit. For the subsequent occurrence of L-dopa related dyskinesias and severe \"off\" periods, the patient was referred to our center for StnDBS.\nThe patient underwent bilateral StnDBS, obtaining a satisfactory improvement of rigidity and bradykinesia on both sides. The 1-year follow-up evaluation showed a 46% improvement in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor section, along with a noticeable reduction in antiparkinsonian therapy (81%).\nThis case is consistent with previous reports from the literature, suggesting that StnDBS is feasible and safe, even in patients who previously received other surgical treatments for Parkinson's disease, such as thalamotomy or cell grafting.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is widely accepted in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders. The standard implantation procedure is performed under local anesthesia (LA). Certain groups of patients may not be eligible for surgery under LA because of clinical reasons, such as massive fear, reduced cooperativity, or coughing attacks. Microrecording (MER) has been shown to be helpful in DBS surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of MER for DBS surgery under general anesthesia (GA) and to compare the data of intraoperative MER as well as the clinical data with that of the current literature of patients undergoing operation under LA.\nThe data of nine patients with advanced PD (mean Hoehn and Yahr status, 4.2) who were operated with subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS under GA, owing to certain clinical circumstances ruling out DBS under LA, were retrospectively analyzed. All operations were performed under analgosedation with propofol or remifentanil and intraoperative MER. For MER, remifentanil was ceased completely and propofol was lowered as far as possible.\nThe STN could be identified intraoperatively in all patients with MER. The typical bursting pattern was identified, whereas a widening of the baseline noise could not be as adequately detected as in patients under LA. The daily off phases of the patients were reduced from 50 to 17%, whereas the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III score was reduced from 43 (preoperative, medication off) to 19 (stimulation on, medication off) and 12 (stimulation on, medication on). Two patients showed a transient neuropsychological deterioration after surgery, but both also had preexisting episodes of disorientation. One implantable pulse generator infection was noticed. No further significant clinical complications were observed.\nSTN surgery for advanced PD with MER guidance is possible with good clinical results under GA. Intraoperative MER of the STN region can be performed under GA with a special anesthesiological protocol. In this setting, the typical STN bursting pattern can be identified, whereas the typical widening of the background noise baseline while entering the STN region is obviously absent. This technique may enlarge the group of patients eligible for STN surgery. Although the clinical improvements and parameter settings in this study were within the range of the current literature, further randomized controlled studies are necessary to compare the results of STN DBS under GA and LA, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The striatum harbours a population of dopaminergic neurons that is thought to act as a local source of dopamine (DA). This neuronal population increases in size in animal models of Parkinson's disease, where striatal DA levels are low, but its fate in idiopathic Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea is poorly known. In this study, we used antibodies raised against the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a faithful marker of dopaminergic neurons, to compare, by means of stereological counting methods, the number of striatal TH+ neurons on post-mortem brain sections from Parkinson's disease patients, Huntington's disease patients and age-matched controls. Propidium iodide nuclear staining was also performed to avoid counting short TH+ axonal segments that bear a large swollen varicosity and resemble small bipolar neurons. In normal subjects, TH+ neurons were scattered throughout the striatum, but they abounded preferentially in the ventral portion of the structure and were more numerous in the putamen than in the caudate nucleus. They displayed a multipolar cell body of medium size (10-20 mum in diameter) that emitted 3-5 smooth dendrites, a typical characteristic of striatal interneurons. These TH+ cells were rarely found in the small TH-poor striosomes, most of them being embedded in the large TH-rich extrastriosomal matrix. The number of striatal TH+ neurons was also found to vary according to an inverse relation with the age of the subjects. In pathological brains, the morphological characteristics of the striatal TH+ neurons were relatively unaltered, but the number of such neurons was markedly reduced compared with controls. The striatum of Parkinson's disease patients was found to contain six times less TH+ neurons than that of controls, whereas the striatum of Huntington's disease patients was largely devoid of such neurons. These findings are at odds with the results obtained in rodent and monkey models of Parkinson's disease, in which the number of striatal TH+ neurons is reported to increase markedly following DA denervation. Since Parkinson's disease patients examined in this study were all treated with l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine to compensate for the loss of striatal DA and that levels of striatal DA are reportedly higher in the striatum of Huntington's disease patients compared with controls, we hypothesize that local DA concentrations exert a negative feedback on the expression of TH phenotype by striatal interneurons. A better knowledge of factors governing the in vivo state of this ectopic neuronal population could open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea.",

    "abstract": "Walking on a rotating platform for 15 min causes healthy subjects to involuntarily turn when walking without vision. This adaptive response, called podokinetic after-rotation (PKAR), uses the same kinematic patterns as voluntary turning suggesting that PKAR and voluntary turning share common mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to determine whether people with Parkinson disease (PD), a condition that produces substantial disability from turning difficulties, can adapt to the rotating platform. Initial testing of people with PD revealed that most were unable to step on the rotating platform for 15 continuous minutes. We thus tested a less intense version of the paradigm in eight healthy people. On one day, subjects walked on the platform for 15 continuous minutes; on another day, they walked on the platform for three 5-minute intervals separated by 5-minute rests. After both sessions, subjects rested for 5 min then walked in place for 30 min without vision, while we recorded rotational velocity of PKAR. Continuous and interval protocols effectively elicited robust PKAR. We then tested eight subjects with PD and matched controls using the 5-minute interval protocol and recorded PKAR responses for 10 min. There were no significant differences between the PD and control groups. We conclude that PD subjects can adapt to the rotating platform and develop PKAR from interval training. Future studies are needed to determine whether the rotating platform may act as a rehabilitative tool to reinforce motor patterns for turning and alleviate turning difficulties in people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is an idiopathic disorder of the extrapyramidal system. It has a worldwide prevalence but data from developing countries is scanty. We describe the clinical spectrum of the disease from Pakistan, a developing country.\nPatients with Parkinson's disease, over a period of 11 years, were identified by ICD-9 coding system of the hospital medical records. Demographical characteristics, clinical features, laboratory investigations and radiological investigations were recorded and analysed.\nA total of 80 patients were identified. 50 (63 percent) were males and 30 (37 percent) were females. Mean age of onset of the disease was 54 years. 47 (59 percent) patients had onset of illness during the sixth or seventh decade of life. Mean duration of illness at the time of presentation was five years. Rigidity, bradykinesia, tremors, hypomimia, primitive reflexes, difficulty in performing fine work and walking difficulty were the most common clinical features. 52 (65 percent) patients had stage I or II (Hoehn-Yahr staging) disease at the time of presentation. 56 (70 percent) patients had predominantly unilateral symptoms. 15 (19 percent) patients had cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline was more common in the elderly and in patients with disease duration of longer than ten years.\nParkinson's disease is more common in males. Tremor, rigidity, walking difficulty, bradykinesia and difficulty in performing fine work are the commonest clinical features. Disease severity increases with duration of the disease. Cognitive impairment is not uncommon in these patients and is associated with disease duration and age of onset of the illness.",

    "abstract": "The DJ-1 gene is extensively studied because of its involvement in familial Parkinson disease. DJ-1 belongs to a complex superfamily of genes that includes both prokaryotic and eukaryotic representatives. We determine that many prokaryotic groups, such as proteobacteria, cyanobacteria, spirochaetes, firmicutes, or fusobacteria, have genes, often incorrectly called \"Thij,\" that are very close relatives of DJ-1, to the point that they cannot be clearly separated from the eukaryotic DJ-1 genes by phylogenetic analyses of their sequences. In addition, and contrary to a previous study that suggested that DJ-1 genes were animal specific, we show that DJ-1 genes are found in at least 5 of the 6 main eukaryotic groups: opisthokonta (both animals and fungi), plantae, chromalveolata, excavata, and amoebozoa. Our results thus provide strong evidence for DJ-1 genes originating before the origin of eukaryotes. Interestingly, we found that some fungal species, among them the model yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, have DJ-1-like genes, most likely orthologous to the animal genes. This finding opens new ways for the analysis of the functions of this group of genes.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in LRRK2 encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 are thus far the most frequent genetic cause associated with autosomal dominant and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). To examine whether LRRK2 is directly associated with neuropathology of PD and other related disorders, we analyzed LRRK2 in brains of patients affected by PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using highly specific antibodies to LRRK2.\nWe demonstrated that anti-LRRK2 antibodies strongly labelled brainstem and cortical Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmarks of PD and DLB, respectively. In addition, anti-LRRK2 also labelled brain vasculature, axons, and neuronal cell bodies. Interestingly, the immunocytochemical profile of LRRK2 varied with different antibodies depending upon specific antigenic sites along the LRRK2 protein. All anti-LRRK2 antibodies tested that were raised against various regions of LRRK2, were found to be immunoreactive to recombinant LRRK2 on Western blots. However, only the antibodies raised against the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of LRRK2, but not the regions containing folded protein domains, were positive in immunolabeling of Lewy bodies, suggesting a differential exposure of specific antigenic sites of LRRK2 on tissue sections.\nWe conclude that LRRK2 is a component of Lewy bodies in both PD and DLB, and therefore plays an important role in the Lewy body formation and disease pathogenesis. Information on the cellular localization of LRRK2 under normal and pathological conditions will deepen our understanding of its functions and molecular pathways relevant to the progression of PD and related disorders.",

Rehabilitation should be initiated early and directed toward functional objectives defined by a pluridisciplinary team. To maintain movements is a fundamental aim and must take into account the tiredness of the old subject. Gymnic, active and passive techniques are proposed to preserve the posture, balance and walk. The prevention of falls is a major goal to avoid the risks of grabatisation and trauma. Multiple respiratory disorders are related to disturbances of swallowing and affect the deficiencies of voice and speech. The objectives of care are different if the patient presents a parkinsonan syndrome different from Parkinson's disease or if dementia is associated. The treatment by neurostimulation in old subjects also raises new questions for rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in subjects over 70 years old is simpler than in younger subjects for correcting the consequences of dopamine deficiency, but more complex with regard to symptoms resulting from non-dopaminergic lesions (axial symptoms, cognitive decline). Due to the lower risk of occurrence of motor fluctuations and severe dyskinesia, L-DOPA is the dopaminergic treatment with the best ratio of efficacy to side effects, and can be used without reservation. Treatment of non-dopaminergic symptoms is still disappointing. Apart from a partial beneficial effect of functional rehabilitation programmes, no treatment was demonstrated to be really effective for correcting dysarthria, swallowing disorders or impairment of gait and balance. Some efficacy in reducing the cognitive deficit in PD has been recently shown by cholinergic drugs, but their functional efficacy and their mid-term impact remain poor. Analysis of the different factors involved in the genesis of symptoms in PD (with the putative interest of the use of L-DOPA as a 'diagnostic tool'), and of the comorbidity usually enables cautious and pragmatic solutions to be found.",

    "abstract": "To specify the existing relationship between Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD), it is necessary to retrace the natural history of an histopathological lesion, which, although being non-specific, is essential for a precise diagnosis, the Lewy body. The occurrence of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease, as in the other two types of dementia, unveils a potential continuum between these affections, which could be reunited under the term of alpha-synucleinopathy. However, defining the modalities of various types of alpha-synucleinopathy has not been historically based on the notion of a continuum. Thus, their nosological framework remains imprecise and controversial. Nevertheless, the LBD and PDD clinical, radiological and neuropathological expressions reveal many similarities. Their clinical distinction could then seem quite arbitrary. Furthermore, some studies underline the relationships between the various \"proteinopathies\" described in the degenerative dementias (Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia and Alzheimer's disease). Finally, the role played by associated vascular lesions needs to be specified. It becomes essential to better define the boundaries of these cerebral neurodegenerative diseases. The perspective of common physiopathological mechanisms and certain vulnerability profiles could lead to new therapeutic pathways.",

    "abstract": "The cognitive disorders observed in non-demented Parkinsonian patients are frequent but subtle. They mostly result from difficulties to control attentional resources. These deficits particularly disturb the strategies involved in planning as well as in encoding and retrieval processing of memory, whereas consolidation of the mnemonic traces and instrumental functions are relatively spared. These deficits can be related to the striatal dopamine depletion (in particular in the caudate nuclei) which seems sufficient to account for the cognitive disorders that appear early in the course of the disease. In particular, the caudate dopamine depletion induces a cascade of dysfunction within the basal ganglia, downstream of the striatum, which ultimately affects the prefrontal functions. It is likely that, in the course of the disease, lesions of other ascending systems of neurotransmission (cholinergic, serotoninergic and noradrenergic pathways) contribute to worsen the cognitive disorders and also to modify their clinical pattern. The impact of direct cortical lesions can also be discussed but it seems that these lesions mostly contribute to the cognitive deficits in the late stages of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "About one third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience hallucinations, mostly of a complex visual type, less often auditory or tactile. Minor hallucinatory phenomena, including sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions are frequent. Hallucinations primarily occur in a context of clear sensorium in patients with longstanding PD. They are more frequent in the evening or during the night. Insight in the hallucinatory nature of the phenomenon may be retained, partial, fluctuating, or abolished. An altered insight is common when cognitive impairment is present, and may be associated with delusions and (or) delusional misidentifications. Pharmacological factors such as dopaminergic treatment clearly trigger or increase the occurence of hallucinations in PD. However, in the recent years, emphasis has been made on disease-related factors including cognitive impairment, diurnal somnolence, visual disorders (either contrast and color discrimination impairment due to PD, or coincident ocular disorders), long duration of PD, late onset, severe axial impairment and autonomic dysfunction. The pathophysiology of hallucinations of PD is poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial. The first steps of the treatment consist in giving information and reassurance to the patient and his/her caregiver, re-evaluating the antiparkinsonian treatment and associated medications, and evaluating the patient for mood disorder, visual impairment, and cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors, when prescribed for associated cognitive impairment, may be beneficial on hallucinations. In the more severe forms, clozapine has been proved to be safe and effective.",

    "abstract": "Many patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have clinically significant anxiety, depression, apathy, fatigue and sleep disturbances. These non motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are still not well recognized in clinical practice, either in primary or in secondary care, and are frequently missed during routine examination, but often contribute to impair the functional abilities in PD patients. Awareness of behavioral and psychological symptoms in PD should generate new approaches to improve their diagnosis accuracy and facilitate timely therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the molecular basis of the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)(1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)). This hormone improves behavioral deficits and normalizes the nigral dopamine levels in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nWe studied whether the administration of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) would protect against 6-hydroxydopa (6-OHDA)- and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neuronal injury, and its potential regulatory effect on microglia activation.\nWe found that 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) pretreatment significantly decreased 6-OHDA- and MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta by preventing the activation of microglia. This observed neuroprotective effect in MPTP-treated mice that were given 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) may be attributable to inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine expression.\nThese results suggest that 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) is a potentially valuable neuroprotective agent; it may therefore be considered for the treatment of pathologic conditions of the central nervous system, such as PD, where inflammation-induced neurodegeneration occurs.",

    "abstract": "Neural stem cells (NSCs) possess high potencies of self-renewal and neuronal differentiation. We explored here whether transplantation of human NSCs cloned by v-myc gene transfer, HB1.F3 cells, is a feasible therapeutic option for Parkinson's disease. In vivo, green fluorescent protein-labeled HB1.F3 cells (200,000 viable cells in 3 microl of PBS) when stereotaxically transplanted (same-day lesion-transplant paradigm) into the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned striatum of rats significantly ameliorated parkinsonian behavioral symptoms compared with controls (vehicle, single bolus, or continuous minipump infusion of trophic factor, or killed cell grafts). Such graft-derived functional effects were accompanied by preservation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity along the nigrostriatal pathway. Grafted HB1.F3 cells survived in the lesioned brain with some labeled with neuronal marker mitogen-activated protein 2 and decorated with synaptophysin-positive terminals. Furthermore, endogenous neurogenesis was activated in the subventricular zone of transplanted rats. To further explore the neuroprotective mechanisms underlying HB1.F3 cell transplantation, we performed cell culture studies and found that a modest number of HB1.F3 cells were TH and dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 32 positive, although most cells were nestin positive, suggesting a mixed population of mature and immature cells. Administration of the HB1.F3 supernatant to human derived dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells and fetal rat ventral mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons protected against 6-hydroxydopamine neurotoxicity by suppressing apoptosis through Bcl-2 upregulation, which was blocked by anti-stem cell factor antibody alone, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt inhibitor LY294002 [2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one] alone, or a combination of both. These results suggest that HB1.F3 cell transplantation exerts neuroprotective effects against dopaminergic depletion in vitro and in vivo because of trophic factor secretion and neuronal differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease.\nTo analyze the dispensation of antiparkinsonian agents in Spain and to estimate the Parkinson's disease prevalence.\nDispensation of antiparkinsonian agents were studied in Spain during two years (October 1998 to September 2000). Results were expressed in defined daily dosages per 1,000 inhabitants per day (DID). Levodopa's DID was used to estimate the prevalence of the disease. The cost per 1,000 inhabitants per day (CID) and the daily treatment cost was also valued.\nThe most frequently used drugs are levodopa, biperiden and selegiline. The total cost reached values of 116,346,589.30 euros during the study period. The CID was 4,14 euros. It was very high the daily treatment cost of pramipexol and entacapone. The prevalence of Parkinson's disease is considered in 1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in Spain. There is an important geographical variability; regions as Castilla-Leon, Galicia and La Rioja have a higher prevalence than Andalucia or Murcia. The number of patients in Spain can be considered in 69,571 people.\nThere are some differences between the autonomous communities in the antiparkinsonian drugs' utilization.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting 1 in 100 individuals over the age of 60. Dementia in the setting of PD (PDD) may be among the most debilitating symptoms associated with disease progression. Estimates of cognitive decline and dementia in PD suggest that up to 14% per year of patients over age 65 with PD will develop some cognitive impairment. Unfortunately, PDD is not well characterized and the relationship of PDD to Alzheimer disease remains unclear. PDD has been proposed as part of a spectrum with dementia with Lewy bodies, and PDD and dementia with Lewy bodies frequently coexist with Alzheimer disease. It is uncertain, however, whether there is a meaningful distinction between the different disorders. It has also been difficult to gain understanding of the interaction of motor and non-motor symptoms that affect quality of life in PD and confound cognitive and psychomotor performance. This review will examine the clinical, cognitive, neuropsychiatric features of cognitive deficits associated with PD, discuss their pathologic basis and propose avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "Dystonia can occasionally be found in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. It is very uncommon in untreated patients and is more frequently seen as a complication of its treatment. In this review, the various types of dystonia occurring in PD, the differential diagnosis with other parkinsonian syndromes associated with dystonia and treatments available are revised. Dystonia unrelated to treatment can be typical (blepharospasm, torticollis), atypical (parkinsonian writer's cramp, camptocormia, anismus), or occurring in earlyonset Parkinson disease (the so-called kinesigenic foot dystonia, considered a hallmark of early-onset Parkinson's disease). Early and prominent dystonia in untreated patients with parkinsonism should raise the suspicion of other entities other than Parkinson's disease, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy or corticobasal degeneration. In patients on chronic dopaminergic treatment, peak-dose dystonia, diphasic dystonia and off-dystonia can be seen. The later constitutes the major dystonic feature of chronic levodopa therapy, and a wide variety of strategies are available to manage this complication. Among them, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has proved to be the most effective one. Dystonic reactions (mainly involving oculomotor cranial nerves and limbs) in operated patients (especially carriers of deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices) are increasingly being reported, constituting a new type of dystonia in patients with Parkinson's disease: dystonia linked to surgical treatment.",

However, its cause and treatment are not established. Fatigue in PD has two components, peripheral and central, which may be related to each other, but are more likely independent. Fatigue is partially associated with depression or sleep disorders, but patients with fatigue are not always depressed and do not necessarily have sleep problems. Anti-PD drugs may exacerbate or reduce fatigue. The impact of fatigue in PD is often underestimated by health-care providers.",

    "abstract": "There is a high frequency of dyshidrosis in Parkinson's disease. Daily use of an antiparkinsonian drug does not affect sweating. Mental sweating relates to the contraction period and seriousness. However, hyperthermic sweating does not necessarily relate to the contraction period or seriousness. Abnormalities in mental sweating are not necessarily correlated with cardiovascular autonomic disturbances. As the autonomic disturbance becomes more advanced, dyshidrosis becomes more common. Hyperhidrosis may develop with dyskinesia. Hyperhidrosis may be improved by the temporally administration of levodopa. Dyshidrosis might be caused by a centrally-acting abnormality during its early stage. However, postganglional abnormalities as well as central changes may increase as the disease progresses. The presence of dyshidrosis affects the QOL and depression in patients with Parkinson's disease. The only therapy for hyperhydrotic sweating disorders is the administration of levodopa or dopaminagonist. Additional studies including therapy for sweating disorders are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss is frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Reduced energy intake and/or increased energy expenditure have been postulated as the cause. Dysphagia, anorexia, and gastrointestinal dysfunction may be possible causes of reduced energy intake; whereas, rigidity, tremor, and levodopa-induced dyskinesia may increase energy expenditure. Levodopa may enhance glucose metabolism resulting in enhanced energy expenditure. Depression, anti-parkinsonian drugs, and medical complications such as pneumonia and malignancies also may facilitate weight loss in PD. Combinations of various degrees of these factors, especially in advanced PD, may produce weight loss. Such weight loss is associated with malnutrition which may precipitate infection and decubitis; accelerate motor, behavioral, and autonomic impairment; consequently spoiling one's quality of life. Attention must be paid as well to motor symptoms to prevent or reverse weight loss in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "The etiologic link between restless legs syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been debated. Since dopaminergic dysfunction and response to dopaminergic agents are consistent features in RLS and PD, some authors have suggested that these two diseases may share common pathophysiology. However, presently there is not enough evidence to suggest that the actual pathophysiologic mechanism in both diseases is identical. The nigrostriatal dopaminergic system is primarily involved in PD and it is possible that the extrastriatal dopaminergic system may be variably involved in those PD patients with RLS symptoms. Further clinical, imaging, pharmacologic, and genetic studies will be needed to address the many unanswered questions related to the link between RLS and PD.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of Gait (FOG) is one of the most disabling and least understood symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), and is usually observed in the advanced stage of the disease. FOG can be experienced on turning, in narrow spaces, whilst reaching a destination, and in stressful situations. FOG is commonly observed in the \"off\" state, but it can also be observed in the \"on\" state. Dual tasking (cognitive load) aggravates FOG. Visual or auditory cues often resolve FOG. Analysis of gait revealed that the rhythm of stepping suddenly jumps into high frequency (4-5 Hz) in FOG (hastening), and that floor reaction forces are disregulated. Stride-to-stride variability is increased in FOG. Hastening phenomenon was reported not only in PD patients but also in patients with striatal lesions. The basal ganglia and its frontal projections may be one of the essential lesion sites for FOG.A recent study using single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) revealed enhanced lateral premotor cortex (PMC) activity during paradoxical gait in PD, suggesting that PMC can compensate for the impaired function of the medial frontal cortex when cued by visual input. Treatment of FOG includes behavioural, medical, and surgical approaches. Tricks of all kinds (including external cues) are effective therapeutic approaches. If FOG occurs predominantly in the \"off\" state, dopaminergic therapy can be increased. For \"on\" freezing or if \"on\" response is otherwise optimised, the dose of the dopaminergic agent may be manipulated, but it could lead to the deterioration of parkinsonism. Deep brain stimulation of the STN often alleviates FOG in the \"off\" state.",

    "abstract": "\"A propensity to bend the trunk forward\" and \"the chin is now almost immovably bent down upon the sternum\" were described by James Parkinson in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The term \"dropped head\" was first reported in \"Gerlier disease\" in Switzerland and 'kubisagari' in Japan and since then also reported in myositis, myopathy, myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neuropathy, and hypothyroidism. Disproportionate antecollis occurs in about half cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA) and is considered dystonic in nature. Dropped head is considered rare in PD, both in advanced and early stages of PD. However, it is known to progress subacutely over a period of several days. In my experience, dropped head is relatively common in PD. The mechanism of dropped head in PD is either dystonia of flexor neck muscles or weakness of extensor neck muscles. The response of dropped head to various anti-parkinsonian medications is rather inconsistent. Levodopa is reported to induce amelioration in some patients while dopamine agonists can cause deterioration. Muscle afferent block with lidocaine and ethanol is reported to be effective, while the effect of botulinum toxin injection into the affected muscles is limited. The effect of stereotaxic neurosurgery on dropped head is controversial. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is necessary to prevent muscle damage associated with longterm overstretch of extensor neck muscles.",

    "abstract": "Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is the only chronic neurodegenerative disorder for which there are effective symptomatic therapies no treatment has yet been identified that would significantly slow its natural progression. Studies into the natural history of Parkinson's disease have been complicated by issues of diagnostic accuracy, heterogeneity of different forms of the disease as well as confounding effects of age related comorbidities. Only recently results from placebo-controlled clinical trials have helped to define the rates of progression of motor dysfunction as assessed by the UPDRS in early PD. Studies in treated patients suggest that there may be different rates of progression in different phases of the disease with faster decline in earlier versus later stages. Measuring progression of motor symptoms, however, alone is insufficient to describe the natural history of PD and may also be inadequate to define clinically meaningful disease modification in intervention trials. Progression of global disability as captured in the Hoehn and Yahr scale is important to consider and progression to stage III with beginning postural impairment defines a major milestone in the natural history of this illness. In addition, non-motor symptoms have major impact on the natural history of PD. Dementia, sleep-wake cycle dysregulation and autonomic failure were present in 50-80% of patients in one recent 15 year-follow up study. Dementia and psychosis are also major risk factors for nursing home placement in PD. A prerequisite for effective interventions that would modify disease progression in Parkinson's disease is the identification of the earliest preclinical stages of illness. This is now become a realistic possibility with screening tests of olfactory function and subsequent functional imaging. Subjects at risk for Parkinson's disease should be the future focus of neuroprotective trials.",

    "abstract": "Various types of abnormal posture are observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). Lateral flexion is very common and frequent among them. The clinical characteristics of lateral flexion in PD vary and are classified into two types, the chronic and subchronic types. The chronic type of lateral flexion in PD appears subclinically and worsens, which is related to the laterality of parkinsonian symptoms and the progression of the disease. The subchronic type of lateral flexion in PD develops subacutely and worsens rapidly in several months. An atypical and rare type of tonic truncal dystonia, Pisa syndrome, may be induced following the intake of neuroleptics. The clinical features of the subchronic type of lateral flexion in PD are similar to those of Pisa syndrome. Differences between lateral flexion in PD and Pisa syndrome are described.",

    "abstract": "Camptocormia is defined as an abnormal, severe and involuntary forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine, which becomes manifest during standing and walking and subsides in the recumbent position. It was originally described as a psychogenic disorder, particularly in soldiers involved in long-term trench service during World War 1. It is becoming increasingly recognized as a prominent and disabling phenomenon during the course of Parkinson's disease (PD). In our experience, there is no clear correlation between camptocormia and levodopa treatment. In a few patients, the abnormal posture improved and in others it was unaltered or even became worse following levodopa administration. In a minority of fluctuating patients, there was a temporary deterioration during the \"off\" periods, but in most, the severity of camptocormia was unchanged during the \"on\" and \"off\" phases. In some patients it is associated with back pains, whereas in others it is painless. It occurs in sporadic PD as well as in postencephalitic and parkin-gene mutation PD and in other parkinsonian syndromes such as MSA. The pathogenesis of this striking clinical sign is unknown. It is definitely not due to a primary vertebral disease causing kyphosis such as ankylosing spondylitis, as the bent spine disappears when the patient lies on his back. The muscles involved may be the abdominal, paravertebral or both. It may by due to a peculiar dystonia or to an extreme form of rigidity. Local myopathic changes were suggested as a possible cause, but these may rather be a secondary phenomenon. Treatment is currently unsatisfactory in most cases. Occasional patients may benefit from intramuscular botulinum toxin injections or from deep brain stimulation.",

Levodopa, the main treatment for this condition, was first used for PD more than 40 years ago and today it still is the most powerful treatment for this disease. In recent years many advances have been made for understanding of the neurochemical mechanisms of this drug. Furthermore, new insights about the genesis of motor complications secondary to its use are known, specially related with the mode of its administration. This article updates the pharmacology of levodopa and its implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of PD. The new available presentations of levodopa are also reviewed.

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation has an effect on the orthostatic regulation of patients with Parkinson disease (PD), we studied cardiovascular regulation during on and off phases of STN stimulation.\nWe examined 14 patients with PD (mean age 58.1 +/- 5.8 years, 4 women, 10 men) with bilateral STN stimulators. Patients underwent 3 minutes of head-up tilt (HUT) testing during STN stimulation and after 90 minutes interruption of stimulation. We monitored arterial blood pressure (BP), RR intervals (RRI), respiration, and skin blood flow (SBF). Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was assessed as the square root of the ratio of low-frequency power of RRI to the low-frequency power of systolic BP for coherences above 0.5.\nDuring the on phase of the STN stimulation, HUT induced no BP decrease, a significant tachycardia, and a significant decrease of SBF. During the off phase of stimulation, HUT resulted in significant decreases in BPsys and RRI and only a slight SBF decrease. HUT induced no change of BRS during stimulation, but lowered BRS when the stimulator was off (p < 0.05).\nSTN stimulation of patients with PD increases peripheral vasoconstriction and BRS and stabilizes BP, thereby improving postural hypotension in patients with PD. The results indicate that STN stimulation not only alleviates motor deficits but also influences autonomic regulation in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "To assess the effects of auditory-verbal distraction on driving performance in Parkinson disease (PD).\nWe tested licensed, currently active drivers with mild-to-moderate PD (n = 71) and elderly controls with no neurologic disease (n = 147) on a battery of cognitive, visual, and motor tests. While they drove on a four-lane interstate freeway in an instrumented vehicle, we determined at-fault safety errors and vehicle control measures during a distracter task (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task [PASAT]) and on an uneventful baseline segment.\nCompared with controls, drivers with PD committed more errors during both baseline and distraction, and drove slower with higher speed variability during distraction. Although the average effect of distraction on driving performance compared with baseline was not different between the groups, the drivers with PD showed a more heterogeneous response to distraction (p < 0.001): the error count increased in 28.2% of drivers with PD (vs 15.8% in controls), decreased in 16.9% (vs 3.4%), and remained stable in 54.9% (vs 80.8%). The odds of increase in safety errors due to distraction was higher in the PD group even after adjusting for baseline errors, level of engagement in PASAT, sex, and education (odds ratio [95% CI] = 2.62 [1.19 to 5.74], p = 0.016). Decreased performance on tests of cognitive flexibility, verbal memory, postural control, and increased daytime sleepiness predicted worsening of driving performance due to distraction within the PD group.\nThe quantitative effect of an auditory-verbal distracter task on driving performance was not significantly different between Parkinson disease (PD) and control groups. However, a significantly larger subset of drivers with PD had worsening of their driving safety errors during distraction. Measures of cognition, motor function, and sleepiness predicted effects of distraction on driving performance within the PD group.",

Although the average effect of distraction on driving performance compared with baseline was not different between the groups, the drivers with PD showed a more heterogeneous response to distraction (p < 0.001): the error count increased in 28.2% of drivers with PD (vs 15.8% in controls), decreased in 16.9% (vs 3.4%), and remained stable in 54.9% (vs 80.8%). The odds of increase in safety errors due to distraction was higher in the PD group even after adjusting for baseline errors, level of engagement in PASAT, sex, and education (odds ratio [95% CI] = 2.62 [1.19 to 5.74], p = 0.016). Decreased performance on tests of cognitive flexibility, verbal memory, postural control, and increased daytime sleepiness predicted worsening of driving performance due to distraction within the PD group.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral measurements during a recognition memory task in 15 normal elderly subjects and 15 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To elicit ERPs unfamiliar faces were repeated immediately after initial presentation (at lag 0), after one intervening face (at lag 1) or at lag 3. Compared to normal controls, PD patients showed decreased accuracy in recognizing new unfamiliar faces. P170 latency and amplitude were similar between both groups. ERP amplitude between 300 and 500 ms after the stimulus in control subjects showed a positive shift (ERP repetition effect) for lag 0 at all sites and for lag 1 and 3 repetitions at the Fz site, while effects in the PD group were not noted at any site, even for the lag 0 repetition. ERP waveforms for the first presentation of faces in PD patients showed a significant positive shift compared to normal controls. These data suggest intact perception but impaired recognition memory for unfamiliar faces in PD. In addition, recognition memory deficits in PD may result from impairment of comparison of structural representations of presented faces with stored representations of faces known to the observer.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have invoked inflammation as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). We determined the role of members of the chemokine system, key inflammatory mediators, in PD pathogenesis. In the MPTP model of murine PD, several chemokines, including CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1) and CCL3 (Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1alpha), were upregulated in the striatum and the ventral midbrain. Astrocytes were the predominant source of CCL2 and CCL3 in the striatum and the substantia nigra, and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra constitutively expressed these two chemokines. MPTP treatment resulted in decreased CCL2 expression and increased CCL3 expression in the surviving dopaminergic neurons. Because we found that CCL2 induced production of TNF-alpha in microglial cells, a cytokine known to play a detrimental role in PD, we anticipated that deletion of the genes encoding CCL2 and CCR2, its major receptor, would confer a protective phenotype. However, MPTP-induced striatal dopamine depletion was comparable in double knockout and wild-type mice. Our results demonstrate that chemokines such as CCL2 are induced following MPTP treatment, but that at least within the context of this PD model, the absence of CCL2 and CCR2 does not protect against striatal dopamine loss.",

    "abstract": "Many current theories of Parkinson's disease (PD) suggest that oxidative stress is involved in the neurodegenerative process. Potential neuroprotective agents could protect neurons through inherent antioxidant properties or through the upregulation of the brain's antioxidant defenses. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been shown to protect and restore dopamine neurons in experimental models of PD and to improve motor function in human patients. This study was designed to investigate GDNF's effect on oxidative stress in a model of PD. GDNF or vehicle was injected into the right striatum of male Fischer-344 rats. Three days later 6-OHDA or saline was injected into the same striatum. The striatum and substantia nigra from both sides of the brain were removed 24h after 6-OHDA or saline injection and analyzed for the oxidative stress markers protein carbonyls and 4-hydroxynonenal. Both markers were significantly reduced in GDNF+6-OHDA treated animals compared to vehicle+6-OHDA treated animals. In addition, in animals allowed to recover for 3.5-4 weeks after the 6-OHDA administration, the GDNF led to significant protection against loss of striatal and nigral tissue levels of dopamine. These results suggest that the protective effects of GDNF against 6-OHDA involve a reduction in oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Arrestins and G proteins-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) regulate signaling and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors. We investigated changes in the expression of arrestins and GRKs in the striatum of patients with Parkinson's disease without (PD) or with dementia (PDD) at postmortem using Western blotting and ribonuclease protection assay. Both PD and PDD groups had similar degree of dopamine depletion in all striatal regions. Arrestin proteins and mRNAs were increased in the PDD group throughout striatum. Protein and mRNA of GRK5, the major subtype in the human striatum, and GRK3 were also upregulated, whereas GRK2 and 6 were mostly unchanged. The PD group had lower concentration of arrestins and GRKs than the PDD group. There was no statistical link between the load of Alzheimer's pathology and the expression of these signaling proteins. Upregulation of arrestins and GRK in PDD may confer resistance to the therapeutic effects of levodopa often observed in these patients. In addition, increased arrestin and GRK concentrations may lead to dementia via perturbation of multiple signaling mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "alpha-synuclein gene mutations are major underlying genetic defects known in familial juvenile onset Parkinson's disease (PD), and alpha-synuclein is a major constituent of Lewy Bodies, the pathological hallmark of PD. The normal cellular function of alpha-synuclein has been elusive, and its exact etiological mechanism in causing dopaminergic neuronal death in PD is also not clearly understood. Very recent reports now indicate that mutant or simply over-expressed alpha- synuclein could cause damage by interfering with particular steps of neuronal membrane traffic. alpha-synuclein selectively blocks endoplamic reticulum-to-Golgi transport, thus causing ER stress. A screen in a yeast revealed that alpha- synuclein toxicity could be suppressed by over-expression of the small GTPase Ypt1/Rab1, and that over-expression of the latter rescues neuron loss in invertebrate and mammalian models of alpha-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration. alpha-synuclein may also serve a chaperone function for the proper folding of synaptic SNAREs that are important for neurotransmitter release. We discuss these recent results and the emerging pathophysiological interaction of alpha-synuclein with components of neuronal membrane traffic.",

    "abstract": "Performing various daily activities requires precise application and control of forces, which has been well addressed in neurologically healthy individuals. Recent experiments have demonstrated that in young, normal subjects generating rapid force pulses over various force amplitudes was accomplished by linearly increasing the rate of force development while keeping time to peak force approximately constant (i.e., a pulse-height control strategy). Using Parkinson's disease (PD) patients the present study examined whether PD patients use a pulse-height control strategy during rapid and accurate isometric force production. Subjects were instructed to produce force pulses to three different target amplitudes (15, 35, and 55% of their maximal voluntary contractions) at their preferred speed and as fast as possible. When the task was performed as fast as possible, PD patients differed from controls by producing reduced rates of force development and prolonged times to peak force as a function of force amplitude. During performance of the task at preferred speed, which leaves the rate of force production unconstrained, PD patients did not show improved regulation of time to peak force in scaling different force amplitudes compared to controls. These results suggest that PD patients have a difficulty in utilizing a pulse-height control strategy and that such impairments are not dependent on speed.",

    "abstract": "Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease exhibit impairments in executive processes, including planning and set-shifting, even at the early stages of the disease. We have recently developed a new card-sorting task to study the specific role of the caudate nucleus in such executive processes and have shown, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in young healthy adults, that the caudate nucleus is specifically required when a set-shift must be planned. Here the same fMRI protocol was used to compare the patterns of activation in a group of early-stage Parkinson's disease patients (seven right-handed patients at Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 and 2; mean age 62 years, range 56-70) and matched control subjects. Increased cortical activation was observed in the patients compared with the control group in the condition not specifically requiring the caudate nucleus. On the other hand, decreased cortical activation was observed in the patient group in the condition significantly involving the caudate nucleus. This event-related fMRI study showed a pattern of cortical activation in Parkinson's disease characterized by either reduced or increased activation depending on whether the caudate nucleus was involved or not in the task. This activation pattern included not only the prefrontal regions but also posterior cortical areas in the parietal and prestriate cortex. These findings are not in agreement with the traditional model, which proposes that the nigrostriatal dopamine depletion results in decreased cortical activity. These observations provide further evidence in favour of the hypothesis that not only the nigrostriatal and but also the mesocortical dopaminergic substrate may play a significant role in the cognitive deficits observed in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The selection of the best candidates for surgery among Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is a debated topic. This could be particularly important for transplantation studies in which patients with advanced PD and motor complications refractory to conventional pharmacological treatments are usually included. The development of lesions in nondopaminergic structures, which apparently are unaffected by the intervention, could eventually lead to the appearance of disabling, treatment-resistant symptoms. This has been considered as the crucial factor responsible for the outcome of any therapeutic procedure. However, other factors might be involved. It is suggested in this article that the rate of progression of PD and the effects of ageing are more important than the extradopaminergic involvement in the final outcome. Rate of progression of PD is critically related to the power of compensatory mechanisms, which are age related and under the control of still unknown genes. Thus, patients with young onset parkinsonism (YOP), either caused by gene mutations or not, could be the best candidates for surgery because they have a slower disease progression and more competent compensatory mechanisms. On the other hand, this can also explain the appearance of unexpected side effects such as the \"runaway\" dyskinesias reported following transplantation.",

    "abstract": "In this study we implanted magnetically labeled neural stem cells (NSCs) in PD rats and then monitored their survival and migration in the host brain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The mesencephalic NSCs were obtained from the brain of SD rats. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) was transferred to NSCs by Lipofectamine transfection. Eighteen PD lesioned rats were selected for transplantation by evaluation of their rotational behavior in response to amphetamine and randomly assigned to 3 groups, i.e., sham group, PBS group and NSCs transplanted group, with 6 rats in each group. MR scanning was performed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 week(s) following transplantation. At the meantime, rotational behavior was assessed in each group. Our results showed that SPIO particles were clearly visible with Prissian blue staining in neurospheres and cells derived from NSCs. The rotational behavior of the NSCs transplanted group was remarkably improved compared with that of sham group and PBS group (P < 0.05). In vivo MR tracking of NSCs showed that SPIO labeling led to a strong susceptibility change of signal 1 week after transplantation on T2 weighted images. And a large circular hypointense signal appeared in the transplanted area on T2* gradient echo images. Ten weeks following transplantation, the hypointense signal on T2 weighted and T2* gradient echo images was still displayed. It is concluded that SPIO particles could label NSCs effectively, and MRI detection of SPIO labeled cells is a promising method and novel approach to analyzing the NSCs following transplantation in the treatment of PD.",

The comparison of the absorption spectra near the iron K-edge measured in melanized neurons from SN of PD and control samples did not show significant differences in iron oxidation state.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that is mainly caused by dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra. Several nuclear medicine radiotracers have been developed to evaluate PD diagnoses and disease evolution in vivo in PD patients. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon computerized emission tomography (SPECT) radiotracers for the dopamine transporter (DAT) provide good markers for the integrity of the presynaptic dopaminergic system affected in PD. Over the last decade, radiotracers suitable for imaging the DAT have been the subject of most efforts. In this review, we provide a critical discussion on the utility of DAT imaging for Parkinson's disease diagnosis (sensitivity and specificity).\nA doen\u00e7a de Parkinson (DP) \u00e9 uma desordem neurodegenerativa causada por perda de neur\u00f4nios dopamin\u00e9rgicos na subst\u00e2ncia negra.

    "abstract": "For more than two decades, reports have suggested that pesticides and herbicides may be an etiologic factor in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, no clear associations with any specific pesticide have been demonstrated from epidemiological studies perhaps, in part, because methods of reliably estimating exposures are lacking. We tested the validity of a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based exposure assessment model that estimates potential environmental exposures at residences from pesticide applications to agricultural crops based on California Pesticide Use Reports (PUR). Using lipid-adjusted dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) serum levels as the \"gold standard\" for pesticide exposure, we conducted a validation study in a sample taken from an ongoing, population-based case-control study of PD in Central California. Residential, occupational, and other risk factor data were collected for 22 cases and 24 controls from Kern county, California. Environmental GIS-PUR-based organochlorine (OC) estimates were derived for each subject and compared to lipid-adjusted DDE serum levels. Relying on a linear regression model, we predicted log-transformed lipid-adjusted DDE serum levels. GIS-PUR-derived OC measure, body mass index, age, gender, mixing and loading pesticides by hand, and using pesticides in the home, together explained 47% of the DDE serum level variance (adjusted r(2) = 0.47). The specificity of using our environmental GIS-PUR-derived OC measures to identify those with high-serum DDE levels was reasonably good (87%). Our environmental GIS-PUR-based approach appears to provide a valid model for assessing residential exposures to agricultural pesticides.",

    "abstract": "Our 15 years of research have generated the first short- and long-term efficacy data for speech treatment (Lee Silverman Voice Treatment; LSVT/LOUD) in Parkinson's disease. We have learned that training the single motor control parameter amplitude (vocal loudness) and recalibration of self-perception of vocal loudness are fundamental elements underlying treatment success. This training requires intensive, high-effort exercise combined with a single, functionally relevant target (loudness) taught across simple to complex speech tasks. We have documented that training vocal loudness results in distributed effects of improved articulation, facial expression, and swallowing. Furthermore, positive effects of LSVT/LOUD have been documented in disorders other than Parkinson's disease (stroke, cerebral palsy). The purpose of this article is to elucidate the potential of a single target in treatment to encourage cross-system improvements across seemingly diverse motor systems and to discuss key elements in mode of delivery of treatment that are consistent with principles of neural plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Despite promising preclinical studies, neurotrophic factors have not yet achieved an established role in the treatment of human neurodegenerative diseases. One impediment has been the difficulty in providing these macromolecules in sufficient quantity and duration at affected sites. An alternative approach is to directly activate, by viral vector transduction, intracellular signaling pathways that mediate neurotrophic effects. We have evaluated this approach in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra, neurons affected in Parkinson's disease, by adeno-associated virus 1 transduction with a gene encoding a myristoylated, constitutively active form of the oncoprotein Akt/PKB. Adeno-associated virus Myr-Akt has pronounced trophic effects on dopamine neurons of adult and aged mice, including increases in neuron size, phenotypic markers, and sprouting. Transduction confers almost complete protection against apoptotic cell death in a highly destructive neurotoxin model. Activation of intracellular neurotrophic signaling pathways by vector transfer is a feasible approach to neuroprotection and restorative treatment of neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies based on limited exposure assessment have suggested that Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with pesticide exposure. The authors used data obtained from licensed private pesticide applicators and spouses participating in the Agricultural Health Study to evaluate the relation of self-reported PD to pesticide exposure. Cohort members, who were enrolled in 1993-1997, provided detailed information on lifetime pesticide use. At follow-up in 1999-2003, 68% of the cohort was interviewed. Cases were defined as participants who reported physician-diagnosed PD at enrollment (prevalent cases, n = 83) or follow-up (incident cases, n = 78). Cases were compared with cohort members who did not report PD (n = 79,557 at enrollment and n = 55,931 at follow-up). Incident PD was associated with cumulative days of pesticide use at enrollment (for highest quartile vs. lowest, odds ratio (OR) = 2.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.2, 4.5; p-trend = 0.009), with personally applying pesticides more than half the time (OR = 1.9, 95% confidence interval: 0.7, 4.7), and with some specific pesticides (ORs > or = 1.4). Prevalent PD was not associated with overall pesticide use. This study suggests that exposure to certain pesticides may increase PD risk. Findings for specific chemicals may provide fruitful leads for further investigation.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, major breakthroughs in the understanding of genetic contributions to Parkinson's disease (PD) have been achieved. Recently, mutations in LRRK2, encoding dardarin, have been found to be responsible for an autosomal dominant parkinsonism (OMIM 607060). We screened 311 subjects (cases: n = 202, controls: n = 109) for the three previously reported LRRK2 mutations. Our investigation revealed a sporadic case of PD with a heterozygous mutation G2019S (c.6055G>A). Here, we present the clinical phenotype of this patient and discuss the implications of genetic testing for the G2019S mutation in patients with sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "Urinary dysfunction is very common in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and manifests primarily with symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB). Affection of central serotonergic systems has been suggested to play a role in OAB. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether in PD patients with OAB symptoms a specific alteration of the brainstem raphe (BR), which contains serotonergic neurons, can be detected with transcranial sonography (TCS). Of 116 PD patients enrolled, 19 had PD-related OAB symptoms (OAB+) unlike remaining 97 patients (OAB-). Patients were examined by a sonographer blinded to the clinical data. Reduced echogenicity of BR was found in 12 (63%) OAB+ patients but only in 18 (19%) of 93 assessable OAB- patients (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.001). In OAB+ patients, lower raphe echogenicity score was associated with longer duration of OAB symptoms (anova, P = 0.033). Other TCS findings such as echogenicity of substantia nigra, thalami, lenticular and caudate nuclei, and widths of third and lateral ventricles did not differ between OAB+ and OAB- patients. TCS findings suggest a pathogenetic role of BR in OAB related to PD. Alterations may reflect disturbance of its central serotonergic system.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that Medicare risk-adjusted capitation models do not adequately compensate programs serving primarily disabled or frail populations. Using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, we demonstrate that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-Hierarchical Condition Categories (CMS-HCC) model calculates Medicare capitation payments for Parkinson's patients more accurately than for the general population. The discrepancies between the predicted and actual expenditures estimated at various disability levels were smaller for Parkinson's patients than for other beneficiaries. If the CMS-HCC payment model were to apply to programs that draw a significant percentage of their participants from the Parkinson's disease community, these programs likely would be compensated fairly.",

    "abstract": "We used fMRI to investigate the neurofunctional basis of externally and internally timed movements in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Ten PD patients whose medication had been withheld for at least 18h and 11 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were scanned while performing continuation paradigm with a visual metronome. Compared with the controls, PD patients displayed an intact capability to store and reproduce movement frequencies but with a significantly increased movement latencies. No differences in BOLD response were found in both groups when comparing the continuation with the preceding synchronization phase and viceversa, except for activity in visually related regions. Relative to healthy controls during the synchronization phase, PD patients exhibited an overall signal increase in the cerebellum and frontostriatal circuit (putamen, SMA and thalamus) activity together with specific brain areas (right inferior frontal gyrus and insula cortex) that are also implicated in primary timekeeper processes. By contrast, in the continuation phase the only neural network involved to a greater extent by the PD group was the cerebello-thalamic pathway. The lack of neurofunctional differences between the two timing phases suggests that rhythmic externally and internally guided movements engage similar neural networks in PD and matched healthy controls. Moreover, between-group comparison indicates that PD patients OFF medication may compensate for their basal ganglia-cortical loop's dysfunction using different motor pathways involving cerebellum and basal ganglia relays during the two phases of rhythmic movement.",

    "abstract": "This study examined sensorimotor integration and motor functioning in seven patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who had mild symptoms, and seven age-matched controls. Neuro-oscillations were recorded by high-density 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG). Participants were required to perform two tasks: simple tapping of the index finger and thumb and a complex Luria finger apposition task. Both tasks were performed unimanually and bimanually. There were no significant group differences in the task-related power (TRPow) within alpha 1 (mu1) or in beta 1 frequencies (beta1). In contrast, there were significant group differences in the alpha 2 (mu2) and beta 2 frequencies (beta2). Patients had less desychronisation than controls at the electrodes covering the central regions of the scalp. Alpha 2 and beta 2 frequencies have been associated with task-specific sensorimotor integration and motor function, respectively. This activity difference in patients with Parkinson's disease may be due to deficits in sensorimotor integration.",

    "abstract": "This work is the second of a series of papers in which we investigated the neurophysiological basis of deep brain stimulation (DBS) clinical efficacy using post-operative local field potential (LFP) recordings from DBS electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson's disease. We found that low-frequency (1-1.5Hz) oscillations in LFP recordings from the STN of patients with Parkinson's disease dramatically increase after DBS of the STN itself (log power change=0.93+/-0.62; Wilcoxon: p=0.0002, n=13), slowly decaying to baseline levels after turning DBS off. The DBS-induced increase of low-frequency LFP oscillations is highly reproducible and appears only after the delivery of DBS for a time long enough to induce clinical improvement. This increase of low-frequency LFP oscillations could reflect stimulation-induced modulation of network activity or could represent changes of the electrochemical properties at the brain-electrode interface.",

    "abstract": "The motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been linked to an abnormal spatial covariance pattern involving basal ganglia thalamocortical pathways. By contrast, little is known about the functional networks that underlie cognitive dysfunction in this disorder. To identify such patterns, we studied 15 non-demented PD patients using FDG PET and a voxel-based network modeling approach. We detected a significant covariance pattern that correlated (p<0.01) with performance on tests of memory and executive functioning. This PD-related cognitive pattern (PDCP) was characterized by metabolic reductions in frontal and parietal association areas and relative increases in the cerebellar vermis and dentate nuclei. To validate this pattern, we analyzed data from 32 subsequent PD patients of similar age, disease duration and severity. Prospective measurements of PDCP activity predicted memory performance (p<0.005), visuospatial function (p<0.01), and perceptual motor speed (p<0.005) in this validation sample. PDCP scores additionally exhibited an excellent degree of test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC=0.89) in patients undergoing repeat FDG PET at an 8-week interval. Unlike the PD-related motor pattern, PDCP expression was not significantly altered by antiparkinsonian treatment with either intravenous levodopa or deep brain stimulation (DBS). These findings substantiate the PDCP as a reproducible imaging marker of cognitive function in PD. Because PDCP expression is not altered by routine antiparkinsonian treatment, this measure of network activity may prove useful in clinical trials targeting the progression of non-motor manifestations of this disorder.",

    "abstract": "Severity of Parkinson's disease (PD) and frontal impairment are positively correlated. Testing frontal functions in depressed/nondepressed PD patients with different severity stages may reveal whether depression leads to this impairment. We aimed to relate severity of PD to frontal functional impairment and to test if negative stimuli/depressive symptoms interfered with frontal tasks. The Stroop test and the Emotional Stroop test were performed by 46 PD patients, 18 of whom were depressed. The Hoehn and Yahr scale assessed severity of the disease. We calculated the difference in seconds for each Stroop card and the interference index (C/D) between depressed and nondepressed patients sharing the same severity of disease. The differences among the groups (depressed and nondepressed) according to the severity of the disease (mild and moderate) were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. The depressed patients had a poorer performance on the test than the nondepressed PD patients, although the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, there is a clinically relevant but not statistically significant difference on the performance of frontal tasks between depressed and nondepressed PD patients. Neither depression nor the severity of the disease were determinant to the poorer performance on the Stroop and the Emotional Stroop tests.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive motor disorder, but frequently is accompanied by autonomic symptoms such as hypotension. Together with the decrease of dopamine, significant decreases in aminopeptidase activities have been reported in PD brains. However, up to date there are no studies about changes of aminopeptidase activities in plasma of PD patients. We studied plasma activities of alanyl-, aspartyl-(AspAP), cystinyl-(CysAP) and glutamyl-aminopeptidase (GluAP) in two groups of subjects: control (n=41) and PD (n=48). Plasma activities of AspAP, CysAP, and GluAP showed significant decreases of 24.9% (p<0.05), 39.4% (p<0.01) and 33.3% (p<0.01), respectively, in PD group. These aminopeptidases are involved in the metabolism of circulating peptides such as the ones of the renin-angiotensin system. The importance of aminopeptidases in striatal dopamine content and in neuroendocrine system in PD is discussed.",

A positron emission tomography scan showed an activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior temporal cortex, the left anterior cingulate cortex and a deactivation of the left insula. This suggests that changes in cortical activation related to mania are subcortically driven, involving notably the substantia nigra.",

    "abstract": "There is an important unmet medical need in Parkinson's disease for a neuroprotective treatment that slows or stops disease progression. TCH346 is a potent anti-apoptotic drug that protects against loss of dopaminergic neurons in laboratory models. Our aim was to assess TCH346 as a neuroprotective drug in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nPatients presenting at 45 international movement disorder clinics with early untreated Parkinson's disease were assessed as part of this parallel-group, double-blind, randomised controlled trial. 301 eligible patients were randomly assigned 12-18 months' treatment with TCH346 at a daily dose of 0.5 mg (n=78), 2.5 mg (n=79), or 10 mg (n=73), or placebo (n=71), followed by a 4 week washout period. The primary outcome measure was time to development of a disability requiring dopaminergic treatment. Secondary outcome measures were the annual rate of change in the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) and the PDQ-39, a measure of quality of life. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. This study is pending registration with .\n255 patients completed the study. TCH346 did not differ from placebo for any of the study outcomes. Treatment was needed in 26 (34%) patients in the TCH346 0.5 mg group, 30 (38%) in the TCH346 2.5 mg group, 24 (33%) in the TCH346 10 mg group, and 23 (32%) in the placebo group. There were no significant differences between groups. There were no differences between groups in the annual change in the UPDRS or PDQ-39 either. Few patients withdrew because of adverse events and none was judged to be related to the study intervention.\nTCH346 did not show evidence of a neuroprotective effect. The discrepancy between the preclinical promise of TCH346 and the clinical outcome could have arisen because of the use of laboratory models that do not accurately reflect the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, the doses of study drug used, insensitive clinical endpoints, and the patient population selected for study.",

    "abstract": "Although the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown, a common element of most theories is the involvement of oxidative stress, either as a cause or effect of the disease. There have been relatively few studies that have characterized oxidative stress in animal models of PD. In the present study a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rodent model of PD was used to investigate the in vivo production of oxidative stress after administration of the neurotoxin. 6-OHDA was injected into the striatum of young adult rats and the production of protein carbonyls and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) was measured at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after administration. A significant increase in both markers was found in the striatum 1 day after neurotoxin administration, and this increase declined to basal levels by day 7. There was no significant increase found in the substantia nigra at any of the time points investigated. This same lesion paradigm produced dopamine depletions of 90-95% in the striatum and 63-80% in the substantia nigra by 14-28 days post-6-OHDA. Protein carbonyl and HNE levels were also measured in middle-aged and aged animals 1 day after striatal 6-OHDA. Both protein carbonyl and HNE levels were increased in the striatum of middle-aged and aged animals treated with 6-OHDA, but the increases were not as great as those observed in the young adult animals. Similar to the young animals, there were no increases in either marker in the substantia nigra of the middle-aged and aged animals. There was a trend for an age-dependent increase in basal amounts of oxidative stress markers when comparing the non-lesioned side of the brains of the three age groups. These results support that an early event in the course of dopamine depletion following intrastriatal 6-OHDA administration is the generation of oxidative stress.",

Twenty-one patients with PD completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and an on-road driving test. Five participants had EDS according to their self-report on the ESS. Neither EDS nor PD medications were associated with on-road driving performance. These findings suggest that in this pilot study EDS did not impair PD patients' driving skills on a formal driving evaluation.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease, precise analysis of gait disorders remains essential for the diagnostic or the evaluation of treatments. During a gait analysis session, a series of successive dynamic gait trials are recorded and data involves a set of continuous curves for each patient. An important aspect of such data is the infinite dimension of the space data belong. Therefore, classical multivariate statistical analysis are inadequate. Recent methods known as functional data analysis allow to deal with this kind of data. In this paper, we present a functional data analysis approach for solving two problems encountered in clinical practice: (1) for a given patient, assessing the reliability of the gait curves corresponding to the different trials (2) performing intra individual curves comparisons for assessing the effect of a therapy. In a first step, each discretized curve was interpolated using cubic B-splines bases in order to ensure the continuous character of data. A cluster analysis was performed on the smoothed curves to assess the reliability and to identify a subset of representative curves for a given patient. Intra individual curves comparisons were carried out in the following way: (1) functional principal component analysis was performed to describe the temporal structure of data and to derive a finite number of reliable principal components. (2) These principal components were used in a linear discriminant analysis to point out the differences between the curves. This procedure was applied to compare the gait curves of 12 parkinsonian patients under 4 therapeutic conditions. This study allowed us to develop objective criteria for measuring the improvements in a subject's gait and comparing the effect of different treatments. The methods presented in this paper could be used in other medical domains when data consist in continuous curves.",

    "abstract": "Authors evaluated the therapeutic effect of the MRI and microelectrodeguided stereotactic pallido- and pallido-thalamotomy in 33 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), whose symptoms were refractory to pharmacological therapy.\nThe patients were evaluated according to the internationally standardized rating scales (UPDRS part II, III, Schawb & England, Hoehn & Yahr, and Fahn) at six timepoints: before the operation, and 2 days, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months postoperatively. The patients were divided into 2 groups. Those in group A had relief of all main parkinsonian symptoms after pallidotomy including tremor. The patients in group B had no relief of tremor after pallidotomy. For them the pallidotomy was completed by thalamotomy in the same sitting, which had resulted in cessation of tremor.\nThe following results were obtained by using the UPDRS part III: after pallidotomy \"On state\" mean: preoperative 51.2, postoperative at 2nd day 29.5 at 3, 6 and 9th month 26, and at 12th month 28.7. \"Off state\" mean: preoperative 64.3, postoperative at 2nd day 31.6, at 3, 6 and 9th month 26, and at 12th months 30.5.

    "abstract": "The m.13513G > A transition in the mitochondrial gene encoding the ND5 subunit of respiratory chain complex I, can cause mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and has been reported to be a frequent cause of Leigh syndrome (LS). We determined the frequency of the mutation in a cohort of 123 patients with reduced complex I activity in muscle (n = 113) or fibroblast (n = 10) tissue. We describe a Pyrosequencing assay for rapid detection and quantification of the m.13513G > A mutation. Two patients with the mutation were identified; both had LS, optical atrophy and a Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPWS)-like cardiac conduction defect. The clinical presentation of the m.13513G > A mutation is discussed. We conclude that the m.13513G > A mutation seems not as frequent as previously suggested and is most likely to be present in patients with Leigh (-like) syndrome combined with a complex I deficiency, optic atrophy and/ or WPWS. In addition, we confirmed that the adjacent m.13514A > G mutation is a rare cause of LS or MELAS since no cases with this transition were found.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac pacemakers and implantable defibrillators are commonly used therapeutic modalities in cardiac arrhythmias. Thalamic deep brain stimulation has also become an important modality in the treatment of drug-refractory tremors and other complications in advanced Parkinson's disease. Concerns exist about the potential electrical interaction and interference between these 2 devices in the same patient. There are only a limited number of reports that have investigated this issue. We describe a patient with advanced Parkinson's disease and a previously implanted deep brain stimulator, who subsequently needed a permanent cardiac pacemaker due to severe bradyarrhythmia. Despite the probability of interference between the devices, there were no problems during implantation of the cardiac pacemaker; both the deep brain stimulator and cardiac pacemaker functioned appropriately afterwards.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed two disease model groups with rats infected by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a 90-day group and a 180-day group after JEV infection. The time measured by the modified pole test showed that motor activities in these two groups were slower than those of age-matched control groups. Striatal dopamine (DA) levels were significantly decreased in all JEV-infected rats. Norepinephrine concentration in brain regions in the 180-day group was significantly decreased in the medulla oblongata and hypothalamus as compared with the control and 90-day group. Tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons were significantly decreased in both JEV-infected rat groups. These results suggest that DA decrease and pathological changes in JEV-infected model rats persist for a long time, at least up to 180 days, and this model will be useful for the evaluation of new anti-parkinsonian agents.",

    "abstract": "The health and socioeconomic impacts of dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia associated with Parkinson's disease have become increasingly recognized. Whilst the nosological status of dementia with Lewy bodies has been better classified as 'Lewy body dementias', both conditions are now believed to represent a disease spectrum, characterized pathologically by synuclein protein and clinically by a variable admixture of cognitive, neuropsychiatric and extrapyramidal features.\nRecent epidemiological studies are described and clinical and pathological similarities emphasized between dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease. A number of investigational techniques are highlighted which have helped to better characterize dementia with Lewy bodies and discriminate it from Alzheimer's disease, whilst also shedding light upon the pathophysiology of both conditions. Finally, the therapeutic aspects of the Lewy body dementias will be considered, concentrating upon studies of the cholinesterase inhibitors.\nThe pathology underlying dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease is heterogeneous, and is neither stereotyped in its topography nor its composition. Cholinesterase inhibitor drugs improve cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms but the clinical response is unpredictable. Major future challenges are to better understand the pathophysiological basis underpinning the diseases, what determines clinical phenotypic expression and how disease-modifying therapies may best be developed and deployed.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the relationship between clinical improvement and in vivo synaptic dopamine (DA) release after a single oral dose of levodopa (LD) in patients with advanced Parkinson disease (PD).\nWe studied 16 patients with advanced PD with [(11)C]raclopride (RAC) PET. Each patient had RAC PET twice: once when medication had been withdrawn and once after an LD challenge. On the day of the LD challenge scan, oral 250 mg LD/25 mg carbidopa was given before scanning. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores were rated in an \"off\" state before LD and again at the end of PET.\nAll the patients were still in \"on\" state at the end of their LD challenge RAC PET scans. Following LD, mean caudate and putamen RAC binding potentials (BPs) were significantly lower vs baseline, consistent with increased synaptic DA. Individual LD-induced improvements in UPDRS score correlated significantly with reductions in putaminal BP. Additionally, large putaminal RAC BP changes were associated with higher dyskinesia scores. When motor UPDRS subitems were examined, improvements in rigidity and bradykinesia, but not in tremor or axial symptoms, correlated with putamen DA release.\nIn advanced Parkinson disease, the improvement of rigidity and bradykinesia and the presence of dyskinesias after a single dose of oral levodopa are governed by the level of dopamine generated at striatal D2 receptors. In contrast, relief of parkinsonian tremor and axial symptoms is not related to striatal synaptic dopamine levels and presumably occurs via extrastriatal mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "To determine which clinical features best characterize Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), compared with Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and to determine the pathologic basis for PDD.\nWe examined 103 participants enrolled in a longitudinal study (nondemented control = 10, PD = 42, DLB = 20, AD = 31) who were followed to autopsy using standardized protocols. We characterized the features of PDD using published criteria for AD and DLB as a framework. Statistical analysis was performed using chi(2) and Fisher exact tests, Kaplan-Meier curves, and logistic regression models.\nThe sample's mean age was 74.0 years (range 53 to 91 years), and individuals were followed for a mean of 3.4 visits (range 1 to 12 visits). During longitudinal follow-up, 83% of subjects with PD developed dementia, defined as a Clinical Dementia Rating score of >or=0.5. Features that distinguished PDD from AD included cognitive fluctuations (p = 0.001), visual (p < 0.001) and auditory (p = 0.006) hallucinations, depression (p = 0.003), and sleep disturbance (p = 0.003). These PDD features were identical to those observed for DLB. The pathologic substrates for PDD included DLB (38%), AD (32%), and nigral LB alone (24%). Clinical predictors of PDD were visual hallucinations (odds ratio [OR] 21.3; 95% CI: 1.5 to 309.6) and male gender (OR 9.6; 95% CI: 1.3 to 71.4).\nParkinson disease dementia (PDD) shares identical clinical features with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB); both entities can be distinguished from Alzheimer disease. The presence of PDD/DLB features at any time during the course of PD is highly predictive of dementia and the presence of LB at autopsy; in particular, male gender and visual hallucinations in PD predict dementia.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac autonomic abnormalities have been described in Parkinson's disease. Little is known about possible alterations of vascular sympathetic regulatory activity in patients without orthostatic hypotension or symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. Nineteen patients with Parkinson's disease without orthostatic hypotension (PD), 21 with orthostatic hypotension (PDOH), and 20 healthy controls underwent ECG, beat-to-beat arterial pressure, and respiration recordings while recumbent and during a 75 degrees head-up tilt. Spectrum analysis of RR interval and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) variability provided indices of cardiac sympathovagal interaction (low frequency [LF]/high frequency [HF]) to the sinoatrial node and sympathetic vasomotor control (LF(SAP)). Arterial baroreceptor mechanisms were assessed by the spontaneous sequences technique and bivariate spectrum analysis (alpha index). Plasma catecholamines provided the neurohormonal profile. At rest, hemodynamics and spectral markers of autonomic function were similar in PD and control subjects. Norepinephrine was lower in PD and PDOH than in control subjects. In PDOH, SAP was higher, whereas LF/HF ratio and LF(SAP) were lower compared with control subjects. During tilt, SAP was unchanged in PD; however, similar to PDOH, the increase of heart rate, LF/HF ratio, and LF(SAP) was blunted compared with control subjects. Baroreflex indices were unmodified in PD and PDOH compared with control subjects. Initial alterations in both cardiac and vascular sympathetic modulatory activity were found in PD and revealed by a gravitational stimulus. Prompt recognition of sympathetic abnormalities might result in earlier therapeutic intervention, reduced orthostatic intolerance, and increased quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been identified as the cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD) at the PARK8 locus. To begin to understand the physiological role of LRRK2 and its involvement in PD, we have investigated the distribution of LRRK2 mRNA and protein in the adult mouse brain. In situ hybridization studies indicate sites of mRNA expression throughout the mouse brain, with highest levels of expression detected in forebrain regions, including the cerebral cortex and striatum, intermediate levels observed in the hippocampus and cerebellum, and low levels in the thalamus, hypothalamus and substantia nigra. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate localization of LRRK2 protein to neurones in the cerebral cortex and striatum, and to a variety of interneuronal subtypes in these regions. Furthermore, expression of LRRK2 mRNA in the striatum of VMAT2-deficient mice is unaltered relative to wild-type littermate controls despite extensive dopamine depletion in this mouse model of parkinsonism. Collectively, our results demonstrate that LRRK2 is present in anatomical brain regions of direct relevance to the pathogenesis of PD, including the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, in addition to other regions unrelated to PD pathology, and is likely to play an important role in the normal function of telencephalic forebrain neurones and other neuronal populations.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine cytotoxicity is thought to contribute towards the selective loss of substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neurons and disease progression in Parkinson's disease. However, the long-term toxicity of dopamine in vivo has not previously been established. The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) sequesters monoamines into synaptic vesicles, a process that, in addition to being important in normal transmission, may also act to keep intracellular levels of monoamine neurotransmitters below potentially toxic thresholds. The homozygous VMAT2-hypomorphic mouse has an insertion in the VMAT2 gene (Slc18a2). Consequently, VMAT2-deficient mice (VD(-/-)) have an approximately 95% reduction in VMAT2 expression and an equivalent level of dopamine depletion in the striatum which results in moderate motor impairment. Here, we show that L-DOPA induces locomotor hyperactivity in VD(-/-) mice and reverses the deficit in motor coordination and balance as tested with the rotarod. We report that evidence for cytosolic accumulation of dopamine in substantia nigra neurons in these mice is two-fold: firstly, there is reduced phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase at the residue associated with catechol feedback inhibition; and, secondly, there are increased rates of dopamine turnover at 6, 12 and 24 months of age. These animals exhibit a progressive decline in striatal monoamine levels and rotarod performance with increasing age. However, despite these data, there was no loss of nigral dopamine neurons as estimated by quantification of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta of old VD(-/-) mice (24-month-old), implying that these age-dependent manifestations may be due to senescence alone.",

    "abstract": "There is a high prevalence of sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD). AIMS. To assess some basic metric attributes of the SCOPA-Sleep scale, a measure for PD patients; secondary objective: to check the impact caused by the sleep disorder on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients and their caregivers.\n68 PD patients and their main caregivers; measures: Hoehn and Yahr staging, SCOPA-Motor, Clinical Impression of Severity Index (CISI-PD), PDSS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, SCOPA-Psychosocial, and EuroQoL. Carers filled in a PDSS questionnaire about patient sleep and HRQoL measures (SF-36, EuroQoL). SCOPA-Sleep acceptability, scaling assumptions, internal consistency, construct validity and precision were determined.\nSCOPA-Sleep acceptability and scaling assumptions resulted satisfactory, although the nocturnal sleep subescale (SC-Ns) showed a mild ceiling effect (22.1%) and a defective convergent validity was found for daytime sleepiness (SC-Ds) item 6. Internal consistency also was satisfactory for both scales (alpha = 0.84 and 0.75, respectively). The correlation between SC-Ns and PDSS was high (rs = -0.70), as it was between SC-Ns and PDSS questionnaire by caregiver (rs = -0.53). The corresponding coefficients with the SC-Ds gained lower values (rs = -0.41 y -0.50). Standard error of measurement was 1.45 for the SC-Ns and 1.76 for the SC-Ds. Both, patient and caregiver HRQoL showed a loose association with the sleep measures.\nSCOPA-Sleep is a feasible, consistent, and useful scale for assessment of sleep disorder in PD patients. A weak association between sleep disorder and HRQoL was found.",

During two follow-up assessments, the self reported health status scores in all eight domains of the PDQ-39 and the overall PDQ-39 summary index worsened significantly (p<0.01) in patients left untreated. In a comparative group in whom treatment was initiated at or soon after diagnosis, there was a trend towards improvement in self reported health status scores after treatment was started.\nThis study addresses for the first time self reported health status, an indicator of health related quality of life, in untreated PD.

    "abstract": "Therapeutic management of gait disorders in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) can sometimes be disappointing, since dopaminergic drug treatments and subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation are more effective for limb-related parkinsonian signs than for gait disorders. Gait disorders could also be partly related to norepinephrine system impairment, and the pharmacological modulation of both dopamine and norepinephrine pathways could potentially improve the symptomatology.\nTo assess the clinical value of chronic, high doses of methylphenidate (MPD) in patients with PD having gait disorders, despite their use of optimal dopaminergic doses and STN stimulation parameters.\nEfficacy was blindly assessed on video for 17 patients in the absence of L-dopa and again after acute administration of the drug, both before and after a 3-month course of MPD, using a Stand-Walk-Sit (SWS) Test, the Tinetti Scale, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III score and the Dyskinesia Rating Scale.\nAn improvement was observed in the number of steps and time in the SWS Test, the number of freezing episodes, the Tinetti Scale score and the UPDRS part III score in the absence of L-dopa after 3 months of taking MPD. The L-dopa-induced improvement in these various scores was also stronger after the 3-month course of MPD than before. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score fell dramatically in all patients. No significant induction of adverse effects was found.\nChronic, high doses of MPD improved gait and motor symptoms in the absence of L-dopa and increased the intensity of response of these symptoms to L-dopa in a population with advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "To examine the development of nocturnal sleeping problems in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) over an 8-year period and to study the clinical and demographic correlates of insomnia.\n231 patients were included in a population-based prevalence study in 1993, and re-examined in 1997 and 2001. At all study visits, we applied semi-structured interviews to obtain information on clinical and demographic data, as well as on nocturnal sleeping problems. Standardised rating scales of parkinsonism, depression and cognitive impairment were used. The relationship between insomnia and demographic and clinical variables was analysed using population-averaged logistic regression models for correlated data. 231 patients were included at baseline, 142 were available for re-evaluation in 1997 and 89 patients in 2001.\nMost nocturnal sleeping problems varied little in prevalence over time, whereas problems related to turning in bed and vivid dreaming or nightmares increased. Insomnia was present in 54-60% of the patients at each of the three study visits and varied considerably in individual patients over time. The presence of insomnia was closely related to disease duration, higher Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores and female sex.\nInsomnia is a highly frequent complaint in patients with PD. It fluctuates over time in individual patients, and its origin seems to be multifactorial.

    "abstract": "To investigate gender differences in basic disease characteristics, motor deterioration and nigrostriatal degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nWe studied 253 consecutive PD patients who were not receiving levodopa or dopamine agonists (disease duration < or = 10 years). We investigated the influence of gender and oestrogen status on: (1) age at onset, (2) presenting symptom, (3) severity and progression of motor symptoms (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS-III) scores) and (4) amount and progression of nigrostriatal degeneration ([123I]FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography measurements).\nAge at onset was 2.1 years later in women (53.4 years) than in men (51.3 years). In women, age at onset correlated positively with parity, age at menopause and fertile life span. Women more often presented with tremor (67%) than men (48%). Overall, patients presenting with tremor had a 3.6 year higher age at onset and a 38% slower UPDRS-III deterioration. Mean UPDRS-III scores at disease onset were equal for both genders, as was the rate of deterioration. Women had a 16% higher striatal [123I]FP-CIT binding than men at symptom onset and throughout the course of PD.\nOur results suggest that, in women, the development of symptomatic PD may be delayed by higher physiological striatal dopamine levels, possibly due to the activity of oestrogens. This could explain the epidemiological observations of a lower incidence and higher age at onset in women. Women also presented more often with tremor which, in turn, is associated with milder motor deterioration and striatal degeneration. Taken together, these findings suggest a more benign phenotype in women with PD.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is effective in the treatment of depression in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). However, since research into the effect of this type of rTMS regime on motor function is limited, we studied the effect of rTMS over the DLPFC on the motor functions in PD patients.\nThirteen patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups, one receiving real-rTMS (90% of resting motor threshold, 10 Hz, 450 pulses-day for 10 consecutive days) over the DLPFC contralateral to the more affected side, and the other group receiving sham-rTMS. Assessment included a clinical motor evaluation using part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and several motor tasks. The UPDRS was applied before and after 10 days of rTMS. Finger tapping, reach movement, grip movement and gait were measured in each session before and after the rTMS over the 10 day period.\nStatistical analysis (ANOVA for repeated measures; group *day *side *rTMS) only showed a significant effect for finger tapping, reach movement and gait for the factor day. No significant change was reported for the UPDRS in any group.\nApplication of rTMS over the DLPFC as a 10 day course had no significant effect on motor functions and clinical motor status, and the improvement in performance of motor tasks can be attributed to the effects of practice.\nrTMS over the DLPFC did not lead to any motor improvement in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "In addition to the G2019S mutation in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2), which is particularly frequent in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish and Northern African origin, three amino acid substitutions (R1441C, R1441G, and R1441H), all at the same residue (R1441), have been identified as important genetic causes of Parkinson disease (PD). To evaluate the frequency of R1441C/G/H and G2019S mutations in the LRRK2 gene in North American patients with PD and to explore genotype-phenotype correlations, we screened 496 PD patients from North America. One Hispanic female was heterozygous for the LRRK2 R1441G mutation, and six other cases including 2 non-Jewish/non-Hispanic whites, 3 Ashkenazi Jewish, and 1 Hispanic, were found to be heterozygous for the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene is a common mutation associated with PD in a North American population, especially in Jewish PD patients (10.7%), while the R1441C/G/H mutation occurs at a relatively low frequency in North Americans except possibly in Hispanics for R1441G. All six G2019S carriers shared a common haplotype with that observed in Europeans and North Africans. The clinical features of all seven cases with LRRK2 mutation were quite broad and included early and late disease onset. These finding may provide new insights into the cause and diagnosis of PD and have implications for genetic counseling.",

    "abstract": "Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [123I]FP-CIT is a marker for loss of presynaptic dopamine transporters in the striatum in Parkinson's disease (PD). We used [123I]FP-CIT SPECT in order to evaluate binding to the dopamine transporter before and after neurosurgical treatment with bilateral stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN).\nThirty-five patients with levodopa-responsive PD were examined with [123I]FP-CIT SPECT pre-operatively (baseline scan: mean 3 months before surgery), and 3 and 12 months after surgery.\nPre-operatively, all patients already had substantial signs of severe nigrostriatal neuronal loss as determined from the [123I]FP-CIT SPECT scans. One year after surgery the specific [123I]FP-CIT binding to the striatum was significantly reduced by 10.3% compared with the pre-operative baseline scan. The mean time span from the baseline scan before surgery to the follow-up scan 1 year after surgery was 16.2 months. Hence, the rate of reduction equals a mean annual reduction of 7.7%. A comparable control group of patients with PD who did not undergo surgery was also examined longitudinally. In this group the specific binding of [123I]FP-CIT was reduced by 6.7% per year.\nThe specific binding of [123I]FP-CIT was reduced equally in the STN-stimulated patients and a group of non-operated PD patients with advanced disease. Our study does not support the notion that electrode implantation and STN stimulation exert a neuroprotective effect by themselves.",

One year after surgery the specific [123I]FP-CIT binding to the striatum was significantly reduced by 10.3% compared with the pre-operative baseline scan. The mean time span from the baseline scan before surgery to the follow-up scan 1 year after surgery was 16.2 months. Hence, the rate of reduction equals a mean annual reduction of 7.7%.

    "abstract": "Spatial covariance analysis has been used with FDG PET to identify a specific metabolic network associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). In the current study, we utilized a new, fully automated voxel-based method to quantify network expression in ECD SPECT images from patients with classical PD, patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), and healthy control subjects.\nWe applied a previously validated voxel-based PD-related covariance pattern (PDRP) to quantify network expression in the ECD SPECT scans of 35 PD patients, 15 age- and disease severity-matched MSA patients, and 35 age-matched healthy control subjects. PDRP scores were compared across groups using analysis of variance. The sensitivity and specificity of the prospectively computed PDRP scores in the differential diagnosis of individual subjects were assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.\nPDRP scores were significantly increased (p < 0.001) in the PD group relative to the MSA and control groups. ROC analysis indicated that the overall diagnostic accuracy of the PDRP measures was 0.91 (AUC). The optimal cutoff value was consistent with a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 0.80 and 0.71 for discriminating PD patients from MSA and normal controls, respectively.\nOur findings suggest that fully automated voxel-based network assessment techniques can be used to quantify network expression in the ECD SPECT scans of parkinsonian patients.",

    "abstract": "To compare the safety and efficacy of quetiapine versus clozapine for the treatment of psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTwenty-seven patients with PD and recent-onset psychosis were randomly allocated to 2 arms of 22 weeks' treatment with quetiapine or clozapine after 2 weeks of adjustment of antiparkinsonian medications. Assessment was done by a blinded neuropsychologist using the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) questionnaire and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Mixed-effect models were used to compare CGIC and Neuropsychological Inventory scores over time between the 2 groups.\nBoth drugs were equally effective based on the CGIC. Clozapine had a trend over quetiapine in controlling the frequency of hallucinations (P = 0.097) and a significant advantage in reducing delusions (P = 0.011). However, one patient in the clozapine arm developed leukopenia. None of the drugs worsened parkinsonism.\nClozapine and quetiapine are effective atypical neuroleptics for the treatment of psychotic symptoms in PD. Clozapine had greater efficacy in reducing hallucinations and delusions frequency, but its use is associated with an increased risk of leukopenia.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate patient perceptions of a new home diary designed to assess the duration and severity of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and to investigate whether the use of a training video and pictograms aids patient understanding of PD terminology.\nFifty advanced PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.5-4.0; dyskinesia for >25% of the waking day) from the United States (n = 18), France (n = 12), and Germany (n = 20) were allocated alternately to 1 of 2 groups and shown a training video either with pictograms or without pictograms. The video explained the functional states \"asleep,\" \"OFF,\" \"ON without dyskinesia,\" and \"ON with dyskinesia,\" and how to complete the diary. Patients were given the corresponding version of the diary with or without pictograms to complete over a 24-hour period. Patients then participated in a second interview in which they were shown the alternate version of the video and diary for discussion only.\nAlmost 95% of patients (47/50) reported that the video helped them to understand and clarify terms. Most patients [39/50 (78%)] preferred the diary with pictograms, but there was no evidence that pictograms improved the accuracy of diary completion. Overall, 80% of patients (40/50) completed the diaries correctly. Incorrect diary completion was usually because of confusion about the different functional states.\nPatients perceive diaries with pictograms as more helpful than those with words alone. Videos, in the patients' primary language, are considered valuable training aids that help patients complete daily diaries.",

    "abstract": "We have previously reported that the use of a 32-symptom Wearing-off Questionnaire (WOQ-32) identified wearing off more frequently than a clinician's evaluation or the complications subscale of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). However, this prototype tool was not designed for clinical practice and required simplification for daily use. Although wearing off is a commonly understood concept among neurologists caring for Parkinson disease patients, there are a number of definitions in the literature. For the purpose of this study and to include both motor and nonmotor parkinsonian symptoms, wearing off was defined as a generally predictable recurrence of motor and nonmotor symptoms that precedes scheduled doses of anti-parkinsonian medication and usually improves after those doses. Using this definition, retrospective analysis and expert opinion were used to identify the 9 most predictive and relevant of the symptoms previously identified as part of the WOQ-32. The resulting 9-symptom questionnaire (WOQ-9) identified 158 (95.8%) of the 165 subjects captured by the 32-Symptom Wearing-off Questionnaire as having wearing off, excluding 7 subjects reporting only balance difficulty (n = 3), numbness (n = 2), difficulty standing (n = 1), and abdominal discomfort (n = 1). Subjects reporting wearing off with the WOQ-9 were significantly younger, had been longer diagnosed with Parkinson disease, experienced a longer duration of levodopa therapy, exhibited a higher UPDRS total score, had higher levodopa equivalent dosages, and increased dyskinesia compared with patients not identified as wearing off with the WOQ-9. No statistical differences were noted with respect to sex, UPDRS subsection scores, Schwab & England Scale, or Hoehn & Yahr Scale.",

Patients with PD treated with L-dopa have been shown to have elevated Hcy levels.\nIdiopathic PD patients were evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr stage, Parkinson Psychosis Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Frontal Assessment Battery, Mini-Mental Status Examination, and several tests for frontal type cognitive functions. Fasting blood samples were collected for the measurement of Hcy, and carotid B-mode ultrasound was performed to measure intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries.\nSeventy-two consecutive PD patients (46 men; average age, 68.7 +/- 11.6 years; average disease duration, 7.0 +/- 4.7 years) were recruited. All but 10 patients were treated with L-dopa. The average level of Hcy was 16.4 +/- 7.8 micromol/L, and 38.9% of the patients had Hcy level above the reference range (>15.0 micromol/L). The Hcy levels were associated with PD duration as they were with L-dopa treatment duration but were not associated with the parameters of disease severity or with L-dopa dose. The Hcy levels were associated neither with the common carotid intima-media thickness nor with cardiovascular morbidity. No association was found between Hcy and the neuropsychiatric features of PD such as depression, cognitive performance, or psychosis.\nHyperhomocystinemia is common in L-dopa-treatedPD patients but was not associated with neuropsychological complications (depression, dementia, and cognitive decline associated with frontal lobe functioning or psychosis), enhanced disease severity, or vascular comorbidity.",

All but 10 patients were treated with L-dopa. The average level of Hcy was 16.4 +/- 7.8 micromol/L, and 38.9% of the patients had Hcy level above the reference range (>15.0 micromol/L). The Hcy levels were associated with PD duration as they were with L-dopa treatment duration but were not associated with the parameters of disease severity or with L-dopa dose. The Hcy levels were associated neither with the common carotid intima-media thickness nor with cardiovascular morbidity. No association was found between Hcy and the neuropsychiatric features of PD such as depression, cognitive performance, or psychosis.",

    "abstract": "The amygdala is closely linked to basal ganglia circuitry and plays a key role in danger detection and fear-potentiated startle. Based on recent findings of amygdalar abnormalities in Parkinson's disease, we hypothesized that non-demented patients with this illness would show blunted reactivity during aversive/unpleasant events, as indexed by diminished emotional modulation of the startle eyeblink response. To test this hypothesis, 23 idiopathic patients with Parkinson's disease and 17 controls viewed standardized sets of aversive, pleasant and neutral pictures for 6 s each. During this time, white noise bursts (50 ms, 95 db) were binaurally presented to elicit startle eyeblink responses, measured from electrodes over the orbicularis oculi. After viewing each picture, subjects provided ratings of valence and arousal. The Parkinson's disease patients were in the early to middle stages of their disease, not demented or depressed, and were tested 'on' dopaminergic medication. The two groups were similar in age, education, gender and cognitive screening status. The control group had larger startle responses when viewing negative, aversive pictures than neutral or pleasant pictures. As predicted, startle enhancement during aversive pictures was significantly muted in the Parkinson's disease patients. This blunting was not due to abnormalities in the mechanics of the startle eyeblink per se. Nor was it related to depression symptoms, medications (psychotropics), or failure to perceive/appreciate the negative meaning of aversive pictures (i.e. normal valence ratings). Reduced startle reactivity in the disease group was related to disease severity (Hoehn-Yahr) and occurred in the context of reduced arousal ratings of aversive pictures. These findings of blunted startle reactivity add to the literature on emotional changes associated with Parkinson's disease. The basis for this muted reactivity is unknown but may involve an amygdala-based translational defect whereby the results of cognitive appraisal are not appropriately transcoded into somato-motor-arousal responses normally associated with an aversive motivational state. This may arise from faulty dopaminergic gating of the amygdala, resulting in 'inhibition' of the amygdala in the manner described by Marowsky et al. (Marowsky A, Yanagawa Y, Obata K, Vogt E. Neuron 2005; 48: 1025-37). More broadly, the findings of muted reactivity to aversive stimuli may reflect a 'bradylimbic' affective disturbance in patients with Parkinson's disease. Future studies are needed to address whether the physiologic blunting observed here might be a useful correlate of apathy.",

    "abstract": "Nix, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, promotes apoptosis of non-neuronal cells, although the mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with POSH (plenty of SH3 domains, a scaffold involved in activation of the apoptotic JNK/c-Jun pathway) as the bait, we identified an interaction between POSH and Nix. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding studies confirmed a direct interaction between POSH and Nix in mammalian cells. When overexpressed in HEK293 cells, Nix promotes apoptosis along with enhanced phosphorylation/activation of JNKs and their target c-Jun. These effects appear to be dependent on POSH because Nix does not promote either JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation or apoptosis of 293 cells that do not express POSH. Nix and POSH appear to mutually stabilize one another and this effect could contribute to their promotion of death. Past work showed induction of Nix transcripts in a cellular model of Parkinson disease based on neuronal PC12 cells exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine. Here, we confirm elevation of Nix protein in this model and that Nix over-expression causes apoptotic death of PC12 cells by a mechanism dependent on c-Jun activation. Expression of s-Nix, a dominant-negative form of Nix, protects neuronal PC12 cells from 6-hydroxydopamine but not from nerve growth factor deprivation. These results indicate that Nix promotes cell death via interaction with POSH and activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway and that Nix protein is induced and contributes to cell death in a cellular model of Parkinson disease.",

More and more other symptoms of this disease not related to the motor system now receive increased attention, including cognitive decline. Dementia in Parkinson's disease occurs more often than initially was thought. After an average of 8 years, about 40% of these patients suffer from cognitive decline. The difficulties and related problems affect prognosis more than do the motor symptoms.

We constructed the adenovirus vector Ad-NSE-GDNF from which the E1, E3/E4 regions of Ad5 have been deleted and in which the GDNF gene was under the control of a neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter. The vector was injected into the striatum of a rat model of Parkinson's disease.

The new compounds were characterized evaluating solubility, chemical stability, apparent partition coefficient (log P) and comparing neostriatum dopamine (DA) levels in freely moving rats after i.p. administration of prodrugs [(+)-4, (+)-5] with prodrugs in liposomal formulations [(+)-4Lip, (+)-5Lip]. All the new compounds showed chemical stability in aqueous buffer solutions (pH 1.3 and 7.4). A relatively slow release of LD in human plasma was observed. Among the studied products, prodrug was able to induce sustained delivery of DA in rat striatal dialysate with respect to equimolar i.p admistration of LD. Furthermore, neostriatum DA concentration after administration of the synthesized prodrugs vs. prodrugs in liposomal formulations was compared (+)-4Lip, (+)-5Lip). The results suggest that cis dimeric prodrug (+)-4 and (+)-4Lip can improve the release of DA in rat brain and demonstrate the potential of these formulations for controlled delivery of antiparkinson agents.",

All patients were examined neurologically with the assessment of stage and severity of Parkinson's disease (Hoehn-Yahr scale, UPDRS, Schwab-England scale). Detailed neuropsychological examination was performed in each Parkinson's disease patient. On the basis of DSM-IV criteria of dementia and the results obtained in psychological examination, the whole group was divided into three subgroups: I, with no cognitive changes (n = 17); II, with mild cognitive impairment (n = 25); and III, with dementia (n = 18).\nThere was noticeable significant decrease of perfusion in all areas in Parkinson's disease patients when compared to the age-matched control group of healthy volunteers (n = 20). In group III, perfusion was significantly decreased (when compared to groups I and II), particularly in parietal and temporal areas with the predominance of the left side. Regression analysis revealed two independent factors related to dementia: decrease of perfusion within left temporal lobe and its increase within left thalamus.\nParkinson's disease patients with dementia showed left temporo-parietal hypoperfusion as compared to a group of patients without dementia, which resembles perfusion deficits described in Alzheimer's disease. The hypoperfusion of the left temporal lobe with increase of rCBF within the left thalamus might be clinically useful in discrimination of Parkinson's disease patients with dementia against those without cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, is a multifactorial disease caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Although most patients suffering from PD have a sporadic disease, several genetic causes have been identified in recent years, including alpha-synuclein, parkin, PINK1, dardarin (LRRK2), and DJ-1. DJ-1 deletions and point mutations have been found worldwide, and loss of functional protein was shown to cause autosomal recessive PD. Moreover, DJ-1 immunoreactive inclusions are found in other alpha-synucleopathies and tauopathies, indicating that different neurodegenerative diseases might share a common mechanism in which DJ-1 might play a key role. The function of DJ-1 is still unknown; however, it is associated with various cellular processes, including response to oxidative stress, cellular transformation, RNAbinding, androgen-receptor signaling, spermatogenesis, and fertilization. This article reviews the current knowledge on DJ-1, focusing on its importance in the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to use both quantitative and qualitative data to assess pain in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and classify it according to cause. In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 123 patients were interviewed and pain was assessed using patient descriptions, the Brief Pain Inventory, and Visual Analogue Scales. Patients reported 285 pains (median 2 per patient), and 22.8% had 4 or more pains. Pain was reported as a problem in 85% and was IPD-related in 62.6% of patients, unrelated to IPD in 64.2%, indirectly related to IPD in 8.1%, related to multiple causes in 4.1%, and treatment related in 0.8%. Pain unrelated to IPD was more common, more constant, and more severe than IPD-related pain. Overall, analgesic use was low. This study demonstrates the benefits of adopting a systematic and logical approach to the assessment of pain in IPD and the merits of a simple new classification system.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated and compared the measurement properties of the 13-item Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F) and the 9-item Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) in 118 consecutive Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, using traditional and Rasch measurement methodologies. Both questionnaires exhibited excellent data quality and reliability (coefficient alpha>or=0.9), and acceptable rating scale functionality, and both discriminated between fatigued and nonfatigued patients. Factor and Rasch analyses provided general support for unidimensionality of both FACIT-F and FSS, although they do not appear to measure identical aspects of fatigue. No signs of differential item functioning (DIF) were found for the FACIT-F, whereas potential age DIF was detected for two FSS items. These results support the measurement validity of both questionnaires in PD, although the FACIT-F displayed better measurement precision and modest psychometric advantages over the FSS. Availability of psychometrically sound fatigue measures that are applicable across disorders provides a sound basis for advancing the understanding of this common and distressing complaint.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with genetic risk factors. Common variants in genes implicated in hereditary forms of parkinsonism may be predisposing factors for sporadic PD. Recent studies have demonstrated that mutations in PINK1 (PARK6 locus) gene, encoding PTEN-induced kinase 1, are associated with both familial recessive and sporadic early onset parkinsonism. In order to assess whether the coding variant A340T contributes to the risk of late-onset PD, we performed an association study of 539 PD patients with an onset age at or older than 50 and 525 controls in Chinese Han. Genotyping was performed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) combined with sequencing analyses. The A-allele frequency was 6.2% in PD and 4.2% in controls (p=0.0404), while G/A genotype frequencies were 12.4% in PD and 8.4% in the controls (p=0.0350). Our results yielded significant evidence for disease association between PINK1 A340T and PD with later onset (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.04-2.32, p=0.0393), thus suggesting that PINK1 A340T variant may contribute to the risk for late-onset PD in Chinese.",

The motor learning paradigm utilized for all subjects included an acquisition phase and retention tests at 24 h and 1 week after acquisition. A force plate was used for testing and to collect outcome measures including movement velocity (MVL), endpoint excursion (EPE), and directional control. Data were analyzed for differences between groups and change over time.\nPersons with PD demonstrated performance deficits relative to controls for MVL at all testing periods (P < 0.05), and initially for EPE (P < 0.05), but were able to maintain significant improvements through retention testing relative to baseline (P < 0.05).\nPersons with PD demonstrated unimpaired capacity for motor learning in a LOS balance task for MVL and EPE, although performance deficits remained for MVL. The results concur with previous motor learning research of upper extremity tasks by suggesting that individuals with mild to moderate PD exhibit a preserved ability to benefit from practice as a means of improving balance task performance.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. To date, treatment strategies are mainly symptomatic and aimed at increasing dopamine levels in the degenerating nigrostriatal system. Hope rests upon the development of effective neurorestorative or neuroregenerative therapies based on gene and stem cell therapy or a combination of both. The results of experimental therapies based on transplanting exogenous dopamine-rich fetal cells or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor overexpression into the brain of Parkinson disease patients encourage future cell- and gene-based strategies. The endogenous neural stem cells of the adult brain provide an alternative and attractive cell source for neuroregeneration. Prior to designing endogenous stem cell therapies, the possible impact of PD on adult neuronal stem cell pools and their neurogenic potential must be investigated. We review the experimental data obtained in animal models or based on analysis of patients' brains prior to describing different treatment strategies. Strategies aimed at enhancing neuronal stem cell proliferation and/or differentiation in the striatum or the substantia nigra will have to be compared in animal models and selected prior to clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons, which have long axons enriched with microtubules. Depolymerization of microtubules by PD toxins such as rotenone disrupts vesicular transport. The ensuing accumulation of vesicles in the cell body leads to increased cytosolic concentration of dopamine due to leakage of the vesicles. Elevated oxidative stress induced by dopamine oxidation may thus trigger the selective demise of DA neurons. Many strategies have been developed to protect DA neurons by stabilizing microtubules either directly or through intracellular signaling cascades. On the other hand, parkin, one of the most frequently mutated genes in PD, encodes for a protein-ubiquitin E3 ligase that strongly binds to microtubules. Parkin stabilizes microtubules through three domains that provide strong and independent interactions with tubulin and microtubules. These interactions anchor parkin on microtubules and may facilitate its E3 ligase activity on misfolded proteins transported along microtubules. Thus, parkin and rotenone, two prominent genetic and environmental factors linked to PD, act in an opposing manner on the same molecular target in the cell, microtubules, whose destruction underlies the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacotherapy designed to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease is focused on the stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors. The ideal pharmacological treatment would involve continuous dopaminergic stimulation. Currently, the most effective pharmacotherapy available is levodopa delivered orally; however, its short plasma half-life in combination with erratic gastric emptying and intestinal absorption makes dopaminergic stimulation pulsatile. Motor fluctuations and dyskinesias develop with time as a consequence and can become disabling. A gel formulation of levodopa/carbidopa has been developed for enteral (duodenal or jejunal) infusion via a portable pump. The infusion provides smooth plasma levodopa levels, more continuous dopaminergic stimulation and effective treatment of motor complications.",

    "abstract": "alpha-Synuclein is one of the main components of Lewy bodies, a pathological marker of Parkinson's disease (PD). Certain missense mutations of the alpha-synuclein gene cause familial PD, but the role of the gene in sporadic PD is still controversial. We scrutinized polymorphisms of the alpha-synuclein gene in a Japanese population and investigated their associations with sporadic cases of PD. The 5' flanking region to intron 2 of the alpha-synuclein gene (3.8 kb) and two polymorphisms in intron 4 previously reported in Caucasian sporadic cases of PD were analyzed in 185 sporadic PD and 191 controls. Five novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 16 reported SNPs, and one reported polynucleotide polymorphism (PNP) were found. Most of the polymorphisms examined were in linkage disequilibrium. Significant associations with PD were found in 15 of 21 SNPs, especially in intron 1 (IVS1+155 TmAn PNP and the IVS1+719 C>T SNP, P < 0.0001). Haplotype analysis showed that T10A7-A-A and T11A6-G-G haplotypes at three loci (IVS1+155 - IVS1+273 - IVS1+608) were strongly negative and positive risk factors of sporadic PD, respectively (odds ratios were 0.23 [95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.32] and 1.51 [95% confidence interval, 1.29-1.75]). In conclusion, our findings indicate that genetic variations of the alpha-synuclein gene affect the development of sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the hypothesis that Parkinsons's disease (PD) is associated with abnormal plasticity of the neuronal circuits mediating blink reflex. We induced long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in trigeminal wide dynamic range neurons of the blink reflex circuit by pairing an high-frequency train of electrical stimuli over the right supraorbital nerve (SO) coincident with the R2 response elicited by a preceding SO stimulus. The facilitation of the R2 response after the induction protocol was markedly decreased in patients relative to controls. Treatment with dopaminergic drugs normalized the LTP-like plasticity of the R2 response. We conclude that nigrostriatal denervation disrupts LTP-like plasticity in the trigeminal reflex circuit.",

    "abstract": "The synucleinopathy known as sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder that severely damages predisposed nerve cell types in circumscribed regions of the human nervous system. A recent staging procedure for the inclusion body pathology associated with PD proposes that, in the brain, the pathological process (formation of proteinaceous intraneuronal Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites) begins at two sites and continues in a topographically predictable sequence in six stages, during which components of the olfactory, autonomic, limbic, and somatomotor systems become progressively involved. In stages 1 to 2, the Lewy body pathology is confined to the medulla oblongata/pontine tegmentum and anterior olfactory structures. In stages 3 to 4, the substantia nigra and other nuclei of the basal mid- and forebrain become the focus of initially subtle and, then, severe changes. During this phase, the illness probably becomes clinically manifest. In the final stages 5 to 6, the lesions appear in the neocortex. This cross-sectional study originally was performed on 168 autopsy cases using material from 69 incidental cases and 41 clinically diagnosed PD patients as well as 58 age- and gender-matched controls. Here, the staging hypothesis is critically reconsidered and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective therapy for off-period motor symptoms and dyskinesias in advanced Parkinson's disease. Clinical studies have shown that STN-DBS also ameliorates urinary bladder function in Parkinson's disease patients by delaying the first desire to void and increasing bladder capacity. This study aimed at investigating the effect of STN-DBS on the neural mechanisms underlying cerebral bladder control. Using PET to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), 11 patients with bilateral STN-DBS were studied during urodynamic bladder filling in STN-DBS ON and OFF condition. A filled bladder led to a significant increase of rCBF in the anterior cingulate cortex, which was further enhanced during STN-DBS OFF. A significant interaction between bladder state and STN-DBS was observed in lateral frontal cortex with increased rCBF when the bladder was filled during STN-DBS OFF. The data suggest that STN-DBS ameliorates bladder dysfunction and that this modulation may result from facilitated processing of afferent bladder information.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the longitudinal metric attributes of three Parkinson's disease (PD) disability scales, taking Hoehn and Yahr (HY) staging as the reference measure of PD progression.\nA sample of 87 PD patients was assessed during regular medical visits, using the HY, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale--Activities of Daily Living Section (UPDRS-ADL), the Schwab and England Scale (SES), and the Intermediate Scale for Assessment of PD (ISAPD), across a follow-up period of 2.6 +/- 1.0 years.\nThe following cross-sectional attributes were analyzed, at baseline and again on conclusion of the study: floor and ceiling effects, convergent validity, reliability, and standard error of measurement, all of which were found to be adequate. Longitudinal reproducibility values (intraclass correlation coefficient) were 0.81 (ISAPD) to 0.84 (UPDRS-ADL). Insofar as longitudinal validity was concerned, the change scores of the three disability scales correlated significantly with the HY change score, absolute value r = 0.33 to 0.45, P < 0.003. Slightly lower values were found when taking the annual rate of change, absolute value r = 0.20 to 0.36. The three scales were acceptable, even though there were small differences among them. The \"minimal clinically important difference\" proposed for these scales is: SES, -6; UPDRS-ADL, +2; ISAPD, +1.5 points.\nThe three scales proved adequate for longitudinal assessment of PD disability. UPDRS-ADL was more precise and ISAPD more consistent. Magnitude of change and correlation with change in HY were slightly higher with the ISAPD. Effect size and standardized response mean for the minimal change in HY were higher for the UPDRS-ADL.",

    "abstract": "To illustrate and discuss issues relevant to treatment of four elderly psychotic patients with multiple comorbidities, including a history of mood disorder and some level of movement disorder.\nFour patients diagnosed with a major mood disorder and comorbid Parkinson's disease were treated successfully with adjunctive ziprasidone at doses of 80 to 160mg/d. Two of the patients had major depressive disorder, recurrent, with psychotic features (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [DSM-IV] DSM-IV 296.34) and two had bipolar disorder, not otherwise specified (DSM-IV 296.8) and presented with psychotic and manic features. In three of the four patients, prior treatment with olanzapine or risperidone or both had failed to adequately control psychotic or manic symptoms; in some cases, the treatment worsened the Parkinson's symptoms.\nIn all four patients, ziprasidone greatly improved psychosis and mood disturbances within days. All of the patients were also treated with other medications for comorbidities; these included one or more antiparkinsonian drugs, antidepressants, and, in one case, quetiapine for insomnia. There were no observed serious adverse events, extrapyramidal side effects, or worsening of movement disorder symptoms with the administration of ziprasidone in these patients. All patients remained stable on ziprasidone combination therapy for as long as they were followed, which ranged from several months to three years.\nThese results indicate that ziprasidone may be an efficacious and well tolerated therapy in patients with comorbid Parkinson's disease and psychiatric illness.",

Patients were assessed before surgery, six months and one year after surgery. The primary outcome measure was the off phase UPDRS 3 at six months follow-up.\nThe off phase UPDRS 3 score improved from 46.5 to 32 points in the pallidotomy patients and from 51.5 to 24 in the STN stimulation patients (p = 0.002). On phase UPDRS 3 and off phase Schwab and England functional scale improved significantly in favour of the STN stimulation patients.

    "abstract": "To explore the relationship between gait and gait-related activities and fatigue in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTwenty people with idiopathic PD (12 male, 8 female; mean age 64.6 +/- 7.96) and 10 age, sex and education matched controls (6 male, 4 female; mean age 63.5 +/- 7.03) wore an activity monitor for approximately 24 h, from which the percentage time walking and standing, the number of periods of walking greater than 10 sec were derived. Prior to monitoring, levels of fatigue (Multi-dimensional Fatigue Index, MFI) were evaluated.\nActivity data related to gait were compared for the waking hours of the day, reflected by the period between 6 am and 10 pm. Overall, PD subjects demonstrated reduced activity compared to controls, however there was no significant difference between PD and controls for the percentage time spent walking (p = 0.149), standing (p = 1.0) or engaged in periods of walking that were greater than 10 sec (p = 0.059). Significantly greater levels of fatigue were experienced by PD subjects in all MFI domains compared to controls (physical p = 0.001; activity p = 0.001; general p = 0.001; mental p = 0.028; motivation p = 0.024). There was no clear association between activity and fatigue in PD subjects.\nEvidence of increased fatigue is not supported by evidence of significantly decreased levels of activity in PD subjects. The relationship between activity and fatigue therefore remains unclear, highlighting the complex nature of the relationship between these factors. Further work is required to increase our understanding of the impact of fatigue on gait and gait-related activity so that improved management can be explored.",

    "abstract": "In the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), impaired motor preparation has been related to a decrease in the latency of mu rhythm event-related desynchronisation (ERD) compared with control subjects, suggesting hypo activation of the contralateral, primary sensorimotor (PSM) cortex. Following movement, a decrease in amplitude of beta rhythm ERS was observed over the same region and thought to be related to impairment in cortical deactivation. By monitoring ERD/ERS, we aimed (i) to extend to advanced PD the observations made in less-advanced parkinsonism and (ii) to test the effect of acute L-Dopa, internal pallidal or subthalamic stimulation on these abnormalities. For the clinical evaluation the motor score of UPDRS decreased by about 60% under subthalamic stimulation and following acute L-Dopa administration and by 40% under internal pallidal stimulation. The following concurrent ERD/ERS changes under subthalamic stimulation and L-Dopa were observed: a marked increase in mu ERD latency during movement preparation over contralateral central region; an increase in mu ERD during movement execution over bilateral central regions; a decrease in mu ERD latency over bilateral frontocentral region and an increase in beta ERS over contralateral central region after movement. On the contrary, mu ERD latency was not improved under internal pallidal stimulation. Changes of mu and beta rhythm parameters seemed to be inversely correlated with bradykinesia. Mu rhythm ERD latency and the beta ERS amplitude further decreased in advanced PD compared with early stages, suggesting greater impairment of cortical activation/deactivation as the disease progresses and a partial restoration in relation to clinical improvement under treatments. Consequently, it appears that L-Dopa and deep brain stimulation partially restored the normal patterns of cortical oscillatory activity in PD, possibly by decreasing the low frequency hyper synchronisation at rest. This mechanism could be involved at the basal ganglia level in the sensorimotor integration implicated in the movement control.",

    "abstract": "Psychosis due to dopamimetic treatment is a difficult problem in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this structured review with meta-analysis was to evaluate which neuroleptic drugs can efficiently be used to treat drug-induced psychosis (DIP) in Parkinson's disease. Electronic databases were screened for the key words Parkinson's disease and psychosis. Only 7 trials with a satisfactory allocation concealment and data reporting were included into the study. Two trials compared low-dose clozapine versus placebo with a significantly better outcome for clozapine regarding efficacy and motor functioning. In one trial clozapine was compared against quetiapine showing equivalent efficacy and tolerability. However, in two placebo controlled trials quetiapine failed to show efficacy. In two further placebo controlled trials olanzapine did not improve psychotic symptoms and significantly caused more extrapyramidal side effects. Based on randomized trial-derived evidence which is currently available, only clozapine can be fully recommended for the treatment of DIP in PD. Olanzapine should not be used in this indication.",

    "abstract": "Until 10 years ago, conventional wisdom held that Parkinson's disease was not a genetic disorder. Since that time, there have been a plethora of genetic findings, culminating in the cloning of several genes that derive from the loci given the nomenclature PARK1-PARK12 (OMIM 168600). Recently, these research findings have begun to impact clinical practice, and this impact is likely to increase. The primary purpose of this article is to outline these genetic advances, discuss their importance for current practice in clinical and related settings, and outline briefly how they are influencing research into the causes of and possible future treatments for this prevalent disorder.",

    "abstract": "Two-Dimensional Difference In Gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) is a powerful tool for measuring differences in protein expression between samples or conditions. However, to remove systematic variability within and between gels the data has to be normalized. In this study we examined the ability of four existing and four novel normalization methods to remove systematic bias in data produced with 2D-DIGE. We also propose a modification of an existing method where the statistical framework determines whether a set of proteins shows an association with the predefined phenotypes of interest. This method was applied to our data generated from a monkey model (Macaca fascicularis) of Parkinson's disease.\nUsing 2D-DIGE we analysed the protein content of the striatum from 6 control and 21 MPTP-treated monkeys, with or without de novo or long-term L-DOPA administration. There was an intensity and spatial bias in the data of all the gels examined in this study. Only two of the eight normalization methods evaluated ('2D loess+scale' and 'SC-2D+quantile') successfully removed both the intensity and spatial bias. In 'SC-2D+quantile' we extended the commonly used loess normalization method against dye bias in two-channel microarray systems to suit systems with three or more channels.Further, by using the proposed method, Differential Expression in Predefined Proteins Sets (DEPPS), several sets of proteins associated with the priming effects of L-DOPA in the striatum in parkinsonian animals were identified. Three of these sets are proteins involved in energy metabolism and one set involved proteins which are part of the microtubule cytoskeleton.\nComparison of the different methods leads to a series of methodological recommendations for the normalization and the analysis of data, depending on the experimental design. Due to the nature of 2D-DIGE data we recommend that the p-values obtained in significance tests should be used as rankings only. Individual proteins may be interesting as such, but by studying sets of proteins the interpretation of the results are probably more accurate and biologically informative.",

    "results": "Using 2D-DIGE we analysed the protein content of the striatum from 6 control and 21 MPTP-treated monkeys, with or without de novo or long-term L-DOPA administration. There was an intensity and spatial bias in the data of all the gels examined in this study. Only two of the eight normalization methods evaluated ('2D loess+scale' and 'SC-2D+quantile') successfully removed both the intensity and spatial bias. In 'SC-2D+quantile' we extended the commonly used loess normalization method against dye bias in two-channel microarray systems to suit systems with three or more channels.Further, by using the proposed method, Differential Expression in Predefined Proteins Sets (DEPPS), several sets of proteins associated with the priming effects of L-DOPA in the striatum in parkinsonian animals were identified. Three of these sets are proteins involved in energy metabolism and one set involved proteins which are part of the microtubule cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "The aetiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is poorly defined but environmental aggression may be relevant. Here, we report a new model of PD in mice, based on chronic inoculation with neurotoxins in the nasal cavity, which is a natural route of contact with the environment. C57BL/6 mice, submitted to daily intranasal inoculation with MPTP for 30 days, developed motor deficits that correlated with a progressive and severe depletion of striatal dopamine levels, and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter staining in substantia nigra and striatum. Moreover, mice intranasally inoculated with MPTP developed strong astrogliosis and microgliosis in substantia nigra and striatum. Consistent with these observations, a role for oxidant aggression was demonstrated by increased levels of Mn-superoxide dismutase. However, alpha-synuclein aggregation was not observed. This new animal model provides a new tool for studying PD symptoms that develop slowly over time, and it may be used to asses risk from environmental neurotoxins.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) ultimately develops in about 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and cross-sectional studies have found that some 30% of these patients will experience neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as visual hallucinations and psychosis. The most consistently reported risk factors for dementia in PD are age, severe parkinsonism and mild cognitive impairment. In PDD, both subcortical cognitive and cortical cognitive profiles are described. Specific disorders of sleep, such as rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks, occur frequently. Alzheimer and Lewy body pathology coexist, but the Lewy body pathology in limbic and cortical areas seems to be the main cause of dementia. Neurochemical changes in the biogenic amines and acetylcholine are common, and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown cortical atrophy in wide cortical areas, including the hippocampus. All PD patients should be screened for mild cognitive impairment and dementia. A large randomised clinical trial showed that the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine has desirable effects on cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms in PDD patients. Atypical antipsychotic agents may improve psychosis in PDD, but the evidence for this is poor and adverse effects from such therapy are common and may be severe. Non-pharmacological interventions can also be effective but require further study.",

    "abstract": "The Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) Gly2019Ser mutation is frequent among Parkinson's disease (PD) patients from the Arab, Jewish, and Iberian populations, while another mutation, Arg1441Gly, is common in the Basque population. We studied the prevalence of these mutations in Sardinia, a Mediterranean genetic isolate with peculiar structure and similarities with the Basque population. Among 98 Sardinian PD probands we detected one heterozygous Gly2019Ser carrier. This mutation was also found in one of 55 Sardinian controls, an 85-year-old man, later shown to have a positive family history of parkinsonism. No carriers of Arg1441Gly, Arg1441Cys, or Arg1441His mutations were found among cases and controls. Our results suggest that the \"Basque\"LRRK2 mutation is absent or very rare in Sardinia. The Gly2019Ser mutation is present but its frequency is lower than that in Iberian, Arab, or Jewish populations. The identification of an 85-year-old, healthy Gly2019Ser carrier supports the concept that this mutation displays incomplete penetrance.",

    "abstract": "Limited data exist concerning the mechanisms that underlie the different motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) and their course over time. Our aims were (1) to identify longitudinal changes in PD patients and (2) to determine the neural correlates of the changes in movement initiation and velocity that occur in the course the disease. Thirteen early stage PD patients were scanned twice off antiparkinsonian medication with H(2)15O PET. Imaging was performed at baseline and again after 2 years while the subjects performed a motor task that was kinematically controlled across time. Paced reaching movements were made towards targets that were presented in a predictable order. Measures of movement onset time (OT) and mean velocity (MV) were recorded during PET. OT and MV decreased significantly from baseline to follow-up. With advancing disease, increasing subcortical activation was detected in the pallidum bilaterally and in the left putamen. In the cortex, motor-related activation increased in the right pre-SMA, anterior cingulate cortex and the left postcentral gyrus. Progressive delays in movement initiation (OT) correlated with increases in the right dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC). Slowing of movement (MV) was associated with declining activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dPMC. Our data suggest that with advancing PD, motor performance is associated with the recruitment of brain regions normally involved in the execution of more complex tasks.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the protective effect of adenovirus mediated vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165) gene transfer on dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson disease (PD).\nAdenovirus vector coding VEGF165 (Ad-VEGF165) was injected into the striate bodies of 16 SD rats, and adenovirus Ad-LacZ was injected into 25 rats and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected into 16 rats as controls. Then 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was injected to establish PD model. X-gal staining was used to detect the expression of the report gene LacZ in the brain of the Ad-LacZ group 3 d, 2 w, and 6 w after injection, 3 rats in each time point. RT-PCR was used to detect the VEGF165 mRNA expression in the striate body of the rats of the 3 groups 2 weeks after injection, 3 rats for each group. Western blotting was performed to check the protein expression of VEGF165 in the striate bodies of the rats of the 3 groups 2 weeks after injection, 3 rats for each group. A certain numbers of rats in each group underwent rotational behavior analysis 1, 2, and 6 weeks after the 6-OHDA injection. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neuron, density of TH-positive fiber in striate body and black substance, laminin-positive vessel density, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive glial cells. High performance liquid chromatography-electric-chemical discharge (HPLC-ECD) was performed to detect the contents of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the striatum.\nBeta-gal was expressed in the striate bodies of all Ad-LacZ transfected rats, showing the successful transfection of LacZ gene. The mRNA expression and protein expression of VEGF165 in the striate body were significantly higher in the Ad-VEGF165 group than in the other 2 groups. The apomorphine-induced rotation number in the Ad-VEGF165 group was 8.3 turns/min +/- 8.7 turns/min 1 week after the transfection, then gradually decreased, and became 5.0 turns/min +/- 4.4 turns/min 6 weeks after.

    "abstract": "Motor fluctuations not controlled by pharmacological therapy are often encountered in long-term Parkinson's disease (PD). Neurosurgery treatment represented by deep brain stimulation (DBS) was considered a valid alternative to pharmacological treatment. Unfortunately this method is most effective in patients under age of 70. Recently it has been suggested that extradural motor cortex stimulation (EMCS) could be a valid cost-effective alternative to DBS to control motor symptoms in patients affected by Parkinson's disease. The relevant non-invasive surgical technique makes this treatment particularly indicated in geriatric patients. Brain atrophy, cognitive impairment, psychiatric symptoms are not an absolute contraindication to the treatment. We submitted to EMCS an outpatient afferent to our geriatric department, a woman 68 yrs old. The patient showed an improvement of 35% as measured by the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scale after the surgery. If our findings will be confirmed in larger series, a new dimension will be added to the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "In patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to improve motor function and decrease medication requirements in the short term. However, the long-term benefits of DBS are not yet established.\nIt was the aim of this study to evaluate long-term outcomes of patients with PD treated with bilateral DBS of the STN.\nThirty-three subjects who had bilateral STN DBS were followed prospectively after surgery. We evaluated subjects, using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), preoperatively, 12 months after surgery and at a long-term follow-up visit. Ratings were performed on and off dopaminergic medications. We compared postoperative UPDRS scores, dyskinesia ratings and medication dosages with preoperative values.\nTwenty-seven subjects had evaluations beyond 18 months (median 33.7 months). Total UPDRS scores in the 'medication-off' state were improved by 37% (p < 0.001) at 12 months and 17.7% (p = 0.0051) at the long-term evaluation. Medication-off state UPDRS part III scores were significantly improved at both 1 year and at the last evaluation (37.6 and 29.3%; p < 0.001). Dopaminergic medication requirements were decreased by 35.3% (p < 0.001) during the first postoperative year and remained below preoperative levels at the long-term evaluation. Average duration of 'off' time remained decreased by about 40% at both 1 year and at the time of last evaluation. Subjects had a sustained reduction in dyskinesia severity (88.6% at 1 year and 68.8% at last evaluation).\nIn this cohort of subjects with advanced PD, bilateral STN stimulation improved 'off' medication motor function, reduced time spent in the medication-off state and reduced medication requirements for up to 4 years after surgery. We conclude that STN DBS is an effective long-term therapy for selected patients with advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "Incentive learning takes place when dopaminergic neurons are activated, usually by rewards. As a result, previously neutral stimuli associated with reward acquire incentive salience and thus the ability to elicit approach or other responses in the future. Incentive learning is assumed to underlie psychostimulant-induced context-dependent sensitization that may play a prominent role in the development of addiction, in dyskinesia, and in amphetamine-induced psychosis. Assuming that these pathological states are due to the gradual process of sensitization, the effects of therapeutics might be manifested as a gradual desensitization. This assumption could explain the delay between onset of cellular effects of drugs (e.g., dopamine receptor blockade) and the improvement in symptoms (e.g., decreases in psychotic symptoms). Reduced dopamine activity results in behavioural changes that are opposite to psychostimulant-induced sensitization, i.e., rewarded behaviours decline in an extinction-like fashion despite the presence and consumption of rewards. We show here that also non reward-related behaviour, i.e., motor activity and catalepsy, follows the same rules: motility is not switched off by dopamine receptor blockade or by 6-hydroxydopamine lesions, but shows a test-to-test extinction-like decline. Thus, psychostimulant-induced sensitization and dopamine-deficiency induced decline of behaviour follows similar rules but in opposite directions.",

    "abstract": "North American researchers' perspectives on designing neurosurgical implant studies for Parkinson disease (PD) challenged the custom of holding surgical trials to less stringent evidentiary standards than other clinical studies. Researchers supported placebo surgery-controlled trials. The framework they used to design and evaluate studies both of deep brain stimulation and cellular implants for PD may be applicable to a broad range of surgical implants for other disorders.",

    "abstract": "Although levodopa remains the gold standard treatment for Parkinson's disease, many patients develop motor complications with chronic levodopa exposure. Tolcapone is a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor that extends the action of levodopa. When used in conjunction with levodopa, tolcapone has been shown to be effective in improving motor fluctuations and reducing levodopa requirements in Parkinson's disease patients. However, rare reports of severe hepatotoxicity have limited its use. A recent review of the data on tolcapone-treated patients suggests that, with proper monitoring of liver function, the potential for hepatotoxicity with tolcapone use is negligibly small.",

    "abstract": "Twenty nine patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity due to Parkinson's disease have undergone percutaneous tibial neuromodulation. The treatment consisted of percutaneous insertion of a 34-gauge solid stainless steel needle at a point of 5 cm cephald from the medial malleolus. The patients were treated weekly for 30 minutes. A subjective effect was assessed using a dairy and I-PSS score. Objective results were evaluated by cystometry. We observed a decrease in the average voiding frequency, number of leakage episodes after 12 sessions and 6 months of the tibial neuromodulation. An over 50% symptomatic improvement was achieved in 26 of 29 patients including 6 patients who were refractory to anticholinergic agents and 9 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Tibial neuromodulation is an effective treatment in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity due to Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "For many years, levodopa has given most patients with Parkinson's disease excellent symptomatic benefit. This agent does not slow down the progression of the disease, however, and it can induce motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in the long term. The other available antiparkinsonian agents also have drawbacks, and as a consequence research into antiparkinsonian drugs is expected to take new and different directions in the coming years. The most promising approaches include the development of 'neuroprotective' drugs that are capable of blocking or at least slowing down the degenerative process that is responsible for cellular death; 'restorative' strategies intended to restore normal brain function; more-effective agents for replacing dopamine loss; and symptomatic and antidyskinetic drugs that act on neurotransmitters other than dopamine or target brain areas other than the striatum. In this Review, we discuss the numerous drugs in development that target the primary motor disorder in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "A recent well-conducted meta-analysis showed that placebo effect is associated with a possible small benefit for subjective outcomes, but has no significant effects on objective outcomes.\nHerein, we aimed to investigate the immediate effects of two different types of placebo [placebo pill and sham transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)] in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and compared them to the standard treatment (levodopa) in a proper randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial.\nPD patients received three different interventions on different days: levodopa, placebo pill, and sham TMS. The motor function was assessed using simple and choice reaction time, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), finger tapping, Purdue Pegboard test, time to button up, walking time and supination-pronation. The subjective motor function was measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS).\nThe results showed that there was a significant motor function in the motor function only after the treatment with levodopa, but not after treatment with placebo pills or sham TMS. However, patients reported a similar subjective improvement in motor function indexed by VAS following these three treatments.\nThese results suggest that placebo interventions in PD may have an immediate subjective sensation of improvement but result in no significant objective motor changes compared with levodopa treatment. Although physiological changes are possible after a placebo intervention, our findings suggest that the acute placebo effect in PD may be the result of the subjective change in the motor rating only.",

    "abstract": "The pharmacologic profile of the alpha-2 agonist dexmedetomidine (Dex) suggests that it may be an ideal sedative drug for deep brain stimulator (DBS) implantation. We performed a retrospective chart review of anesthesia records of patients who underwent DBS implantation from 2001 to 2004. In 2003, a clinical protocol with Dex sedation for DBS implantation was initiated. Demographic data, use of antihypertensive medication, and duration of mapping were compared between patients who received Dex (11 patients/13 procedures) and patients who did not receive any sedation (controls: 8 patients/9 procedures). There were no differences in severity of illness between the two groups. Dex provided patient comfort and surgical satisfaction with mapping in all cases, and significantly reduced the use of antihypertensive medication (54% in the Dex group, versus 100% in controls, P = 0.048). In DBS implantation, sedation with Dex did not interfere with electrophysiologic mapping, and provided hemodynamic stability and patient comfort. Routine use of Dex in these procedures may be indicated.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between haemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations and the prevalence of Parkinson's disease. The HFE gene encodes a protein that modulates iron absorption. Several studies have documented increased iron levels in the basal ganglia in patients with Parkinson's disease. In a study on patients with concurrent hereditary haemochromatosis and Parkinson's disease, abnormal deposition of iron in the basal ganglia was suggested as an inductor of Parkinson's disease. In this study, genotype frequencies of the HFE mutations C282Y, H63D and S65C were estimated in 388 patients with Parkinson's disease and compared with frequencies found in comparable studies. No significant differences were found in frequencies between the patients and comparable populations. This study does not indicate increased susceptibility to Parkinson's disease in HFE gene mutation carriers in Norway.",

    "abstract": "Clinical symptoms of the idiopathic Parkinson's syndrome (IPS) are numerous. Clinical experience as well as pharmacological research identified symptoms not responsive to dopaminergic stimulation. These symptoms in particular were the target of rehabilitative therapy approaches. Several of these approaches have been evaluated in prospective studies. In the present paper, these studies and the respective therapeutic interventions were categorized and rated concerning their clinical relevance and their study design supporting a differential therapeutic approach. Symptoms were arranged relating to their clinical relevance and specific therapeutic approaches were described and rated. The rating was based on a novel developed approach to check for clinical relevance. In addition, areas in need of further and more intensive scientific research, as depression, cognitive deficits, and tremor, were identified. On the contrary, conclusive therapeutic approaches were available for the treatment of symptoms like gait and postural disturbances and dysarthria. Some advice for the therapy of muscular weakness, dexterity problems and dysphagia was given, but further studies are warranted in these fields.",

    "abstract": "The idiopathic Parkinson syndrome (IPS) affects multiple structures of the central nervous system and exhibits a broad variety of clinical symptoms that are only partially treatable by pharmacological treatment. Therefore, non-pharmacological approaches are highly warranted. The aim of this study was to identify, categorize and rate studies on rehabilitative therapeutic approaches for IPS regarding not only study design and statistics, but also clinical relevance. For reasons of homogeneity, only studies applying a rehabilitative program targeting three or more symptoms were included and studies treating isolated symptoms were excluded. Study design and statistics were rated by using an established rating system. To evaluate clinical relevance a rating system was developed considering effectiveness, everyday life relevance, long-term effect, therapy frequency and setting, duration of the therapy units, effects on quality of life, and assessment. Applying this rating system to 17 studies, we found four studies with a Level I of statistical quality and four studies with high clinically relevant information. This novel method of analysing may help to gain valuable data from studies that may lack strong methodology, and may help to promote further research.",

    "abstract": "We have recently introduced a set of sequence learning tasks that emphasize explicit learning and target anticipation and involve the activation of frontal lobes. This type of learning is impaired even in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies on the effects of L-Dopa on cognitive symptoms of PD have yielded controversial results. To verify whether L-Dopa acutely improves explicit sequence learning, we tested six normal subjects and seven PD patients both off-drug and during L-Dopa infusion with two tasks: SEQ, a motor task with multiple demands, where a sequence had to be learned while reaching for a targets; VSEQ, a visual task where a sequence had to be learned by attending to a visual display without moving. Motor performance was assessed with simple motor tasks. L-Dopa improved motor scores and movement speed, but had no beneficial effect on either type of sequence learning.",

    "abstract": "We compared retrospectively the outcome of bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation in 15 patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent the procedure under general anesthesia (GA) with that achieved in 10 patients under local anesthesia (LA). At 3 months postoperatively, all cardinal parkinsonian motor symptoms, evaluated on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale were significantly improved compared to preoperative baselines in both groups. The administration of GA did not adversely affect postoperative improvements in motor and daily activity scores, except for off-medication bradykinesia. Our results suggest that GA compares favorably with LA in surgical procedure for bilateral STN stimulation.",

The adjusted odds ratio associated with ever use was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43, 1.66) for CCBs, and 1.20 (95% CI: 0.71, 2.03) for beta-blockers.

The weakness of these associations and the absence of additional influence of dose or duration of use argue against any causal interpretation.",

    "abstract": "alpha-Synuclein is a synaptic protein that has been directly linked to both the etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. We have previously shown that only nigral neurons in PD expressing alpha-synuclein inclusions display a loss dopaminergic phenotype. The present study tested the hypothesis that normal aging contributes to this effect. The relative abundance of alpha-synuclein protein within individual nigral neurons was quantified in eighteen normal humans between the age of 18 and 102 and twenty four rhesus monkeys between the age of 2 and 34. Optical densitometry revealed a robust age-related increase in alpha-synuclein protein within individual nigral neurons in both species. This effect was specific for nigral alpha-synuclein as no age-related changes were found in the ventral tegmental area nor were there changes in the nigra for non-pathogenic beta-synuclein. The age-related increases in nigral alpha-synuclein were non-aggregated and strongly associated with age-related decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme for dopamine production. In fact, only cells expressing alpha-synuclein displayed reductions in TH. We hypothesize that age-related increases in alpha-synuclein result in a subthreshold degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine which, in PD, becomes symptomatic due to lysosomal failure resulting in protein misfolding and inclusion formation. We further hypothesize that preventing the age-related accumulation of non-aggregated alpha-synuclein might be a simple and potent therapeutic target for patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Striatal postsynaptic D2 receptors in Parkinson's disease (PD) are thought to be upregulated in the first years of the disease, especially contralateral to the clinically most affected side. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the highest striatal D2 binding is found contralateral to the most affected side in PD, and whether this upregulation can be used as a diagnostic tool.\nCross-sectional survey was undertaken of 81 patients with clinically asymmetric PD, without antiparkinsonian drugs and with a disease duration of < or = 5 years and 26 age-matched controls. Striatal D2 binding was assessed with [123I]IBZM SPECT, and severity of the presynaptic dopaminergic lesion with [123I]FP-CIT SPECT.\nThe mean striato-occipital ratio of [123I]IBZM binding was significantly higher in PD patients (1.56 +/-0.09) than in controls (1.53 +/-0.06). In PD patients, higher values were found contralateral to the clinically most affected side (1.57 +/-0.09 vs 1.55 +/-0.10 ipsilaterally), suggesting D2 receptor upregulation, and the reverse was seen using [123I]FP-CIT SPECT. However, on an individual basis only 56% of PD patients showed this upregulation.\nOur study confirms asymmetric D2 receptor upregulation in PD. However, the sensitivity of contralateral higher striatal [123I]IBZM binding is only 56%. Therefore, the presence of contralateral higher striatal IBZM binding has insufficient diagnostic accuracy for PD, and PD cannot be excluded in patients with parkinsonism and no contralateral upregulation of D2 receptors, assessed with [123I]IBZM SPECT.",

    "abstract": "Recent discovery of pathogenic mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients in different ethnic groups have raised a hope of diagnostic screening and genetic counseling. We investigated the six most commonly reported mutations in LRRK2 gene among Indian PD patients, using PCR-RFLP method. Mutations G2019S, R1441C, R1441G, and R1441H were screened in 1012 individuals (PD, 800; controls, 212) while mutations I2012T and I2020T were screened in 748 PD patients. We did not observe any of these six mutations in this study sample except in a single female young onset PD patient who showed a heterozygous G2019S mutation. The absence of mutations was reconfirmed by sequencing of probands from several autosomal dominant PD families. Our observations suggest that these mutations may be a rare cause of PD among Indians and therefore of little help for diagnostic screening and genetic counseling for Indian PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is classically characterised as a motor neurodegenerative disorder. Motor symptoms in the disorder are secondary to an altered dopamine-acetylcholine balance due to reduced striatal dopaminergic tone and subsequent cholinergic overactivity. In the past, anticholinergic drugs were given to improve motor aspects of the disease. There is now an increasing interest in the cognitive and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and in cholinesterase-inhibitor therapy for dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. In this Personal View, we reconsider the dopamine-acetylcholine balance theory and look at recent clinical findings and the possible cooperative role of dopamine and acetylcholine in the induction and maintenance of the long-lasting changes of striatal and cortical synaptic plasticity. We also discuss a convergent versus parallel model to explain cognitive dysfunctions in Parkinson's disease according to dopamine-acetylcholine dependent alterations in synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "A genome-wide association study identified 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with Parkinson's disease. Small-scale replication studies were largely non-confirmatory, but a meta-analysis that included data from the original study could not exclude all SNP associations, leaving relevance of several markers uncertain.\nInvestigators from three Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research-funded genetics consortia-comprising 14 teams-contributed DNA samples from 5526 patients with Parkinson's disease and 6682 controls, which were genotyped for the 13 SNPs. Most (88%) participants were of white, non-Hispanic descent. We assessed log-additive genetic effects using fixed and random effects models stratified by team and ethnic origin, and tested for heterogeneity across strata. A meta-analysis was undertaken that incorporated data from the original genome-wide study as well as subsequent replication studies.\nIn fixed and random-effects models no associations with any of the 13 SNPs were identified (odds ratios 0.89 to 1.09). Heterogeneity between studies and between ethnic groups was low for all SNPs. Subgroup analyses by age at study entry, ethnic origin, sex, and family history did not show any consistent associations. In our meta-analysis, no SNP showed significant association (summary odds ratios 0.95 to 1.08); there was little heterogeneity except for SNP rs7520966.\nOur results do not lend support to the finding that the 13 SNPs reported in the original genome-wide association study are genetic susceptibility factors for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Several genes underlying rare monogenic forms of Parkinson's disease have been identified over the past decade. Despite evidence for a role for genetics in sporadic Parkinson's disease, few common genetic variants have been unequivocally linked to this disorder. We sought to identify any common genetic variability exerting a large effect in risk for Parkinson's disease in a population cohort and to produce publicly available genome-wide genotype data that can be openly mined by interested researchers and readily augmented by genotyping of additional repository subjects.\nWe did genome-wide, single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of publicly available samples from a cohort of Parkinson's disease patients (n=267) and neurologically normal controls (n=270). More than 408,000 unique SNPs were used from the Illumina Infinium I and HumanHap300 assays.\nWe have produced around 220 million genotypes in 537 participants. This raw genotype data has been and as such is the first publicly accessible high-density SNP data outside of the International HapMap Project. We also provide here the results of genotype and allele association tests.\nWe generated publicly available genotype data for Parkinson's disease patients and controls so that these data can be mined and augmented by other researchers to identify common genetic variability that results in minor and moderate risk for disease.",

The objective of this study was to determine the extent of complement activation, a major inflammatory mechanism, in PD.\nSubstantia nigra specimens from young normal subjects (n = 11-13), aged normal subjects (n = 24-28), and subjects with PD (n = 19-20), Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 12-13), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n = 9) were stained for iC3b and C9, representing early- and late-stage complement activation, respectively. Numbers of iC3b+, C9+, and total melanized neurons in each section were counted in a blinded fashion. Nonparametric analyses were used to evaluate differences between groups and to evaluate correlations between complement staining, numbers of melanized neurons, and the duration of PD.\nLewy bodies in both PD and DLB specimens stained for iC3b and C9. Staining was also prominent on melanized neurons. The percentage of iC3b+ neurons was significantly increased in PD vs. aged normal and AD specimens, and in young normal vs. aged normal specimens. C9 immunoreactivity was significantly increased in PD vs. AD specimens, but unlike iC3b, the increased C9 staining in PD and young normal specimens did not achieve statistical significance vs. aged normal specimens. iC3b and C9 staining in PD specimens was not correlated with the numbers of remaining melanized neurons, nor with the duration of PD.\nComplement activation occurs on Lewy bodies and melanized neurons in the PD substantia nigra. Early complement activation (iC3b) is increased on melanized neurons in PD vs. aged normal specimens, and late-stage complement activation (C9) also tends to increase. This latter finding suggests that complement activation may contribute to loss of dopaminergic neurons in some individuals with PD. Complement activation on melanized neurons appears to decrease with normal aging, suggesting a possible neuroprotective role for this process in the normal substantia nigra.",

    "abstract": "The underlying cause of Parkinson's disease is still enigma. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of PD including oxidative damage, environmental toxins, genetic predisposition, and accelerated aging. Recent research suggests that salsolinol, a derivate of dopamine, is an important contributing factor. In the presence of acetaldehyde dopamine is converted into salsolinol, a neurotoxin involved in apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons. Increased production of acetaldehyde is associated with chronic polysystemic candidiasis (CPC). Chronically elevated levels of acetaldehyde in patients with CPC might participate in the formation of salsolinol and its metabolites in the brain contributing to the destruction of dopaminergic cells in substantia nigra. Clinical mental symptoms of PD often correspond with the mental manifestations of CPC. This hypothesis may constitute basis for further scientific and clinical research of PD etiopathogenesis (Fig. 1, Ref. 29).",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the frequency of leucine-rich repeat kinase gene (LRRK2) mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in early-onset Parkinson disease (EOPD) and late-onset Parkinson disease (LOPD).\nWe genotyped five previously reported LRRK2 mutations (G2019S, L1114L, I1122V, R1441C, and Y1699C) and 17 coding SNPs for haplotype analysis in 504 cases with PD and 314 controls enrolled in the Genetic Epidemiology of PD Study. Cases and controls were recruited without knowledge of family history of PD and cases were oversampled in the < or =50 age at onset (AAO) category.\nThe LRRK2 G2019S mutation was present in 28 cases with PD (5.6%) and two controls (0.6%) (chi(2) = 13.25; p < 0.01; odds ratio 9.18, 95% CI: 2.17 to 38.8). The mutations L1114L, I1122V, R1441C, and Y1699C were not identified. The frequency of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation was 4.9% in 245 cases with AAO < or =50 years vs 6.2% in 259 cases with AAO >50 (p = 0.56). All cases with PD with the G2019S mutation shared the same disease-associated haplotype.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy controls were administered a flanker task that consisted of the presentation of colored targets and distractors. Participants were required to attend to the center target and identify its color. The stimulus displays were either congruent (i.e., the target and flankers were the same color) or incongruent. The time between the onset of the flanker and the target color (the target onset delay) was either short or long. Results indicated that PD patients and controls did not differ in the magnitude of the flanker effect within individual trials in that both groups demonstrated a typical flanker effect at the short target onset delay and neither group demonstrated a flanker effect at the longer delay. However, when performance was examined on a trial-by-trial basis, PD patients demonstrated a slowing of reaction time relative to controls when having to make the same response across consecutive trials at longer inter-trial intervals when the flankers were incongruent across consecutive trials and the display on the second of two trials was incongruent. These results indicate that PD patients are impaired in inhibiting the distractors over an extended delay and that this deficit may impact motor responding in these patients, suggesting that the basal ganglia contribute to the interface of attention and action.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with loss of total glutathione (GSH) which may contribute to progressive cell death. Peripheral GSH administration has been used clinically with reported benefits. Despite this, there is little specific information to characterize its cellular uptake or clearance, brain elevation with peripheral delivery or neuroprotective efficacy in PD models. The current study was carried out to provide this information using in vitro and in vivo approaches. In rat mesencephalic culture, the monoethyl ester of GSH (GEE), but not GSH (1-10 mM, 24 h) produced a dose-dependent elevation in GSH. The half-life for clearance was 10.14 h and was not different in cells depleted of GSH prior to loading. Elevation of GSH with GEE protected neurons from oxidative stress with H2O2 or metabolic stress with the complex I and II inhibitors MPP+ and malonate, respectively. To determine if peripheral administration of GEE could elevate brain GSH levels, rats were administered 0.1-50 mg/kg/day GEE via osmotic minipump either subcutaneously (sc) or via a cannula placed into the left cerebral ventricle (icv) for 28 days. Only central delivery of GEE resulted in significant elevations of brain GSH. Elevation of brain GSH by icv infusion of GEE was examined for its neuroprotective effects against chronic central delivery of MPP+. Infusion of 0.142 mg/kg/day MPP+ for 28 days caused a selective ipsilateral loss of striatal dopamine. Co-infusion of MPP+ with 10 mg/kg/day GEE significantly protected against striatal dopamine loss. These findings show that the ethyl ester of GSH but not GSH per se can elevate intracellular GSH, that brain elevation of GSH requires central delivery of the ethyl ester and that this elevation provides neuroprotection against oxidative stress or chronic mitochondrial impairment.",

The second patient showed also signs of dopamine dysregulation syndrome, with an addiction to dopaminergic medication. Neither patients responded to the standard therapy for gambling behavior, but dramatically improved after bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) and early postoperative withdrawal of dopaminergic therapy. The possible therapeutic role of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) on such a disabling behavior needs to be investigated prospectively.",

    "abstract": "We determined whether tetrahydrobiopterin(BH4), an endogenous cofactor for dopamine(DA) synthesis, causes preferential damage to DArgic neurons among primary cultured rat mesencephalic neurons and whether the death mechanism has relevance to Parkinson's disease (PD). DArgic neurons were more vulnerable to BH4 than non-DArgic neurons, exhibiting sensitivity at lower concentrations, evident by morphological and neurotransmitter uptake studies. BH4-exposed DArgic neurons showed (1) increased TUNEL staining and activated caspase-3 immunoreactivity, indicative of apoptotic death; (2) mitochondrial membrane potential loss and increased cytosolic cytochrome c, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction; (3) increased level of oxidized proteins and protection by antioxidants, indicative of oxidative stress; and (4) increased ubiquitin immunoreactivity, suggesting alteration of protein degradation pattern. Percent of cells positive for these parameters were much higher for DArgic neurons, demonstrating preferential vulnerability. Therefore, the DArgic neuronal damage induced by BH4, the molecule synthesized and readily upregulated in DArgic neurons and activated microglia, suggests physiological relevance to the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a significant neurodegenerative disease of the elderly, affecting 1 to 2% of those over 60 years of age. The disorder is characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, and pathologically by alpha-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies. For most, the etiology is unknown and it is likely due to a multifactorial interaction of genes and the environment. In a minority, a clear environmental, toxic, or genetic etiology is determined. Six genes have been identified to cause diseases often indistinguishable from sporadic PD. Although accounting for only 1 to 3% of PD, the identification of single genes that cause PD clearly indicate that PD can have solely genetic causes. In addition to single-gene mutations, large familial aggregation and twin studies demonstrate a modest genetic component in idiopathic PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by progressive slowness in activities of daily living and is the most common cause of parkinsonism, whose symptoms include resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, and bradykinesia. The introduction of levodopa and its positive effect on motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease has allowed neurologists to focus on motor fluctuations. \"End-of-dose wearing-off\" and \"morning akinesia\" are terms to describe the transition between a patient's relatively normal motor performance when levodopa is effective and when it has transiently lost its effect on motor responses and parkinsonian symptoms reemerge. The choices available to alleviate these motor fluctuations range from altering the patient's levodopa/carbidopa dosing schedule to the addition of other agents to the regimen, including dopamine receptor agonists, catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and amantadine, as well as implementing dietary changes. Therapeutic decisions can be difficult because older agents have not been compared in head-to-head trials to determine which drugs are better than others and the order in which they should be tried or added to the levodopa regimen; however, all of the available treatments provide a good possibility of benefit to the patient. Deep brain stimulation surgery is an option for patients with medically intractable severe motor fluctuations.",

Certain individual nuclear-encoded mitochondrial complex I gene polymorphisms were found to be associated with approximately 2-fold risk variation in an Australian case-control sample. We further characterized this sample of 306 cases and 321 controls to determine the mutual information contained in the 22 SNPs and, additionally, level of pesticide exposure: five distinct risk sets were identified using grade-of-membership analysis. Of these, one was robust to pesticide exposure (I), three were vulnerable (II, III, IV), and another (V) denoted low risk for unexposed persons. Risk for individual subjects varied > 16-fold according to level of membership in the vulnerable groups. We conclude that inherited variation in mitochondrial complex I genes and pesticide exposure together modulate risk for PD.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a potent tool that can be used to modify activity of targeted cortical areas. Significant clinical effects have been obtained in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) by stimulating different cortical regions with rTMS at inhibitory (low) or excitatory (high) frequency. These effects were thought to result from plastic changes in motor cortical networks. Actually cortical dysfunction has been documented in PD by neuroimaging and neurophysiologic studies showing either hypo- or hyper-activation of various brain areas. In addition, cortical excitability studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation disclosed significant alterations in intracortical facilitatory or inhibitory processes according to the resting state or to phases of movement preparation or execution. These observations clearly support the therapeutic potential of cortical neuromodulation in PD. Motor cortex stimulation could impact on any station within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops that are involved in motor control, providing alleviation of parkinsonian symptoms. Depending on the target, cortical stimulation might improve motor performance or other symptoms associated with PD, like depression. Clinical application of rTMS to treat PD patients is limited by the short duration of the effects beyond the time of stimulation, even if long-lasting improvements have been observed after repeated rTMS sessions. In any case, the place of cortical stimulation in the therapeutic management of PD patients remains to be determined, as an alternative or a complementary technique to deep brain stimulation. The rTMS technique could be used to better define the targets and the parameters of stimulation subsequently applied in chronic epidural stimulation.",

    "abstract": "A new system for long-term monitoring of gait in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been developed and validated. The characteristics of every stride taken over 10-h epochs were acquired using a lightweight ankle-mounted sensor array that transmitted data wirelessly to a small pocket PC at a rate of 100 Hz. Stride was calculated from the vertical linear acceleration and pitch angular velocity of the leg with an accuracy of 5 cm. Results from PD patients (5) demonstrate the effectiveness of long-term monitoring of gait in a natural environment. The small, variable stride length characteristic of Parkinsonian gait, and fluctuations of efficacy associated with levodopa therapy, such as delayed onset, wearing off, and the 'off/on' effect, could reliably be detected from long-term changes in stride length.",

    "abstract": "Clinical DA agonist monotherapy trials, which used in vivo imaging of the DA transporter (DAT) to assess the rate of progression of nigrostriatal degeneration, have failed to demonstrate consistent evidence for neuroprotection. The present study aims at reconciling these experimental and clinical data by testing the protective property of the continuously delivered D3/D2/D1 dopamine receptor agonist rotigotine. Using a progressive 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned (MPTP) macaque model that mimics the progression of Parkinson's disease in vivo ([99mTc]-TRODAT-1 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)) and ex vivo ([125I]-nortropane DAT labelling) endpoints were evaluated. After 38 days of treatment followed by two weeks of washout, rotigotine-treated animals were significantly less parkinsonian than the vehicle-treated ones. Such behavioural difference is the consequence of a partial protection of the DA terminals as could be confirmed by ex vivo DAT labelling. However, the protection of nerve terminals was not detected using SPECT. The data suggest that rotigotine exerts partial protection but that conventional imaging would not be able to identify such protection.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress and apoptosis are considered common mediators of many neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, we identified that PKCdelta, a member of the novel PKC isoform family, is proteolytically activated by caspase-3 to induce apoptosis in experimental models of PD [Eur. J. Neurosci. 18 (6):1387-1401, 2003; Antioxid. Redox Signal. 5 (5):609-620, 2003]. Since caspase-3 cleaves PKCdelta between proline and aspartate residues at the cleavage site 324DIPD327 to activate the kinase, we developed an irreversible and competitive peptide inhibitor, Z-Asp(OMe)-Ile-Pro-Asp(OMe)-FMK (z-DIPD-fmk), to mimic the caspase-3 cleavage site of PKCdelta and tested its efficacy against oxidative stress-induced cell death in PD models. Cotreatment of z-DIPD-fmk with the parkinsonian toxins MPP(+) and 6-OHDA dose dependently attenuated cytotoxicity, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation in a mesencephalic dopaminergic neuronal cell model (N27 cells). However, z-DIPD-fmk treatment did not block MPP(+)-induced increases in caspase-9 enzyme activity. The z-DIPD-fmk peptide was much more potent (IC50 6 microM) than the most widely used and commercially available caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk (IC50 18 microM). Additionally, z-DIPD-fmk more effectively blocked PKCdelta cleavage and proteolytic activation than the cleavage of another caspase-3 substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Importantly, the peptide inhibitor z-DIPD-fmk completely rescued TH(+) neurons from MPP(+)- and 6-OHDA-induced toxicity in mouse primary mesencephalic cultures. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the PKCdelta cleavage site is a novel target for development of a neuroprotective therapeutic strategy for PD.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently complain of sleep problems. These can be due to several factors, and the approach to their management depends on careful consideration of the various possible factors in each case. 1. Older people, in general, require less sleep. After retirement, people may also engage in less physical activity, and this factor is of course even more pronounced in patients with PD because of their illness. 2. Daytime naps, either spontaneous or due to drugs, reduce the need for nocturnal sleep. Explanation of these physiological and circumstantial changes may help those PD patients who manifest these consequences. 3. The existence of a severe progressive disease as well as social isolation have psychologic consequences, such as anxiety and depression, that may manifest as insomnia. Furthermore, depression is part of the disease, frequently antedating the motor manifestations, and may manifest as insomnia. 4. In advanced disease, patients may be immobile and have difficulty in getting up or even turning in bed. This causes great inconvenience, and may impair sleep. Long acting anti-Parkinson drugs such as cabergoline or rotigotine patch may help. 5. In some cases, unpleasant hallucinations may appear which prevent the patient from falling asleep. These may respond to atypical neuroleptics. Clozapine and quetiapine are particularly useful, but require attention to possible adverse effects.",

In addition, this mutation was found in the proband's father, who also had PD, in 1 PD family, and in 1 carrier without signs of PD at age 40 in another PD family. All carriers were heterozygous for the G2019S mutation and reported the Ashkenazi Jewish origin. The mutation was not found in the control group.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study is to examine the effects of neuromuscular therapy (NMT) on motor and nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Thirty-six subjects with PD were randomly assigned to NMT or music relaxation (MR, or active control). Subjects received treatment twice a week for 4 weeks. Testing was conducted at baseline, after final treatment, and 8 days after final treatment. Primary outcome measures were the Motor subscale of the United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI-Change). Secondary outcome measures included a PD-specific quality of life scale (PDQ-39), quantitative measures of motor function, and severity scales for anxiety and depression symptoms. NMT resulted in a significant and sustained improvement in the Motor subscale of the UPDRS (P < or = 0.0001), most notable in the tremor scores. Also improved 1 week after the last treatment were the CGI scores (P = 0.007) and the finger-tapping speed (P = 0.001). The MR active control group had a slight improvement in tremor but evidenced no other change in motor function. Both groups exhibited a modest improvement in quality of life immediately after the last treatment. This effect was sustained for 8 days only in the MR group. In the nonmotor domains, the MR group evidenced improvements in mood (P = 0.001) and anxiety (P = 0.002), whereas NMT had no effect on mood (P = 0.09), and its initial effect on anxiety (P = 0.0009) dissipated after 8 days (P = 0.40). Group differences for UPDRS motor score and patient CGI-Change were superior in the NMT compared to the MR group. There was no group difference in PDQ-39 scores or in nonmotor measures. The findings suggest that NMT can improve motor and selected nonmotor symptoms in PD and that this effect is more durable for the motor symptoms. The results of this pilot study warrant larger controlled studies to examine dose range, durability, and mechanisms of NMT in PD function.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to test the impact of entacapone (ENT) addition to levodopa with a decarboxylase inhibitor (LD) in full-time-employed patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), focusing on retirement rates, medical absenteeism, self-perception of disability, as well as motor assessments of parkinsonism, motor fluctuations, and dyskinesias. Thirty full-time-employed PD patients (disease onset before age 60 years) and on optimized monotherapy with LD exhibiting minor motor fluctuations or dyskinesias were entered into a 2-year randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of ENT adjunctive therapy. The outcome measures were the number of full-time-employed patients at study end, cumulative days of medical absenteeism, patient-completed disability assessments, diary records, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-based measures of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. LD + ENT treatment was associated with a lower retirement rate (2 [17%] of 12 vs. 6 [50%] of 12; P = 0.12), lower absenteeism rate (21.5 vs. 43.5 days; P < 0.0001), improved self-perception of disability progression over 2 years (change score 1.0 vs. 4.5; P < 0.0001), and lower scores for both motor fluctuations and dyskinesia assessments compared to LD monotherapy. In this pilot study, LD with ENT adjunctive therapy positively influenced employment rate over 2 years; this effect was associated with reduced motor complications and patient perceptions of stabilized disability.",

    "abstract": "Pathological gambling (PG) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by loss of control of gambling, which has repercussions on family, personal, and professional life. Several recent studies have reported the relationship between PG and the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), but no prevalence study has yet been conducted to investigate this correlation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of PG in Italian patients with PD on dopamine replacement therapy. The prevalence of PG in a PD sample (n = 98) and in an age- and sex-matched control group (n = 392) was obtained. The prevalence of PG results significantly higher (P = 0.00001) in PD patients than in control subjects (6.1% vs. 0.25%). Our results emphasize that PG in patients with idiopathic PD on dopamine replacement therapy is an emergent comorbidity, but probably at present the condition is not properly diagnosed because it is mostly unknown.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) occurs worldwide, but little is known about PD in Africa. We systematically reviewed publications on PD in Africa, with emphasis on epidemiologic and genetic studies. Articles published between 1944 and December 2004 were identified using several strategies. The studies emanated from 13 African countries (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, Togo, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Zimbabwe, and South Africa). The publications fell into four categories: clinical series (n = 17), prevalence studies (n = 7), incidence studies (n = 1), and genetic studies (n = 3). The clinical series documented the occurrence of PD in Africa and described its clinical characteristics. The prevalence studies suggested some intracontinental geographic variation in PD prevalence. Overall, the prevalence figures and the incidence rates of PD in Africa appeared lower than those reported for European and North American populations. Few genetic studies of PD have been reported from Africa, and none in blacks. There are no case-control or cohort studies of PD reported from Africa. This review provides a summary of PD research in Africa over the past 60 years and highlights the information gaps and potential areas for future research.",

    "abstract": "Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme regulating metabolism of neurotransmitters such as dopamine. Two distinct forms of enzyme, encoded by genes MAOA and MAOB located on the X chromosome, have been considered as possible factors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). Previous association studies of PD and MAO genes reported inconsistent results. In this study, we used a large family-based data set to test associations between MAO genes and a risk of PD. The data set includes 298 female discordant sibpairs and 348 male discordant sibpairs. For this study, all subjects analyzed were white and families with known parkin mutations were removed. We analyzed 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a dinucleotide repeat marker in the MAO genes. Association was found with the intron 13 SNP of MAOB in the female subset (P = 0.02). No significant association was found in the male subset. Our results add to the evidence of involvement of MAOB in PD and suggest that the effect may be stronger in women.",

    "abstract": "The yeast deletion collection includes approximately 4700 strains deleted for both copies of every nonessential gene. This collection is a powerful resource for identifying the cellular pathways that functionally interact with drugs. In the present study, the complete pool of approximately 4700 barcoded homozygous deletion strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were surveyed to identify genes/pathways interacting with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) and N,N-dimethyl-4-4-bipiridinium (paraquat), neurotoxicants that can produce Parkinson's disease. Each yeast mutant is molecularly \"barcoded\" the collections can be grown competitively and ranked for sensitivity by microarray hybridization. Analysis data from these screens allowed us to determine that the multivesicular body pathway is an important element of toxicity induced by both MPP(+) and paraquat. When yeast genes that when deleted showed sensitivity to MPP(+) and paraquat toxicity were analyzed for their homology to human genes, 80% were found to have highly conserved human homologs (with e < 10(-8)). Future work will address if these human genes may also functionally interact with MPP(+) and paraquat toxicity.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of an aerobic training in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) as compared to a medical Chinese exercise (Qigong).\nrandomized controlled trial with a cross over design.\nPD out-patients referred to a Neurorehabilitation facility for the management of motor disability.\n26 PD patients in Hoehn and Yahr stage II to III under stable medication were randomly allocated to either Group AT1+QG2 (receiving 20 aerobic training sessions followed by 20 ''Qigong'' group sessions with 2 month interval between the interventions), or Group QG1+AT2 (performing the same treatments with an inverted sequence).\nclinical effects of treatment were sought through the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Brown's Disability Scale (B'DS), six-Minute Walking Test (6MWT), Borg scale for breathlessness, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 items (PDQ-39). A spirometry test and maximum cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) were also performed to determine the pulmonary function, the metabolic and cardio-respiratory requests at rest and under exercise. All measures were taken immediately before and at the completion of each treatment phase.\nThe statistical analysis focusing on the evolution of motor disability and quality of life revealed a significant interaction effect between group and time for the 6MWT (time x group effect: F: 5.4 P=0.002) and the Borg scale (time x group effect: F: 4.2 P=0.009). Post hoc analysis showed a significant increase in 6MWT and a larger decrease in Borg score after aerobic training within each subgroup, whereas no significant changes were observed during Qigong. No significant changes over time were detected through the analysis of UPDRS, B'DS, BDI and PDQ-39 scores. The analysis of cardiorespiratory parameters showed significant interaction effects between group and time for the Double Productpeak (time x group effect: F: 7.7 P=0.0003), the VO(2peak) (time x group effect: F: 4.8 P=0.007), and the VO(2)/kg ratio (time x group effect: F: 4.3 P=0.009), owing to their decrease after aerobic training to an extent that was never observed after Qigong treatment.\nAerobic training exerts a significant impact on the ability of moderately disabled PD patients to cope with exercise, although it does not improve their self-sufficiency and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "DJ-1 has multiple functions and its dysfunction may be linked to the onset of familial Parkinson's disease PARK7. However, the function and distribution of DJ-1 is unclear. In this study, we determined DJ-1 distribution and change after intranigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Although distribution of DJ-1 immunoreactivity was not changed in cerebral cortex and striatum, 6-OHDA caused increase of DJ-1 in the particulate fraction and decrease in the cytosolic fraction in substantia nigra. At that time, DJ-1 shifted to acid forms. These results suggest that distributional changes, translocation, and acidic shift of DJ-1 may be compensatory responses to protect against 6-OHDA-induced oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper was to investigate to what extent parkinsonian symptoms, including mild dysphagia and other eating problems, could influence the choice of consistency and the amount of food intake and if this could be related to weight loss as an expression of the underlying neurodegenerative process.\nPrevious studies show that patients with Parkinson's disease tend to lose body weight even early during the disease.\nThe design was a longitudinal prospective study.\nTwenty-six free-living Parkinson's disease patients and 26 age- and sex-matched controls were investigated twice, with one-year apart, with focus on Parkinson's disease symptoms, as well as swallowing function. Intake of food items and food consistency were assessed by food records, completed over three consecutive days at each investigation.\nIn patients with weight loss, motor symptoms, problems with activities of daily living and problems with eating, related to motor symptoms, increased and they had more dysphagia compared with their controls. They consumed lower amounts of fluid and solid food on both investigated occasions, compared with their controls. Multiple regression analysis showed that weight loss was associated with female gender, eating difficulties related to activities of daily living and preference towards soft food, but negatively correlated with age.\nParkinson's disease patients with weight loss seemed to avoid solid food, partly because of eating difficulties. Eating problems, as well as weight loss, could be because of the underlying disease, even when it is not at an advanced stage.\nCaring for patients with Parkinson's disease should not only include medical treatment, but also support for adequate food intake to prevent weight loss.",

    "abstract": "We investigated whether employment as a welder with potential exposure to manganese and other substances is associated with Parkinson disease (PD), parkinsonism or related neurological disorders, or accelerates the age of onset of PD.\nWe selected cases and controls from 12,595 persons ever employed at three Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) plants between 1976 and 2004 with potential to make a medical insurance claim between 1998 and 2004. Cases had filed a claim for 1) PD, 2) \"secondary parkinsonism\", 3) \"other degenerative diseases of the basal ganglia\" or 4) \"essential and other specific forms of tremor\". Cases were grouped by claims: Group 1-claims 1 and 2 and Group 2-claims 1 to 4, and as study period incident (SPI) or prevalent. Each case was matched to two series of 10 controls each on date of case's first claim, year of birth, race and sex. Series I was also matched on plant.\nOdds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the variable, \"ever welder in any CAT plant\" were: Group 1-SPI Cases: Series I (OR = .76, CI = .26-2.19), Series II (OR = .81, CI = .29-2.25); Group 1- Prevalent Cases: Series I (OR = .82, CI = .36-1.86), Series II (OR = .97, CI = .42-2.23); Group 2- SPI Cases: Series I (OR = 1.03, CI = .57-1.87), Series II (OR = 1.21, CI = .67-2.20) Group 2-Prevalent Cases: Series I (OR = 1.02, CI = .62-1.71), Series II (OR = .86, CI = .51-1.43). Our finding of no statistically significant associations for welding employment was maintained following adjustment for potential confounding and evaluation of possible effect modification.

    "abstract": "To determine the frequency of cardiac valvulopathy in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) treated with or without dopamine agonists.\nWe obtained transthoracic echocardiography and EKG in 210 consecutive patients with PD admitted to our hospital between September 2004 and September 2005. We analyzed the frequency according to the type of dopamine agonist. A case-control design was adopted with dopamine agonist nontreated group as the reference group, and multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted considering age, sex, and duration of illness to examine the relationships between each dopamine agonist and the presence of valvular abnormalities.\nThe frequency of valvulopathy was significantly higher in the cabergoline-treated group (68.8%, 11/16; affected patients/total) than in the dopamine agonist nontreated control group (17.6%, 15/85). The frequency was not different between the pergolide group (28.8%, 19/66) and the pramipexole group (25%, 4/16). The adjusted odds ratio was significantly higher in the cabergoline group (12.96, 95% CI = 3.59 to 46.85), compared with the pergolide group (2.18, 95% CI = 0.90 to 5.30) and pramipexole group (1.62, 95% CI = 0.45 to 5.87). The mean daily dose was 3.8 mg for cabergoline, 1.4 mg for pergolide, and 1.7 mg for pramipexole. The cumulative dose and treatment duration of cabergoline in the valvulopathy subgroup were significantly higher than in the nonvalvulopathy subgroup.\nThe frequency of valvulopathy was significantly increased in the cabergoline group. Our results indicate that high cumulative dose and long-term treatment with cabergoline are risk factors for valvulopathy in patients with Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "In many parkinsonian syndromes, neuromelanin (NM)-containing dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) are selectively targeted by the noxius pathogens. Studies of the constitutional and functional features of human NM allow the formulation of a logical hypothesis on its role in parkinsonian syndromes. In the early stages, NM synthesis and iron-chelating properties may act as a powerful protective mechanism, delaying symptom appearance and/or slowing disease progression. Once these systems have been exhausted, the pathogenic mechanisms affecting cytoplasmic organelles other than NM destroy NM-harboring neurons, with consequent pouring out of NM granules. These in turn activate microglia, causing release of nitric oxide, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, thus becoming an important determinant of disease aggravation. Neuromelanin appears to be a suitable target for devising chemical agents that might modify the course of these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Many of the motoric features that define Parkinson's disease (PD) result primarily from the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. l-dopa remains at present the most powerful symptomatic drug for the treatment of this condition. However, motor complications of chronic l-dopa treatment have emerged as a major limitation of this therapy. Slowing or delaying the progression of the disease with neuroprotective therapies may delay the need for l-dopa. In the past few years, novel insight into the pathogenetic mechanisms of neurodegeneration in PD has been provided. Mitochondrial function deficiency, increased oxidative stress, apoptosis, excitotoxicity, and inflammation are part of the processes that ultimately result in neurodegeneration. Drugs that are now under clinical scrutiny as neuroprotectant include molecules that combine one or more of the following properties: (1) monoamine oxidase inhibition (rasagiline, safinamide); (2) mitochondrial enhancement (coenzyme Q10, creatine); (3) antiapoptotic activity; (4) anti-inflammatory activity; (5) protein aggregation inhibition; (6) neurotrophic activity. In advanced Parkinson's disease, the combination of disease progression and l-dopa therapy leads to the development of motor response complications, particularly wearing off, on off, dyskinesias and dystonias. The nonphysiologic pulsatile stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors, produced by the currently available dopaminergic drugs, may trigger a dysregulation of many neurotransmitter systems within the basal ganglia, mainly localized on medium spiny striatal neurons. These include alterations of glutamatergic, serotonergic, adrenergic and adenosine A(2A) receptors. Novel strategies for pharmacological intervention with nondopaminergic treatments hold the promise of providing effective control or reversal of motor response complications. Of particular interest are NMDA and AMPA antagonists or drugs acting on 5-HT subtype 2A, alpha2-adrenergic, and adenosine A(2) receptors. Future strategies may also target pre- and postsynaptic components that regulate firing pattern of basal ganglia neurons, such as synaptic vesicle proteins, nonsynaptic gap junction communication mechanisms, or signal transduction systems that modulate the phosphorylation state of glutamatergic receptors.",

    "abstract": "In an open pilot study, doses of safinamide (100, 150, and 200 mg once a day, higher than previously tested) were administered to 13 parkinsonian patients along with a stable dose of dopamine (DA) agonist, causing a significant progressive improvement in motor performance as evaluated by the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III over an 8-week period (4.2 points; P < 0.001). In association with levodopa, the same doses of safinamide in another group of patients (N = 11) induced a significant decrease in motor fluctuations (UPDRS part IV, 2.1 points; P < 0.001), accompanied by a dose-proportional increase of the levodopa AUC, up to 77% from baseline. Because MAO-B was fully inhibited (95%) at all doses tested, we suggest that these biochemical and symptomatic dose-dependent effects must be related to additional mechanisms of action, such as inhibition of glutamate release, increased dopamine release, or inhibition of dopamine re-uptake. These hypotheses are under investigation and will pursue confirmation in controlled clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Ideal treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) aims at relieving symptoms and slowing disease progression. Of all remedies, levodopa remains the most effective for symptomatic relief, but the medical need for neuroprotectant drugs is still unfulfilled. Safinamide, currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of PD, is a unique molecule with multiple mechanisms of action and a very high therapeutic index. It combines potent, selective, and reversible inhibition of MAO-B with blockade of voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+ channels and inhibition of glutamate release. Safinamide has neuroprotective and neurorescuing effects in MPTP-treated mice, in the rat kainic acid, and in the gerbil ischemia model. Safinamide potentiates levodopa-mediated increase of DA levels in DA-depleted mice and reverses the waning motor response after prolonged levodopa treatment in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Safinamide has excellent bioavailability, linear kinetics, and is suitable for once-a-day administration. Therefore, safinamide may be used in PD to reduce l-dopa dosage and also represents a valuable therapeutic drug to test disease-modifying potential.",

    "abstract": "We describe the development of a novel animal model of acute severe dopamine (DA) deficiency by using genetically altered mice lacking the DA transporter (DAT-KO mice). In the absence of a DAT-mediated recycling mechanism in these mice, striatal DA concentrations become entirely dependent on its de novo synthesis, and acute pharmacologic inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase induces transient (up to 16 hours) elimination of brain DA. Dopamine-deficient DAT-KO mice (DDD mice) demonstrate a striking behavioral phenotype manifested as severe akinesia, rigidity, tremor, and ptosis. We propose that DDD mice represent a novel acute model of severe DA deficiency that might be used to identify compounds with potential therapeutic use for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). This model is particularly promising as a tool for evaluating the efficacy of compounds that may induce movement independently of DA. The advantages and limitations of DDD mice in comparison to other rodent PD models are discussed.",

    "abstract": "To date, 5 well-confirmed genes for Parkinson disease (PD) have been identified, including 3 autosomal recessive genes: PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), parkin, and DJ-1. Almost nothing is known about the genetics of PD in Saudi Arabia; however, consanguineous families, not infrequent in this population, could be important in the evaluation of known PD genes and the search for new PD factors in the future.\nTo investigate known recessive PD genes in 5 consanguineous Saudi families with PD.\nThe entire open frame as well as the untranslated region and all 5' and 3' intron-exon boundaries of the PINK1, parkin, and DJ-1 genes were sequenced in 5 probands in Saudi families.\nFour of 5 probands tested negative for PINK1, parkin, and DJ-1 mutations. However, in a large Saudi family with PD with at least 3 consanguineous marriages between first cousins, we detected a threonine to methionine substitution at codon 313 (T313M) PINK1 mutation that affected the kinase domain. Manifestations of the disease in this family included early onset (age, 28-38 years), tremulous movement, slow progression, diurnal fluctuations, bradykinesia, good response to levodopa therapy, and only mild dyskinesias. A neurologist blinded to genetic status clinically evaluated 15 family members, all older than 20 years, and diagnosed PD only in individuals who were later found to be homozygous for the T313M mutation. None of the 13 heterozygotes demonstrated any sign of PD.\nA homozygous T313M mutation is responsible for PD in this large Saudi family.

    "abstract": "The adenosine A2A receptor has emerged as an attractive non-dopaminergic target in the pursuit of improved therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), based in part on its unique CNS distribution. It is highly enriched in striatopallidal neurons and can form functional heteromeric complexes with other G-protein-coupled receptors, including dopamine D2, metabotropic glutamate mGlu5 and adenosine A1 receptors. Blockade of the adenosine A2A receptor in striatopallidal neurons reduces postsynaptic effects of dopamine depletion, and in turn lessens the motor deficits of PD. A2A antagonists might partially improve not only the symptoms of PD but also its course, by slowing the underlying neurodegeneration and reducing the maladaptive neuroplasticity that complicates standard 'dopamine replacement' treatments. Thus, we review here a prime example of translational neuroscience, through which antagonism of A2A receptors has now entered the arena of clinical trials with realistic prospects for advancing PD therapeutics.",

The etiology of PDD is still unclear, but exciting advances have been made in discovering pathogenetic components in Parkinson's disease (PD), implicating the role of genetic factors. It is, however, still controversial whether genetic factors also contribute to the development of dementia in PD. Thus, we investigated the association between development of dementia and a positive family history of PD or dementia in a community-based study of PD in Rogaland County, Norway (n = 219). The patients were followed prospectively with neurological and neuropsychological assessments. Dementia was more common in patients with a strong family association of PD (first-degree relatives > second-degree relatives > no family history; P < 0.05). However, time to dementia did not differ between the two groups. No associations between dementia in PD and familial occurrence of dementia could be shown. Further studies with larger samples are needed to explore a possible relationship between a family history of PD and development of dementia in PD and its potential pathogenetic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In this prospective study of 34 patients with Parkinson's disease, measurements of the short duration levodopa motor response have been performed in defined off states at 3 yearly intervals over a mean period of 11.4 years from the point of commencement of levodopa treatment. Twenty-two patients were still available for study; 10 had died and 2 were lost to follow-up. The levodopa motor response amplitude increases over the first 5 years of treatment, and thereafter, on and off scores worsen in parallel with conservation of the response. Patients who developed motor fluctuations within the first 5 years of treatment had, on average, a stronger response to levodopa with significantly better on phase motor function (P = 0.003). Although the proportion of \"midline\" motor disability (affecting gait, balance, and cranial motor function) increases with time, these deficits do not actually become unresponsive to levodopa. Patients who developed dementia had a significantly more rapid decline in motor function. The latest graph of serial scores for the whole cohort shows an upward curving or exponential increase in motor disability after the first decade of treatment. Applying a notional untreated disability line to this graph--an estimate of the disability that would have accrued if drugs had never been given--we suggest that the long-duration response to levodopa eventually runs down with disease progression.",

In the PDND group, 12 subjects had normal cognitive status and 8 had MCI. Standardised rating scales for motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms were used.\nWidespread areas of cortical atrophy were found in patients with PDD compared with normal controls (in both temporal and frontal lobes and in the left parietal lobe). Grey matter reductions were found in frontal, parietal, limbic and temporal lobes in patients with PDD compared with those with PDND. In patients with PDND with MCI, areas of reduced grey matter in the left frontal and both temporal lobes were found.\nThese findings show that dementia in Parkinson's disease is associated with structural neocortical changes in the brain, and that cognitive impairment in patients with PDND may be associated with structural changes in the brain. Further studies with larger groups of patients are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Negative symptoms generally refer to a reduction in normal functioning. In schizophrenia they encompass apathy, anhedonia, flat affect, avolition, social withdrawal and, on some accounts, psychomotor retardation. Negative symptoms have been identified in other psychiatric disorders, including melancholic depression, and also in neurological disorders, such Parkinson's disease. Achieving a better understanding of negative symptoms constitutes a priority in mental health. Primarily, negative symptoms represent an unrelenting, intractable and disabling feature for patients, often amounting to a severe burden on families, carers and the patients themselves. Identifying and understanding subgroups within disorders may also contribute to the clinical care and scientific understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders. The purpose of this paper is to review the current literature on negative symptoms in schizophrenia and explore the idea that negative symptoms may play an important role not only in other psychiatric disorders such as melancholic depression, but also in neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. In each disorder negative symptoms manifest with similar motor and cognitive impairments and are associated with comparable neuropathological and biochemical findings, possibly reflecting analogous impairments in the functioning of frontostriatal-limbic circuits.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is both common and incurable. The majority of cases are sporadic and of unknown origin but several genes have been identified that, when mutated, give rise to rare, familial forms of the disease. The principal genes that have been shown to cause PD are alpha-synuclein (SNCA), parkin, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and DJ-1. Here, we discuss what has been learnt from the study of these genes and what has been elucidated of the molecular pathways that lead to cell degeneration. Of importance is what these molecular events and pathways tell scientists of the common sporadic form of PD. Although complete knowledge of these genes' functions remains elusive, recent work implicates abnormal protein accumulation, protein phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress as common pathways to PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Camptocormia is characterised as an extreme bent-forward posture of the trunk that disappears in the recumbent position. On X-ray, trunk flexion appears without vertebral rotation as in scoliosis. The condition is a well-known complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) at the late stage. The authors present the case of a 77-year-old woman affected by severe camptocormia, which appeared and worsened in less than 6 months and hindered gait. Despite no signs of PD, neuro-imaging (DAT-Scan) showed an L-Dopa transducer decrease in putamens. A few weeks later, bradykinesia appeared and the clinical diagnosis of PD became more obvious. L-Dopa improved bradykinesia but did not change the bent-spine posture. A 1-year follow-up showed no other signs of PD other than bradykinesia, but the camptocormia was unchanged.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating movement disorder resulting from a progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway and depletion of neurotransmitter dopamine in the striatum. Molecular cloning studies have identified nearly a dozen genes or loci that are associated with small clusters of mostly early onset and genetic forms of PD. The etiology of the vast majority of PD cases remains unknown, and the precise molecular and biochemical processes governing the selective and progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway are poorly understood. Current drug therapies for PD are symptomatic and appear to bear little effect on the progressive neurodegenerative process. Studies of postmortem PD brains and various cellular and animal models of PD in the last 2 decades strongly suggest that the generation of pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic factors by the resident brain immune cells, microglia, plays a prominent role in mediating the progressive neurodegenerative process. This review discusses literature supporting the possibility of modulating the activity of microglia as a neuroprotective strategy for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "The current views on the role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease are considered. The review is focused on monogenic forms of the disease, for which 11 loci are mapped and seven genes whose mutations cause the disease are identified. In addition, a number of candidate genes for sporadic Parkinson's disease are described. The further development of studying genetic bases of Parkinson's disease will follow two main directions: in-depth analysis of genes related to the monogenic form of the disease and more large-scale associative investigation of candidate genes for the sporadic form of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis underlying the selective degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease is not fully understood but several lines of evidence implicate the role of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Depletion in levels of the thiol reducing agent glutathione (GSH + GSSG) is the earliest reported biochemical event to occur in the Parkinsonian substantia nigra prior to selective loss of complex I (CI) activity associated with the disease believed to contribute to subsequent dopaminergic cell death. Recent studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that acute reduction in both cellular and mitochondrial glutathione levels results in increased oxidative stress and a decrease in mitochondrial function linked to a selective decrease in CI activity through an NO-mediated mechanism (Jha, N.; Jurma, O.; Lalli, G.; Liu, Y.; Pettus, E. H.; Greenamyre, J. T.; Liu, R. M.; Forman, H. J.; Andersen, J. K. Glutathione depletion in PC12 results in selective inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity. Implications for Parkinson's disease J. Biol. Chem. 275: 26096-26101; 2000. Hsu, M.; Srinivas, B.; Kumar, J.; Subramanian, R.; Andersen, J. Glutathione depletion resulting in selective mitochondrial complex I inhibition in dopaminergic cells is via an NO-mediated pathway not involving peroxynitrite: implications for Parkinson's disease J. Neurochem. 92: 1091-1103.2005.). However, the effect of prolonged glutathione depletion on dopaminergic cells is not known. In this present study, using low concentrations of buthionine-S-sulfoximine, a chemical inhibitor of the de novo glutathione synthesizing enzyme glutamate cysteine ligase, we developed a chronic model in which glutathione depletion in dopaminergic N27 cells for a 7-day period was found to lead to inhibition of CI activity via a peroxynitrite-mediated event which is reversible by the thiol reducing agent, dithiothreitol, and coincides with increased S-nitrosation of mitochondrial proteins.",

    "abstract": "Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), a pro-inflammatory agent, was inoculated, subcutaneously, to Sprague-Dawley rats prior to the intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Animals were sacrificed 7 and 28 days following 6-OHDA injection; neuronal damage, glial activation and cytokine levels, within the nigrostriatal system, were then investigated. Nigrostriatal degeneration induced by 6-OHDA was accompanied by early microglial and astroglial activation, which preceded the onset of dopaminergic cell loss, in the SNc, without significant changes in cytokine levels. CFA pretreatment markedly reduced the SNc neuronal loss and associated microglial activation, as well as the rotational response to apomorphine. These changes were associated with moderate, transient increases in the nigrostriatal levels of glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6. Our results show that prior delivery of a peripheral, pro-inflammatory stimulus induces neuroprotection, in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease, possibly through the modulation of cytokine production at the nigrostriatal level.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist and alpha2 adrenergic receptor antagonist, piribedil, is used clinically as monotherapy and as an adjunct to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. As it appears to improve mood, we examined its actions in rodent models of antidepressant properties, in comparison with the prototypical anti-Parkinson agent, apomorphine, the D2/D3 receptor agonist, quinpirole, and the antidepressants, imipramine and fluvoxamine. In the mouse forced-swim test, acute administration of imipramine, fluvoxamine, apomorphine or quinpirole decreased immobility time, actions dose dependently mimicked by piribedil (2.5-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously). In rats, acute and subchronic administration of piribedil similarly reduced immobility (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) and apomorphine, quinpirole and imipramine were also active in this test, whereas fluvoxamine was inactive. Both in mice and in rats, the D2/D3 receptor antagonist, raclopride, and the D2 receptor antagonist, L741,626, dose dependently blocked the antidepressant properties of piribedil, whereas the selective D3 receptor antagonists, S33084 and SB277,011, were ineffective. In a chronic mild stress model in rats, piribedil (2.5-40.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) restored sucrose intake in stressed animals exerting its actions more rapidly (by week 1) than imipramine. Imipramine, fluvoxamine, apomorphine, quinpirole and piribedil dose dependently (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) suppressed aggressive and marble-burying behaviour in mice. In the latter procedure, raclopride and L741,626, but not S33084, attenuated the actions of piribedil. Over a dose range (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) equivalent to those active in models of antidepressant activity, piribedil did not stimulate locomotor behaviour. In conclusion, principally via recruitment of D2 receptors, piribedil exerts robust and specific antidepressant-like actions in diverse rodent models.",

    "abstract": "The G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene, the most common known cause of Parkinson's disease (PD), will soon be widely available as a molecular clinical test for PD. The objective of this study was to assess performance characteristics of G2019S as a clinical test for PD in the setting of typical movement disorder clinics in the United States. Subjects included 1,518 sequentially recruited PD patients from seven movement disorder clinics in the United States, and 1,733 unaffected subjects. All 3,251 subjects were genotyped for the G2019S mutation using a TaqMan assay, and mutations were verified by direct sequencing. Test validity estimates were calculated using standard methods. A total of 20/1518 patients and 1/1733 controls carried the G2019S mutation. Specificity was 99.9% (95% CI, 99.6-100%), sensitivity was 1.3% (0.8-2.1%), and the positive likelihood ratio was 22.8. A positive family history of PD increased the positive likelihood ratio to 82.5. Information on gender, age at disease onset, or age at testing did not improve test performance. The gene test was highly accurate in classifying mutation carriers as PD, but it performed poorly in predicting the phenotype of non-mutation carriers. A G2019S molecular test for PD would be highly specific, technically simple, and inexpensive. Test interpretation is straightforward when used for diagnosis of symptomatic individuals, but is more complex for risk assessment and predictive testing in asymptomatic individuals. Test results can have psychological, social, and economical ramifications; thus, proper counseling is essential.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disease that places a substantial burden on patients, their families and carers, as well as on society as a whole. PD can severely affect the health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) of both patients and their carers and, as the disease progresses, HR-QOL deteriorates. This review aims to critically evaluate the literature on a number of important aspects that influence HR-QOL in relation to PD. Factors associated with a negative impact and ways to improve HR-QOL are highlighted, and tools for HR-QOL assessment reviewed. The economic impact of PD and related cost-effectiveness studies are also reviewed. Over the course of the disease, patients with PD experience changes in their HR-QOL that are affected by factors such as depression, motor complications, education and surgery. However, a lack of uniformity in the choice of HR-QOL tools used in studies makes comparison of results difficult. Research on motor fluctuations and dyskinesias has shown conflicting results, whereas it is clear from the available data that depression needs to be more clearly recognised and treated. Inequality in the numbers of men and women receiving surgery still needs to be addressed and, again, in this area there is a lack of uniformity with respect to assessment for surgery. Education programmes have been shown to be successful in improving HR-QOL, although more research is needed about how to introduce such programmes to all PD patients. In particular, there has been little detailed research into young-onset PD and juvenile patients to assess the true impact of the disease on their HR-QOL. The literature has also shown that PD can affect the HR-QOL of the carer, which may have a 'knock-on' effect for the patient. The HR-QOL of carers needs more attention because these individuals can significantly reduce the burden that would otherwise fall on the health services in terms of cost and care. Research shows that the economic costs of PD are high, particularly for patients in advanced stages of the disease and those with motor complications. Although carer burden is a major source of costs, this is not factored into cost-effectiveness analyses. Furthermore, because too few studies use quality-adjusted life years as their health outcome, particularly in studies of the costs of surgery, comparison of costs of treatments is difficult. The review highlights the need for HR-QOL tools such as the EuroQol-5D to be used together with disease-specific tools to provide the most comprehensive picture of the costs and impact of PD.A recent upsurge in published literature on PD resulting from increased interest in HR-QOL issues has led to an at times overwhelming amount of new information. The present review assembles the most important points relating to HR-QOL in PD raised in the literature, adds value to previously covered issues, and examines areas of HR-QOL in PD that have not previously been reviewed, such as education, carer burden and surgery, highlighting where more research is warranted.",

    "abstract": "A single-subject, time-series design was used to describe a female with young-onset Parkinson's disease who, after a period of 15 years, was demonstrating long term side effects of medication in addition to the progression of Parkinson's disease. She underwent a bilateral pallidotomy to address these problems. Prior to her surgery, her spatiotemporal gait kinematics were measured at intervals before and after medication ingestion. The identical procedures were undertaken one month and at four months post-pallidotomy. In all three sessions, the Webster Scale scored her symptoms while her medication was not working (Off) and again when effective (On). After surgery, she was interviewed to obtain a qualitative impression of the outcome. Before the surgery, the gait parameters demonstrated a fluctuating profile. Forty-five minutes post-medication, her gait parameters approached normal levels but significant dyskinetic movements were evident. Her Webster Scale scores indicated advanced Parkinson's disease particularly when Off One-month post-pallidotomy, her gait parameters were more consistent with dyskinesias mildly present. Her Webster Scale scores were reduced while both Off and On. Four months post-pallidotomy her gait parameters were entirely consistent and within normal limits. Her Webster Scale scores were the same Off and On and no dyskinesias were detectable. The excellent result was probably enhanced by the patient's dedication to regular exercise designed to minimize secondary physical complications.",

    "abstract": "Evidence of LRRK2 haplotypes associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) risk was recently found in the Chinese population from Singapore, and a common LRRK2 missense variant, Gly2385Arg, was independently detected as a putative risk factor for PD in the Chinese population from Taiwan. To test the association between the Gly2385Arg variant in a large case-control sample of Chinese ethnicity from Singapore, and to perform functional studies of the wild type and Gly2385Arg LRRK2 protein in human cell lines. In a case-control study involving 989 Chinese subjects, the frequency of the heterozygous Gly2385Arg genotype was higher in PD compared to controls (7.3 vs. 3.6%, odds ratio = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-3.9, P = 0.014); these values yield an estimated population attributable risk (PAR) of approximately 4%. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis with the disease group (PD vs. controls) as the dependent variable and the genotype as an independent factor with adjustments made for the effect of age and gender, the heterozygous Gly2385Arg genotype remained associated with an increased risk of PD compared to wild type genotype (odds ratio = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.43-4.99, P = 0.002). The glycine at position 2385 is a candidate site for N-myristoylation, and the Gly2385Arg variant replaces the hydrophobic glycine with the hydrophilic arginine, and increases the net positive charge of the LRRK2 WD40 domain. In transfection studies, we demonstrated that both the wild type and Gly2385Arg variant LRRK2 protein localize to the cytoplasm and form aggregates. However, under condition of oxidative stress, the Gly2385Arg variant was more toxic and associated with a higher rate of apoptosis. Our study lends support to the contention that the Gly2385Arg is a common risk factor for PD in the Chinese population. Our bioinformatics and in-vitro studies also suggest that the Gly2385Arg variant is biologically relevant and it might act through pro-apoptotic mechanisms.",

SIN-1-induced lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species synthesis, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis were attenuated by metallothionein gene overexpression and augmented by metallothionein gene down-regulation. A progressive nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration in weaver mutant (wv/wv) mice was associated with enhanced nitrite ion synthesis, metallothionein down-regulation, and significantly reduced dopamine synthesis and 18F-DOPA uptake as determined by high-resolution micropositron emission tomography neuroimaging. The striatal (18)F-DOPA uptake was significantly higher in MT(trans) mice than in MT(dko) and alpha-synuclein knockout (alpha-Syn(ko)) mice. These observations provide further evidence that nitric oxide synthase activation and ONOO- synthesis may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of PD, and that metallothionein gene induction may provide neuroprotection.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis, whether caspase-dependent or caspase-independent, has been implicated as one of the important mechanisms leading to the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients. Major advances of our understanding of apoptosis have been achieved in studies of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) toxicity in mice and monkeys and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) toxicity in rats and monkeys. The use of viral vectors to either express anti-apoptotic proteins or to downregulate pro-apoptotic proteins has the major advantage of addressing selective molecular targets, bypassing the blood-brain-barrier to specifically target the nigrostriatal pathway by their stereotaxic application and by the choice of the appropriate virus and promotor. Used thus far have been virus-mediated overexpression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, inhibitors of the c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, inhibitors of calpains and dominant negative inhibitors of the protease activating factor (APAF)-1 and cdk5. Most studies implicate the endogenous, mitochondrial pathway in the apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons. The results suggest that only an inhibition of this pathway upstream of caspase activation will also result in the protection of nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals and behavioral benefit, whereas an inhibition of caspases alone may not be sufficient to prevent the degeneration of terminals, although it may promote the survival of neuronal cell bodies for some time.",

    "abstract": "Iron and monoamine oxidase activity are increased in brain of Parkinson's disease (PD). They are associated with autoxidation and oxidative deamination of dopamine by MAO resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species and the onset of oxidative stress to induce neurodegeneration. Iron chelators (desferal, Vk-28 and clioquinol) but not copper chelators have been shown to be neuroprotective in the 6-hydroxydoapmine and MPTP models of Parkinson's disease (PD), as are monoamine oxidase B inhibitors such as selegiline and rasagiline. These findings prompted the development of multifunctional anti PD drugs possessing iron chelating phamacophore of VK-28 and the propargylamine MAO inhibitory activity of rasagiline. M30 is a potent iron chelator, radical scavenger and brain selective irreversible MAO-A and B inhibitor, with little inhibition of peripheral MAO. It has neuroprotective activity in in vitro and in vivo models of PD and unlike selective MAO-B inhibitors it increases brain dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline. These findings indicate beside its anti PD action, it may also possess antidepressant activity, similar to selective MAO-A and nonselective MAO inhibitors. These properties make it an ideal anti PD drug for which it is being developed.",

    "abstract": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been implicated in the protection of dopamine (DA) neurons from oxidative stress in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). We have now shown that GDNF can also protect against the effects of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in a dopaminergic cell line and in cultures of primary DA neurons prepared from rat substantia nigra (SN). This appears to involve a rapid and transient increase in the phosphorylation of several isoforms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Our evidence indicates that ERK activation also can be modulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), including those generated by endogenous DA. Identification of the ways by which these pathways can be triggered should provide insights into the pathophysiology of PD, and may offer useful avenues for retarding the progression of the disorder.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients augments STN-driven excitation of the internal globus pallidus (GPi). However, other DBS-induced changes are largely unknown. Here we report the biochemical effects of STN-DBS in two basal ganglia stations (putamen--PUT--and GPi) and in a thalamic relay nucleus, the anteroventral thalamus (VA). In six advanced PD patients undergoing surgery, microdialysis samples were collected from GPi, PUT and VA before, during and after one hour of STN-DBS. cGMP was measured in the GPi and PUT as an index of glutamatergic transmission, whereas GABA was measured in the VA. During clinically effective STN-DBS, we found a significant decrease in GABA extracellular concentrations in the VA (-25%). Simultaneously, cGMP extracellular concentrations were enhanced in the PUT (+200%) and GPi (+481%). DBS differentially affects fibers crossing the STN area: it activates the STN-GPi pathway while inhibiting the GPi-VA one. These findings support a thalamic dis-inhibition, as the main responsible for the clinical effect of STN-DBS. This, in turn, re-establishes a more physiological level of PUT activity.",

With accumulating experience, there has been an appreciation of the important benefits of this procedure, including the alleviation of disability and improvement in the quality of life. We have also become aware of some limitations of DBS surgery. Among the important issues that remain to be resolved are the timing of surgery, whether early or late in the course of the disease, and the best target for the individual patient, including a reassessment of the relative merits of globus pallidus versus subthalamic nucleus surgery. A better understanding of the symptoms that are resistant to both levodopa therapy and DBS surgery is also required.",

    "abstract": "High frequency stimulation (HFS) has become the main alternative to medical treatment, due to its reversibility, adaptability, and low morbidity. Initiated in the thalamus (Vim) for the control of tremor, HFS has been applied to the Pallidum (GPi), and then to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), suggested by experiments in MPTP monkeys. STN-HFS is highly efficient on tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia and is now widely applied. Criteria for success are correct patient selection and precise electrode placement. The best outcome predictor is the response to Levodopa. The mechanisms of action might associate inhibition of cell firing, jamming of neuronal message and exhaustion of synaptic neurotransmitter release. The inhibition of glutamate STN release could be neuroprotective on nigral cells. Animal experiments support this hypothesis, not contradicted by the long-term follow up of patients. Neuroprotection might have considerable impact on the management of PD patient and warrants clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "We investigated whether the cytokines produced in activated microglia in the substantia nigra (SN) and putamen in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) are neuroprotective or neurotoxic. In autopsy brains of PD, the number of MHC class II (CR3/43)-positive activated microglia, which were also ICAM-1 (CD 54)-, LFA-1 (CD 11a)-, TNF-alpha-, and IL-6-positive, increased in the SN and putamen during progress of PD. At the early stage activated microglia were mainly associated with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurites in the putamen, and at the advanced stage with damaged TH-positive neurons in the SN. The activated microglia in PD were observed not only in the nigro-striatal region, but also in various brain regions such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. We examined the distribution of activated microglia and the expression of cytokines and neurotrophins in the hippocampus of PD and Lewy body disease (LBD). The levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNAs increased both in PD and LBD, but those of BDNF mRNA and protein drastically decreased specifically in LBD, in which neuronal loss was observed not only in the nigro-striatum but also in the hippocampus. The results suggest activated microglia in the hippocampus to be probably neuroprotective in PD, but those to be neurotoxic in LBD. As an evidence supporting this hypothesis, two subsets of microglia were isolated from mouse brain by cell sorting: one subset with high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the other with no production of ROS. When co-cultured with neuronal cells, one microglia clone with high ROS production was neurotoxic, but another clone with no ROS production neuroprotective. On the other hand, Sawada with coworkers found that a neuroprotective microglial clone in a culture experiment converted to a toxic microglial clone by transduction of the HIV-1 Nef protein with increasing NADPH oxidase activity. Taken together, all these results suggest that activated microglia may change in vivo from neuroprotective to neurotoxic subtsets as degeneration of dopamine neurons in the SN progresses in PD. We conclude that the cytokines from activated microglia in the SN and putamen may be initially neuroprotective, but may later become neurotoxic during the progress of PD. Toxic change of activated microglia may also occur in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases in which inflammatory process is found.",

    "abstract": "This brief review deals with pathological aspects of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease (PDD). PDD has been variably linked with cortical Lewy body topography and density. alpha-Synuclein and Alzheimer-type pathology frequently co-exist, suggesting that a combination of pathology related to protein dysmetabolism, possibly with synergistic protein-protein interaction, underpins the cognitive impairment in PDD. Dementia may therefore ensue when a \"toxic threshold\" is reached, irrespective of the combination of pathologies involved in reaching that threshold. The nature of this putative protein-protein interaction needs to be further elucidated, and also whether there are specific clinical correlates of the pathological substrate. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid proteins or imaging techniques may be useful in future as biomarkers to identify the relative contribution of Lewy-related and Alzheimer-type pathology in a given case of PDD and to inform the rational use of drugs that can reduce alpha-synuclein aggregation and beta-amyloid production.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease experience prominent difficulties in maintaining sleep, painful night-time abnormal movements, and daytime sleepiness, sometimes culminating in sleep attacks. Recent insights into the pathophysiology of sleep disorders in PD points to a complex interaction between movement disorders, side-effects of dopamine agents and lesions in sleep-wake regulating systems. Treatment with dopamine agonists provides a twice higher risk of daytime sudden sleep episodes than levodopa, with no difference between ergotic and non ergotic compounds. Insomnia can be improved by a better control of night-time disability, restless legs syndrome and dystonia using subthalamic nucleus stimulation or night-time levodopa. A specific REM sleep disorder contributes to REM sleep behavior disorder and also to hallucinations (suggesting they could be awake dreams) and excessive daytime sleepiness. The management of sleep and alertness problems requires to analyze their potential causes, to monitor night-time and daytime sleep, and to subtly adjust psychotropic and dopaminergic treatment.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent in Parkinson disease. These disorders can be broadly categorized into those that involve nocturnal sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. The disorders that are often observed during the night in PD include sleep fragmentation that may be due to recurrent PD symptoms, sleep apnea, Restless Leg Syndrome/ periodic limb movements and REM sleep behavior disorder. Excessive daytime sleepiness is also a common occurrence in PD. EDS can arise from several etiologies, and patients may have more than one etiology responsible. The causes of EDS include nocturnal sleep disorder with sleep deprivation and resulting daytime somnolence, the effect of drugs used to treat PD, and possibly neurodegeneration of central sleep/wake areas. Appropriate diagnosis of the sleep disturbance affecting a PD patient can lead to specific treatments that can consolidate nocturnal sleep and enhance daytime alertness.",

In PD an impairment of dopaminergic neurons of the preganglionic retina and a defect of the retinal nerve fibers (axons of the retinal ganglion cells) has been demonstrated and a correlation of loss of spatial contrast sensitivity, with the progression of motor impairment in PD has been described. These low level visual deficits contribute but do not directly explain behavioural visual deficits in PD involving spatial cognition, internal representation, space navigation and visual categorization. Language deficits in non-demented PD patients can include impairments in comprehension, verbal fluency, and naming. Comprehension deficits become evident when patients are required to process sentences with non-canonical, irregular grammatical structures. Semantic memory deficits may result in the impairments in category fluency and confrontational naming. Selective language deficits may be due to impaired dynamics of the \"phonological loop\" connecting the pre-frontal cortex and the basal ganglia. A more encompassing linguistic and functional model of PD specific language impairments would be useful for evaluating language deficits in the context of motor dysfunction.",

The fear of getting into the wheel chair is one of the first thoughts many patients ask about when the diagnosis of PD is given. At the early stages of the disease gait disturbances are present and can be measured but in most patients it does not cause significant functional disturbances. In contrast, as the disease progress, gait disturbances and postural control abnormalities are becoming major causes for lost of mobility and falls. These unfortunate consequences should be forecasted at the early stages of the disease and a preventive approach should be taken. Treatment of gait disturbances at the early stages of the disease is mainly to encourage patients to exercise and walk daily and by drugs in those with disabling symptoms. At the advanced stages, treatment should be aggressive in order to keep the patient walking safely. Drugs, physiotherapy and functional neurosurgery should be used wisely for best outcomes and least side effects. When time comes and the risk of falls is very significant, walking aids should be suggested and if no other option is left, wheel chair is a very reasonable option to maintain mobility out of home, preserving quality of life and avoiding falls with all it severe consequences.",

    "abstract": "The association of Parkinson's disease (PD) with an impaired sense of smell was first reported about thirty years ago. Since then, it has become quite firmly established that olfactory dysfunction is one of the first and most prevalent clinical manifestations of this disorder. Recent data from an ongoing prospective study indicate that otherwise unexplained hyposmia in first degree relatives of patients with sporadic PD is associated with an increased risk of developing clinical PD of at least 13%. In particular, a combination of impaired olfactory function and reduced striatal [123I]beta-CIT binding on a baseline SPECT scan appears to be a strong predictor of a subsequent diagnosis of PD. Pathological studies support these observations by demonstrating that the anterior olfactory structures may be one of the induction sites of PD pathology. Considering that there is a doubling rather than a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb in PD patients, the pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction in PD is far from being elucidated. Studying prodromal manifestations of PD, such as olfactory dysfunction, and their underlying pathophysiology may greatly contribute to the development of treatment strategies that focus on preclinical detection and slowing down disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsonism is a clinical syndrome characterized by bradykinesia, hypo-/ akinesia, muscular rigidity, and resting tremor, mainly caused by Parkinson's disease (PD). Progressive loss of nigral neurons with Lewy bodies is considered an essential neuropathological feature. Recent studies, however, indicate that nigral degeneration is only a part of this synucleinopathy, and clinical symptoms go far beyond motor parkinsonism. Olfactory disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, pain, sleep fragmentation, depression, and dementia with or without psychosis are frequently seen. The variability in the expression of these signs and symptoms suggests multiple causes and/or pathogeneses within the present diagnostic disease entity. In this article, a recently proposed staging of PD-related brain pathology will be correlated with the various clinical expressions. It will be argued that the specific topographical sequence of the pathology, depending on the extent and progression of the degenerative process at defined sites, may explain the individually variable expression of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Several new advances facilitate current understanding of the progression of Parkinson's disease. The application of statistical modeling techniques has helped to estimate rates of clinical decline in the context of symptomatic interventions. These approaches may allow a new means for testing neuroprotection effects even when patients are on dopaminergic treatment. Further, the development of new rating scales, specifically the Movement Disorder Society-initiated revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale has capitalized on a greater clinical appreciation of non-motor elements of Parkinson's disease. Finally, adaptations of new technologies that are computer-based and enable data transmission from at-home environments allow researchers to capture disease impairment and disability with potentially greater precision and much more frequently than permissible in a hospital clinic or practice setting.",

    "abstract": "The kynurenine pathway is the main pathway of tryptophan metabolism. L-kynurenine is a central compound of this pathway since it can change to the neuroprotective agent kynurenic acid or to the neurotoxic agent quinolinic acid. The break-up of these endogenous compounds' balance can be observable in many disorders. It can be occur in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease, in stroke, in epilepsy, in multiple sclerosis, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and in mental failures, such as schizophrenia and depression. The increase of QUIN concentration or decrease of KYNA concentration could enhance the symptoms of several diseases. According to numerous studies, lowered KYNA level was found in patients with Parkinson's disease. It can be also noticeable that KYNA-treatment prevents against the QUIN-induced lesion of rat striatum in animal experiments. Administrating of KYNA can be appear a promising therapeutic approach, but its use is limited because of its poorly transport across the blood-brain barrier. The solution may be the development of KYNA analogues (e.g. glucoseamine-kynurenic acid) which can pass across this barrier and disengaging in the brain, then KYNA can exert its neuroprotective effects binding at the excitatory glutamate receptors, in particular the NMDA receptors. Furthermore, it seems hopeful to use kynurenine derivatives (e.g. 4-chloro-kynurenine) or enzyme inhibitors (e.g. Ro-61-8048) to ensure an increased kynurenic acid concentration in the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "A general complex I deficit has been hypothesized to contribute to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) and all toxins used to destroy dopaminergic neurons are complex I inhibitors. With MPTP or 6-OHdopamine, this hypothesis can not be tested since these toxins selectively accumulate in the dopaminergic neurons. However with rotenone, which penetrates all cells, the hypothesis can be tested. Thus, the proof of the hypothesis is whether or not rotenone-induced neurodegeneration mimics the degenerative processes underlying PD. Low doses of rotenone (1.5 or 2.5 mg/kg in oil i.p.) were administered to Sprague Dawley rats on a daily basis. After about 20 days of treatment, signs of parkinsonism occurred and the concentrations of NO and peroxidase products rose in the brain, especially in the striatum. After 60 days of treatment, rotenone had destroyed dopaminergic neurons. Behaviourally, catalepsy was evident, a hunchback posture and reduced locomotion. Other transmitter systems were not, or much less affected. L-DOPA-methylester (10 mg/kg plus decarboxylase inhibition) potently reversed the parkinsonism in rats. Also when infused directly into the dopaminergic neurons, rotenone produced parkinsonism which was antagonized by L-DOPA. Some peripheral symptoms of PD are mimiced by rotenone too, for example a low testosterone concentration in the serum and a loss of dopaminergic amacrine cells in the retina. These results support the hypothesis of an involvement of complex I in PD and render the rotenone model as a suitable experimental model. The slow onset of degeneration make it suitable also to study neuroprotective strategies. Evidence that rotenone-induced neurodegeneration spreads beyond the dopaminergic system is not contradictory given that, according to the new staging studies, also degeneration in PD is not confined to dopamine neurons.",

    "abstract": "Cell cultures for Parkinson's disease research have the advantage of virtually unlimited access, they allow rapid screening for disease pathogenesis and drug candidates, and they restrict the necessary number of animal experiments. Limitations of cell cultures, include that the survival of neurons is dependent upon the culture conditions; that the cells do not develop their natural neuronal networks. In most cases, neurons are deprived from the physiological afferent and efferent connections. In Parkinson's disease research, mesencephalic slice cultures, primary immature dopaminergic neurons and immortalized cell lines--either in a proliferating state or in a differentiated state--are used. Neuronal cultures may be plated in the presence or absence of glial cells and serum. These different culture conditions as well as the selection of outcome parameters (morphological evaluation, viability assays, biochemical assays, metabolic assays) have a strong influence on the results of the experiments and the conclusions drawn from them. A primary example is the question of whether L-Dopa is toxic to dopaminergic neurons or whether it provides neurotrophic effects: In pure, neuronal-like cultures, L-Dopa provides toxicity, whereas in the presence of glial cells, it provides trophic effects when applied. The multitude of factors that influence the data generated from cell culture experiments indicates that in order to obtain clear-cut and unambiguous results, investigators need to choose their model carefully and are encouraged to verify their main results with different models.",

The first two are based on the etiology of the disease and consist in 1) reproducing in animals the mutations seen in inherited forms of PD; 2) intoxicating animals with putative environmental toxins causing PD. The last method currently used, which is not exclusive of the first two, is to try to reproduce the molecular or biochemical changes seen post-mortem in the brain of patients with PD.

    "abstract": "In recent years transcranial sonography (TCS) has become a widely used method for the visualization of the brain parenchyma through the intact scull. Using TCS, our group discovered changes of the echotexture--namely increased echogenicity--at the substantia nigra (SN) in about 90% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). These results assessed with an interrater reproducibility of r = 0.8 in several studies have been confirmed by several other groups. In contrast increased SN echogenicity is rarely found in patients with atypical or symptomatic Parkinsonian syndromes, providing a valuable tool for differential diagnosis. Interestingly, increased SN echogenicity can also be found in about 8 to 10% of healthy subjects. In PET analyses more than 60% of these clinically healthy individuals show a subclinical reduction of the striatal 18F-Dopa uptake indicating an alteration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and nigral cell loss. Furthermore, it was possible to demonstrate that this ultrasound finding has a functional impact as subjects with an increased echogenicity of the SN (i) showed more frequently clinical symptoms of asymmetric hypokinesia with increasing age and (ii) developed more often and more severe Parkinsonian side effects when treated with neuroleptic therapy for neuropsychiatric disorders. Longitudinal studies indicate that the ultrasound signal does not change in the course of the disease. Moreover, presymptomatic carriers of mutations causative for monogenetic PD display the same echofeature as their relatives already affected by the disease. These findings indicate that increased SN echogenicity constitutes a biomarker for vulnerability of the nigrostriatal system in healthy subjects and eventually PD in a subgroup of persons with additional risk factors.",

LRRK2 mutations are relatively common genetic causes of familial and sporadic PD. In addition, these mutations have been identified in diverse populations. The clinical and pathologic features of LRRK2-associated PD are indistinguishable from idiopathic PD; however, considerable clinical and pathologic variability exists even among kindreds.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons. Accompanying the loss the of DA neurons is the accumulation of Lewy bodies and neurites, intracytoplasmic proteinaceous inclusions that contain alpha-synuclein, synphilin-1, components of the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway and parkin. Recent advances indicate that PD is due in some individuals to genetic mutations in alpha-synuclein, DJ-1, PINK-1, LRRK2, and parkin. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which mutations in familial-linked genes cause PD holds great promise for unraveling the mechanisms by which DA neurons degenerate in PD. Parkin is E3-ubiquitin-protein ligase that ubiquitinates itself and promotes its own degradation. Familial associated mutations of parkin have impaired ubiquitin ligase function suggesting that this may be the cause of familial autosomal recessive PD. Parkin might be required for formation of Lewy bodies as Lewy bodies are absent in patients with parkin mutations. Parkin interacts with and ubiquitinates the alpha-synuclein interacting protein, synphilin-1. Formation of Lewy-body-like ubiquitin-positive cytosolic inclusions occurs upon coexpression of alpha-synuclein, synphilin-1 and parkin. Nitric oxide inhibits Parkin's E-3 ligase activity and its protective function by nitric oxide through S-nitrosylation both in vitro and in vivo. Nitrosative and oxidative stress link parkin function with the more common sporadic form of Parkinson's disease and the related alpha-synucleinopathy, DLBD. Development of new therapies for PD and other disorders associated with nitrosative and oxidative stress may follow the elucidation of the pathways by which NO S-nitrosylates and inhibits parkin. Moreover, parkin and alpha-synuclein are linked in common pathogenic mechanism through their interaction with synphilin-1 and parkin may be important for the formation of Lewy bodies.",

    "abstract": "To date 11 forms of familial Parkinson's disease (PD) have been mapped to different chromosome loci, of which 6 genes have been identified as the causative genes, i.e., alpha-synuclein (SNCA), parkin, UCH-L1, PINK1, DJ-1, and LRRK2. For UCH-L1, additional families with this mutation are necessary before concluding that UCH-L1 is the definite causative gene for PARK5, as only one family so far has been reported. SNCA, UCH-L1, and LRRK2 mutations cause autosomal dominant PD and the remaining gene mutations autosomal recessive PD. Age of onset tends to be younger in familial PD compared with sporadic PD, particularly so in autosomal recessive PD. Generally familial cases respond to levodopa quite nicely and progression of the disease tends to be slower. It is an interesting question how familial PD-causing proteins are mutually related each other. In this article, we review recent progress in genetics and molecular biology of familial PD.",

Other genes are involved in mitochondrial homeostasis and still others link newly identified signalling pathways to the established paradigm of oxidative stress in PD. Additional factors are posttranslational modifications of key proteins such as phosphorylation. Also, molecular data support the role of altered iron metabolism in PD.

In line with the enhancement of MPTP toxicity by diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), here we demonstrate how other CYP450 (2E1) inhibitors, such as diallyl sulfide (DAS) or phenylethylisothiocyanate (PIC), also potentiate the selective DA neuron degeneration in C57/bl mice. In order to provide direct evidence for this isozyme involvement, CYP 2E1 knockout mice were challenged with MPTP or the combined treatment. Here we show that these transgenic mice have a low sensitivity to MPTP alone, similarly to the wild type SVI, suggesting that it is likely that transgenic mice compensate for the missing enzyme. However, in these CYP 2E1 knockout mice, DDC pretreatment completely fails to enhance MPTP toxicity; this enhancement is instead regularly present in the SVI control animals. This study indicates that the occurrence of CYP 2E1 in C57/bl mouse brain is relevant for MPTP toxicity, and suggests that this isozyme may have a detoxificant role related to the efflux transporter of the toxin.",

    "abstract": "The ecogenetic theory contends that most cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) result from the actions of environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals on a background of normal ageing. This notion is supported by epidemiologic data; family history of PD and exposures to environmental toxins such as pesticides increase risk, while cigarette smoking reduces risk. As a result, polymorphic genes that code for metabolic enzymes have been considered as candidates for conferring differential risk for PD. Given their prominence in xenobiotic metabolism, the cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes have come under great scrutiny. The activity of CYP2D6 is largely determined by genetic variability and common sequence variants exist in human populations that lead to poor metaboliser (PM) phenotypes. These have been extensively studied as genetic risk factors for PD with inconsistent results. However, these studies have disregarded interactive effects (e.g. gene x environment interactions) despite the assertions of the ecogenetic theory. Data from our group and others suggest that the CYP2D6 PM genotype interacts with certain environmental factors such as pesticide exposure and cigarette smoking to confer differential risk for PD. Previous failure to consider such interactions might, in part, explain the inconsistencies observed in the CYP2D6 genetic risk-factor literature. Our data illustrate, using CYP2D6 as an exemplar, that it is crucial to consider both genetic and environmental factors, and their interactions, in any examination of risk factors for PD.",

Since that time, epidemiologic investigations have suggested risk factors, though their results do not establish causality. Pesticide exposure has been associated with increased risk in many studies. Other proposed risks include rural residence and certain occupations. Cigarette smoking, use of coffee/caffeine, and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) all appear to lower risk of PD, while dietary lipid and milk consumption, high caloric intake, and head trauma may increase risk. The cause of PD is likely multifactorial. Underlying genetic susceptibility and combinations of risk and protective factors likely all contribute. The combined research effort by epidemiologists, geneticists, and basic scientists will be needed to clarify the cause(s) of PD.",

A staging procedure for sporadic PD pathology was developed by Braak et al. assuming that the abnormal deposition of alpha-synuclein indicates the intracellular process responsible for clinical PD. This paradigm has merit in corralling patients with similar cellular mechanisms together and determining the potential sequence of events that may herald the clinical syndrome. Progressive pathological stages were identified--1) preclinical (stages 1-2), 2) early (stages 3-4, 35% with clinical PD) and 3) late (stages 5-6, 86% with clinical PD). However, preclinical versus early versus late-stage cases should on average be progressively older at the time of sampling, a feature not observed in the cohort analysed. In this cohort preclinical cases would have developed extremely late-onset PD compared with the other types of cases analysed. While the staging scheme is a valuable concept, further development is required.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder in which predisposed neuronal types in specific regions of the human peripheral, enteric, and central nervous systems become progressively involved. A staging procedure for the PD-related inclusion body pathology (i.e., Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies) in the brain proposes that the pathological process begins at two sites and progresses in a topographically predictable sequence in 6 stages. During stages 1-2, the inclusion body pathology remains confined to the medulla oblongata, pontine tegmentum, and anterior olfactory structures. In stages 3-4, the basal mid- and forebrain become the focus of the pathology and the illness reaches its symptomatic phase. In the final stages 5-6, the pathological process is seen in the association areas and primary fields of the neocortex. To date, we have staged a total of 301 autopsy cases, including 106 cases with incidental pathology and 176 clinically diagnosed PD cases. In addition, 163 age-matched controls were examined. 19 of the 301 cases with PD-related pathology displayed a pathological distribution pattern of Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies that diverged from the staging scheme described above. In these cases, olfactory structures and the amygdala were predominantly involved in the virtual absence of brain stem pathology. Most of the divergent cases (17/19) had advanced concomitant Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary changes (stages IV-VI).",

    "abstract": "The discovery of the nigrostriatal DA system in the rat was made possible by the highly specific and sensitive histochemical fluorescence method of Falck and Hillarp in combinations with electrolytic lesions in the substantia nigra and removal of major parts of the neostriatum. Recent work on DA neuron evolution shows that in the Bottlenose Dolphin the normal DA cell groups of the substantia nigra are very cell sparse, while there is a substantial expansion of the A9 medial and A10 lateral subdivisions forming an impressive \"ventral wing\" in the posterior substantia nigra. The nigrostriatal DA pathway mainly operates via Volume Transmission. Thus, DA diffuses along concentration gradients in the ECF to reach target cells with high affinity DA receptors. A novel feature of the DA receptor subtypes is their physical interaction in the plasma membrane of striatal neurons forming receptor mosaics (RM) with the existence of two types of RM. The \"functional decoding unit\" for DA is not the single receptor, but rather the RM that may affect not only the integration of signals in the DA neurons but also their trophic conditions. In 1991 A2A receptor antagonists were indicated to represent novel antiparkinsonian drugs based on the existence of A2A/D2 receptor-receptor interactions and here P2X receptor antagonists are postulated to be neuroprotective drugs in treatment of Parkinson's Disease.",

    "abstract": "Striatal dopamine loss in Parkinson's Disease (PD) sets into play a variety of compensatory responses to help counter dopamine depletion. Most of these changes involve surviving dopamine neurons, but there are also changes in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which are the major target of dopamine axons. Among these changes are decreases in MSN dendritic length and spine density, which may dampen excessive corticostriatal glutamatergic drive onto MSNs that occurs secondary to dopamine loss. An increasing knowledge of dendritic changes in PD suggests strategies for tracking progressive worsening of symptoms and is opening new ideas on novel therapeutic strategies for PD.",

    "abstract": "To determine if novel methods establishing patterns in EEG-EMG coupling can infer subcortical influences on the motor cortex, and the relationship between these subcortical rhythms and bradykinesia.\nPrevious work has suggested that bradykinesia may be a result of inappropriate oscillatory drive to the muscles. Typically, the signal processing method of coherence is used to infer coupling between a single channel of EEG and a single channel of rectified EMG, which demonstrates 2 peaks during sustained contraction: one, approximately 10 Hz, which is pathologically increased in PD, and a approximately 30 Hz peak which is decreased in PD, and influenced by pharmacological manipulation of GABAA receptors in normal subjects.\nWe employed a novel multiperiodic squeezing paradigm which also required simultaneous movements. Seven PD subjects (on and off L-Dopa) and five normal subjects were recruited. Extent of bradykinesia was inferred by reduced relative performance of the higher frequencies of the squeezing paradigm and UPDRS scores. We employed Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to determine EEG/EMG coupling.\nCorticomuscular coupling was detected during the continually changing force levels. Different components included those over the primary motor cortex (ipsilaterally and contralaterally) and over the midline. Subjects with greater bradykinesia had a tendency towards increased approximately 10 Hz coupling and reduced approximately 30 Hz coupling that was erratically reversed with L-dopa.\nThese results suggest that lower approximately 10 Hz peak may represent pathological oscillations within the basal ganglia which may be a contributing factor to bradykinesia in PD.",

    "abstract": "Recordings in humans as a result of functional neurosurgery have revealed a tendency for basal ganglia neurons to oscillate and synchronise their activity, giving rise to a rhythmic population activity, manifest as oscillatory local field potentials. The most important activity is synchronised oscillation in the beta band (13-30 Hz), which has been picked up at various sites within the basal ganglia-cortical loop in PD. Dopaminergic medication and movement suppress this activity, with the timing and degree of suppression closely correlating with behavioural performance. Accordingly synchronisation in the beta band has been hypothesised to be essentially antikinetic in nature and pathophysiologically relevant to bradykinesia.",

    "abstract": "Early physiological studies emphasized changes in the discharge rate of basal ganglia in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), whereas recent studies stressed the role of the abnormal oscillatory activity and neuronal synchronization of pallidal cells. However, human observations cast doubt on the synchronization hypothesis since increased synchronization may be an epi-phenomenon of the tremor or of independent oscillators with similar frequency. Here, we show that modern actor/ critic models of the basal ganglia predict the emergence of synchronized activity in PD and that significant non-oscillatory and oscillatory correlations are found in MPTP primates. We conclude that the normal fluctuation of basal ganglia dopamine levels combined with local cortico-striatal learning rules lead to noncorrelated activity in the pallidum. Dopamine depletion, as in PD, results in correlated pallidal activity, and reduced information capacity. We therefore suggest that future deep brain stimulation (DBS) algorithms may be improved by desynchronizing pallidal activity.",

However, Parkinson's disease involves degeneration of non-dopaminergic neurons and the treatment of the resulting predominantly non-motor features remains a challenge.

    "abstract": "The differential dysfunction of chromatic and achromatic visual pathways in early Parkinson's disease (PD) was evaluated by means of visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded in 12 patients (mean age 60.1 +/- 8.3 years; range 46 to 74 years) in the early stages of PD and not yet undergoing treatment with L-dopa, and in 12 age-matched controls. Visual stimuli were full-field (14 deg) equiluminant red-green (R-G), blue-yellow (B-Y), and black-white (B-W) sinusoidal gratings of two cycles per degree, presented in onset (300 milliseconds)--offset (700 milliseconds) mode, at two contrast (K) levels (90% and 25%). The VEP mean latencies were significantly more delayed in PD patients than in controls for chromatic than for luminance stimuli, in particular for B-Y stimuli of low contrast (K90%: B-W = 6.6 milliseconds, R-G = 3.34 milliseconds, B-Y = 15.48 milliseconds; K25%: B-W = 7.8 milliseconds, R-G = 14.8 milliseconds, B-Y = 28.9). Latencies of chromatic VEPs were more variable that achromatic VEP latencies in both normal subjects and PD patients. Therefore, the frequency of latency abnormalities (within 30%) was not significantly different for the three visual stimuli. Our results show that, in addition to achromatic VEPs, chromatic VEPs are impaired in early PD patients not yet undergoing L-dopa therapy, indicating an acquired color deficiency in these patients. The greater delay for the B-Y VEPs suggests a higher vulnerability of visual blue-cone pathway in the early stages of the disease. However, the overall sensitivity of chromatic VEPs in detecting early visual impairment in PD is comparable with that of achromatic VEPs.",

    "abstract": "To review existing studies evaluating the effectiveness of physical exercise on mortality, strength, balance, mobility, and activities of daily living (ADL) for sufferers of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe following databases were searched (1) Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, (2) Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), (3) PubMed and (4) Medline/NARIC (National Rehabilitation Information Center) using combinations of key words Parkinson's disease and physical exercise. Only articles written in English were included. References cited were also examined.\nStudies were eligible if (1) only patients with PD were included in the intervention study (there were many studies that evaluated the benefits of exercise after stroke, cardiac arrest, sports injuries, surgery, and arthritis, but only a few for patients with PD), (2) the intervention included some form of physical or therapeutic exercise, (3) the effects of the physical exercise were evaluated, and (4) the studies were published in a refereed journal. Because few studies were found that dealt with PD patients exclusively, all studies that evaluated the effectiveness of physical exercise for only PD patients were included. Seven studies met our criteria and were selected. Three of the selected studies were randomized controlled studies, 1 was an open trial, and the other 3 relied on patients' own assessments.\nOutcomes in the studies were measured in terms of physical improvements in patients with PD, such as improved axial rotation, functional reach, flexibility, balance, muscle strength, short-step gait, and mobility. All studies reviewed show that exercise improves overall performance in PD patients. Improvements were measured using standardized tests and other measurement scales.\nThe results of the present research synthesis support the hypothesis that patients with PD improve their physical performance and activities of daily living through exercise. Future studies should include the development of standardized exercise programs specific for problems associated with PD as well as standardized testing methods for measuring improvements in PD patients. There is also a need for longer term studies (over 1 year) to assess if improvements achieved during the intervention stage are retained long term.",

    "abstract": "DJ-1/PARK7, a cancer- and Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated protein, protects cells from toxic stresses. However, the functional basis of this protection has remained elusive. We found that loss of DJ-1 leads to deficits in NQO1 [NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1], a detoxification enzyme. This deficit is attributed to a loss of Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor), a master regulator of antioxidant transcriptional responses. DJ-1 stabilizes Nrf2 by preventing association with its inhibitor protein, Keap1, and Nrf2's subsequent ubiquitination. Without intact DJ-1, Nrf2 protein is unstable, and transcriptional responses are thereby decreased both basally and after induction. This effect of DJ-1 on Nrf2 is present in both transformed lines and primary cells across human and mouse species. DJ-1's effect on Nrf2 and subsequent effects on antioxidant responses may explain how DJ-1 affects the etiology of both cancer and PD, which are seemingly disparate disorders. Furthermore, this DJ-1/Nrf2 functional axis presents a therapeutic target in cancer treatment and justifies DJ-1 as a tumor biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Classic Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by fibrillar alpha-synuclein inclusions known as Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra, which are associated with nigrostriatal degeneration. However, alpha-synuclein pathologies accumulate throughout the CNS in areas that also undergo progressive neurodegeneration, leading to dementia and other behavioral impairments in addition to parkinsonism. Although mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene only cause Lewy body PD in rare families, and although there are multiple other, albeit rare, genetic causes of familial parkinsonism, sporadic Lewy body PD is the most common movement disorder, and insights into mechanisms underlying alpha-synuclein-mediated neurodegeneration provide novel targets for the discovery of disease-modifying therapies for PD and related neurodegenerative alpha-synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Piribedil is a D2 dopamine agonist, which has been shown to improve symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) when combined with L-dopa. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of piribedil monotherapy to placebo in patients with early PD over a 7-month period. Four hundred and five early PD patients were randomized (double-blind) to piribedil (150-300 mg/day) or placebo. L-dopa open-label supplementation was permitted. Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS III) score as the last observation on monotherapy over 7 months was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes were proportion of responders (UPDRS III improvement > 30%), patients remaining on monotherapy after 7 months, UPDRS III subscores, and UPDRS II. UPDRS III improved on piribedil (-4.9 points) versus a worsening on placebo (2.6 points; estimated effect = 7.26 points; 95% CI = 5.38-9.14; P < 0.0001). The proportion of responders was significantly higher for piribedil (42%) than for placebo (14%) (OR = 4.69; 95% CI = 2.82-7.80; P < 0.001). Piribedil significantly improved several UPDRS III subscores. UPDRS II improved on piribedil by -1.2 points, while it deteriorated by 1.5 points on placebo (estimated effect = 2.71; 95% CI = 1.8-3.62; P < 0.0001). The proportion of patients remaining on monotherapy after 7 months was greater in the piribedil group (OR = 3.72; 95% CI = 2.26-6.11; P < 0.001). Safety was consistent with that reported for other dopamine agonists, gastrointestinal side effects being the most common (22% of patients in piribedil group vs. 14% on placebo). Piribedil is effective and safe as early PD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies previously have reported reduced driving performance in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Few studies to date, however, have examined how specific cognitive difficulties associated with PD impact on specific aspects of driving performance in this population. In this study, the impact of a concurrent task on driving performance was examined. A simulator was used to measure the driving behavior of 18 current drivers with PD and 18 matched controls. The presence of a concurrent task was manipulated between conditions. Results showed that, although groups were similarly affected by the concurrent task on most driving measures, participants with PD were disproportionately affected on operational level driving behavior. It also appears that participants with PD sacrificed concurrent task performance to maintain driving performance. These results further support the hypothesis that cognitive difficulties associated with PD compromise driving performance in this population, even in the mild to moderate stages of the disease.",

Treatment options include reducing medications used for the treatment of PD-related motor symptoms or introducing an atypical antipsychotic drug. Only clozapine has been demonstrated to be efficacious and tolerated in double-blind controlled trials. This study evaluated the effect of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, on psychosis in PD in an open-label pilot study. Fourteen patients meeting entry criteria were started on aripiprazole 1 mg/day and titrated up to a maximum dose of 5 mg as needed. Subjects were evaluated on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III for motor function, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) for psychiatric response. Statistically significant improvement in mean BPRS and positive BPRS subscales occurred with open-label aripiprazole, but eight subjects discontinued the study due to worsened Parkinsonism (three), worsened psychosis (two), worsening of both (two), and lack of efficacy (one). While some patients had a favorable response, aripiprazole was associated with an exacerbation of motor symptoms. In this small study on psychosis in PD, aripiprazole did not appear promising.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to consider the role of the physical therapist in locomotor training for people with Parkinson disease. The ways in which disease progression, medication status, environmental conditions, individual factors, and the goals of locomotor tasks contribute to clinical decision making are explored. Using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, gait training will be considered in relation to impairments of body structure and function, activity limitations, and participation restrictions in people who are newly diagnosed through to those with end-stage disease. Based on the principles of neural adaptation and clinical research findings, practical suggestions are made on how to provide the most efficient and effective physical therapy services at different stages of Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD) there is a selective loss of certain midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. The most vulnerable neurons reside in the substantia nigra zona compacta (SNC), whereas the DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and interfascicular (IF) nucleus are less vulnerable to degeneration. Many sporadic PD patients have a defect in mitochondria respiration, and some of the genes that cause PD are mitochondrial-related (e.g., PINK1, Parkin, DJ1). The present study sought to determine whether mitochondria mass is different in SNC neurons compared to other midbrain DA neurons and to non-DA neurons in the mouse. At the electron microscopic level, mitochondria in the SN DA neurons occupy 40% less of the soma and dendritic area than in the SN non-DA neurons. The area occupied by mitochondria in the SN DA neurons is also lower than in the VTA neurons, although not different from the IF neurons. The red nucleus somata have the largest percentage of the somata occupied by mitochondria (12%). Mitochondria size is related to somata size; the largest mitochondria are found in the red nucleus neurons and the smallest mitochondria are found in the IF neurons. At the light microscopic level, SNC, VTA and IF DA neurons have <50% of the cytoplasm immunostained with the mitochondrial antibody 1D6, whereas non-DA neurons in the same midbrain regions contain mitochondria areas up to >65% of the cytoplasm area. These data indicate that mitochondria size and mass are not the same for all neurons, and the SNC DA neurons have relatively low mitochondria mass. The low mitochondria mass in SNC DA neurons may contribute to the selective vulnerability of these neurons in certain rodent models of PD.",

    "abstract": "It has been revealed that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have neuroprotective properties based not only on their cyclooxygenase-inhibitory action, but also on other properties including their inhibitory effects on the synthesis of nitric oxide radicals and agonistic action for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, in addition to some as yet unknown properties. Recently, a number of experimental and clinical studies have examined the neuroprotective effects of NSAIDs on the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease. In this article, various pharmacological effects of NSAIDs (except for their cyclooxygenase-inhibitory action) are reviewed, and possible neuroprotective effects of NSAIDs on Parkinson's disease are discussed. The neurotoxicity of dopamine quinones, or DOPA quinones, has recently received attention as a dopaminergic neuron-specific oxidative stress that is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and neurotoxin-induced parkinsonism. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin H synthase, thus suppressing dopamine oxidation and subsequent dopamine quinone formation. Therefore, this article also reviews possible suppressive effects of some NSAIDs against dopamine quinone generation.",

With the exception of the injectable short-acting dopamine agonist apomorphine, there is no other widely available non-oral dopaminergic therapy. Rotigotine is a lipid-soluble, non-ergot, D3, D2, D1 dopamine receptor agonist that has demonstrated efficacy as an alternative therapeutic option in both early and advanced Parkinson's disease. More importantly, it is uniquely formulated as a transdermal patch delivery system allowing for continuous, once-daily administration and better patient compliance. Preclinical and clinical trials have shown rotigotine to be a well-tolerated and effective treatment for early-stage Parkinson's disease. Rotigotine has also shown promise as adjunctive therapy with levodopa for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Tetrahydropapaveroline (THP) is a compound derived from dopamine monoamine oxidase-mediated metabolism, particularly present in the brain of parkinsonian patients receiving L-dopa therapy, and is capable of causing dopaminergic neurodegeneration. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of THP to cause oxidative stress on mitochondrial preparations and to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for its neurotoxicity. Our data show that THP autoxidation occurs with a continuous generation of hydroxyl radicals (*OH) and without the involvement of the Fenton reaction. The presence of ascorbate enhances this process by establishing a redox cycle, which regenerates THP from its quinolic forms. It has been shown that the production of *OH is not affected by the presence of either ferrous or ferric iron. Although THP does not affect lipid peroxidation, it is capable of reducing the high levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances obtained in the presence of ascorbate and/or iron. However, THP autoxidation in the presence of ascorbate causes both an increase in protein carbonyl content and a reduction in protein-free thiol content. THP also increases protein carbonyl content when the autoxidation occurs in the presence of iron. The remarkable role played by ascorbate in the production of oxidative stress by THP autoxidation is of particular interest.",

The another aim was to assessment of effectiveness of micrographia's management.\n40 Parkinson's disease patients (19 women and 21 men) aged from 49 to 82 years (mean--65.5) were examined. In the analysis age, duration of disease, predominance of right- or left - side symptoms, impairments of concentration of attention, dosage of levodopa, UPDRS score, and the level on the Hoehn and Yahr's scale were taken into account. In therapy of micrographia three methods were managed: writing between lines determining desired height of letters, writing with a big dot as a guide for letter's size and regular reminding the patient of the need to write at bigger size.\nmicrographia was occurred in 30 of 40 Parkinson's disease patients (75%). The better writing magnitude was obtained in all patients, but in 16 patients the effect was much better and maintained to 6 hours, whereas in 14 patients the effect was worse and maintained only short time.

    "abstract": "The molecules underlying neuron loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) are essentially unknown, and current therapies focus on diminishing symptoms rather than preventing neuron death. We identified RTP801 as a gene whose transcripts were highly induced in a cellular model of PD in which death of neuronal catecholaminergic PC12 cells was triggered by the PD mimetic 6-OHDA. Here, we find that RTP801 protein is also induced in this and additional cellular and animal PD models. To assess the relevance of these observations to PD, we used immunohistochemistry to compare RTP801 expression in postmortem brains from PD and control patients. For all PD brains examined, expression was highly elevated within neuromelanin-containing neurons of the substantia nigra but not in cerebellar neurons. Evaluation of the potential role of RTP801 induction in our cellular model revealed that RTP801 overexpression is sufficient to promote death but does not further elevate death caused by 6-OHDA. Furthermore, RTP801 induction is requisite for death in our cellular PD models and in 6-OHDA-treated cultured sympathetic neurons in that its knockdown by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) is protective. The mechanism by which 6-OHDA and RTP801 induce neuron death appears to involve repression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase activity, and such death is inhibited by shRNAs targeting TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex), a protein with which RTP801 interacts to block mTOR activation. Our findings thus suggest that the elevation of RTP801 we detect in PD substantia nigral neurons may mediate their degeneration and death and that RTP801 and its signaling cascade may be novel potential therapeutic targets for the disease.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that beta (15-30 Hz) oscillatory activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is dramatically increased in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may interfere with movement execution. Dopaminergic medications decrease beta activity and deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the STN may alleviate PD symptoms by disrupting this oscillatory activity. Depth recordings from PD patients have demonstrated beta oscillatory neuronal and local field potential (LFP) activity in STN, although its prevalence and relationship to neuronal activity are unclear. In this study, we recorded both LFP and neuronal spike activity from the STN in 14 PD patients during functional neurosurgery. Of 200 single- and multiunit recordings 56 showed significant oscillatory activity at about 26 Hz and 89% of these were coherent with the simultaneously recorded LFP. The incidence of neuronal beta oscillatory activity was significantly higher in the dorsal STN (P = 0.01) and corresponds to the significantly increased LFP beta power recorded in the same region. Of particular interest was a significant positive correlation between the incidence of oscillatory neurons and the patient's benefit from dopaminergic medications, but not with baseline motor deficits off medication. These findings suggest that the degree of neuronal beta oscillatory activity is related to the magnitude of the response of the basal ganglia to dopaminergic agents rather than directly to the motor symptoms of PD. The study also suggests that LFP beta oscillatory activity is generated largely within the dorsal portion of the STN and can produce synchronous oscillatory activity of the local neuronal population.",

    "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness has been widely accepted as a common problem not only in Parkinson's disease (PD) but also in other related disorders. Lowered excretion of orexin A (hypocretin 1) into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is known to play a pathological role in narcolepsy and secondary hypersomnia due to hypothalamic dysfunction. Although the levels of CSF orexin in PD have been previously examined, the results have been controversial, and no systematic investigation of CSF orexin excretion has been conducted on PD related disorders. In this study, orexin was measured in CSF collected by lumbar puncture in 62 patients with PD, 13 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 16 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and 7 patients with corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Levels of CSF orexin (mean+/-SD pg/ml) were 302+/-38 in PD, 297+/-48 in DLB, 258+/-37 in PSP, 246+/-90 in CBD. The occurrence of low orexin levels (<or=110pg/ml) was rare in both PD and DLB, and orexin levels were significantly lower in the PSP and CBD groups compared to PD (PSP: p<0.001, CBD: p<0.05). Orexin levels were inversely correlated with duration of morbidity in PSP but not in the other conditions studied. These findings suggest that loss of orexin neurons or impaired orexin neurotransmission might exist as a part of the neurodegeneration associated with advanced PSP with long duration of morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the gait characteristics of subjects with de novo Parkinson's disease (PD). We hypothesized that alterations in the spatio-temporal characteristics of gait will already be quantifiable in these patients. The gait of 35 patients with idiopathic PD (mean age 60 years) who were in the early stages of the disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage 1.8 +/- 0.5, median 2.0, range 1.0-2.5) and were not yet treated with any anti-parkinsonian medications were compared with the gait of age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 22). The patients walked more slowly and with reduced swing times while also exhibiting increased left/right swing asymmetry and marked inconsistencies in the timing of gait. By contrast, significant group differences in the peak forces at heel-strike and in the stride-to-stride variability of the ground reaction forces (a reflection of muscle output consistency) were not observed. These findings indicate that in de novo PD, an altered gait pattern is observed, even though dramatic changes in the gait pattern may not yet be apparent visually (e.g. fairly intact gait speed). Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the observed alterations are not just side-effects of treatments or complications of the disease. Instead, there is evidence for motor programming deficits in gait, as revealed by increased gait variability and asymmetry in timing. PD apparently impinges on the regulation of a consistent gait rhythm, even early in the course of the disease when observed alterations are not the result of any pharmacologic treatment.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder that remains refractory to curative treatment. Most patients are afflicted for many years, and the disease frequently results in severe physical handicap. Statements on the considerable cost of treatment are largely based on estimates and retrospective studies. To obtain more substantial data, we conducted a 3-year study of the economic aspects. Direct and indirect costs incurred by 117 patients (78 male, mean age 67.5 years) at the Deutsche Klinik f\u00fcr Diagnostik in Wiesbaden, Germany, were prospectively followed. The average cost per patient and month ran to <euro> 1007.55. Of that, direct costs amounted to <euro> 603.33 (55.9%), with drugs taking up the major share at <euro> 480.23. Indirect costs were <euro> 404.22 per patient and month, with 76% thereof related to nursing care and the incapacity to earn a living. Cost increased in proportion to Hoehn and Yahr stage, declining again with stages 4 and 5. The data we gathered confirm that Parkinsonism is responsible for sizeable expenses for not only the treating unit but the national economy as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Nearly one third of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) cite dysphonia, characterized subjectively as causing a harsh and breathy voice, as their most debilitating deficit. Medical or behavioral treatments may lead to voice improvement. The purpose of this study was 1) to determine whether vocal fold injection of Cymetra (micronized form of collagen, elastin, proteoglycans; Lifecell Co.) is associated with changes in dysphonic voice characteristics in subjects with IPD, as judged perceptually using a standard instrument Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V), and (2) which acoustic and aerodynamic measurements of voice are most reflective of any observed perceptual changes in voice.\nProspective clinical evaluation of patients with Parkinson's-related dysphonia (PRD).\nSix patients with PRD were evaluated before treatment for the presence of dysphonia and glottal gap. All subjects underwent transoral vocal fold collagen injection using topical anesthesia in the otolaryngology clinic as part of their clinical care. At the initial clinic visit, and 10 to14 days after vocal fold collagen injection, patients were asked to complete the Voice Handicap Index (VHI), a questionnaire concerning voice-related quality of life, and perceptual analyses of voice quality were performed. In addition, patients underwent acoustic (pitch/loudness range, maximum phonation time [MPT], and aerodynamic phonation threshold pressure [PTP]) voice analysis.\nFive of six subjects had self-perceived improvements in voice after treatment, as determined by the VHI (range, +8 to -24). All five subjects who completed testing demonstrated decreased PTP (range, -1.3 to -2.7, P = .002). Five of six subjects demonstrated statistically significant improvements in MPT (range, -2-16 s, P = .05). Five of six subjects had improved pitch range (-26-343 Hz), whereas all subjects had increased intensity range (0.6-23 db) after injection.\nTransoral collagen injection in patients with PRD is safe, well tolerated, and is an effective temporary method of subjectively improving voice and speech in selected patients with IPD. Reduction of glottal gap with collagen improves MPT and subglottal PTP. The resulting gain of vocal efficiency may reduce vocal fatigue and provide a useful adjunct to voice therapy for PRD.",

    "abstract": "During the past decade, the identification of several genes responsible for monogenic forms of Parkinson's disease has greatly increased our knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease. The alpha-synuclein gene, involved in very rare forms with autosomal dominant transmission, encodes a protein which is a major component of Lewy bodies, the histopathological hallmark of the disease. The Parkin gene, responsible for a significant number of cases with early onset, encodes an E3 ubiquitin-ligase, supporting the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in Parkinson's disease. Finally, mutations in the LRRK2 gene, which codes for a kinase with unknown substrates, accounts for a substantial fraction of autosomal dominant forms, particularly in North Africa. The study of these genes shows that the formation of Lewy bodies is not mandatory for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. It remains to be determined whether the products of the genes are implicated in the same metabolic path way.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal white matter hyperintensity (WMH) changes in older subjects with clinically diagnosed dementia.\nFluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were acquired one year apart in subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), Alzheimer disease (AD), and also healthy elderly comparison subjects. WMH volume was quantified using an automated technique.\nBaseline WMH (as a percent of brain volume) was significantly greater compared with healthy subjects (N=33, geometric mean WMH: 0.4%) in subjects with AD (N=23 [1.3%], analysis of variance post hoc p <0.001) but not PDD (N=13 [0.6%]) or DLB (N=14 [0.4%]). Increase in WMH volume (as a percent of brain volume) was not significantly different (Kruskal-Wallis p=0.4) between groups (AD median change: 0.08%; DLB: 0.025%; PDD: 0.07%, healthy: 0.02%). Severity of baseline WMH, rather than diagnosis or severity of dementia, was a significant predictor of lesion progression. Rate of change of WMH had no association with change in global cognitive performance.\nSignificant WMH progression occurs in degenerative dementias with rates influenced by severity of lesions at baseline rather than dementia type or cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "The Parkinson's disease (PD) causative PINK1 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein kinase called PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1). The autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance of PINK1 mutations suggests that PINK1 is neuroprotective and therefore loss of PINK1 function causes PD. Indeed, overexpression of PINK1 protects neuroblastoma cells from undergoing neurotoxin-induced apoptosis. As a protein kinase, PINK1 presumably exerts its neuroprotective effect by phosphorylating specific mitochondrial proteins and in turn modulating their functions. Towards elucidation of the neuroprotective mechanism of PINK1, we employed the baculovirus-infected insect cell system to express the recombinant protein consisting of the PINK1 kinase domain either alone [PINK1(KD)] or with the PINK1 C-terminal tail [PINK1(KD+T)]. Both recombinant enzymes preferentially phosphorylate the artificial substrate histone H1 exclusively at serine and threonine residues, demonstrating that PINK1 is indeed a protein serine/threonine kinase. Introduction of the PD-associated mutations, G386A and G409V significantly reduces PINK1(KD) kinase activity. Since Gly-386 and Gly-409 reside in the conserved activation segment of the kinase domain, the results suggest that the activation segment is a regulatory switch governing PINK1 kinase activity. We also demonstrate that PINK1(KD+T) is approximately 6-fold more active than PINK1(KD). Thus, in addition to the activation segment, the C-terminal tail also contains regulatory motifs capable of governing PINK1 kinase activity. Finally, the availability of active recombinant PINK1 proteins permits future studies to search for mitochondrial proteins that are preferentially phosphorylated by PINK1. As these proteins are likely physiological substrates of PINK1, their identification will shed light on the mechanism of pathogenesis of PD.",

Since the degeneration of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons that occurs in Parkinson's disease is more often than not confined to elderly individuals, it is of interest to determine whether the effects of BDNF against 6 hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in young rats can be extended to aged animals. 6-hydroxydopamine was stereotaxically injected into the striatum of young (3-months) and aged (24-months) rats, which were treated two hours earlier with BDNF. 6-OHDA results in almost complete destruction of substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons. BDNF injection significantly changed apomorphine induced rotations from 132 +/- 15 to 181 +/- 10, staircase test from 73 +/- 2% to 61 +/- 3%, initiation time from 7 +/- 2 to 12 +/- 1 sec, and disengage time from 80 +/- 7 to 90 +/- 5 sec in young and aged animals, respectively. It is concluded that BDNF causes the limited behavior recovery of striatal DA systems from 6-OHDA toxicity in aged animals.",

    "abstract": "The severe, cortical, cholinergic depletion accompanying Parkinson's disease (PD) is considered as a highly probable correlate of cognitive and behavioural dysfunction. Recent studies have demonstrated that cholinesterase inhibitors (notably rivastigmine) are beneficial in patients suffering from dementia associated with PD (PDD). However, the primary efficacy variables used in such work came from scales designed for Alzheimer's disease (AD), even though the cognitive symptoms in PD and AD dementia do not overlap completely. The aim of the present study (a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial) was to determine the utility of the Mattis dementia rating scale - the most commonly used scale in PD patients - to assess the efficacy of a 24-week rivastigmine treatment.\nTwenty-eight patients with PD, who constituted a subgroup of patients enrolled to the EXPRESS study (Emre et al, N Engl J Med 2004) participated in this study. They suffered from mild to moderately severe dementia (MMSE scores above 10 and below 24), with an onset of cognitive symptoms occurring at least two years after the diagnosis of PD. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with rivastigmine (3 to 12 mg per day) or placebo. The Mattis dementia rating scale was administered to patients from six centres in France at the baseline and end-point visits.\nCompared with placebo, a 24-week rivastigmine treatment led to a significant improvement in the overall score on the Mattis dementia rating scale (p = 0.031), with a trend towards a significant improvement in the \"Attention\" subscale score (p = 0.061). Correlation analysis showed that in the rivastigmine group, performance on the Mattis \"Attention\" and \"Initiation\" subscales appeared to contribute heavily to the improvement in the overall score. Moreover, the latter was also related to an improvement in activities of daily living and a reduction in behavioural disturbances.\nBy using the Mattis dementia rating scale (which comprises items that are sensitive to executive dysfunction), the present study confirmed that rivastigmine has a beneficial effect on cognitive function in PDD. Despite our study's small sample size, the Mattis scale was able to detect this improvement and could thus be considered as an interesting outcome measure in further work.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction and dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) are still poorly understood. Altered resting state oscillatory brain activity may reflect underlying neuropathological changes. The present study using magneto encephalography (MEG) was set up to study differences in the pattern of resting state oscillatory brain activity in groups of demented and non-demented PD patients and healthy, elderly controls.\nThe pattern of MEG background oscillatory activity was studied in 13 demented PD patients, 13 non-demented PD patients and 13 healthy controls. Whole head MEG recordings were obtained in the morning in an eyes closed and an eyes open, resting state condition. Relative spectral power was calculated using Fast Fourier Transformation in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands.\nIn the non-demented PD patients, relative theta power was diffusely increased and beta power concomitantly decreased relative to controls. gamma Power was decreased in central and parietal channels. In the demented PD patients, a diffuse increase in relative delta and to lesser extent theta power and a decrease in relative alpha, beta and to lesser extent gamma power were found in comparison to the non-demented PD group. In addition, reactivity to eye opening was much reduced in the demented PD group.\nParkinson's disease is characterized by a slowing of resting state brain activity involving theta, beta and gamma frequency bands. Dementia in PD is associated with a further slowing of resting state brain activity, additionally involving delta and alpha bands, as well as a reduction in reactivity to eye-opening.\nThe differential patterns of slowing of resting state brain activity in demented and non-demented PD patients suggests that, in conjunction with a progression of the pathological changes already present in non-demented patients, additional mechanisms are involved in the development of dementia in PD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in DJ-1 (PARK7) are one cause of early-onset autosomal-recessive parkinsonism. We screened for DJ-1 mutations in 93 affected individuals from the 64 multiplex Parkinson disease (PD) families in our sample that had the highest family-specific multipoint LOD scores at the DJ-1 locus. In addition to sequencing all coding exons for alterations, we used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to examine the genomic copy number of DJ-1 exons. A known polymorphism (R98Q) was found in five PD subjects, once as a homozygote and in the other four cases as heterozygotes. No additional missense mutations and no exon deletions or duplications were detected. Our results, in combination with those of previous studies, suggest that alterations in DJ-1 are not a common cause of familial PD.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been known to play an important role in the regulation of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop. STN neurons have pacemaking activitiy and their firing pattern can switch from spike mode to bursting mode when membrane potential becomes hyperpolarized. Recent study has shown that STN neurons show marked increase in burst and oscillatory activity during the dopamine-depleting state of Parkinson's disease (PD). This electrophysiological change in activity is now considered as an characterstic pathophysiological feature of PD. High frequency stimulation of STN can modify and \"normalize\" the activity of STN neurons in the pathophysiologial state. This electrophysiological treatment applied to STN, known as deep brain stimulation (DBS) clinically, ameliorates the symptoms of PD effectively, and is becoming a standard treatment in patients with advanced PD. This article would review the basic researches concerning electrical activities of STN and try to extend the basic knowledge into clinical applications.",
