    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative neurodopaminergic disease in nigrostriatum pathway of human and is responsible for most of the movement disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that an inflammatory reaction accompanies the pathological processes caused by Cyclooxygenase (COX) seen in many neurodegenerative disorders, including PD and according to the recent researches chronic use of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) decreases the risk of PD in human. In the study the rat left Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta (SNc) have been destroyed using electrical lesion (1 mA; DC; 8 Sec) to induce PD model. Then aspirin (30, 60 mg kg(-1)) and celecoxib (4, 8 mg kg(-1)) have been administrated orally to parkinsonian rats. When the animals were suffered to PD Murprogo's Method evaluated the rigidity ofparkinsonian rats. Both selective COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) and non-selective COX-2 inhibitor (aspirin) decreased the rigidity of parkinsonian rats p<0.05 but rigidity recovery after administration the selective COX-2 inhibitor was more than non-selective COX-2 inhibitor. These findings are additional pharmacological information which has suggested the use of NSAIDs as alternative way to treat the rigidity of PD.",

    "abstract": "In idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), a generalized Lewy body type-degeneration in the brain as well as extracranial organs was identified. It is unclear, whether cerebral and extracranial Lewy body type-degeneration in PD are coupled or not. To address this question, cerebral [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT - to quantify cerebral nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration - and myocardial [(123)I]MIBG scintigraphy - to quantify extracranial myocardial sympathetic degeneration - were performed in 95 PD patients and 20 healthy controls. At each Hoehn and Yahr stage separately, myocardial MIBG uptake correlated significantly with striatal FP-CIT uptake. No such correlation was found in the controls. Cerebral and extracranial Lewy body type-degeneration in PD do not develop independently from each other but develop in a strongly coupled manner. Obviously cerebral and extracranial changes are driven by at least similar pathomechanisms. Our findings in controls contradict a physiological correlation between nigrostriatal dopaminergic and myocardial sympathetic function.",

Five clinical and four health-economic evaluations suggest that the clinical and cost effectiveness of nursing care for PD remain inconclusive. This is in contrast to clinical experience and may be due to issues related to study designs, study interventions, and the outcome measures used. More studies are needed and may benefit from considering specific interventions evaluated using outcome measures that are valid and responsive representations of their expected outcomes.",

According to the level of available evidence, we provide recommendations for clinical practice. Finally, we discuss the need for an improved organization of allied health care, and identify topics for future research to further underpin the pros and cons of allied health care and complementary therapies in PD.",

    "abstract": "A systematic review of the literature found 23 randomized clinical trials reflecting specific core areas of physical therapy (PT), that is, transfer, posture, balance, reaching and grasping, gait, and physical condition. All studies were of moderate methodological quality. Important limitations of the studies were: (1) insufficient statistical power (type II error); (2) poor methodological quality due to inadequate randomization and blinding procedures; (3) insufficient contrast in dosage and treatment between experimental and control groups; and (4) lack of appropriate measurement instruments able to identify clinically meaningful changes according to the International Classification of Functioning (ICF). In the last 5 years, the methodological quality of RCTs has shown substantial improvement. Most high-quality studies investigated the effects of exercise therapy, including the use of external rhythms to improve gait and gait-related activities. The results of these trials suggest that the effects of PT are task- and context-specific. This indicates that the tasks that are trained tend not to generalize to related activities that are not directly trained in the rehabilitation programme itself, and suggests that future programmes should train meaningful tasks preferably in patients' home environment. In addition, the decline in treatment effects after an intervention has ended suggests the need for permanent treatment of patients with PD, i.e. chronic treatment for this chronic disease. Future studies should aim to develop responsive measurement instruments able to monitor meaningful changes in activities, as well as better understanding of insufficiently understood symptoms such as freezing, rigidity and bradykinesia and greater insight into neurophysiological mechanisms underlying training-induced changes in activities such as improved gait performance by rhythmic cueing.",

Data will be reviewed here from cross-sectional EEG and MEG studies to suggest that Parkinson's disease is characterized by changing patterns of disturbed neural synchrony that appear to be dependent on the stage of disease. Some of these alterations in neural synchrony may directly account for a number of disease-related impairments in motor and cognitive functions. Future longitudinal studies are required to fully understand the disturbances of functional brain networks in Parkinson's disease and how they evolve throughout the course of the disease.",

    "abstract": "A number of independent studies provide evidence that transcranial sonography (TCS) is helpful in the diagnosis of idiopathic and monogenetic Parkinson's disease (PD). In the clinical setting, it may exclude a number of secondary or atypical parkinsonian syndromes at very early stages. TCS may additionally depict morphological alterations of symptoms associated with PD motor features like midline alterations in PD-associated depression. Importantly, substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity, the typical ultrasound marker of PD, can also be found in approximately 9% of healthy subjects. PET studies and conditions challenging the dopaminergic system indicate that this stable ultrasound feature has a functional relevance. Ongoing longitudinal studies test the hypothesis that SN hyperechogenicity is a risk marker for nigrostriatal vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "Functional imaging can be used to detect preclinical evidence of dopamine deficiency in people deemed to be at increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) based on genetic or environmental risk, or because they have clinical features such as REM sleep behaviour disorder that may be a harbinger of PD. Positron emission tomography (PET) using [11C]dihydrotetrabenazine to label the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2), a variety of 11C- or 18F-labeled ligands for the membrane dopamine transporter (DAT), or 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa (FD), which assesses uptake and decarboxylation of levodopa as well as vesicular storage of radiolabeled dopamine, can all be used, and all provide comparable, but somewhat different information. DAT binding using either PET or SPECT appears to be the most sensitive marker of dopamine denervation, while FD uptake is subject to compensatory upregulation and its reduction may more closely herald the onset of clinical disease. Alterations in glucose metabolism and in dopamine release also occur in the asymptomatic hemisphere of subjects with unilateral PD. An interesting potential application of PET is the determination of non-dopaminergic abnormalities that correlate with the presence of clinically apparent pre-motor symptoms of PD.",

This article illustrates how changes in the plasticity of these circuits is linked to the expression of dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease, and may even underlie the tendency of some individuals to develop focal dystonia. Indeed, gradual normalisation of this excessive plasticity occurs after initiating deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus in patients with generalised dystonia. It may therefore relate to the slow onset of clinical improvement that occurs over the first 6 weeks or so of treatment.",

Thus, multiple cellular hits are likely to contribute to neurodegeneration in PD. If such a mechanism happens to occur, our therapeutic intervention may perhaps require a cocktail of molecules acting on various pathways simultaneously. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that PD may progress even when the initial cause of neurodegeneration has disappeared, suggesting that toxic substances released by the glial cells may be involved in the perpetuation of neuronal degeneration. This may thus represent a therapeutic target for PD.",

Pathologically, there is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that project to the striatum. Current available therapies for PD are targeted to the restoration of striatal dopamine. These approaches may alleviate symptoms transiently, but fail to slow the progression of disease. One emergent therapeutic approach is the use of neurotrophic factors to halt or reverse the loss of dopaminergic neurons. There have been intensive research efforts both preclinically and clinically testing the efficacy and safety of neurotrophic factors for the treatment of PD. In this review, we discuss the neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties of various trophic factors, both old and recent, and their status as therapeutic molecules for PD.",

Here we discuss examples of novel multifunctional ligands that may have potential as neuroprotective and neurorestorative therapeutics in PD.

    "abstract": "The excitatory corticostriatal pathway, which plays a critical role in the building up and storage of adaptive motor behaviours, can undergo long-lasting, activity-dependent changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission, named long-term potentiation (LTP) and long- term depression (LTD). Both forms of plasticity are thought to underlie motor learning and depend upon the concomitant activation of glutamatergic corticostriatal and dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathways. Accordingly, corticostriatal LTP and LTD are altered in Parkinson's Disease (PD) models. The dopamine (DA)/acetylcholine(Ach) synaptic unbalance could be responsible of some of the cognitive deficits described in PD patients. The impairment of DA/ACh-dependent cellular learning could lead to the storage of unessential memory traces, as it has been postulated for the induction of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Other non-motor symptoms involve not only the central dopaminergic system, but also in the noradrenergic, serotoninergic and cholinergic transmitter systems.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput gene-based platform studies in human post-mortem substantia nigra from sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) cases have revealed significant dysregulation of genes involved in biological processes linked to previously established neurodegenerative mechanisms both in sporadic and hereditary PD. These include protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, cell cycle, vesicle trafficking, synaptic transmission, dopamine metabolism and cell adhesion/cytoskeleton maintenance. These observations have extended our current view on the molecular pathways underlying the etio-pathology of the disease and provided a basis for the development of a novel genetic model of sporadic PD, centered on gradual silencing/over-expression of the candidate genes. The uncovered signatures may serve as future predictive biomarkers for early PD diagnosis, disease progression and drug development.",

    "abstract": "Our knowledge regarding the genetics of Parkinson's disease (PD) and parkinsonism has evolved dramatically during the past decade, with the discovery of numerous loci and genes. The LRRK2 gene has emerged as the most commonly involved in both familial and sporadic PD. Several variants in LRRK2 and SNCA have been associated with an increased risk of sporadic PD. PRKN, PINK1 and DJ1 mutations cause early-onset recessively inherited PD. Autosomal dominant dementia and parkinsonism is caused by mutations in the MAPT gene, and in the most recently discovered PGRN gene.",

    "abstract": "It has become increasingly apparent that Parkinson's disease (PD) can no longer be considered purely a motor disease, as numerous sensory alterations accompany this disorder either before or early in its clinical progression. Most notable among such disturbances are decrements in smell function. Such anomalies have been documented in approximately 90% of patients with early-stage sporadic PD and appear to progress little, if at all, with the development of the more classic PD-related motor symptoms. In this paper, I briefly review the nature of the olfactory dysfunction observed in PD and current theories as to its pathological basis.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is relatively common in Parkinson's Disease (PD). When dementia occurs in the setting of PD, it is referred to as Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), which is distinguished from the clinical syndrome in which dementia precedes extrapyramidal features, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In this report, the neuropathology of PDD and DLB is reviewed and preliminary findings are reported on striatal pathology in 28 brains, including 7 PD, 7 PDD and 14 DLB. Sections of putamen immunostained for a-synuclein and investigated with image analysis show that striatal pathology is common and that both cortical and striatal a-synuclein pathology is greater in PDD and DLB than PD. Most cases of PDD and DLB have Alzheimer-type pathology, particularly amyloid plaques, which may act in an additive or synergistic manner with a-synuclein pathology. There are few pathologic differences between PDD and DLB, despite differences in their clinical course.",

    "abstract": "This chapter discusses the epidemiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Classically, PD refers to progressive parkinsonism caused by loss of pigmented aminergic brainstem neurons without an identifiable cause, while parkinsonism refers simply to the syndrome of bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity and postural reflex impairment. Over nearly two centuries, Parkinson's clinical description has provided the framework for clinical investigations, including epidemiologic ones. Descriptions of PD were limited to selected clinical settings until the middle of the 20th century. Since then, epidemiologic approaches have been used not only to investigate the population distribution of PD, but also as a way to glean clues as to the cause of this \u201cidiopathic\u201d disorder. Because PD is relatively infrequent, a large base population must be surveyed to identify sufficient numbers of cases for a study. In some instances, PD cases can be identified through health service rosters within defined geographic areas or in enumerated populations. In others, cases of PD are sought independently of the health care system, such as through door-to-door surveys. While the latter approach is theoretically least likely to exclude cases, the time and cost involved are also greatest using this approach.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (DBS/STN) is an effective treatment for motor symptoms in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is less clear how DBS/STN affects cognitive functions. We investigated 19 PD patients (13 male, 6 female, mean age 57 +/- 6, mean PD duration 15 +/- 4 years) who received bilateral DBS/STN. Neuropsychological assessment was done before the surgery and at least 12 months after DBS implantation. The patients were examined in their optimal motor status. Global cognitive performance measured by Mattis Dementia Rating Scale was not significantly changed after DBS STN. The performance in Wechsler Memory Scale III decreased in the subtest Logical Memory, in delayed recall (p < 0.05) and in recognition (p < 0.05). In Stroop Test, the performance worsened in the second (p < 0.05), and third condition (p < 0.01) measuring interference and ability to suppress automatic reactions. In conclusion, patients treated by DBS/STN tend to worsen in executive functions and in logical memory.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with limited pharmacologic therapies. Recent animal studies and one large retrospective study have found NSAIDs to be protective against the development of PD. We decided to test this hypothesis by conducting a nested case-control study using the Saskatchewan drug plan database. Entry to the cohort was defined as the first prescription of an antihypertensive agent between 1980 and 1987 and followed until 1999. Cases were defined as those having received three prescriptions for a dopamine agonist within a year. For each case, ten controls were selected matched to the case by age, calendar time and index date. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate rate ratios adjusting for gender, previous use of arthritis medication and previous antipsychotic use. Current users of NSAIDs had a slightly higher risk of developing PD (RR=1.49 [95% CI, 1.11-2.01]). This effect was not seen with past users (RR=1.18 [95% CI, 0.89-1.59]). Based on the results of our study current users of NSAIDs may be at a slightly higher risk of developing PD. More studies are needed to confirm this finding.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa, a prodrug of dopamine, remains to be one of the main drugs in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. All current levodopa products are formulated with aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitors such as carbidopa or benserazide to prevent the metabolism of levodopa in the gastrointestinal tract and systemic circulation. Levodopa pharmacokinetic profiles remain unchanged after multiple doses, and are similar between healthy volunteers and patients and among patients at different stages of disease. Entacapone inhibits the metabolism of levodopa therefore increases the area under the plasma concentration-time profile of levodopa; however, it may decrease the initial absorption rate of levodopa in some patients probably due to competitive absorption. Food appears to affect the absorption of levodopa, but its effects vary with formulations. The results of positron emission tomography study suggest that a high protein diet may compete with the uptake of levodopa into the brain, therefore, may result in reduced levodopa effects. Since infusion studies demonstrated that it is beneficial to maintain stable plasma concentrations of levodopa, controlled-release formulations have been designed to provide prolonged absorption of levodopa. However, subsequent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated that a threshold concentration of levodopa appears to be necessary to switch patients \"on\". Once patients are turned \"on\", the duration of levodopa effects may be correlated with plasma concentration of levodopa. As such, more recent studies have demonstrated significant clinical benefits such as shorter time to \"on\" and longer duration of \"on\" when combining the immediate- and controlled-release levodopa products as compared to controlled-release levodopa products. Given these findings, it is important for physicians to understand the relationship between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of levodopa in order to provide dosage regimens that meet patient needs. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data of levodopa reported in the literature are reviewed here.",

    "abstract": "The case is presented of a five-year-old boy with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, who had undergone three surgical palliations because of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect and pulmonary trunk near-atresia. Successful and uncomplicated radiofrequency catheter ablation of an accessory pathway located across the systemic atrioventricular valve ring was performed. The procedure was motivated by forthcoming corrective surgery, which would preclude venous access to the heart. This case emphasizes the need for precise timing of ablative therapy in such patients and shows that surgery itself may facilitate catheter ablation. (Cardiol J 2007; 14: 500-503).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized clinically by resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability due to progressive and selective loss of dopamine neurons in the ventral substantia nigra, with the presence of ubiquitinated protein deposits called Lewy bodies in the neurons. The pathoetiology of cell death in PD is incompletely understood and evidence implicates impaired mitochondrial complex I function, altered intracellular redox state, activation of proapoptotic factors and dysfunction of ubiquitinproteasome pathway. Now it is believed that genetic aberration, an environmental toxin or combination of both leads to a cascade of events culminating in the destruction of myelinated brainstem catecholaminergic neurons. Also the role of production of significant levels of abnormal proteins, which may misfold, aggregate and interfere with intracellular processes causing cytotoxicity has recently been hypothesized. In this article, the diverse pieces of evidence that have linked the various factors responsible for the pathophysiology of PD are reviewed with special emphasis to various candidate genes and proteins. Furthermore, the present therapeutic strategies and futuristic approaches for the pharmacotherapy of PD are critically discussed.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests inflammation, mitochondria dysfunction, and oxidative stress play major roles in Parkinson's disease (PD), where the primary pathology is the significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Current methods used to treat PD focus mainly on replacing dopamine in the nigrostriatal system. However, with time these methods fail and worsen the symptoms of the disease. This implies there is more to the treatment of PD than just restoring dopamine or the dopaminergic neurons, and that a broader spectrum of factors must be changed in order to restore environmental homeostasis. Pharmacological agents that can protect against progressive neuronal degeneration, increase the level of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system, or restore the dopaminergic system offer various avenues for the treatment of PD. Drugs that reduce inflammation, restore mitochondrial function, or scavenge free radicals have also been shown to offer neuroprotection in various animal models of PD. The activation of peroxisome proliferator receptor- gamma (PPAR-gamma ) has been associated with altering insulin sensitivity, increasing dopamine, inhibiting inflammation, altering mitochondrial bioenergetics, and reducing oxidative stress - a variety of factors that are altered in PD. Therefore, PPAR-gamma activation may offer a new clinically relevant treatment approach to neuroinflammation and PD related neurodegeneration. This review will summarize the current understanding of the role of PPAR-gamma agonists in neuroinflammation and discuss their potential for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkison's disease causes damage to the central nervous system resulting in bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, rest tremor and dysarthric speech. In clinical terms dysarthria denotes the dysfunction of articulation, phonation and respiration. It is brought about by the impairment of neural paths innervating the speech apparatus, thus causing a decreased ability to communicate. The study was conducted by the Center for Speech and Language Processing (CSLP), Adam Mickiewicz University, Pozna\u0144 and the Chair and Department of Phoniatrics and Audiology, the Medical University, Pozna\u0144 within the interdisciplinary research project grant called \"Speech and Language Virtual Therapist for Individuals with Parkinson's Disease\". Apart from traditional voice and speech therapies, one of the ways of treating speech disturbances accompanying Parkinson's disease is an innovative Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT). The purpose of this innovative method introduced by dr L. Ramig and colleagues in 1987-1988, is to teach the patient to speak loud. As a result of co-operation between CLSP and the Center for Spoken Language Research (CSLR) at the University of Colorado, Boulder, USA, a Polish version of LSVT Virtual Therapist computer programme was created (LSVTVT). The programme is based on the principles of LSVT. The positive outcomes of the therapy give hope to Parkinson's disease patients with dysarthria, as well as to speech therapists.",

    "abstract": "Progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the resulting dopamine deficiency in the striatum are neuropathological basis of the movement disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD). Neuromelanin-containing neurons are particularly susceptible to degeneration and their depigmentation is the hallmark of the advanced disease. The proposed mechanisms underlaying the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra include iron-catalyzed oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunctions, inflammation and disturbances of protein metabolism. This review presents some new concepts concerning important but ambiguous role of neuromelanin in the above mentioned processes. It seems that the imbalance between cytoprotective and cytotoxic action of the pigment may cause neuronal death via mitochondrial oxidative stress, inhibition of ubiquitine-proteasome system and alpha-synuclein accumulation. Extraneuronal melanin may contribute to chronic inflammation by excessive secretion of cytokines and nitric oxide due to prolonged microglia activation. Recent reports suggest a possible role of the lipid component of neuromelanin in pigment-dependent cytotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative, dopamine deficiency disorder. The main therapeutic strategies for PD treatment relies on dopamine precursors (levodopa), inhibition of dopamine metabolism (monoamine oxidase [MAO] B and catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors), and dopamine receptor agonists. Recently, a novel selective and irreversible MAO B propargylamine inhibitor rasagiline (N-propargyl-1-R-aminoindan, Azilect((R))) was approved for PD therapy. In contrast to selegiline, the prototype of MAO B inhibitors, rasagiline is not metabolized to potentially toxic amphetamine metabolites. The oral bioavailability of rasagiline is 35%, it reaches T(max) after 0.5-1 hours and its half-life is 1.5-3.5 hours. Rasagiline undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism primarily by cytochrome P450 type 1A2 (CYP1A2). Rasagiline is initiated at 1 mg once-daily dosage as monotherapy in early PD patients and at 0.5-1 mg once-daily as adjunctive to levodopa in advanced PD patients. Rasagiline treatment was not associated with \"cheese effect\" and up to 20 mg per day was well tolerated. In PD patients with hepatic impairment, rasagiline dosage should be carefully adjusted. Rasagiline should not be administered with other MAO inhibitors and co-administration with certain antidepressants and opioids should be avoided. Although further clinical evidence is needed on the neuroprotective effects of rasagiline in PD patients, this drug provides an additional tool for PD therapy.",

Simultaneously microelectrode recording was performed in the STN and electromyography (EMG) was conducted on the selected muscles of contralateral limb during the surgery. Single unit analysis and cross-correlation test were carried out to study the neuronal pattern-related parkinsonian symptoms.

The 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion procedure is described in more detail for mice than for rats since the lesioning procedure in rats has been described extensively in previous work and is less difficult to perform. Unlike primate models, rodent models of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia are relatively simple and fast to set up, thus being affordable to most laboratories. These models allow for studying the dyskinetic complications of L-DOPA treatment on large groups of animals under strictly controlled experimental conditions. Along with information and structured protocols for the practical execution of the test, this unit provides a detailed description of the rating scale and the phenomenology of rodent abnormal involuntary movements, and suggestions for beginners.",

    "abstract": "Forty-one Parkinson's disease patients with dementia (21 galantamine group, 20--control group) with onset of dementia at least two years after the manifestation of parkinsonian symptoms participated in this open-label controlled trial of galantamine in maximum dose 16 mg/day. Cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms were assessed before and after 4, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment using clinical assessment as well as rating scales, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), ADAS-cog, clock drawing test, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-12) with assessment of caregiver distress. Patients treated with galantamine had better scores on MMSE (p<0,05), ADAS-cog (p<0,05), clock drawing test (p<0,05) and FAB (p<0,01) to the end of the trial comparing to the control group. NPI scores on individual items changed from baseline at week 12 and 24, showing benefits of galantamine treatment as compared to the controls, with significant difference for hallucinations (p=0,0002), anxiety (p=0,04), sleep disorders (p=0,04) and apathy (p=0,006). Galantamine therapy was associated with a significant reduction in caregiver distress (p=0,007), improvement of daily life activity (p=0,003). Gait, freezing and falls were improved in the galantamine group but a mild worsening of tremor was noted in two patients. Adverse events (drooling, postural hypotension, nausea, dysuria) were observed in 7 (30%) of galantamine treated patients.",

These complications may be reduced due to the constant (physiologic) stimulation of post-synaptic dopamine receptors that, to a certain degree, provides the drug stalevo, which contains levodopa and 2 enzyme inhibitors, dopa decarboxylase (carbidopa) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (entacapone). The results of the study demonstrated beneficial effects of stalevo as compared to traditional therapy in patients with \"wearing off\" and \"on-off\" phenomena.",

Only in PD patients coming from Valcamonica levels of Cu were higher than in subjects coming from the province of Brescia. Moreover, In patients with PD levels of sieric Cu significantly correlated with score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UDPRS).\nZinc seems to be higher in PD independently from the exposition to metal pollution. Perturbation of copper metabolism in PD seems to be related to exposition to environmental toxins or metal pollution and coul be involved in the progression of the disease itself.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a dramatic loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Among the many pathogenic mechanisms thought to contribute to the demise of these cells in sporadic cases of PD, oxidative stress has taken center stage due to extensive experimental evidence showing that dopamine- or MPTP-derived reactive oxygen species and oxidized dopamine metabolites may trigger toxicity through mitochondrial inhibition or deleterious modifications of biomolecules. In familial forms of PD, however, the involvement of toxic protein aggregation (synuclein), impairment of ubiquitin-proteosome system (parkin. and loss of antioxidative properties (DJ-1) has gained attention. Recently, JNK pathway has come to light that could link malfunction of mutated DJ-1, parkin, PINK1 and alpha-synuclein to the oxidative stress-triggered apoptosis, finally ascribing a common pathogenic mechanism to both the sporadic and familial forms of PD.",

    "abstract": "We tested the ability of eight Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with clearly asymmetrical right-sided motor signs and eight control subjects to assess different levels of muscular forces. In Experiment 1, subjects had first to produce a target-force with one hand (the reference hand) with the assistance of visual feedback, and then match that force with the other hand (the matching hand) without any visual feedback. In Experiment 2, they had to produce a target-force with one hand and then estimate it by attributing a numerical value. In Experiment 1, the results showed that PD patients could normally reach the target-forces with the more affected left hand but they were impaired in inter-manual force transfer. They were also impaired, in Experiment 2, in estimating forces produced by their more affected hand. Our findings suggest that PD patients present a deficit in sensing motor effort. Effort awareness might be mediated by the basal ganglia.",

    "abstract": "A recently described form of Parkinson's disease - PARK8 - is caused by mutations in the novel LRRK2 gene on chromosome 12q12. The most common mutation in this gene is the substitution G2019S and we studied it for the first time in a large group of Russian Slavonic patients (311 patients) with Parkinson's disease including 295 sporadic and 16 familial cases. The mutation LRRK2-G2019S was identified in 1% of patients examined (3 cases) and was not found in a group of population control. The clinical picture of all patients with the LRRK2-G2019S mutation was typical for levodopa-responsive parkinsonism and age of disease onset varied widely (from 39 to 71 years). Two different PARK8-linked haplotypes were found in carriers of the mutation that suggested the independent origin of the G2019S mutation on different chromosomes. The identification of mutations in the LRRK2 gene in patients with \"ordinary\" sporadic Parkinson's disease has serious implications for medical genetic counseling and prognosis in respective families.",

    "abstract": "The biological rhythm in comorbidity of depression and Parkinson disease (PD) is still unclear. For early diagnosis or clarification of the pathologic condition of comorbidity of depression and PD, the present study investigated the presence of circadian rhythm abnormalities in patients with depression.\nWe measured the rectal temperature (RT) in 30 PD patients with or without depression during 48 consecutive hours using the maximum entropy method (MEM) and least-squares method (COSINOR). The presence of major or minor depression was evaluated by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview based on the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and the Hamilton Depression Scale.\nThe RT rhythms of patients without depression predominately showed a circadian rhythm. However, 2 of 6 patients with depression showed an infradian rhythm using MEM. COSINOR revealed that PD patients with depression showed lower amplitudes of core body temperature (p = 0.012) and higher minimum RT (p = 0.031) relative to those of patients without depression.\nPD patients with depression show an altered RT circadian rhythm. The results suggest that the characteristics of core body temperature could be potentially used as a biological marker for depression in PD.",

    "abstract": "Two missense mutations (A30P and A53T) in the gene for alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) cause familial Parkinson's disease (PD) in a small cohort. There is increasing evidence to propose that abnormal metabolism and accumulation of alpha-syn in dopaminergic neurons play a role in the development of familial as well as sporadic PD. The complexity of the mechanisms underlying alpha-syn-induced neurotoxicity, however, has made difficult the development of animal models that faithfully reproduce human PD pathology. We now describe and characterize such a model, which is based on the stereotaxic injection into rat right substantia nigra pars compacta of the A30P mutated form of alpha-syn fused to a protein transduction domain (TAT). The TAT sequence allows diffusion of the fusion protein across the neuronal plasma membrane and results in a localized dopaminergic loss. Dopaminergic cell loss was evaluated both by tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry and by HPLC analysis of dopamine and its catabolite 3,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. Infusion of TAT-alpha-synA30P induced a significant 26% loss in dopaminergic neurons. This dopaminergic loss was accompanied by a time-dependent impairment in motor function, evaluated utilizing the rotarod and footprint tests. In comparison to chemical neurotoxin-based (e.g. 6-hyroxydopamine, MPTP) animal models of PD, the alpha-syn-based PD animal model offers the advantage of mimicking the early stages and slow development of the human disease and should prove valuable in assessing specific aspects of PD pathogenesis in vivo and in developing new therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that left versus right deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) would have differential effects on speech. Twenty right-handed individuals with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) underwent unilateral STN DBS. Ten were operated on the right and 10 on the left hemisphere as indicated by severity of nonspeech motor function. Speech was evaluated before surgery and 3 to 6 months after surgery with stimulator-off and with stimulator-on, with all participants off anti-parkinsonian medication for 12 hours before evaluation. Evaluators and patient speakers were blinded to the stimulator status at the postsurgery evaluations. Motor performance was assessed with UPDRS-III. Each participant produced three samples of diadochokinetic syllables. Syllable rate, syllable and vowel duration, VOT, and F0 were obtained. The diadochokinetic syllables were rated for articulatory accuracy and speaking rate. Twenty graduate clinicians served as judges. The samples were randomly presented via headphones. A mixed ANOVA with repeated measures was used to assess the significance of the changes in UPRS-III scores and speech measures. The results indicated that unilateral STN DBS produced improvement in nonspeech motor function regardless of the side of stimulation.

Radiofrequency ablation of accessory atrio-ventricular pathways resulted in diminishment of intraventricular dyssynchrony, what appeared as lowering of the degree of heterogeneity of electromechanical intervals and was associated with significant augmentation of left ventricular stroke volume. Presence of pronounced intraventricular asynchrony might be an additional indication to radiofrequency ablation of accessory atrio-ventricular pathways in patients with WPW syndrome without history of documented attacks of tachycardia.",

    "abstract": "Disrupted iron metabolism and excess iron accumulation has been reported in the brains of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Because excessive iron can induce oxidative stress subsequently causing degradation of nigral dopaminergic neurons in PD, we determined the protective effect of a naturally occurring iron chelator, phytic acid (IP6), on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced cell death in immortalized rat mesencephalic/dopaminergic cells. Cell death was induced with MPP(+) in normal and iron-excess conditions and cytotoxicity was measured by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT assay) and trypan blue staining. Apoptotic cell death was also measured with caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation, and Hoechst nuclear staining. Compared to MPP(+) treatment, IP6 (30 micromol/L) increased cell viability by 19% (P<0.05) and decreased cell death by 22% (P<0.05). A threefold increase in caspase-3 activity (P<0.001) and a twofold increase in DNA fragmentation (P<0.05) with MPP(+) treatment was decreased by 55% (P<0.01) and 52% (P<0.05), respectively with IP6. Cell survival was increased by 18% (P<0.05) and 42% (P<0.001) with 30 and 100 micromol/L of IP6, respectively in iron-excess conditions. A 40% and 52% (P<0.001) protection was observed in caspase-3 activity with 30 and 100 micromol/L IP6, respectively in iron-excess condition. Similarly, a 45% reduction (P<0.001) in DNA fragmentation was found with 100 micromol/L IP6. In addition, Hoechst nuclear staining results confirmed the protective effect of IP6 against apoptosis. Similar protection was also observed with the differentiated cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate a significant neuroprotective effect of phytate in a cell culture model of PD.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial function is necessary to supply the energy required for cell metabolism. Mutations/polymorphisms in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). The mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) controls the transcription of mtDNA and regulates the mtDNA-copy number, thus being important for maintaining ATP production. TFAM dysfunction may also be involved in PD, and TFAM gene mutations/polymorphisms could contribute to the risk of developing PD. We searched for gene variants in the seven TFAM-exons in a total of 250 PD-patients. We found five common polymorphisms, and only one was a missense change (S12T in exon 1). Genotype and allele frequencies did not differ between patients and healthy controls (n=225) for the five polymorphisms. Our work suggests that TFAM-variants did not contribute to the risk of developing PD.",

    "abstract": "In this study, adults with Parkinson's disease (PD) used virtual cueing spectacles (VCS) mimicking kinesia paradoxa in home and community settings to assess the impact on mobility and participation. We used an ABA single-subject design with repeated measures. Six adults with PD, akinesia, and stage III or IV Hoehn and Yahr rating scale status used VCS in their homes and communities for a week or more. Our main outcome measures included participant counts of losses of balance and freezes, pre-/postintervention completion of the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, observation of baseline and intervention gait, and an interview regarding user satisfaction with VCS. We also assessed participants' preuse baseline and return to baseline. Use of VCS decreased length of freezes as well as number of freezes for some participants. All participants expressed satisfaction with VCS. VCS shows promise in simulating kinesia paradoxa to improve the gait of some adults with PD in the home and community.",

    "abstract": "The reaction times and kinematics of reach and grasp were analyzed for eight subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) and eight healthy subjects during three variations of a maximal speed prehension task: (a) grasping a stationary ball as fast as possible, (b) grasping a stationary ball within specific time constraints (520 ms and 450 ms), and (c) grasping a moving ball within the same time constraints. Subjects with PD exhibited bradykinesia when reaching for a stationary ball. When reaching for a moving or stationary ball with temporal constraints, subjects with PD moved as fast as healthy subjects. The reaction times of both groups were shorter when reaching to a moving ball than to a stationary ball, regardless of the time constraint. Subjects with PD had a slower velocity of hand opening and closing, a smaller maximal aperture, and a longer time to maximal aperture than healthy subjects in all task conditions. Thus, visual motion cues and external temporal constraints had a greater effect on reach than on grasp. The results suggest that the bradykinesia observed in individuals with PD during self-determined maximal speed prehension may reflect a strategy used to compensate for deficiencies in the grasp component of the task.",

    "abstract": "Patients with medically refractory Parkinson's disease (PD) obtain significant clinical benefit from subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation. The degree to which a successful outcome relates to the anatomic location of the stimulating electrode has not yet been clearly established. Many studies have attempted to correlate the clinical result with the electrode location using postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and there have been a few that used autopsy-determined locations. In this report, we describe long-term clinical follow-up in a patient with autopsy-determined electrode tip anatomic location.\nA 67-year-old patient with a 27-year history of idiopathic PD complicated by disabling motor fluctuations and dopaminergic dyskinesias underwent bilateral STN deep brain stimulation (DBS). He was prospectively followed in a long-term clinical protocol until his death 40 months after electrode placement. Postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and postmortem studies of this patient's brain were performed to localize DBS tip locations.\nSTN stimulation produced improvement of the patient's motor fluctuations, dyskinesias and clinical motor performance, especially appendicular tremors, rigidity and bradykinesia. MRI showed the electrode tips to be within 2 mm of the intended target. Postmortem brain analysis identified the right DBS tip location at the dorsomedial edge of the STN, with the left electrode in the vicinity (but not within) the STN. Chronic DBS elicited minor reactive changes were confined to the immediate vicinity of the electrode tracks. The pathological analysis demonstrated numerous cortical Lewy bodies and degenerative encephalopathy, establishing the diagnosis of transitional type diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) rather than simple PD.\nThis patient obtained clinical benefit from STN stimulation typical of that seen for most PD patients. Both the MR analysis and the autopsy demonstrated electrode placement at or outside the boundaries of the STN, suggesting that that clinical efficacy may not depend on electrode location within the central region of the STN.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been linked to dopaminergic neuron degeneration in Parkinson disease. We have previously shown that dopamine oxidation leads to selective dopaminergic terminal degeneration in vivo and alters mitochondrial function in vitro. In this study, we utilized 2-D difference in-gel electrophoresis to assess changes in the mitochondrial proteome following in vitro exposure to reactive dopamine quinone. A subset of proteins exhibit decreased fluorescence labeling following dopamine oxidation, suggesting a rapid loss of specific proteins. Amongst these proteins are mitochondrial creatine kinase, mitofilin, mortalin, the 75 kDa subunit of NADH dehydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase 2. Western blot analyses for mitochondrial creatine kinase and mitofilin confirmed significant losses in isolated brain mitochondria exposed to dopamine quinone and PC12 cells exposed to dopamine. These results suggest that specific mitochondrial proteins are uniquely susceptible to changes in abundance following dopamine oxidation, and carry implications for mitochondrial stability in Parkinson disease neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "The early motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD) reflect degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons projecting to the caudal putamen. However, extrastriatal dopamine and other monoamine systems are also involved, particularly in later disease. We used (18)F-dopa PET in a cross-sectional study to characterize extrastriatal monoamine neuronal dysfunction in PD. 16 Controls and 41 patients underwent investigation. We found that (18)F-dopa uptake was decreased in cortical motor areas, particularly the motor cortex, even in early disease. Frontal association areas were also affected in later disease but limbic areas were spared except for hypothalamus. The substantia nigra, midbrain raphe and locus coeruleus showed normal or increased (18)F-dopa uptake until PD was advanced, indicating compensatory responses in intact monoamine neuron perikarya. The red nucleus, subthalamus, ventral thalamus and pineal gland were also eventually involved. These findings provide a further basis for understanding the complex pathophysiology of PD in vivo and complement pathological studies.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal death is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). This occurs over years, not the minutes of classically defined apoptosis, and neurons show both responses of apoptosis and regeneration, evidenced by accumulated oxidative insult and attempts at cell cycle re-entry. There is recent evidence suggesting that several known gene mutations in causing familial AD (amyloid beta protein precursor, presenilin-1, or presenilin-2 gene) and familial PD (Parkin, PINK-1, or DJ-1 gene) are associated with increased oxidative stress. Also, several known genetic (e.g. Apolipoprotein Eepsilon4 variant) and environmental (e.g. metals or pesticides exposure) risk factors of sporadic AD and/or PD are associated with increased oxidative stress. In concord, patients at the preclinical stages of AD and PD as well as cellular and animal models of the diseases provide consistent evidence that oxidative insult is a significant early event in the pathological cascade of AD and PD. In contrast to the general aspects of the pathological hallmarks, aggregation of the disease-specific proteins such as amyloid-beta, tau, and alpha-synuclein may act as a compensatory (survival) response against the oxidative insult via the mechanism that the disease-specific structures sequester redox-active metals. Expanding knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of organism longevity indicates that pro-longevity gene products such as forkhead transcription factors and sirtuins are involved in the insulin-like signaling pathway and oxidative stress resistance against aging. An enhancement of the pro-longevity signaling (e.g. caloric restriction) may be a promising approach as anti-oxidative strategy against age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia have been associated with temporal processing in ranges of milliseconds and seconds. However, results from PD patient studies are elusive. Time perception in these patients has been tested with different approaches including repetitive movement tasks (i.e. finger tapping) and cognitive tasks (i.e. time reproduction), and both abnormal and normal performances have been reported for different time intervals. Furthermore, when PD patients were required to learn two target durations in the same session when they were off medication, they overestimated the short duration and underestimated the long duration in the seconds range. This pattern of temporal accuracy was described as a \"migration effect\" and was interpreted as a dysfunctional representation of memory for time (Malapani, C., Rakitin, B. C., Levy, R., Meck, W. H., Deweer, B., Dubois, B., et al. (1998). Coupled temporal memories in Parkinson's disease: A dopamine-related dysfunction. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 10, 316-331). Here, we controlled the emergence of similar behaviour also during millisecond time processing in PD patients. A time reproduction task was employed in which subjects were required to estimate intervals in millisecond (500ms) and few second (2000ms) ranges. In the first experiment, these intervals were tested in the same session to verify whether the migration effect was present also between time intervals in different millisecond and few second ranges. In a second experiment, they were not intermingled but were tested in two separate sessions to verify whether abnormalities depended on a selective perceptual deficit of the time intervals tested (i.e. millisecond or second ranges). All experiments were performed in both off and on therapy conditions. Our results demonstrated that PD patients showed no deficits in time estimation for time intervals in either the millisecond or few second range when the different time intervals were tested in separate sessions. This negative finding was obtained in both on and off conditions. However, when the different ranges were tested in the same session, we found that PD patients were impaired selectively for time intervals in the seconds range. Our data seem to indicate that time processing in PD patients for time intervals spanning up to 2s is unimpaired and that abnormalities in such temporal scale may emerge only when patients have to deal with different durations, when timing involves further cognitive processes such as memory and attention.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder among elderly people. 5-10% of PD cases are familial and presumably hereditary forms. Based on the genes responsible for familial PD, genetic PD animal models were produced and provided invaluable information as to the pathogenetic mechanisms of PD. Missense mutations or gene multiplications of alpha-synuclein lead to autosomal dominant form of familial PD termed PARK1 or PARK4, respectively. Transgenic (Tg) mice expressing mutant of wild-type alpha-synuclein replicated main clinical features of PD including Lewy body-like aggregate formation. Inactivation of Parkin E3 enzyme leads to autosomal recessive form of PD without Lewy body formation. We have identified Pael-R as a substrate of Parkin. Accumulation of Pael-R induced by Parkin deletion evokes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, resulting in cell death in cultured cells, Pael-R Tg Drosophila and Parkin-knockout crossed with Pael-R Tg mice. Recently Parkin-deficient and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)-deficient flies showed almost identical phenotype: muscle and sperm degeneration accompanied by mitochondrial abnormalities. PINK1 is the gene for PARK6, an autosomal recessive PD. Interestingly, overexpression of Parkin rescued the phenotype of PINK1-deleted fly and Parkin/PINK1 double knockout Drosophila did not aggravated the phenotype of either Parkin or PINK1 single knockouts, indicating that Parkin and PINK1 are located in the common signaling pathway, in which Parkin works downstream of PINK1. Further studies on familial PD animal models will elucidate the roles and relationships of ubiquitin-proteasome system, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in the pathogenesis of PD.",

In addition, PD is characterized by the appearance of Lewy bodies in the remaining neurons. The exact etiology for this disease is still unknown. However, genetic-environmental interaction could contribute the pathomechanisms of PD. Indeed, totally seven causative genes responsible for familial PD have been identified. Since discovery of familial PD (FPD), genetic PD models have been developed.

    "abstract": "The existence of endogenous progenitor cells in the adult mammalian brain presents an exciting and attractive alternative to existing therapeutic options for treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, prior to designing endogenous cell therapies, the effect of PD neuropathology on endogenous progenitor cell proliferation and their neurogenic potential must be investigated. This study examined the effect of dopaminergic cell loss on the proliferation and differentiation of subventricular zone- (SVZ) and midbrain-derived progenitor cells in the adult rodent brain, using the partial progressive 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion model of PD. Cell proliferation and differentiation were assessed with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and immunohistochemistry for cell type-specific markers. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry demonstrated a complete loss of nigrostriatal projections in the striatum and a subsequent progressive loss of dopamine (DA) cells in the SN. Quantification indicated that 6-OHDA lesion-induced cell degeneration produced a significant increase in BrdU immunoreactivity in the SVZ, ipsilateral to the lesioned hemisphere from 3 to 21 days post-lesion, compared with sham-lesioned animals. Similarly, in the striatum we observed a significant increase in the total number of BrdU positive cells in 6-OHDA-lesioned animals at all time points examined. More importantly, a significant increase in midbrain-derived BrdU positive cells was demonstrated in 6-OHDA-lesioned animals 28 days post-lesion. While we did not detect neurogenesis, BrdU labeled cells co-expressing the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were widely distributed throughout the 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum at all time points. In contrast, BrdU-labeled cells in the SN of 6-OHDA-lesioned animals did not co-express neural markers. These results demonstrate that DA-ergic neurodegeneration in the partial progressive 6-OHDA-lesioned rat brain increases SVZ- and midbrain-derived progenitor cell proliferation. While, newborn striatal progenitors undergo robust astrogenesis, newborn midbrain-derived progenitors remain in an undifferentiated state suggesting local environments differentially regulate endogenous progenitor cell populations in PD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are known as a common cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) among patients from different geographic origins. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of LRRK2 mutations in exons 31 and 41 in a cohort of 154 consecutive, unrelated Brazilian patients with familial or sporadic PD, including early and late onset patients. The LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation was present in heterozygous state in three index cases (approximately 2%), and in three additional relatives. No carriers of this mutation were found among 250 control chromosomes. Clinically, all mutation-positive patients presented a typical PD phenotype and a good response to levodopa. Mutation segregation analysis in a large sibling showed incomplete penetrance of the p.G2019S. Our findings suggest that the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation has a substantial contribution to PD susceptibility among Brazilian population and add new clues to current research of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that caffeine, one of the major components of coffee, has a protective effect against developing PD. However, the detailed mechanisms of how caffeine suppresses neuronal death have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the cytoprotective mechanisms of caffeine using human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells as a PD model. Caffeine prevented the apoptotic cell death induced by serum/retinoic acid (RA) deprivation, MPP+, rotenone, and 6-OHDA in SH-SY5Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Caffeine lowered caspase-3 activity induced by serum/RA deprivation and 6-OHDA administration, and also decreased the number of apoptotic condensed and/or fragmented nuclei. Akt was phosphorylated 60 min after caffeine administration in a dose dependent manner; PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002 canceled this cytoprotective effect of caffeine. On the other hand, MAPKs such as Erk1/2, p38, or JNK were not activated by caffeine. These results suggest that caffeine has a cytoprotective effect due to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathways in SH-SY5Y cells.",

    "abstract": "Ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release is a new once-daily formulation of ropinirole that provides continuous delivery of ropinirole over 24 hours.\nThe studies described here were conducted to characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nStudy 164 was a 2-part study; Part A employed a crossover design to assess the relative bioavailability of steady-state ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release 8 mg QD and ropinirole immediate release 2.5 mg TID, and Part B evaluated the effect of food intake on the rate and extent of ropinirole absorption from ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release 8 mg QD. Study 165 assessed the dose proportionality of ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release 2-, 4-, and 8-mg tablets and the dose-strength equivalence of four 2-mg tablets compared with one 8-mg tablet. Intensive pharmacokinetic blood sampling was performed over 24 hours. Steady-state C(max), C(min), AUC from time zero to 24 hours after dosing (AUC(0-24)), and T(max) were determined by noncompartmental methods.\nTwenty-three patients (91% white; mean age, 67 years [range, 34-80 years] mean weight, 84.5 kg [range, 57-103 kg]) were randomized to treatment in Study 164. Twenty-eight patients (86% white; mean age, 67 years [range, 47-87 years] mean weight, 84.6 kg [range, 49-128 kg]) were randomized to treatment in Study 165. Compared with ropinirole immediate release, ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release had a smooth plasma concentration-time profile over 24 hours. AUC(0-24) and C(min) values, normalized to a 1-mg dose, were similar for ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release and ropinirole immediate release. Dose-normalized C(max) was slightly lower (approximately 12%) for ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release than for ropinirole immediate release. The AUC(0-24) and C(min) were similar in the fed and fasted states. The pharmacokinetics of ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release were dose proportional, as indicated by the estimated slopes for AUC(0-24) and C(max) being close to unity, along with the 90% CIs being contained within the predefined dose-range-adjusted limits. For C(min), the slope was close to unity (1.04), but the upper end of the 90% CI fell marginally outside the predefined range. Statistical analysis indicated that the dose strengths were equivalent when a single pharmacokinetic outlier was excluded from the analysis.\nRopinirole 24-hour prolonged release provided continuous delivery of ropinirole over 24 hours, resulting in a smooth plasma concentration-time profile, and food had no significant effect on absorption. Dose-normalized AUC(0-24) and C(min) were similar for both formulations, and dose-normalized C(max) was slightly lower for ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release. These relative bioavailability data indicated that patients may switch overnight from ropinirole immediate release to ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release while maintaining similar daily exposure. The pharmacokinetics of ropinirole were dose proportional over the range from 2 to 8 mg. The dose strengths of four 2-mg tablets and one 8-mg tablet of ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release were found to be equivalent.",

    "abstract": "The cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been widely investigated with particular reference to abnormalities of steady-state walking. The great majority of studies, however are related to severe forms of PD patients (phases > = 3 of Hoehn and Yahr scale), where locomotor abnormalities are clearly manifested. Goal of the present study was to quantitatively describe locomotor symptoms in subjects with mild PD. Accordingly, a multitask protocol involving instrumental analysis of steady-state linear walking, initiation of gait, and turning while walking was applied to a group of patients with idiopathic PD in their early clinical stage (phases 1 and 2 of Hoehn and Yahr scale), as well as in age-matched elderly controls. Kinematic, kinetic, and myoelectric measures were obtained by optoelectronic motion analysis, force platform, and telemetric electromyography. Results in PD patients showed a tendency to bradykinetic gait, with reduction of walking speed and cadence. Impairments of gait initiation consisted in reduction of the backward shift of the center of pressure (CoP) and prolongation of the stepping phase. Alterations of the turning task were more consistent and included delayed reorientation of the head toward the new direction, altered head-upper trunk rotational strategy, and adoption of a greater number of steps to complete the turning. It is concluded that patients in the early stage of PD reveal mild alterations of steady-state linear walking and more significant anomalies in the transitional conditions, especially during changes in the travel direction. Quantitative analysis of nonstationary locomotor tasks might be a potentially useful starting point for further studies on the pathophysiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "Sporadic Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are late-onset neurodegenerative diseases with tremendous impact on lives of affected individuals. There is a great probability of developing concurrent Parkinsonism in AD and vice-versa than would be predicted by independent prevalence of each disease. We hypothesize that in sporadic AD as well as PD a combination of environmental effects and gene expression may affect specific brain areas leading to neurodegeneration. We profiled gene expression of AD compared to PD and age matched controls post-mortem in the hippocampus, the gyrus-frontalis-medius (Gfm) and the cerebellum using Gene-Chip microarray (Affymetrix) and quantitative-real-time-RT-PCR. Twelve genes altered in similar manner in AD and PD, while four genes showed differential expression profiles between AD and PD in different brain regions (cannabinoid-receptor-2, Histone-cluster-1-H3e, nicotinic-cholinergic-receptor-alpha6 and beta-site-APP-cleaving enzyme-1). Knowledge of selective gene expression profile can lead to better understanding of disease pathology and development of specific diagnosis and effective therapy.",

    "abstract": "The neuroinflammatory reaction has been linked with Parkinson's disease. One of the hypotheses to explain the significance of age and gender (male predominance) effects on neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease may result from a link between these risk factors and the inflammatory processes. Here, we investigated the expression of inflammatory mediators in relation to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropiridine (MPTP)-induced neurodegenerative processes in nigrostriatal pathway in young and aged male and female mice.\nWe simultaneously assessed striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein concentrations (Western blotting) and cytokine (TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TGFbeta(1)) mRNA levels (RT-PCR) in young and aged (2- and 12-month-old) C57BL/6 male and female mice after 6 h, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 days after MPTP intoxication. Western blotting analysis showed that at the early time points, males showed a greater reduction in striatal TH versus females. Additionally, in contrast to the aged mice, in young males and females the TH concentration gradually increased between the 7th and the 21st day after intoxication. The increases in TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IFNgamma after intoxication were faster in both young and aged males than females. In males (both ages), we observed an increase in TGFbeta(1) at the early time points. In contrast, in females (both ages) TGFbeta(1) was elevated at later time points. MPTP caused an increase in IL-6 in males and females, but this increase was significantly higher in females.\nA gender and age skewing of the cytokine gene expression in the striatum after intoxication may be related to the greater susceptibility in males as well as older animals to the detrimental effects of MPTP.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein has been implicated in Parkinson disease, yet the mechanism by which alpha-synuclein causes cell injury is not understood. Using a transgenic mouse model, we evaluated the effect of alpha-synuclein overexpression on gene expression in the substantia nigra. Nigral mRNA from wild type and alpha-synuclein transgenic mice was analyzed using Affymetrix gene arrays. At 3 months, before pathological changes are apparent, we observed modest alterations in gene expression. However, nearly 200 genes were altered in expression at 9 months, when degenerative changes are more apparent. Functional genomic analysis revealed that the genes altered at 9 months were predominantly involved in gene transcription. As in human Parkinson disease, gene expression changes in the transgenic model were also modulated by gender. These data demonstrate that alterations of gene expression are widespread in this animal model, and suggest that transcriptional dysregulation may be a disease mechanism that can be targeted therapeutically.",

A cross-sectional survey of 28 patients who attended a Movement Disorders Clinic for treatment of PD was used. FRAQ is a 28-item self-administered survey that assesses the knowledge and perception of risk factors for falling. Demographic, medical, and medication data were gathered from both the participants and clinic charts. Twenty-three (82%) of the participants reported falls in the past; seven (30%) had fallen within the past month. Nineteen (68%) of the participants felt they were at risk for further falls. When asked to list potential risk factors for falling, only 14% could identify medication as a risk factor. Persons with PD are at substantial risk of falling, yet many appear to be unaware of common risk factors, especially medication use.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. The heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) reduces protein misfolding and aggregation. It has been shown to protect cells against oxidative stress and apoptotic stimuli in various neurodegenerative disease models. To deliver Hsp70 across cellular membranes and into the brain, we linked it to a cell-penetrating peptide derived from the HIV trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein. In vitro, Tat-Hsp70 transduced neuroblastoma cells and protected primary mesencephalic DA neurons and their neurites against MPP+-mediated degeneration. In vivo, the systemic application of cell-permeable Hsp70 protected DA neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta against subacute toxicity of MPTP. Furthermore, Tat-Hsp70 diminished the MPTP induced decrease in DA striatal fiber density. Thus, we demonstrate that systemically applied Tat-Hsp70 effectively prevents neuronal cell death in in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease. The use of Tat-fusion proteins might therefore be a valuable tool to deliver molecular chaperones like Hsp70 into the brain and may be the starting point for new protective strategies in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "It is still debated to what extent intraoperative electrophysiological techniques contribute to the outcome of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS). Intraoperative electrophysiological recordings for identification of the STN can be made with one electrode or with multiple, simultaneously implanted electrodes. The latter provide more detailed information about the electrophysiological boundaries of the STN; however, implantation of several electrodes at one time might increase the risk of bleeding. Here we report the results of a study of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, in which one group of patients underwent bilateral STN DBS with electrophysiological recordings from a single electrode, and the other group received STN DBS with multiple (five or fewer) simultaneously implanted electrodes.\nFifty-five patients suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease who underwent bilateral STN stimulation were included in this study. Thirty-two patients underwent STN DBS guided by a single semi-microelectrode, and 23 patients underwent STN DBS guided with simultaneously implanted multiple microelectrodes. All patients were examined preoperatively and 3 and 12 months postoperatively with regard to activities of daily living, motor functions, and neuropsychological functions.\nWe found that the simultaneous implantation of multiple electrodes does not increase the risk of bleeding or any other major intracranial complication. The use of multiple electrodes resulted in better motor results when compared with patients who underwent STN DBS guided with a single recording electrode. There were significantly more improvements in patients' tremor and rigidity, and as a consequence, a better total Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Part III score was identified during the medication-off phase. Despite better motor effects, patients treated with multiple electrodes showed subtle deterioration in neuropsychological functions, particularly in memory function.\nSTN DBS performed with multiple electrophysiological recording electrodes resulted in better motor outcome but induced specific mild declines in neuropsychological functions.",

    "abstract": "The development of treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been one of the most notable successes of neurology. Dopaminergic therapies in the form of levodopa, dopamine agonists, or monoamine oxidase B inhibitors significantly improve the characteristic motor symptoms of bradykinesia and rigidity, with a beneficial effect upon tremor in a proportion of patients. Novel delivery of dopaminergic drugs whether in the form of once a day sustained release preparations or transdermal applications ensures that they remain at the forefront of PD treatment. The development of drugs to slow the progression of PD has attracted considerable attention and there appears to be some measure of success although additional studies need to be performed. A range of nondopaminergic drugs including alpha 2-adrenergic antagonists, serotoninergics, and adenosine A2a antagonists are in late-stage development for PD and offer benefit for motor symptoms and motor complications.",

    "abstract": "After several years of smooth and stable response to levodopa, many patients develop motor fluctuations manifested by \"on\" and \"off\" phases. There are various subtypes of motor fluctuations that have different underlying mechanisms and therapeutical strategies. The \"wearing off\" phenomenon may be mainly due to the loss of stratial dopamine storage capacity and short levodopa half-life. The \"delayed on\" and \"no-on\" phenomena may be due to impaired absorption of oral levodopa. Management include various combined approaches, such as administration of small multiple daily doses of levodopa, controlled release, dispersible and soluble levodopa formulations, oral dermal- patch and subcutaneous dopamine agonists, MAO-B and COMT inhibitors, and surgical approaches, i.e., subthalamic deep brain stimulation. Future strategies may include gene therapy (e.g., intrastriatal GDNF) or transplantation of stem cells that can either produce and release dopamine or generate trophical factors.",

Autonomic and cognitive dysfunction are among the most prevalent of these nonmotor aspects of the disease. Although exact clinico-pathological correlations have not been established, alpha-synuclein pathology with Lewy body formation in the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system as well as in neocortical areas are generally believed to be driving factors for autonomic failure and cognitive decline in PD. Recent pathological and clinical studies have suggested greater prevalence of clinical dysautonomia and cardiac sympathetic denervation in PD dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies as compared with PD without dementia. This raises the possibility that spread of synuclein pathology to involve neocortical areas producing cognitive decline could be somehow linked to involvement of the autonomic nervous system in PD.",

Some sleep disorders, in particular REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) may arise as a primary manifestation of PD, reflecting the anatomic areas affected by the neurodegenerative process.

    "abstract": "Impairment in different cognitive domains such as executive functions, language, memory, and visuospatial skills occurs frequently in Parkinson disease (PD) even in the early stages of the disease. Although frank dementia (Parkinson disease dementia, PDD) is less frequent, risk for developing dementia is two to six times greater than the prevalence rate in general population and it increases in relation to disease duration. Clinically, dementia in PD is characterized by uninsidious onset and slowly progressive cognitive decline, with a predominant dysexecutive syndrome accompanied frequently by a variety of behavioral symptoms such as hallucinations, depression, anxiety, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Although the exact pathophysiology and neurobiological basis of PDD is not known, dementia in PD probably develops as a result of progressive involvement of subcortical and cortical structures by Lewy-type pathology and associated Alzheimer-like histological changes. Dysfunction of different monoamine transmitter has also been implicated in the cognitive deterioration of PD but reduced cholinergic activity in the cortex is thought to account for the strongest mechanism in the development of dementia. Recent evidence suggests that cholinesterase inhibitors are effective in the treatment of dementia and accompanying behavioral symptoms in PD.",

    "abstract": "It is now 30 years since the beginning of intensive efforts to understand the neurotransmitter biochemistry of dementia as exemplified by Alzheimer's disease and such studies have led to the development of rational treatment strategies, which are continuing to benefit patients. However, as studies became more sophisticated and clinicians rediscovered an interest in dementia, because of the potential for symptomatic treatment, it has become clear that there are several different neurodegenerative conditions that gives rise to dementia syndromes and that each has distinct neurochemical pathology. This has important treatment implications since what works for one may not work for another or at the extreme, may make matters worse. Therefore it is clear that a detailed understanding of the neurotransmitter function in each condition is not merely academic but can lead to rationale drug design and treatment strategies appropriate for that group of patients. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) has clinico-pathological features, which overlap with either AD or Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as features that help to distinguish it, such as fluctuations in cognitive impairment and a higher prevalence of visual hallucinations. On this basis, it would be expected that the neurochemistry would have some similarities with both disorders.",

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, several genes for monogenic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been mapped and/or cloned. Mutations have been identified in the gene for alpha-synuclein in rare families with dominant PD, indicating that aggregation of this protein in Lewy bodies is probably a crucial step in the molecular pathogenesis of the disorder. A much more common cause for dominant PD, mutations in the gene for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), has recently been identified. Mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1 and PINK1 all cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset. These genes have been implicated in the proteasomal protein degradation pathway, in the oxidative stress response and mitochondrial function. Mutations in recessive genes probably are pathogenic through loss-of-function mechanisms, suggesting that their wildtype products protect dopaminergic cells against a variety of insults. Evidence is emerging that at least some of these genes may play a direct role in the etiology of the common sporadic form of PD. Further, it is likely that the cellular pathways identified in rare monogenic variants of the disease also shed light on the molecular pathogenesis in typical sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "A number of factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD). These include oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, excitotoxicity, and apoptosis. While the precise pathogenic mechanism leading to neurodegeneration in PD is not known, there is considerable evidence suggesting that cell death occurs by way of a signal-mediated apoptotic process. PD is also characterized by intracellular proteinaceous inclusions or Lewy bodies. Proteolytic stress arises as a consequence of the excessive production of misfolded proteins, which exceed the capacity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade them. Recent genetic and laboratory studies support the possible relevance of proteolytic stress to both familial and sporadic forms of PD. Postmortem studies have shown that in the SNc of sporadic PD patients there are reduced levels of the alpha subunit of the 20S proteasome and reduced proteolytic enzyme activities. A determination as to the precise cause of cell death in PD, and the identification of specific targets for the development of drugs that might modify disease progression is one of the most critical goals in PD research. It is anticipated that over the next few years there will be a flurry of scientific activity examining the mechanism of cell death and putative neuroprotective interventions.",

    "abstract": "James Parkinson's Essay on the Shaking Palsy published in 1817 provided the first clear clinical description for the disorder now known throughout the world by his name. His primary reason for publishing his monograph shortly before his retirement from medical practice was to draw the medical profession's attention to a malady, which had not yet been defined as a nosological entity. He also hoped that the eminent anatomists of the day would be stimulated to elucidate the pathological lesion responsible for the clinical picture and that this in turn might lead to a rational cure. The concept of Parkinson's disease remains clinically based and successive generations of neurologists have refined and embellished Parkinson's seminal descriptions. Narrative accounts by affected individuals have also helped physicians understand what it is like to live with Parkinson's disease. For many years, the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease were disputed and there were few clinico-pathological reports with adequate clinical description. However, most neurologists now link severe loss of nigral cells in the ventrolateral tier of the pars compacta of the substantia nigra with bradykinesia and the presence of Lewy bodies in a number of discrete brain stem and cortical regions with Parkinson's disease. There are many unanswered clinical questions relating to Parkinson's disease including the striking heterogeneity and frequent limb asymmetry. It also remains somewhat uncertain whether Parkinson's disease is ever truly unilateral by the time of clinical presentation and whether the hand rather than the foot is the most common site of onset. Hyposmia and visual hallucinations are helpful pointers in distinguishing Parkinson's disease from atypical Parkinsonism and should be specifically enquired about in the history. Simple reliable cultural-specific smell identification batteries are an urgent need and target of clinical research. It remains to be determined whether Alzheimer type dementia as opposed to a dysexecutive syndrome should be considered a part of Parkinson's disease and further detailed clinico-pathological correlative studies are needed. It is also unclear whether autosomal dominant monogenetic Parkinsonism due to synuclein or LRRK-2 mutations will prove to be identical clinically with Parkinson's disease and for the present it is wiser to regard Parkinson's disease as a sporadic disorder. Parkinson was an active political reformer and if alive today would certainly be campaigning to translate more effectively the rich seam of neuroscientific research of the last decade into therapeutic benefits for the rising number of people who are developing the shaking palsy as a result of increasing longevity in the developed world.",

    "abstract": "Improving economy and health in developing countries like India, has increased the life span and changed the emphasis from communicable to noncommunicable diseases. This is likely to increase the prevalence of movement disorders and, age-related diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD). We review Indian epidemiological studies to describe: a) Prevalence of movement disorders, b) methodological issues and c) potential of epidemiological research in a country with multiple ethnic races and environmental risks for PD. Most Indian epidemiological studies do not specifically assess PD and figures are from studies evaluating all neurological diseases. Well-designed Indian studies on PD and essential tremors estimate prevalence rates in Parsis who are ethnically different from Indians. We compare Indian prevalence studies with other parts of the world to examine the role of ethnicity in PD. Lack of accurate epidemiological data on PD and movement disorders creates an urgent need for properly designed and conducted epidemiological studies in India. This will help find out their load, identify areas of focus, create public health policies for elderly Indians and, possibly, provide etiological clues to the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that dance, specifically tango, may be an appropriate and effective strategy for ameliorating functional mobility deficits in people who are frail and elderly. Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience declines in functional mobility that may be even more pronounced than those experienced by frail elderly individuals without PD. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two movement programs: tango classes or exercise classes. Nineteen subjects with PD were randomly assigned to a tango group or a group exercise class representative of the current classes offered in our geographical area for individuals with PD. Subjects completed a total of 20 tango or exercise classes and were evaluated the week before and the week following the intervention. Both groups showed significant improvements in overall Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score and nonsignificant improvements in self-reported Freezing of Gait. In addition, the tango group showed significant improvements on the Berg Balance Scale. The exercise group did not improve on this measure. Finally, the tango group showed a trend toward improvement on the Timed Up and Go test that was not observed in the exercise group. Future studies with a larger sample are needed to confirm and extend our observation that tango may be an effective intervention to target functional mobility deficits in individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress has been implicated in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. An important biochemical feature of presymptomatic PD is a significant depletion of the thiol antioxidant glutathione (GSH) in these neurons resulting in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately cell death. We have earlier demonstrated that curcumin, a natural polyphenol obtained from turmeric, protects against peroxynitrite-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction both in vitro and in vivo. Here we report that treatment of dopaminergic neuronal cells and mice with curcumin restores depletion of GSH levels, protects against protein oxidation, and preserves mitochondrial complex I activity which normally is impaired due to GSH loss. Using systems biology and dynamic modeling we have explained the mechanism of curcumin action in a model of mitochondrial dysfunction linked to GSH metabolism that corroborates the major findings of our experimental work. These data suggest that curcumin has potential therapeutic value for neurodegenerative diseases involving GSH depletion-mediated oxidative stress.",

We find that the fluctuations in the gait timing are significantly larger for PD patients and early PD patients, who were not treated yet with medication, compared to age-matched healthy controls. Simultaneously, the long-term correlations and the phase synchronization of right and left leg are significantly reduced in both types of PD patients. Surprisingly, long-term correlations of the gait force profiles are relatively weak for treated PD patients and healthy controls, while they are significantly larger for early PD patients.

    "abstract": "alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn), a protein of unknown function, is the most abundant protein in Lewy bodies, the histological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). In yeast alpha-syn inhibits endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi (ER-->Golgi) vesicle trafficking, which is rescued by overexpression of a Rab GTPase that regulates ER-->Golgi trafficking. The homologous Rab1 rescues alpha-syn toxicity in dopaminergic neuronal models of PD. Here we investigate this conserved feature of alpha-syn pathobiology. In a cell-free system with purified transport factors alpha-syn inhibited ER-->Golgi trafficking in an alpha-syn dose-dependent manner. Vesicles budded efficiently from the ER, but their docking or fusion to Golgi membranes was inhibited. Thus, the in vivo trafficking problem is due to a direct effect of alpha-syn on the transport machinery. By ultrastructural analysis the earliest in vivo defect was an accumulation of morphologically undocked vesicles, starting near the plasma membrane and growing into massive intracellular vesicular clusters in a dose-dependent manner. By immunofluorescence/immunoelectron microscopy, these clusters were associated both with alpha-syn and with diverse vesicle markers, suggesting that alpha-syn can impair multiple trafficking steps. Other Rabs did not ameliorate alpha-syn toxicity in yeast, but RAB3A, which is highly expressed in neurons and localized to presynaptic termini, and RAB8A, which is localized to post-Golgi vesicles, suppressed toxicity in neuronal models of PD. Thus, alpha-syn causes general defects in vesicle trafficking, to which dopaminergic neurons are especially sensitive.",

    "abstract": "DJ-1 was initially identified by us as a novel oncogene and has later been found to be a causative gene for familial Parkinson's disease PARK7. DJ-1 plays role in transcriptional regulation and in oxidative stress function, and loss of its function is thought to be related to onset age, mode of progression and clinical severity of both familial and sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). DJ-1 is localized both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and it has been reported to be secreted into the serum or plasma of patients with breast cancer, melanoma, familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy and stroke. In this study, levels of DJ-1 secreted into the serum of healthy controls and patients with sporadic PD were examined by using a DJ-1 ELISA kit, and the level of oxidative stress in the serum was also measured. The results showed that DJ-1 was secreted into the serum of both healthy controls and PD patients. There was no significant difference between the levels of secreted DJ-1 in two groups, and correlations of levels of secreted DJ-1 with age, clinical severity of PD and level of oxidative stress were not found.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine agonists used to manage Parkinsonian motor symptoms have been suggested to be neuroprotective. The study was designed to assess the neuroprotective potential of the D(3)/D(2)/D(1) dopamine receptor agonist rotigotine in the acute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease by measuring mesencephalic degenerating neurons using FluoroJade staining and the remaining dopaminergic nerve endings in the striatum using dopamine transporter binding. Continuous administration of rotigotine at a dose of 3mg/kg significantly attenuated MPTP-induced acute cell degeneration in the FluoroJade-staining paradigm. Rotigotine (0.3-3mg/kg) partially protected dopamine nerve endings from MPTP-induced degeneration in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that rotigotine, at the doses employed, significantly protected dopamine neurons from degeneration in an acute mouse model of MPTP intoxication.",

    "abstract": "Bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) can reduce working memory while improving motor function in Parkinson disease (PD), but findings are variable. One possible explanation for this variability is that the effects of bilateral STN DBS on working memory function depend in part on functional or disease asymmetry. The goal of this study was to determine the relative contributions of unilateral DBS to the effects seen with bilateral DBS. Motor (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part III, UPDRS) and working memory function (Spatial Delayed Response, SDR) were measured in 49 PD patients with bilateral STN DBS while stimulators were Both-off, Left-on, Right-on and Both-on in a randomized, double-blind manner. Patients were off PD medications overnight. Effects of unilateral DBS were compared to effects of bilateral STN DBS. Mean UPDRS and SDR responses to Left-on vs. Right-on conditions did not differ (p>.20). However, improvement in contralateral UPDRS was greater and SDR performance was more impaired by unilateral DBS in the more affected side of the brain than in the less affected side of the brain (p=.008). The effect of unilateral DBS on the more affected side on contralateral UPDRS and SDR responses was equivalent to that of bilateral DBS. These results suggest that motor and working memory function respond to unilateral STN DBS differentially depending on the asymmetry of motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the tau gene (MAPT) have been found in families with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. In addition, the MAPT H1-clade specific sub-haplotype, H1c, has been strongly associated with the tauopathies, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and, to a lesser extent, with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In Parkinson's disease (PD), there have been several reports of association with the MAPT H1-clade. Although weak to inconclusive, this association is supported by meta-analyses of the various studies. To further investigate this baffling role of MAPT in PD, six haplotype-tagging SNPs were genotyped in a large cohort of sporadic PD cases; 324 pathologically confirmed and 248 clinically diagnosed, and 660 controls. In the single-locus association analysis, the H1-clade was associated with an increased risk of PD (p=0.032). In the haplotype-analysis, the sole H2-derived haplotype was under-represented in all of the PD cases compared to controls (p=0.03). There was no significant difference in the distribution of any of the common haplotypes derived from the H1-clade background. Our study supports the hypothesis that genetic variability in the MAPT gene confers susceptibility to PD. However, the effect is not strong, and the H1c haplotype is not involved, suggesting a mechanism that is distinct to that involved in the associated tauopathies and may be explained by the H1/H2 inversion.",

    "abstract": "Chronic L-dopa treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) often leads to debilitating involuntary movements, termed L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), mediated by dopamine (DA) receptors. RGS9-2 is a GTPase accelerating protein that inhibits DA D2 receptor-activated G proteins. Herein, we assess the functional role of RGS9-2 on LID. In monkeys, Western blot analysis of striatal extracts shows that RGS9-2 levels are not altered by MPTP-induced DA denervation and/or chronic L-dopa administration. In MPTP monkeys with LID, striatal RGS9-2 overexpression--achieved by viral vector injection into the striatum--diminishes the involuntary movement intensity without lessening the anti-parkinsonian effects of the D1/D2 receptor agonist L-dopa. In contrasts, in these animals, striatal RGS9-2 overexpression diminishes both the involuntary movement intensity and the anti-parkinsonian effects of the D2/D3 receptor agonist ropinirole. In unilaterally 6-OHDA-lesioned rats with LID, we show that the time course of viral vector-mediated striatal RGS9-2 overexpression parallels the time course of improvement of L-dopa-induced involuntary movements. We also find that unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned RGS9-/- mice are more susceptible to L-dopa-induced involuntary movements than unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned RGS9+/+ mice, albeit the rotational behavior--taken as an index of the anti-parkinsonian response--is similar between the two groups of mice. Together, these findings suggest that RGS9-2 plays a pivotal role in LID pathophysiology. However, the findings also suggest that increasing RGS9-2 expression and/or function in PD patients may only be a suitable therapeutic strategy to control involuntary movements induced by nonselective DA agonist such as L-dopa.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene encoding beta-glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal degrading enzyme, have recently been associated with the development of Parkinson disease. Here we report the results found in a cohort of Portuguese Parkinson disease patients and healthy age-matched controls for mutations in the aforementioned gene. This screening was accomplished by sequencing the complete open-reading frame, as well as intron/exon boundaries, of the glucocerebrosidase gene, in a total of 230 patients and 430 controls. We have found an increased number of Parkinson disease patients presenting mutations in GBA when compared to controls. These results, together with recent literature, clearly suggest a role of glucocerebrosidase in the development of Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is an inevitable complication of the long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with levodopa. In a rat model of LID, we observed that animals of almost identical genetic but slightly different environmental backgrounds displayed a very different profile in terms of their development and severity of LID.\nWe hypothesised that this heterogeneity can be attributed to different levels of anxiety in individual animals. We evaluated the basal anxiety level of rats in this study using the elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF) test, and plasma corticosterone level. These animals then received unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway after which they were primed to develop LID. Finally, we manipulated the anxiety level of these animals by citalopram treatment over a 9-week period before they were killed.\nAlthough we could not establish an association between the anxiety level of rats with either the onset or severity of LID, our results showed that citalopram was able to mediate a partial alleviation in LID after chronic treatment, and the extent of recovery was negatively correlated to the anxiety measures of individual animals. Furthermore, this citalopram-mediated LID recovery appeared to be independent of any changes in striatal cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) system, in contrast to our previous studies with fetal ventral mesencephalon transplants. However, chronic citalopram treatment almost completely abolished the expression of serotonin receptor 1B (5HT1B) in the striatum in animals exhibiting LID recovery.\nThese results indicate a novel association of serotonin receptors in the development of LID and contributes to the evidence that the serotonergic system may play an important role in such movements.",

    "abstract": "Misfolding and abnormal aggregation of the neuronal protein alpha-synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and related neurological disorders, such as dementia with Lewy bodies. alpha-synuclein is a conventional cytosolic protein and is thought to exert its pathogenic function exclusively in the neuronal cytoplasm in a cell-autonomous manner. However, the current model is being challenged by a series of new observations that demonstrate the presence of alpha-synuclein and its aggregated forms in the extracellular fluid both in vivo and in vitro. Extracellular alpha-synuclein appears to be delivered by unconventional exocytosis of intravesicular alpha-synuclein, although the exact mechanism has not been characterized. Compared to the cytosolic alpha-synuclein, intravesicular alpha-synuclein is prone to aggregation and the potential source of extracellular aggregates. A number of tissue culture studies suggest that exposure to extracellular alpha-synuclein aggregates induces microglial activation, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from astrocytes, and neurotoxicity. Thus, exocytosis of alpha-synuclein may be an important mechanism for amplifying and spreading degenerative changes from a small group of cells to its surrounding tissues, and it potentially provides therapeutic targets for halting the progression of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Data from Asian populations on dietary and lifestyle factors associated with Parkinson's disease are sparse. In 1993-2005, the authors examined these factors in relation to Parkinson's disease in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a prospective cohort of 63,257 Chinese men and women. Baseline data were collected through in-person interviews using structured questionnaires. All 157 incident Parkinson's disease cases were identified either through follow-up interviews or via linkage with hospital discharge databases and Parkinson's disease outpatient registries and were confirmed by review of medical records. Current versus never smokers exhibited a reduced risk of Parkinson's disease (relative risk = 0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.16, 0.52). Total caffeine intake was inversely related to Parkinson's disease risk (p for trend = 0.002); the relative risk for the highest versus lowest quartile was 0.55 (95% confidence interval: 0.35, 0.88). Black tea, a caffeine-containing beverage, showed an inverse association with Parkinson's disease risk that was not confounded by total caffeine intake or tobacco smoking (p for trend = 0.0006; adjusted relative risk for the highest vs. lowest tertile of intake = 0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.13, 0.67). Green tea drinking was unrelated to Parkinson's disease risk. Diet had no strong influence on risk. Ingredients of black tea other than caffeine appear to be responsible for the beverage's inverse association with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "In search for a suitable rat model to study potentially affected blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport mechanisms in the course of Parkinsons disease (PD) progression, experiments were performed to characterise Parkinsons disease markers following subcutaneous (SC) and intracerebral (IC) infusion of the toxin rotenone in the rat.\nStudies were performed using Male Lewis rats. SC infusion of rotenone (3 mg/kg/day) was performed via an osmotic minipump. IC infusion of rotenone occurred directly into the right medial forebrain bundle at three different dosages. At different times following rotenone infusion, behaviour, histopathology (tyrosine hydroxylase and alpha-synuclein immunocytochemistry), peripheral organ pathology (adrenals, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen and stomach) were assessed. In part of the SC and IC rats, BBB transport profiles of the permeability marker sodium fluorescein were determined using microdialysis.\nSC rotenone failed to produce dopaminergic lesions and led to extensive peripheral organ toxicity. BBB permeability for fluorescein following SC rotenone was changed, however due peripheral toxicity. In contrast, IC rotenone produced a progressive lesion of the nigrostrial dopaminergic pathway over 28 days with no associated peripheral toxicity. IC rotenone also exhibited a large increase in amphetamine induced rotational behaviour. In addition, a few IC rats showed alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity and aggregation. Following IC rotenone, no changes in BBB permeability were detected after 14 days.\nSC rotenone only produced peripheral toxicity. IC rotenone appeared to create a progressive lesion of the rat nigrostrial pathway, and may therefore be a more appropriate model of Parkinson's disease progression, compared with the most commonly used 6-OH-DA rat model.",

    "abstract": "The voluntary, maximum inclined posture reflects the self-perceived limits of stability. Parkinson's disease is associated with small, bradykinetic postural weight shifts while standing but it is unclear whether this is due to reduced limits of stability and/or to the selection of abnormal strategies for leaning. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Parkinson's disease and levodopa medication on voluntary limits of stability and strategies used to reach these limits.\nFourteen subjects with Parkinson's disease (OFF and ON levodopa) and 10 age-matched controls participated in the study. Functional limits of stability were quantified as the maximum center of pressure excursion during voluntary forward and backward leaning. Postural strategies to achieve functional limits of stability were assessed by (i) body segments alignment, (ii) the difference between center of pressure and center of mass in preparation for a lean, (iii) the timing and the velocity of the preparation phase.\nFunctional limits of stability were significantly smaller in subjects with Parkinson's disease compared to control subjects. Subjects with Parkinson's disease maintained their stooped posture while leaning, initiated leaning with a smaller difference between center of pressure and center of mass and had a slower leaning velocity compared to control subjects. Levodopa enlarged the limits of stability in subjects with Parkinson's disease because of an increase in maximum forward, but not backward leans, but did not significantly improve postural alignment, preparation for a leaning movement, or velocity of leaning.\nParkinson's disease reduces functional limits of stability as well as the magnitude and velocity of postural preparation during voluntary, forward and backward leaning while standing. Levodopa improves the limits of stability but not the postural strategies used to achieve the leaning.",

    "abstract": "A preceding article described the clinical features of Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D) and proposed clinical diagnostic criteria for \"probable\" and \"possible\" PD-D. The main focus of this article is to operationalize the diagnosis of PD-D and to propose practical guidelines based on a two level process depending upon the clinical scenario and the expertise of the evaluator involved in the assessment. Level I is aimed primarily at the clinician with no particular expertise in neuropsychological methods, but who requires a simple, pragmatic set of tests that are not excessively time-consuming. Level I can be used alone or in concert with Level II, which is more suitable when there is the need to specify the pattern and the severity on the dementia of PD-D for clinical monitoring, research studies or pharmacological trials. Level II tests can also be proposed when the diagnosis of PD-D remains uncertain or equivocal at the end of a Level I evaluation. Given the lack of evidence-based standards for some tests when applied in this clinical context, we have tried to make practical and unambiguous recommendations, based upon the available literature and the collective experience of the Task Force. We accept, however, that further validation of certain tests and modifications in the recommended cut off values will be required through future studies.",

    "abstract": "The protein leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a key player in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations in the LRRK2 gene account for up to 10% of all autosomal dominant forms of familiar and for approximately 1-3% of sporadic PD patients. Although the LRRK2 protein has many functional domains like a leucine-rich repeat domain, a Roc-GTPase domain, a kinase domain of the tyrosine kinase-like subfamily and multiple protein interaction domains (armadillo, ankyrin, WD40), the exact biological role of LRRK2 in the human brain is elusive. To gain more insight into the biological function of this protein, we monitored the changes in the expression profiles of SH-SY5Y cells, a dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell line, induced by a depletion of LRRK2 levels by RNA interference (RNAi) with Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. A total of 187 genes were differentially regulated by at least a 1.5-fold change with 94 transcripts being upregulated and 93 transcripts being downregulated compared to scrambled control siRNA transfected cells. Key players of the interaction networks were independently verified by qRT-PCR. The differentially expressed gene products are involved in axonal guidance, nervous system development, cell cycle, cell growth, cell differentiation, cell communication, MAPKKK cascade, and Ras protein signal transduction. Defined gene expression networks will now serve to look more closely for candidates affected by LRRK2 reduction and how they might be altered in other forms of familial or sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common known cause of late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinical and pathological studies have demonstrated that in the majority of cases LRRK2 mutations lead to PD with classical clinical and pathological features. However, in some patients the pathological features can be distinct and/or more extensive than typically seen in PD. Collectively, these findings provide important clues into the mechanisms by which LRRK2 mutations can lead to demise of dopaminergic neurons. The understanding of LRRK2 protein function and its gene regulation and the consequences of mutations are still at their infancy, but scientific findings are progressing at a rapid pace. Although more detailed information on LRRK2 is still needed in the quest for therapeutic intervention that could halt or slow the progression of disease, here we summarize the current information on the biological and pathological properties of LRRK2.",

    "abstract": "Prior to the onset of the cardinal motor features of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), other manifestations of neurodegeneration such as olfactory dysfunction are often apparent. Characterizing these potential biomarkers of preclinical PD is particularly important in identifying individuals who will go on to develop disabling symptoms, and thus be good candidates for new neuroprotective strategies. As shown by the Braak neuropathologic staging of PD, the olfactory system is among the first neuronal populations to display Lewy body pathology. Clinically, loss of smell can be easily tested in the office using several validated techniques and is often helpful to the physician in distinguishing idiopathic PD from other forms of parkinsonism. Recent findings have indicated that a decline in olfaction may be observed in selected at-risk patients, which has significant implications for identifying potential study populations. Ongoing studies of olfactory dysfunction may also reveal potential for use as a medication-independent biomarker of disease progression in addition to use as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is classically thought of as a movement disorder characterized by tremor, rigidity and postural instability. Nevertheless, there is growing recognition of prominent cognitive impairment in PD and related disorders, which is responsible for substantial disability in these patients. This review will focus on cognitive impairment associated with Lewy body pathology, including PD with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We will review the epidemiology, clinical evaluation, underlying mechanisms and treatment of cognitive impairment in these patients. Despite differences between PDD and DLB, there is clinical, neuropathological and radiological overlap between these disorders, supporting the view that they represent a spectrum of disease. These observations suggest that common targets for diagnosis and treatment of these disorders can be identified.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by reduced nigrostriatal and cortical dopaminergic influence, with changes in movement and, subsequently, behavioral and cognitive disturbances. We studied cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease by assessing a group of 30 idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients with an average age of 64.23 years (PG group) and compared our findings with those for a control group of 30 patients (CG group). All the patients were submitted to the following assessments: motor function, using the UPDRS; staging, using the Hoehn-Yahr scales (PG group only); depression, using the Montgomery-Asberg scale; attention impairment; verbal fluency (FAR and animals); cognitive function, using the Mini Mental State Examination; visuospatial and executive functions; and clock drawing. In addition to altered motor function in PD patients, we found statistically significant differences between PD patients and controls in terms of cognitive function, verbal, executive and visuospatial functions, and attention deficits. Depression was more prevalent in the PG group.",

    "abstract": "Although neural transplantation of fetal dopaminergic cells is a promising therapy for Parkinson's disease, poor transplanted cell survival limits its efficacy. In the present study it was hypothesized that the use of Poloxamer 188 (P188), a non-ionic surfactant, during cell preparation and transplantation may protect cells from associated mechanical injury and thus improve transplanted cell survival in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. Fetal rat dopaminergic tissue was dissociated in media with or without P188 and then cultured for 1 week or transplanted into the striatum of rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. Fetal dopaminergic cell survival and reinnervation of the host brain were examined using tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry and stereological quantification. The number of surviving tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells in vitro and in vivo was significantly increased by 2.2-fold by incubating fetal dopaminergic cells with P188 during tissue dissociation. Furthermore, the striatal reinnervation in parkinsonian rats that received intrastriatal transplants of P188-exposed dopaminergic cells was significantly enhanced (1.8-fold increase) compared with rats that received non-P188-treated cells. In conclusion, P188 protects fetal dopaminergic cells from mechanical injury by increasing cell survival and enhances dopaminergic fibre outgrowth into the transplanted striatum. Use of P188 may thus be an important adjunct to improve the clinical efficacy of neural transplantation for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "UCHL1 has been proposed as a candidate gene for Parkinson's disease (PD). A meta-analysis of white and Asian subjects reported an inverse association between the non-synonymous UCHL1 S18Y polymorphism and PD risk. However, this finding was not replicated in a large case-control study and updated meta-analysis restricted to white subjects. We performed a case-control study of 1757 PD patients recruited from movement disorder clinics and 2016 unrelated controls from four regions of the United States. All subjects self-reported as white. We did not observe evidence for an association between S18Y genotypes and PD (overall P-value for association: P = 0.42). After adjustment for age, sex, and recruitment region, the odds ratio for Y/S versus S/S was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.78-1.06) and for Y/Y versus S/S was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.58-1.29). We also did not observe a significant association for recessive or dominant models of inheritance, or after stratification by age at onset, age at blood draw, sex, family history of PD, or recruitment region. Our results suggest that UCHL1 S18Y is not a major susceptibility factor for PD in white populations although we cannot exclude the possibility that the S18Y variant exerts weak effects on risk, particularly in early-onset disease.",

    "abstract": "During the past decade five genes have been identified that are important in autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson disease. The identification of these genes has increased our understanding of the likely pathogenic mechanisms resulting in disease. However, mutations in these genes likely contribute to disease in fewer than 5% of all cases of Parkinson disease. Thus, researchers have continued to search for genes that may influence disease susceptibility. Molecular diagnostic testing is currently available for four of the genes mutated in Parkinson disease. Evidence for reduced penetrance, possible effects of haploinsufficiency, and the identification of nondisease causing polymorphisms within several of these genes has made genetic counseling challenging. Current recommendations are to limit molecular testing only to those individuals who are symptomatic. Furthermore, because treatment is unaltered by the presence or absence of mutations in these genes, restraint is recommended when considering the value of screening for mutations in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "The neuropsychological effects of chronic subthalamic nucleus (STN)-deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for Parkinson's disease are variable. Whether these side effects result from the target per se or current diffusion into neighboring structures is uncertain. In this study, the relationship between clinical outcomes and coordinates of active contact are analyzed and compared between patients with and without neuropsychological sequelae.\nThirty-eight Parkinsonian patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. They were followed for at least 12 months. During the follow-up period, they were divided into two groups for comparison; Group A included patients with neuropsychological side effects and Group B was composed of patients without neuropsychological side effects. The position of the active contact of the electrode was defined with postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scans according to the midcommissural line. Active contact coordinates and clinical outcomes were compared for the two groups.\nAmong the 38 Parkinsonian patients who underwent STN-DBS, eight patients who had neuropsychological side effects were assigned to Group A; the other 30 patients were assigned to Group B. In Groups A and B, the mean follow-up periods were 13.9 and 12.1 months, respectively, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score was improved by 53.4 and 45.2% (P = 0.24), respectively, and the levodopa equivalent daily dosage was decreased by 68.4 and 46.4% (P = 0.16), respectively. The mean coordinates of active contact in both Groups A and B were x = 10.1 and 10.5 mm, respectively, y = -2.8 and -3.9 mm, respectively, and z = -6.3 and -6.2 mm, respectively, relative to the midcommissural point. A significant difference was observed on the y axis (P = 0.01).\nWhen taking spatial influence into consideration, the neuropsychological effects of chronic STN-DBS were related to a significant anteriorly located active contact within the ventral STN in this preliminary study. This might suggest the existence of topography of STN in patients with Parkinson's disease concerning limbic and associative circuits.",

The early and delayed heart to mediastinum ratios were analyzed according to the dominant motor deficit (tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability), age, sex, age at onset, disease duration, and Hoehn and Yahr stage. Both ratios correlated with bradykinesia, age at disease onset, and disease duration; but not with sex, Hoehn and Yahr stage, tremor, rigidity, and postural instability.

Cellular models of Parkinson's disease were produced by administering different concentrations of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium to PC12 and SH-SY5Y cell lines. Cell apoptosis rates were analysed by flow cytometry. Annexin V was labelled with 99mTc by hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC). Cell binding studies were carried out using cellular models of Parkinson's disease. Cell uptake studies were also performed after different levels of MPP treatment, and the correlation between the degree of apoptosis and Tc-HYNIC-annexin V uptake was analysed.\nThe specific activity of 99mTc-HYNIC-annexin V was 3.7-74 x 10 Bq.mg protein. In-vitro binding of 99mTc-HYNIC-annexin V to model cells was specific, saturable and time dependent. Scatchard analysis gave a Kd of 7.16+/-1.78 nmol.l, Bmax values of 179+/-33 fmol per 10(6) cells (PC12) and 220+/-26 fmol per 10(6) cells (SHSY5Y).

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which project to the striatum. The aim of this study was to analyze in vivo and in vitro consequences of dopamine depletion on amount of metabolites in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease using proton (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The study was performed on control mice (n = 7) and MPTP-intoxicated mice (n = 7). All the experiments were performed at 9.4 T. For in vivo MRS acquisitions, mice were anesthetized and carefully placed on an animal handling system with the head centered in birdcage coil used for both excitation and signal reception. Spectra were acquired in a voxel (8 microL) centered in the striatum, applying a point-resolved spectroscopy sequence (TR = 4000 ms, TE = 8.8 ms). After in vivo MRS acquisitions, mice were killed; successful lesion verified by tyrosine hydroxylase immunolabeling on the substantia nigra pars compacta and in vitro MRS acquisitions performed on perchloric extracts of anterior part of mice brains. In vitro spectra were acquired using a standard one-pulse experiment. The absolute concentrations of metabolites were determined using jmrui (Lyon, France) from (1)H spectra obtained in vivo on striatum and in vitro on perchloric extracts. Glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and GABA concentrations obtained in vivo were significantly increased in striatum of MPTP-lesioned mice (Glu: 15.5 +/- 2.5 vs. 12.9 +/- 1.0 mmol/L, p < 0.05; Gln: 2.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.6 mmol/L, p < 0.05; GABA: 2.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.6 mmol/L, p < 0.05). The in vitro results confirmed these results, Glu (10.9 +/- 2.5 vs. 7.9 +/- 1.7 micromol/g, p < 0.05), Gln (6.8 +/- 2.9 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.0 micromol/g, p < 0.05), and GABA (2.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.4 micromol/g, p < 0.01). The present study strongly supports a hyperactivity of the glutamatergic cortico-striatal pathway hypothesis after dopaminergic denervation in association with an increase of striatal GABA levels. It further shows an increased of striatal Gln concentrations, perhaps as a strategy to protect neurons from Glu excitotoxic injury after striatal dopamine depletion.",

    "abstract": "Researchers of Internet health interventions have begun to address the problems of high attrition rates. Attrition has been a problem for psychosocial interventions for nearly 50 years. It is ubiquitous no matter what the type of intervention or the modality of delivery. Consistent are the repeated findings that demographic characteristics are the most robust variables. We tested the hypothesis that the greater the fear and apprehension experienced in professionally led Internet support groups, the more likely the participants would not complete the 25-week intervention. The sample consisted of 66 people with Parkinson's disease; each participant was assigned to one of six chat groups. To assess psychological states, we used PCAD, a text analysis program analyzing each person's postings during each chat room session. There was a statistically significant difference between those who terminated the group early and those who completed the intervention on the Anxiety-Fear dimension, F=2.35, (6,63), p=0.03. People who dropped out demonstrated higher death and shame anxiety. A number of possible designs for online groups that may reduce premature attrition are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the Impact on Participation and Autonomy (IPA) questionnaire, in its two scales: IPA-I, perceived limitations in participation and autonomy; IPA-II, perceived problems in participation.\nThe IPA data underwent Rasch analysis for rating scale diagnostics and a reliability and validity study. The work and education domain was left out of the analysis due to its low applicability to our subjects. A convenience sample of 100 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (41 male, 59 female; mean age 72+/-7 years) were consecutively observed at our Rehabilitation Clinic.\nAccording to Rasch analysis, two response categories of IPA-I were collapsed into one and 1 item (''intimate relationship'') was deleted. The remaining 24 items fitted the unidimensional construct that the scale was intended to measure. IPA-I demonstrated good reliability (person separation = 0.93, item separation = 0.97) and internal construct validity. All six IPA-II items proved to belong to the same construct. For IPA-II, item separation = 0.97, person separation = 0.71. The targeting and spread of item difficulty and the quite low person separation reliability of IPA-II made it possible only to differentiate people with low vs high level of problems in participation. Both scales showed the expected correlation with PD-specific clinical and quality of life measures.\nIPA-I shows promise as a tool for measuring participation in people with PD. IPA-II has acceptable psychometric characteristics for measuring perceived problems in participation. Additional steps to improve their metric properties and further studies in people with different kinds of health conditions need to be carried out.",

It is important for patients to have a treatment option that may provide rapid relief from \"off\" episodes. In three pivotal, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, subcutaneous apomorphine was effective in acutely treating \"off\" episodes, significantly improving Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor scores and reducing the number of \"off\" hours per day, with a significantly shorter time to patient-declared onset of relief than placebo. Thus, clinical trial data support the efficacy of intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine as a rapid acute treatment for \"off\" episodes in advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is increasingly used to treat advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). The optimal method for targeting the STN before implanting the definitive DBS electrode is still a matter of debates. Beside methods of direct visualization of the nucleus based on stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the most often used technique for targeting STN consists in recording single-cell activity along exploratory tracks of 10-15mm in length, centered on the theoretical or MRI-defined target coordinates. Single-unit recordings with a microelectrode present various drawbacks. They are time-consuming if correctly performed and a single-cell precision is probably superfluous, taking into account the size of the implanted electrode. In this study, we present an original method of recording and quantification of a multi-unit signal recorded intraoperatively with a semi-microelectrode for targeting the STN. Twelve patients with advanced PD have been included and assessed clinically before and one year after bilateral STN-DBS electrode implantation guided by multi-unit electrophysiological recordings. After one year of chronic stimulation, all patients showed a marked clinical improvement. The motor score of the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale decreased by more than 57% and the required levodopa-equivalent daily dose by 59.5% in on-stimulation off-medication condition compared to off-stimulation off-medication condition. The accuracy of STN-DBS lead placement was confirmed on postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans, which were fused to preoperative T2-weighted MRI. The boundaries of the STN were easily determined by an increase in multi-unit signal amplitude, which was observed on average from 0.492mm below the rostral border of the STN down to 0.325mm above its caudal border. Signal amplitude significantly increased at the both rostral and caudal STN margins (P<0.05) and the level of neuronal activity easily distinguished inside from outside the nucleus. This study showed that STN boundaries could be adequately determined on the basis of intraoperative multi-unit recording with a semi-microelectrode. The accuracy of our method used for positioning DBS electrodes into the STN was confirmed both on CT-MRI fusion images and on the rate of therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve occurs in both Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies and begins early in the disease progression of PD, accounting for reduced cardiac uptake of meta-iodobenzylguanidine even in the early stages of Lewy body disease (LBD). We previously demonstrated that degeneration of the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nerve precedes loss of their mother neurons in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia, suggesting distal dominant degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD. Because alpha-synuclein is one of the key molecules in the pathogenesis of this disease, we further investigated how alpha-synuclein aggregates are involved in this distal-dominant degeneration. Both cardiac tissues and paravertebral sympathetic ganglia were obtained for comparison from 20 patients with incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD), 10 with PD, 20 with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and 10 control subjects. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as a marker for sympathetic nerves, phosphorylated neurofilament as a marker for axons and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein for pathological deposits. We found that (i) alpha-synuclein aggregates in the epicardial nerve fascicles, namely the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nerve, were much more abundant in ILBD with preserved TH-ir axons than in this disease with decreased TH-ir axons and PD; (ii) alpha-synuclein aggregates in the epicardial nerve fascicles were closely related to the disappearance of TH-ir axons; (iii) in ILBD with preserved TH-ir axons, alpha-synuclein aggregates were consistently more abundant in the epicardial nerve fascicles than in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia; (iv) this distal-dominant accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates was reversed in ILBD with decreased TH-ir axons and PD, which both showed fewer of these axons but more abundant alpha-synuclein aggregates in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and (v) MSA was completely different from ILBD and PD based on the preservation of TH-ir axons and the scarcity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in either the cardiac tissues or the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia. These findings indicate that accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system precedes that of neuronal somata or neurites in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and that heralds centripetal degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD, which sharply contrasts with slight changes in MSA. This chronological and dynamic relationship between alpha-synuclein aggregates and distal-dominant degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system may represent the pathological mechanism underlying a common degenerative process in PD.",

    "abstract": "Neuroprotective therapeutics stop or slow down the degeneration process in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Neuronal survival in PD animal models is often measured by immunohistochemistry. However, dynamic changes in the pathology of the brain cannot be explored with this technique. Application of proton magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) can cover this lacuna as these techniques are non-invasive and can be repeated over time in the same animal. Therefore, the sensitivity of both techniques to measure changes in PD-pathology was explored in an experiment studying the neuroprotective effects of the vigilance enhancer modafinil in a marmoset PD model. Eleven marmoset monkeys were treated with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Six of these 11 animals, simultaneously, received a daily oral dose of modafinil (100 mg/kg) and five received vehicle for 27 days. MR experiments were performed at baseline and 1 and 3.5 weeks after the MPTP intoxication period after which brains were analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH-IR) staining of dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta confirmed that modafinil was able to partially prevent the MPTP-induced neuronal damage. In MRS, N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/phosphocreatine (tCR) ratios confirmed the protective effect indicating that this is a sensitive measure to detect neuroprotection in the MPTP marmoset model. Furthermore, the number of TH-IR positive neurons and the NAA/tCR ratio were significantly correlated to behavioral observations indicating that the changes measured in the brain are also reflected in the behavior and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is a frequent symptom in Parkinson disease (PD), but its pathogenesis remains obscure. Fatigue may be influenced by depression and motor disability, but immunological factors have been also implicated. The purpose of the study was to assess fatigue in PD patients in relation to depression and various immunological factors.\nForty PD patients and 26 normal matched controls were studied. Fatigue was assessed by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was employed for depression screening. The following immunological factors were estimated: a) T- and B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocyte subsets (helper/suppressor cells) as well as natural killer cells (NK); b) circulating levels of interleukins IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.\nFSS mean score was higher in PD patients compared to controls (p < 0.01). Significant differences between patients and controls were found in the following immunological parameters. In PD patients: a) mean percentage of NK cells was higher, p < 0.01); b) IL-1beta levels were significantly increased (p < 0.01) and IL-1Ra levels were decreased (p < 0.001). FSS correlated significantly to BDI (p < 0.008). Circulating Il-1Ra levels correlated to fatigue severity (p < 0.01), but after exclusion of depressed PD subjects this correlation significance level dropped to p = 0.055.\nOur results indicate that fatigue is a common non motor symptom in PD. Immunological differences between PD patients and controls were observed in percentages of NK cells, IL-1beta and IL-1Ra blood levels. Fatigue correlated to depression and IL-Ra levels. However after exclusion of depressed subjects IL-1Ra levels showed only a tendency to significance, leaving depression as the principle correlate of fatigue.",

The association between caffeine intake and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in fast and slow caffeine metabolizers has not been compared.\nIn a case-control study, we analyzed the relationship between caffeine intake and risk of PD in both fast and slow caffeine metabolizers.\nAll the study participants were recruited prospectively, and interviewed for information on the amount and duration of caffeine intake. Genotyping of the CYP1A2 variant was carried out using the allelic discrimination method.\nOut of 1000 participants who were initially screened, 886 consisting of 418 PD and 468 race, sex and age matched controls were included. No evidence existed to suggest any association between CYP1A2 and the onset of PD (P=0.08).

    "abstract": "A new ambulatory method of monitoring physical activities in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is proposed based on a portable data-logger with three body-fixed inertial sensors. A group of ten PD patients treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and ten normal control subjects followed a protocol of typical daily activities and the whole period of the measurement was recorded by video. Walking periods were recognized using two sensors on shanks and lying periods were detected using a sensor on trunk. By calculating kinematics features of the trunk movements during the transitions between sitting and standing postures and using a statistical classifier, sit-to-stand (SiSt) and stand-to-sit (StSi) transitions were detected and separated from other body movements. Finally, a fuzzy classifier used this information to detect periods of sitting and standing. The proposed method showed a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of basic body postures allocations: sitting, standing, lying, and walking periods, both in PD patients and healthy subjects. We found significant differences in parameters related to SiSt and StSi transitions between PD patients and controls and also between PD patients with and without STN-DBS turned on. We concluded that our method provides a simple, accurate, and effective means to objectively quantify physical activities in both normal and PD patients and may prove useful to assess the level of motor functions in the latter.",

Patients Ninety-six patients having PD treated with pergolide for longer than 3 months vs 50 control subjects. Intervention Standardized echocardiography performed by an investigator blinded to treatment status. Main Outcome Measure Moderate to severe regurgitation in at least 1 heart valve.\nOne hundred thirty-three echocardiograms (86 in the pergolide-treated group and 47 in the control group) were analyzed in the study. Moderate to severe regurgitation was found in 15 patients treated with pergolide (17.4%) and in 2 control subjects (4.3%) (odds ratio [OR], 4.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-22.1; P = .03). Moderate to severe regurgitation was associated with the cumulative dose of pergolide (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.04-1.81 per 10-mg/kg increase; P =.03). Including the present study, the meta-analysis comprised 7 trials (394 patients treated with pergolide and 280 controls). The overall OR for moderate to severe regurgitation was 3.1 (95% CI, 1.7-5.6; P < .001) in the pergolide-treated group. Risk differences were correlated with the mean cumulative dose of pergolide (r = 0.90, P < .001).\nUsing an end point of moderate to severe heart valve regurgitation, we performed a meta-analysis of patients having Parkinson disease (PD) treated with pergolide mesylate vs control subjects by searching PubMed (January 1, 1966, to April 1, 2007) and the Cochrane databases to identify English-language prospective observational studies that reported echocardiographic data.\nHeart valve disease is independently associated with the use of pergolide treatment in patients having PD and correlates with its cumulative dose.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe, progressive, age-associated, neurodegenerative disorder. Current therapies are symptomatic and not effective at halting or significantly slowing the disease progress. The search for etiologic-based therapies has focused largely on genetic findings made in familial forms of this disease. Mutations of five genes have been unequivocally linked to PD; two of these, LRRK2 and PINK1, encode kinases and as such are attractive tools with which to understand the disease process; furthermore, preliminary functional data suggests that these proteins, or the pathways in which they are involved, are viable therapeutic targets. Here we explore the current data and thoughts regarding LRRK2 and PINK1 and discuss further avenues of research to understand the pathologic effects of mutations at these loci and potential points of therapeutic intervention, such as within these kinases or in associated pathways such as Jun N-terminal kinase and Akt pathways.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. Although a subject of intense research, the etiology of PD remains poorly understood. Over the last decade, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has emerged as a compelling player in PD pathogenesis. Disruption of the UPS, which normally identifies and degrades intracellular proteins, is thought to promote the toxic accumulation of proteins detrimental to neuronal survival, thereby contributing to their demise. Support for this came from a broad range of studies, including genetics, gene profiling and post-mortem analysis, as well as in vitro and in vivo modeling. Notably, various cellular and animal models of PD based on direct disruption of UPS function reproduce the salient features of PD. However, several gaps remain in our current knowledge regarding the precise role of UPS dysfunction in the pathogenesis of the disease. Current thoughts regarding their relationship are reviewed here and some major unresolved questions, the clarification of which would considerably advance our understanding of the implicated role of the UPS in PD pathogenesis, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The current review describes the modem Parkinson's disease models in animals, their advantages, limitations and disadvantages. It was noted that the most widespread up-to-date models based on etiology of the Parkinson's disease. Although toxins mostly produce the Parkinson's disease, a study of involved genes allows investigating not only inherited but also sporadic (not inherited) forms of disease since the same genes are involved in both cases. Mutations of genes lead to formation of \"mutant\" toxic proteins, which produce a death of the specialized neurons of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and the development of Parkinson's disease. A significant place in the review takes adescription of characteristics of the toxic models produced by 6-OHDA, MPTP and rotenone, their similarities and differences in pathogenetic mechanisms of the Parkinson's disease development. On the basis of the considered experimental models of Parkinson's disease a conclusion has been done that none of these models may in full and adequate scale imitate the entire clinical, pathophysiological, morphological, biochemical and other aspects of the Parkinson's disease development.",

    "abstract": "The ventral part of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in initiation and control of voluntary movement, mood and cognition. However, after the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway, the neuronal activity of the ventral mPFC and the role of serotonin(1A) (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT(1A)) receptors in the firing of the neurons are still unknown. The present study is to investigate the change of neuronal activity in the ventral mPFC and the effect of systemic administration of the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635 on the activity of the neurons in normal and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats.\nSingle unit responses were recorded extracellularly with glass microelectrodes from ventral mPFC neurons in normal rats and 6-OHDA unilaterally lesioned rats in vivo.\n6-OHDA lesion of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) significantly increased the firing rate with no change in the firing pattern of neurons of the ventral mPFC in rats. Systemic administration of WAY-100635 (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) did not change the mean firing rate and firing pattern of ventral mPFC neurons in normal rats. In contrast, WAY-100635 significantly decreased the mean firing rate of the neurons in rats with 6-OHDA lesion of the SNc.\nThese data suggest that the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway results in an increase of neuronal activity of ventral mPFC and dysfunction of 5-HT(1A) receptor.\n\u8179\u5185\u4fa7\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u76ae\u8d28\u5728\u968f\u610f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002 \u7136\u800c, \u9ed1\u8d28-\u7eb9\u72b6\u4f53\u901a\u8def\u53d8\u6027\u540e\u8179\u5185\u4fa7\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u76ae\u8d28\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c5-HT\n\u91c7\u7528\u5728\u4f53\u73bb\u7483\u5fae\u7535\u6781\u7ec6\u80de\u5916\u8bb0\u5f55\u65b9\u6cd5, \u8bb0\u5f55\u6b63\u5e38\u5927\u9f20\u548cSNc \u5355\u4fa7\u635f\u6bc1\u5927\u9f20\u7684\u8179\u5185\u4fa7\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u76ae\u8d28\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\n6-OHDA \u635f\u6bc1 SNc \u5927\u9f20\u7684\u8179\u5185\u4fa7\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u76ae\u8d28\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u653e\u7535\u9891\u7387\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0, \u653e\u7535\u5f62\u5f0f\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u6539\u53d8\u3002 \u4f53\u5faa\u73af\u7ed9\u4e88WAY-100635 (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) \u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6b63\u5e38\u5927\u9f20\u8179\u5185\u4fa7\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u76ae\u8d28\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u653e\u7535\u9891\u7387\u548c\u653e\u7535\u5f62\u5f0f, \u800c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86SNc\u635f\u6bc1\u5927\u9f20\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u76ae\u8d28\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u653e\u7535\u9891\u7387\u3002\n\u9ed1\u8d28-\u7eb9\u72b6\u4f53\u901a\u8def\u7684\u53d8\u6027\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u8179\u5185\u4fa7\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u76ae\u8d28\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u589e\u5f3a, 5-HT",

    "abstract": "Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative disorders and in both diseases susceptibility is known to be influenced by genes. We set out to identify novel susceptibility genes for LOAD by performing a large scale, multi-tiered association study testing 4692 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). We identified a SNP within a putative transcription factor binding site in the NEDD9 gene (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated), that shows good evidence of association with disease risk in four out of five LOAD samples [N = 3521, P = 5.38x10(-6), odds ratio (OR) = 1.38 (1.20-1.59)] and in addition, we observed a similar pattern of association in two PD sample sets [N = 1464, P = 0.0145, OR =1.31 (1.05-1.62)]. In exploring a potential mechanism for the association, we observed that expression of NEDD9 and APOE show a strong inverse correlation in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's cases. These data implicate NEDD9 as a novel susceptibility gene for LOAD and possibly PD.",

    "abstract": "Clinical observations have noted variability in amplitude of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and chorea in Huntington's disease (HD) during the day. However, no studies have examined whether both the amplitude and body location (motor topography) of whole-body involuntary movement (WBIM) varied over short periods of time (seconds or minutes), which may have a distinct and significant effect on how disruptive these WBIM may be. The present study quantified the variability of WBIM amplitude and motor topography in patients with PD having LID and in patients with HD having chorea.\nWBIM was quantified using the MotionMonitor magnetic motion tracker system. Five patients in each group were tested in two conditions: sitting and standing.\nWBIM increased from sitting to standing, more so in choreic patients. WBIM varied from 17% to 102% of total WBIM amplitude. Chorea tended to present with greater variability than LID in absolute terms in the standing condition, but not when the mean WBIM amplitude was taken into consideration. Motor topography of WBIM also varied more in the HD group, but mostly in the seated condition where more limbs were free to move. Neither group expressed any laterality of involuntary movement, with amplitude being equally distributed on both sides of the body.\nResults show significant short-term variability in amplitude of chorea and LID, as well as, variability in location of these involuntary movements, illustrating the complexity of the adaptations required to live and be active with involuntary movements such as HD chorea or PD dyskinesias.",

    "abstract": "The final step in the physiological synthesis of 17beta estradiol (E(2)) is aromatization of precursor testosterone by a CYP19 gene product, cytochrome P450 estrogen aromatase in the C19 steroid metabolic pathway. Within the central nervous system (CNS) the presence, distribution, and activity of aromatase have been well characterized. Developmental stage and injury are known modulators of brain enzyme activity, where both neurons and glial cells reportedly have the capability to synthesize this key estrogenic enzyme. The gonadal steroid E(2) is a critical survival, neurotrophic and neuroprotective factor for dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), the cells that degenerate in Parkinson's disease (PD). In previous studies we underlined a crucial role for the estrogenic status at the time of injury in dictating vulnerability to the parkinsonian neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Our ongoing studies address the contribution of brain aromatase and extragonadal E(2) as vulnerability factors for PD pathology in female brain, by exposing aromatase knockout (ArKO, -/-) female mice which are unable to synthesize estrogens to MPTP. Our initial results indicate that aromatase deficiency from early embryonic life significantly impairs the functional integrity of SNpc tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and dopamine transporter innervation of the caudate-putamen in adulthood. In addition, ArKO females exhibited a far greater vulnerability to MPTP-induced nigrostriatal damage as compared to their Wt type gonadally intact and gonadectomized counterparts. Characterization of this novel implication of P450 aromatase as determining factor for PD vulnerability may unravel new avenues for the understanding and development of novel therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Current Health Canada instructions for use of the dopamine agonists (DA), pramipexole and ropinirole, state that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients should be told not to drive. The objective was to assess neurologists' actual clinical practice concerning driving advice they give to PD patients starting a DA.\nAn online survey was created consisting of 4 items regarding demographics, 5 regarding PD and driving, and 9 regarding DA use and driving. The survey was distributed to 563 neurologists.\nIn total 96 neurologists (17.9%) responded. 4.4% tell patients with PD not to drive, solely because they are taking a DA. Respondents assess the patient's tendency for excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks after starting a DA more frequently than after starting other dopaminergic drugs (p < 0.001).\nA minor proportion of the clinicians responding to our survey advise PD patients not to drive, solely because they use a DA. Such being the case, we propose that current Health Canada guidelines need revision.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein has been implicated in the pathology of certain neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson disease (PD). Although the precise physiological and pathological role of alpha-synuclein is unclear, overexpression of the protein or its mutants may reduce cell viability. In this study we evaluated the apoptotic response to oxidative stress induced by 2-deoxy-d-ribose (dRib) in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of two siblings with Parkinson disease secondary to A53T alpha-synuclein mutation. PBLs exposed to oxidative stress showed a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in PD patients than in controls. However in cells of PD patients, the increase of apoptotic response was lower than in controls, suggesting that cells of PD patients have greater \"resistance\" to oxidative stress. We conclude that other environmental agents could play a key role in inducing programmed cell death in cells of PD patients with mutant alpha-synuclein.",

We produced human neural progenitor cells (hNPC) releasing either GDNF or IGF-1 and transplanted them into a rat model of PD. hNPC secreting either GDNF or IGF-1 were shown to significantly reduce amphetamine-induced rotational asymmetry and dopamine neuron loss when transplanted 7 days after a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion. Neither untransduced hNPC nor a sham transplant had this effect suggesting GDNF and IGF-1 release was required. Interestingly, GDNF, but not IGF-1, was able to protect or regenerate tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fibers in the striatum. In contrast, IGF-1, but not GDNF, significantly increased the overall survival of hNPC both in vitro and following transplantation. This suggests a dual role of IGF-1 to both increase hNPC survival after transplantation and exert trophic effects on degenerating dopamine neurons in this rat model of PD.",

    "abstract": "We present the method and results of an original technique to implant electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to treat Parkinson's disease, based on adaptations of the Fisher ZD stereotactic frame.\nTargets coordinates were calculated after fusion of stereotactic CT-scan and MRI images. STN was localized by its theoretical coordinates according to AC-PC and by its direct visualization on T2 images. Electrodes were implanted after local anesthesia, using peroperative multicanal microrecordings and test stimulation. Electrodes location was checked by peroperative perpendicular radiographs. To avoid projection of the frame arm on the area of interest on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs, the arm was fixed at 45 degrees from the usual 90 degrees position. This original fixation needed a trigonometric transformation of the X and Y stereotactic coordinates. Radiopaque markers, fixed on the frame, were identified on the radiographs, allowing the calculation of the stereotactic coordinates of the electrode tip, which were then entered in the stereotactic MRI, to check its location from the defined target.\nNo problem due to adaptations of the frame occurred in the 60 patients. In all cases, peroperative radiographs allowed to confirm the correct location of electrodes. Six months after surgery, UPDRS III score without medication was decreased by 52% with stimulation \"on\". UPDRS IV items 32, 33 and 39 scores were decreased by 75,7, 79,5 and 72%. Daily dopa-equivalent dose was decreased by 71%. One asymptomatic thalamic hematoma and two wound infections occurred.\nThis method was efficient and safe to implant deep electrodes.",

    "abstract": "Adult adipose contains stromal progenitor cells with neurogenic potential. However, the stability of neuronal phenotypes adopted by Adipose-Derived Adult Stromal (ADAS) cells and whether terminal neuronal differentiation is required for their consideration as alternatives in cell replacement strategies to treat neurological disorders is largely unknown. We investigated whether in vitro neural induction of ADAS cells determined their ability to neuroprotect or restore function in a lesioned dopaminergic pathway. In vitro-expanded na\u00efve or differentiated ADAS cells were autologously transplanted into substantia nigra 1 week after an intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine injection. Neurochemical and behavioral measures demonstrated neuroprotective effects of both ADAS grafts against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced dopaminergic neuron death, suggesting that pre-transplantation differentiation of the cells does not determine their ability to survive or neuroprotect in vivo. Therefore, we investigated whether equivalent protection by na\u00efve and neurally-induced ADAS grafts resulted from robust in situ differentiation of both graft types into dopaminergic fates. Immunohistological analyses revealed that ADAS cells did not adopt dopaminergic cell fates in situ, consistent with the limited ability of these cells to undergo terminal differentiation into electrically active neurons in vitro. Moreover, re-exposure of neurally-differentiated ADAS cells to serum-containing medium in vitro confirmed ADAS cell phenotypic instability (plasticity). Lastly, given that gene expression analyses of in vitro-expanded ADAS cells revealed that both na\u00efve and differentiated ADAS cells express potent dopaminergic survival factors, ADAS transplants may have exerted neuroprotective effects by production of trophic factors at the lesion site. ADAS cells may be ideal for ex vivo gene transfer therapies in Parkinson's disease treatment.",

    "abstract": "A study of complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) brain has identified loss of activity only in substantia nigra although loss of activity of this enzyme has been identified in a number of non-brain tissues. We investigated this paradox by studying complex I and other complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in frontal cortex from PD and aged control brain using a variety of assay conditions and tissue preparations. We found increasingly significant losses of complex I activity in PD frontal cortex as increasingly pure mitochondria were studied. Complexes II, III, and IV were comparable in PD and controls. Inclusion of bovine serum albumin in the assay increased enzyme activity but lessened discrimination between PD and controls. Complex I deficiency in PD brain is not confined to substantia nigra. Methodological issues are critical in demonstrating this loss of activity.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammatory processes play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Epidemiologic, animal, human, and therapeutic studies all support the presence of an neuroinflammatory cascade in disease. This is highlighted by the neurotoxic potential of microglia . In steady state, microglia serve to protect the nervous system by acting as debris scavengers, killers of microbial pathogens, and regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses. In neurodegenerative diseases, activated microglia affect neuronal injury and death through production of glutamate, pro-inflammatory factors, reactive oxygen species, quinolinic acid amongst others and by mobilization of adaptive immune responses and cell chemotaxis leading to transendothelial migration of immunocytes across the blood-brain barrier and perpetuation of neural damage. As disease progresses, inflammatory secretions engage neighboring glial cells, including astrocytes and endothelial cells, resulting in a vicious cycle of autocrine and paracrine amplification of inflammation perpetuating tissue injury. Such pathogenic processes contribute to neurodegeneration in PD. Research from others and our own laboratories seek to harness such inflammatory processes with the singular goal of developing therapeutic interventions that positively affect the tempo and progression of human disease.",

    "abstract": "A novel approach is presented for the analysis of surface electromyogram (EMG) morphology in Parkinson's disease (PD). The method is based on histogram and crossing rate (CR) analysis of the EMG signal. In the method, histograms and CR values are used as high-dimensional feature vectors. The dimensionality of them is then reduced using the Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve transform (KLT). Finally, the discriminant analysis of feature vectors is performed in low-dimensional eigenspace. Histograms and CR values were chosen for analysis, because Parkinsonian EMG signals typically involve patterns of EMG bursts. Traditional methods of EMG amplitude and spectral analysis are not effective in analyzing impulse-like signals. The method, which was tested with EMG signals measured from 25 patients with PD and 22 healthy controls, was promising for discriminating between these two groups of subjects. The ratio of correct discrimination by augmented KLT was 86% for the control group and 72% for the patient group. On the basis of these results, further studies are suggested in order to evaluate the usability of this method in early stage diagnostics of PD.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) may present with various types of pain. In some instances, no cause can be identified and pain is considered a primary disorder (primary central pain [PCP]). We hypothesized that PCP in patients with PD (PD-PCP) may be due to a dysfunction of pain pathways or the processing of pain inputs in the CNS.\nWe carried out a psychophysical and neurophysiologic study in 9 patients with PD-PCP, 9 patients with PD without pain (PD-NoP), and 9 healthy control subjects. We assessed the clinical characteristics of pain, performed quantitative sensory testing with thermal probes, and recorded laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) and laser-induced sudomotor skin responses (1-SSRs) in \"off\" and \"on\" conditions.\nIn \"off\" condition, patients with PD-PCP had lower heat pain and laser pinprick thresholds, higher LEP amplitudes, and less habituation of the l-SSR in comparison with PD-NoP patients and control subjects. Abnormalities were more marked in the most affected side. In \"on\" condition, psychophysical and neurophysiologic differences disappeared or were significantly attenuated.\nConduction along peripheral and central pain pathways is normal in patients with Parkinson disease with or without primary central pain. However, apart from signs of hyperalgesia, our patients exhibited lack of habituation of sympathetic sudomotor responses to repetitive pain stimuli, suggesting an abnormal control of the effects of pain inputs on autonomic centers. Abnormalities were attenuated by l-dopa, suggesting that the dysfunction may occur in dopamine-dependent centers regulating both autonomic function and inhibitory modulation of pain inputs.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the clinimetric properties of the AMC Linear Disability Score (ALDS), a new generic disability measure based on Item Response Theory, in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson disease (PD).\nA sample of 132 patients with PD was evaluated using the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y), the Unified PD Rating Scale motor examination, the Schwab and England scale (S&E), the Short Form-36, the PD Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the ALDS.\nThe internal consistency reliability of the ALDS was good (alpha = 0.95) with 55 items extending the sufficient item-total correlation criterion (r > 0.20). The ALDS was correlated with other disability measures (r = 0.50 to 0.63) and decreasingly associated with measures reflecting impairments (r = 0.36 to 0.37) and mental health (r = 0.23 to -0.01). With regard to know-group validity, the ALDS indicated that patients with more severe PD (H&Y stage 3) were more disabled than patients with mild (H&Y stage 1) or moderate PD (H&Y stage 2) (p < 0.0001). The ALDS discriminated between more or less severe extrapyramidal symptoms (p = 0.001) and patients with postural instability showed lower ALDS scores compared to patients without postural instability (p = or< 0.0001). Compared to the S&E (score 100% = 19%), the ALDS showed less of a ceiling effect (5%).\nThe AMC Linear Disability Score is a flexible, feasible, and clinimetrically promising instrument to assess the level of disability in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Relatives of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) have an increased risk of PD and other neurologic disorders; however, their risk of psychiatric disorders remains uncertain.\nTo study the risk of depressive disorders and anxiety disorders among first-degree relatives of patients with PD compared with first-degree relatives of controls.\nIn a population-based, historical cohort study, we included 1000 first-degree relatives of 162 patients with PD and 850 first-degree relatives of 147 controls. Both patients with PD and controls were representative of the population of Olmsted County, Minnesota.\nDocumentation of psychiatric disorders was obtained for each relative separately through a combination of telephone interviews with the relatives (or their proxies) and review of their medical records from a records-linkage system (family study method). Psychiatric disorders were defined using clinical criteria from the DSM-IV or routine diagnoses.\nWe found an increased risk of several psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives of patients with PD compared with first-degree relatives of controls (hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-1.95; P <.001). In particular, we found an increased risk of depressive disorders (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11-1.89; P = .006) and anxiety disorders (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.05-2.28; P = .03). The results were consistent in analyses that adjusted for type of interview, excluded relatives who developed parkinsonism, or excluded relatives who developed both a depressive disorder and an anxiety disorder.\nThese findings suggest that depressive disorders and anxiety disorders may share familial susceptibility factors with PD.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that mood, clinical manifestations and cognitive impairment of levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are associated with vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. To this end, we performed this cross-sectional study by measuring serum folate and vitamin B12 blood levels in 111 consecutive PD patients. Levodopa-treated PD patients showed significantly lower serum levels of folate and vitamin B12 than neurological controls, while depressed patients had significantly lower serum folate levels as compared to non-depressed. Cognitively impaired PD patients exhibited significantly lower serum vitamin B12 levels as compared to cognitively non-impaired. In conclusion, lower folate levels were associated with depression, while lower vitamin B12 levels were associated with cognitive impairment. The effects of vitamin supplementation merit further attention and investigation.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests beneficial effects of estrogen and estrogen-like chemicals on neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's disease (PD). Genistein, an isoflavone naturally found in soy products, displays estrogenic properties. The present study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of genistein on dopaminergic neurons in ovariectomized (OVX), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model mice. MPTP significantly decreased the levels of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the striatum, which could be restored by genistein or estrogen pretreatment. MPTP-challenge with genistein or estrogen pretreatment demonstrated reduced neurotoxicity, with tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) affected to a significantly lesser extent as compared to the MPTP treated control. The reverse transcription-PCR results also confirmed that the MPTP-induced downregulation of TH, dopamine transporter (DAT) and Bcl-2 mRNA expression in the midbrain could be restored by genistein or estrogen pretreatment. These findings provide the first evidence that genistein has neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP-induced PD mice and this effect may be attributed to enhancing Bcl-2 gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Genetically modified mice models are increasingly used to study the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in conditions where they are subjected to toxins specific for dopaminergic neurons. The most widely used toxin in these paradigms is 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), although it presents a number of drawbacks regarding (i) the kinetics of neurodegeneration, (ii) strain-specificity and (iii) partial lesion recovery. 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) may be an alternative tool since it leads to a partial damage of DA terminals and to a delayed and progressive loss of nigral DA neurons. It is frequently used in rats and well characterized in this species. In mice, however, this model has not been described in detail to date. The aim of the present study was to characterize the time course of intra-striatal 6-OHDA lesions in mice with regard to i) dopaminergic cell loss, ii) dopamine concentrations in the substantia nigra and the striatum, iii) hydroxylation products in substantia nigra and striatum and iv) behavioural impairment. Furthermore, we used alpha-synuclein-deleted mice, which have been studied extensively in MPTP paradigms, and examined their reactivity to intra-striatal 6-OHDA injections. Intra-striatally injected 6-OHDA leads to a long-lasting dopamine depletion of the nigro-striatal pathway, whereas behavioural parameters partially recovered over a two month period. Its toxicity seems to be influenced by alpha-synuclein, since alpha-synuclein-deleted mice are more resistant against 6-OHDA than their wild type littermates. In summary, we propose that the striatal 6-OHDA model may be a valuable addition and/or alternative in genetically modified mice models used in the study of PD pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that alpha-synuclein (alpha Syn) pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD) spreads in a predictable caudo-rostral way with the earliest changes seen in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV). However, the reliability of this stereotypical spread of alpha Syn pathology has been questioned. In addition, the comparative occurrence of alpha Syn pathology in the spinal cord and brain has not been closely studied.\nIn order to address these issues, we have examined 71 cases of PD from the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Tissue Bank at Imperial College, London. The incidence and topographic distribution of alpha Syn pathology in several brain regions and the spinal cord were assessed.\nThe most affected regions were the substantia nigra (SN; in 100% of cases) followed by the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert (NBM) in 98.5%. Fifty-three per cent of cases showed a distribution pattern of alpha Syn compatible with a caudo-rostral spread of alpha Syn through the PD brain. However, 47% of the cases did not fit the predicted spread of alpha Syn pathology and in 7% the DMV was not affected even though alpha Syn inclusions were found in SN and cortical regions. We also observed a high incidence of alpha Syn in the spinal cord with concomitant affection of the DMV and in a few cases in the absence of DMV involvement.\nOur results demonstrate a predominant involvement of the SN and NBM in PD but do not support the existence of a medullary induction site of alpha Syn pathology in all PD brains.",

    "abstract": "The authors review current literature on hallucinations in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent neuropathological studies showed that hallucinations occur in synucleinopathies and are a significant predictor of Lewy Body depositions. Therefore, hallucinations are a hallmark of PD and of dementia with Lewy Bodies. Visual hallucinations are mostly complex and kinematic; preserved or disturbed insight on the nature of hallucinations is a major prognostic factor, although eventually all hallucinators will present with reduced insight. Current theories on the origin of hallucinations point to visual dysfunction, dream overflow and cognitive impairment, yet objection can be raised on each one of the putative models of hallucinations. Understanding of the origin of hallucinations is required in order to develop treatments: all treatment evaluations were focused in general on psychosis, and only clozapine obtained positive evidence-based ratings on efficacy. However, it is likely that cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotics and anti-5-hydroxytryptamine(3) agents and drugs acting on sleep regulation will have different and perhaps opposite effects on different types of hallucinations, whether they are accompanied by disturbed insight, sleep disorders or other psychotic features. Further studies will try to separate phenomenology and responses to treatment and will investigate the relevance of concomitant sleep disorders and abnormality of frontoparietal networks involved in the attention process.",

    "abstract": "For decades, the cornerstone of treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) has been levodopa, which provides a smooth clinical response early in the course of disease. However, many PD patients develop motor complications on long-term levodopa therapy. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a selective and widely distributed enzyme involved in the catabolism of levodopa. Tolcapone and entacapone are selective and potent COMT inhibitors that slow the metabolism of levodopa, thus prolonging its effects. While both drugs act peripherally, tolcapone also inhibits COMT in the CNS. Tolcapone has been shown to be an effective adjunct in the treatment of PD in Phase II and III clinical trials, improving motor fluctuations and reducing levodopa requirements. Rare reports of severe hepatotoxicity, however, limited tolcapone's implementation in the treatment of PD. A reappraisal of the data for tolcapone treatment in PD has found that this risk is very small if proper hepatic monitoring guidelines are followed. This article reviews the pharmacology and clinical data on tolcapone, with particular focus on drug safety and the future role of tolcapone therapy in the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. Although a subject of intense research, the etiology of PD remains poorly understood. Recently, several lines of evidence have implicated an intimate link between aberrations in the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and PD pathogenesis. Derangements of the UPS, which normally functions as a type of protein degradation machinery, lead to alterations in protein homeostasis that could conceivably promote the toxic accumulation of proteins detrimental to neuronal survival. Not surprisingly, various cellular and animal models of PD that are based on direct disruption of UPS function reproduce the most prominent features of PD. Although persuasive, new developments in the past few years have in fact raised serious questions about the link between the UPS and PD. Here I review current thoughts and controversies about their relationship and discuss whether strategies aimed at mitigating UPS dysfunction could represent rational ways to intervene in the disease.

    "abstract": "Unilateral subthalamotomy has been reported to be effective in the treatment of rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor of the contralateral limb. However, gait, clinical fluctuation, and postural stability are not significantly improved by unilateral lesioning of the STN in the long term. We sought to determine if bilateral surgery of the STN offers more benefits in the treatment of advanced PD.\nRadiofrequency thermal coagulation was performed bilaterally in the STN in 10 patients. Under microelectrode and stereotactic guidance, surgery was directed at the dorsolateral portion of the STN in stages and followed by MRI in each patient to confirm lesion location. Patients have been followed for a median duration of 26 months as measured from the date of first surgery (range, 6-48 months) with UPDRS before and after surgery.\nBilateral subthalamotomy demonstrated persistent benefits in bradykinesia, rigidity of the limbs, and consequently the improvement in activities of daily living, motor function, Schwab and England scales. In addition, significant improvement in axial motor features, gait, postural stability, and clinical fluctuation were present with bilateral STN surgeries. The benefits were sustained at the last evaluation period of 36 months. Tremor and drug-induced dyskinesia improved in early postoperative period, but the benefits declined over time. The reduction of daily l-dopa equivalent was 34%. No speech impairment was observed. Mild choreic movement occurred in 2 of 20 procedures that resolved spontaneously in 4 to 8 weeks.\nFor advanced PD present with bilateral symptoms, axial motor impairment, or clinical fluctuation, staged bilateral subthalamotomy appears as a safe and effective treatment in the long term.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a finger taps acceleration measurement system for the quantitative diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The system was composed of two 3-axis piezoelectric element accelerometers, a pair of touch sensors made of thin stainless steel sheets, an analog-digital(AD) converter and a personal computer (PC). Fingerstalls,with these sensors, were attached to subject's index finger and thumb. The acceleration and output of the touch sensors were recorded using the PC during the finger taps movements. Intervals between the single finger taps movements were calculated from the measured output of the touch sensors. Velocities during the single finger taps movements were calculated by integrating the measured acceleration. The amplitudes were calculated by integrating the velocities. The standard deviation of the single finger taps intervals, average of maximum single finger taps velocities and average of maximum single finger taps amplitudes were calculated from them. They were used as features for the quantitative diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The developed system was used to conduct finger taps tests employing 27 normal subjects and 16 Parkinson's diseases subjects. The subjects were asked to execute continuous finger taps movement for 60 s. It was shown that the acceleration and output of the touch sensors could be measured and the features could be extracted.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate patient-reported health outcomes of a multidisciplinary group educational programme for people with Parkinson's disease (PD), delivered as part of routine clinical practice.\nStudies suggest that educational programmes for people with PD have potential to improve patients' perceived health and well-being. However, controlled trials of multidisciplinary group educational programmes are lacking.\nNaturalistic non-randomized controlled trial.\nFollowing ethical approval and informed consent, 48 people with PD (58% men; mean age, 69.3) received the intervention and 48 (52% men; mean age, 72) were allocated to a delayed intervention control group. The intervention was a six-week (two hours per week) multidisciplinary group educational programme. Patient-reported health outcomes were assessed by the 12-item short-form health survey (SF-12) at baseline and one month postintervention.\nChanges in SF-12 scores at follow-up did not differ between the groups and there were no within-group differences over time. Daily dopaminergic medication increased in the control group but not in the intervention group.\nSlightly, but significantly, increased drug requirement in the control group may in part have masked deterioration in perceived health. However, failure to demonstrate improved patient-reported health may relate to the intervention design, response shift (i.e. change in how people perceive their health), and/or quality and choice of outcome measures. Further studies that take these aspects into consideration are needed to determine the potential for patient education interventions in PD.\nNurses and other healthcare professionals need to document the effects of patient educational programmes and to be aware of the importance of intervention design and challenges associated with evaluating programme outcomes. Otherwise, there is a risk that benefits cannot be demonstrated and that decision makers will not invest resources in interventions that actually are beneficial for chronically ill people.",

    "abstract": "The dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) replicates many of the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) in mice via selective destruction of dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra and striatum. Although MPTP has been widely used to study downstream effects following the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, the underlying mechanisms of MPTP action remain poorly understood. To determine the underlying mechanisms of MPTP action at the protein level, a 2-DE-based proteomics approach was used to evaluate the changes in protein expression in substantia nigra and striatal tissue in C57BL/6 mice after MPTP administration. We identified nine proteins that were markedly altered and are likely to be involved in mitochondrial function, heat shock protein activity, and which contribute enzyme activities for energy metabolism and protein degradation.",

Because of concern over the high risk of side-effects resulting from bilateral ablative procedure, alternative approaches have been explored.With improved deep brain stimulation (DBS) technology, DBS has been successfully applied in the internal globus pallidus, ventral intermediate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus for Parkinson's disease. In addition, recent surgical approaches including biological neurorestorative technologies - surgical therapies with transplantation, gene therapy, and growth factor are all being discussed in this review. Although a great deal of work remains to be done for researchers, advances in surgical therapies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease are moving forward at an unprecedented pace, and, not surprisingly, would give PD patients more choices and hope.",

    "abstract": "We performed an analysis of prospectively-acquired cross sectional data on 106 Parkinson disease (PD) patients who underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scale. A significant correlation between the UPDRS motor and neuropsychological tests in all cognitive domains except for general intelligence and visuo-spatial function was seen. In this study, cognitive decline within this PD cohort correlated with motor impairment but not disease duration. Our findings suggest that overall cognitive impairment (except visuospatial dysfunction) may track motor progression in PD more than duration of disease. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our results.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) afflicts millions of people worldwide and leads to cognitive impairment or dementia in the majority of patients over time. Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is characterized by deficits in attention, executive and visuospatial function, and memory. The clinical diagnostic criteria and neuropathology surrounding PDD remain controversial with evidence of overlap among PDD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cortical cholinergic deficits are greater in PDD than in AD, and are well-correlated with the cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunction that occurs in PDD. Inhibition of acetylcholine metabolism is therefore a practical therapeutic strategy in PDD.This review examines current evidence for rivastigmine (a cholinesterase/butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor) treatment in PDD. In addition to its efficacy, we examine the safety profile, side effects, and cost effectiveness of rivastigmine in PDD. Rivastigmine provides modest benefit in PDD and further long-term studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of rivastigmine over time. Tolerability is a problem for many PDD patients treated with rivastigmine. Future studies of rivastigmine in PDD should focus on pragmatic outcomes such as time to need for nursing home placement, pharmacoeconomic outcomes and simultaneous patient/caregiver quality of life assessments.",

    "abstract": "Although essential tremor (ET), Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are considered to be distinct illnesses, there is a certain overlap between some of their clinical, pathological and genetic features.\nTo conduct a critical examination of the evidence for and against the association between these three pathological conditions.\nThe body of evidence supporting the notion of a relation between ET and PD is growing all the time; the same can be said of the fact that a postural tremor may appear years before the onset of other extrapyramidal symptoms, the involvement of common genes in the development of both conditions or the presence of common pathological findings. In addition, it has also been suggested that there are several aspects linking PD and DLB, and it has even been claimed that that they might be part of the clinical spectrum of the same disease. The concept of ET as a benign single-symptom disease has changed in recent years and, since it has been related to cognitive disorders and Lewy bodies in the central nervous system, it is now considered to be a neurodegenerative pathology. CONCLUSIONS. ET, PD and DLB could represent different points on the same clinical spectrum.",

Step amplitude also increased significantly with the attentional and combination cue strategies in single- (P<.001, P<.001) and dual-task (P<.001, P<.001) conditions. Step frequency was reduced significantly with the attentional strategy (P=.042) in the single and dual tasks (P<.001) and combination cue strategy (P=.009) in the dual task. The rhythmic auditory cue alone did not alter significantly any parameter of gait in the single or dual tasks.\nThe attentional strategy and the combination of a rhythmic auditory cue with an attentional strategy were equally effective, and improved walking speed and step amplitude significantly during both single and dual tasks. The combination cue, however, may still be a useful alternative in situations of increased attentional demand, or where problems exist with executive function.",

    "abstract": "Fluctuating Parkinson's disease (PD) represents a clinical management challenge. The primary utility of levodopa in patients with PD is moderated by the \"wearing off\" phenomena seen with long-term use. COMT inhibitors slow down the rapid metabolism of levodopa, resulting in a more-sustained response to dopaminergic therapy. Tolcapone is a selective, reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, shown to have both peripheral and central effects. In clinical trials, tolcapone has been shown to reduce \"off\" time, increase \"on\" time, improve patient and clinician assessments of disease severity, and improve patient quality of life. In a SWITCH study, tolcapone was associated with greater duration of \"on\" time than remaining on entacapone. Adverse effects of tolcapone are related to the class, with the exception of rare cases of hepatotoxicity. Tolcapone has been recently reintroduced on the European market and recent guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration has reduced the hepatic monitoring requirements for patients initiating tolcapone therapy. With proper monitoring, tolcapone is an effective, well-tolerated drug useful in the management of patients with fluctuating PD.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorders (ICDs) constitute a group of relatively common psychiatric conditions. ICDs typically involve pleasurable or hedonic behaviors (e.g. gambling, shopping or sex) that are performed repetitively, excessively or compulsively, to an extent that interferes in major areas of life functioning. Over the past decade, case reports, case studies and controlled examinations have reported ICDs in neurological patients, particularly those with Parkinson's disease (PD). A relationship between dopamine agonist treatment and ICDs was initially suggested on the basis of clinical observations, and subsequent systematic studies have provided more-substantial support for this association. Ongoing studies of the clinical characteristics of individuals with PD with and without ICDs suggest that certain individuals might be at increased risk of developing ICDs during PD treatment. Emerging data suggest that the association between dopamine agonists and ICDs extends into other neurological patient populations in which these agents are employed, such as those with restless legs syndrome. In this article, we summarize current knowledge regarding ICDs, review their relationships with PD and its treatments, provide practical clinical recommendations based on existing data, and suggest avenues for future research directed at advancing clinical care strategies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive neuronal loss affecting preferentially the dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal projection. Transplantation of fetal dopaminergic precursor cells has provided the proof of principle that a cell replacement therapy can ameliorate clinical symptoms in affected patients. Recent years have provided evidence for the existence of neural stem cells with the potential to produce new neurons, particularly of a dopaminergic phenotype, in the adult mammalian brain. Such stem cells have been identified in so called neurogenic brain areas, where neurogenesis is constitutively ongoing, but also in primarily non-neurogenic areas, such as the midbrain and the striatum, where neurogenesis does not occur under normal physiological conditions. We review here presently published evidence to evaluate the concept that endogenous neural stem cells may have the potential to be instrumentalized for a non-invasive cell replacement therapy with autologous neurons to repair the damaged nigrostriatal dopaminergic projection in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder of high prevalence in the elderly. It is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons and the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusions named Lewy bodies. To date six familial PD-associated proteins have been identified so far. Some of them are implicated in the development of either autosomal dominant (alpha-synuclein and LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2/dardarin) or early-onset recessive (parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase-1) and ATP13A2) PD forms. A number of genetic studies have shown that 50% of the recessive forms are linked to mutations on parkin gene, followed by PINK1 (8-15%) and DJ-1 (1%). The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the emerging data on the cellular and molecular biology of DJ-1. DJ-1 is a ubiquitous protein that was first described as an oncogene. Nevertheless, after its association to monogenic PD a number considerable data aiming at understanding its implication in the physiopathology of PD was produced. This review will describe the main advances concerning the function of DJ-1. A considerable progress that was only possible due to a better understanding of DJ-1 structure, genetics, distribution and development of in vivo models. All these points along with the description of recent data showing the interaction of DJ-1 with other PD-associated proteins will be given.",

    "abstract": "With the ability to study brain anatomy in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging, studies on regional brain atrophy suggest possible improvements for differential diagnosis of movement disorders with parkinsonian symptoms. In this study, we investigate effects of different parkinsonian syndromes on the cortical gray matter thickness and the geometric shape of the cerebral cortex. The study consists of a total of 24 patients with a diagnosis of probable progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple systems atrophy (MSA) or idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). We examine dense estimates of cortical gray matter thickness, sulcal depth, and measures of the curvature in a surface-based cortical morphometry analysis framework. Group difference results indicate higher cortical atrophy rate in the frontal lobe in PSP patients when compared to either MSA or IPD. These findings are indicative of the potential use of routine MRI and cortical morphometry in performing differential diagnosis in PSP, MSA and IPD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by elevated expression of an abnormal metabolic brain network that is reduced by clinically effective treatment. We used fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) to determine the basis for motor improvement in 12 PD patients receiving unilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) infusion of an adenoassociated virus vector expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase (AAV-GAD). After gene therapy, we observed significant reductions in thalamic metabolism on the operated side as well as concurrent metabolic increases in ipsilateral motor and premotor cortical regions. Abnormal elevations in the activity of metabolic networks associated with motor and cognitive functioning in PD patients were evident at baseline. The activity of the motor-related network declined after surgery and persisted at 1 year. These network changes correlated with improved clinical disability ratings. By contrast, the activity of the cognition-related network did not change after gene transfer. This suggests that modulation of abnormal network activity underlies the clinical outcome observed after unilateral STN AAV-GAD gene therapy. Network biomarkers may be used as physiological assays in early-phase trials of experimental therapies for PD and other neurodegenerative disease.",

Nocturia was the most common in men and feeling sad in women. The average number of symptoms which patients knew to be related to PD was 5.2+/-6.8 and to family members 7.7+/-6.5. Twenty-eight patients and five family members were unaware of the relationship between any of these symptoms and PD. For PD to be properly managed, nonmotor symptoms should be comprehensively assessed and patients and families informed that these are associated with PD.",

    "abstract": "Current dopaminergic therapies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease are associated with the development of long-term motor complications. Abnormal pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors is thought to underlie the development of motor complications. There is thus a need for therapies that mimic the normal physiological state more closely by resulting in constant dopaminergic stimulation (CDS). Several studies support the hypothesis that CDS can reverse levodopa-induced motor complications. Other potential benefits of CDS include alleviating nocturnal disturbances, minimizing daytime sleepiness, avoiding priming for motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, preventing the development of gastrointestinal dysfunction and reducing the risk of developing psychosis or behavioural disturbances. Continuous infusion of dopaminergic therapies is impractical for the routine treatment of large numbers of patients. Although catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors or sustained-release preparations of levodopa may be beneficial, they do not entirely eliminate pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors. A new dopamine agonist (rotigotine), delivered over 24 h by a once-daily transdermal patch, has been investigated in several clinical trials. Continuous delivery of rotigotine has been shown to provide 'true' CDS in animal models. The potential of true CDS therapy to prevent or reduce long-term motor and non-motor complications requires investigation in appropriately designed clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Extradural motor cortex stimulation (EMCS) has been proposed as alternative to deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Its mechanisms of action are still unclear. Neuroimaging evidenced motor cortical dysfunction in PD that can be reversed by therapy. We performed left hemisphere EMCS surgery in six advanced PD patients fulfilling CAPSIT criteria for DBS with the exception of age >70 years. After 6 months, we measured regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at rest with SPECT and Tc-99m cysteinate dimer bicisate off-medication with stimulator off and on. Clinical assessment included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II and III, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale and mean dopaminergic medication dosage. We used statistical parametric mapping for imaging data analysis. Clinically we observed no mean changes in motor scales, although blinded evaluation revealed some benefit in individual patients. We found significant rCBF decrements in the pre-central gyrus, pre-motor cortex and caudate nucleus bilaterally, left prefrontal areas and right thalamus. Perfusion increments were found in cerebellum bilaterally. EMCS determined significant modulation of neuronal activity within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor loop in our cohort of advanced PD patients. However, these effects were paralleled by mild and variable clinical efficacy.",

    "abstract": "We examined clinical presentations, neuropsychological findings, and perfusion patterns of (99m)Tc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with early stage dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 17) and Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 16), with age-matched healthy controls (n = 10). Seven paired regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually including inferior frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, parieto-occipital junction, striatum and thalamus for semiquantitative measurement. Neuropsychological tests were applied for clinical correlation. The SPECT results showed significant hypoperfusion in DLB group in frontal, parietal, thalamus, temporal ROIs compared with controls (P < 0.01) whilst signals in temporal areas was significantly reduced compared with PD group (P < 0.05). Neuropsychological tests showed that DLB patients had deficits in mental manipulation, short-term memory, abstract thinking, drawing and semantic verbal fluencies (P < 0.05, compared with control). In addition, DLB group had lower scores than those with PD in mental manipulation, drawing and semantic verbal fluency (P < 0.05). Our study showed that even in early stages of DLB, neuropsychological and perfusion patterns were evident and may be different from PD group, despite they shared certain similarities both in neuropsychological and image findings compared with age-matched controls.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) with selectivity and specificity for MAO type B prolong the activity of both endogenously and exogenously derived dopamine, making them an option either as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease or as adjunctive therapy in patients treated with levodopa who are experiencing motor complications. In addition to symptomatic benefits, experimental data suggest that MAO-B inhibitors may be neuroprotective through MAO-B inhibition and other mechanisms that have yet to be clearly defined. The two available MAO-B inhibitors approved for use in the United States, rasagiline and selegiline, each provide symptomatic relief as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy, and have shown potential disease-modifying effects in experimental models and clinical studies. Selegiline in a conventional tablet formulation is less bioavailable than rasagiline, resulting in limited potency. It also has amphetamine metabolites that may produce adverse effects and interfere with any putative disease-modifying effects. The oral disintegrating tablet formulation of selegiline allows pregastric absorption, minimizing first-pass metabolism, thereby increasing selegiline bioavailability and reducing the concentration of amphetamine metabolites. Rasagiline, more potent than selegiline, exhibits disease-modifying effects in experimental models and lacks amphetamine metabolites. Both the symptomatic and potential disease-modifying effects of rasagiline are under investigation. A third agent with MAO-B inhibition properties, safinamide, is in phase III development. Although not yet approved, safinamide may offer the added advantage of combined MAO-B and dopamine reuptake inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The available pharmacotherapies for Parkinson's disease address symptomatology because no agent has been demonstrated to provide definite neuroprotection against the disease. Choice of pharmacotherapy must include consideration of short-term benefits as well as long-term consequences. Patients with mild Parkinson's disease often function adequately without symptomatic treatment. However, recent data suggest that initiation of treatment with a well-tolerated agent (e.g., the monoamine oxidase [MAO]-B inhibitor rasagiline) in the absence of functional impairment is associated with improved long-term outcomes. Consideration should also be given to many patient-specific factors, including patient expectations, level of disability, employment status, functional as well as chronologic age, expected efficacy and tolerability of drugs, and response to previous Parkinson's disease therapies. Increasingly, initial monotherapy begins with a nondopaminergic agent or, if the patient is considered functionally young, a dopamine agonist. Since Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder, adjustments to pharmacotherapy must be expected over time. When greater symptomatic relief is desired, or in the more frail elderly patient, levodopa therapy should be considered. If motor fluctuations develop, addition of a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor or MAO-B inhibitor should be considered. For management of levodopa-induced dyskinesias, addition of amantadine is an option. Surgery may be considered when patients need additional symptomatic control or are experiencing severe motor complications despite pharmacologically optimized therapy.",

    "abstract": "This overview of Parkinson's disease is designed to serve as a background to the discussion elsewhere in this supplement on the pharmacotherapy used in its management. Parkinson's disease is a common progressive neurodegenerative condition associated with significant disability and negative impact on quality of life. Although the cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, the pathologic manifestation involves the loss or dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Characteristic clinical manifestations include difficulty with coordinated movement such as asymmetric resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. These symptoms and their response to levodopa constitute the basis for a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Postural instability and gait abnormalities occur in more advanced disease. Although there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, a number of pharmacologic treatments are available for managing the motor and nonmotor symptoms. Research is under way to assess the disease-modifying ability of both standard and newer treatments.",

    "abstract": "The role of CD200-CD200R signaling in immune regulation of the central nervous system has become a popular field of research in recent years. Many studies have shown that there is a close correlation between CD200-CD200R, microglia activation, and Parkinson's disease (PD). This review discusses the above relationship, highlighting (1) the gene mapping and molecular structure of CD200 and CD200R, (2) the distribution and expression of CD200 and CD200R in the nervous system, (3) the effect of CD200-CD200R signaling on microglia activation, and (4) the role of microglia activation in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Finally, we discuss the status of current studies on the regulation of microglia activation in PD and strongly suggest that it is very promising to regulate microglia activation in PD via targeting CD200-CD200R signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Pharmacological therapies are valuable but suffer from two main drawbacks: side effects and loss of efficacy with disease progression. Surgical treatment is no better than drugs. Transplantation of embryonic mesencephalic tissue has emerged as a therapeutic alternative, but the unstable efficiency and the shortage of embryonic donors limit its clinical application. Recent advances in stem cell research inspire our hope that stem cell transplantation to replace degenerated neurons may be a promising therapy for Parkinson's disease. There are three sources of stem cells currently in testing: embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. The stem cell transplantation in the animal model of Parkinson's disease proves that it is capable of relieving symptoms and restoring damaged brain function. Future stem cell research should focus not only on ameliorating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease but also on neuroprotection or neurorescue that can favorably modify the natural course and slow the progression of the disease.",

    "abstract": "To study anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) via a biomechanical analysis, including vertical torque (Tz).\nTen patients with PD (in the \"off-drug\" condition) and 10 age matched controls were included. While standing on a force platform, the subject performed a right shoulder flexion in order to grasp a handle in front of him/her, under three conditions (all at maximal velocity): movement triggered by a sound signal and loaded/non-loaded, self-paced movement. The anteroposterior coordinates of the centre of pressure (COP) and Tz were calculated.\nA group effect was observed for Tz and COP in patients with PD (compared with controls): the maximal velocity peak appeared later and the amplitude of the COP backward displacement and the area of the positive phase of Tz were lower, whereas the duration of the positive phase of Tz was greater. Interaction analysis showed that the area of Tz was especially affected in the triggered condition and the loaded, self-paced condition. The onset of the COP backward displacement was delayed in the triggered condition.\nOur biomechanical analysis revealed that patients with PD do indeed perform APAs prior to unilateral arm movement, although there were some abnormalities. The reduced APA magnitude appears to correspond to a strategy for not endangering postural balance.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of alpha-synuclein is known to be a causal factor in the genesis of Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy bodies. Duplication and/or triplication and mutation of the alpha-synuclein gene are associated with sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease. Synucleinopathies appear to primarily affect dopaminergic neurons. The present studies investigate the role of dopamine in alpha-synuclein aggregation through NMR. Dopamine causes aggregation of both wild type and A53T mutant alpha-synuclein in a temperature-dependent manner, but the mutant A53T shows a greater propensity to aggregate in the presence of dopamine only at 37 degrees C. A single point mutation in the alpha-synuclein A53T mutant gene results in a structural change in the protein and drastically increases its propensity to aggregate in the presence of dopamine. The present data indicate that mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene may predispose the protein to dopamine-induced aggregation, thereby contributing to disease pathogenesis.",

It helps distinguish Parkinson's disease from the more common essential tremor.

These features are unilateral at onset but become bilateral as the condition progresses.",

    "abstract": "Symptomatic medications, l-Dopa and dopaminergic agents, remain the only clinically pertinent pharmacological treatment proven effective and available for the large population of patients with Parkinson's disease. The challenge for the pharmaceutical industry is to develop disease-modifying drugs which could arrest, delay or at least oppose the progression of the specific pathogenic processes underlying Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this review, based on recent biological and genetic data to be validated with appropriate animal models, was to re-examine the putative neuroprotective agents in Parkinson's disease and discuss the development of new strategies with the ultimate goal of demonstrating neurocytoprotective activity in this neurodegenerative disease. Since guidelines for research on neurocytoprotective drugs remain to be written, innovation will be the key to success of future clinical trials. It is reasonable to expect that future advances in our understanding of the pathogenic processes of Parkinson's disease will open the way to new perspectives for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that processing of action words recruits cortical motor regions that are also involved in the planning and execution of the actions words refer to. The functional role of these regions in word understanding remains, however, to be clarified. The present study investigates this issue by examining the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on lexical decision performance for action words, relative to concrete nouns, in a masked priming paradigm. Priming effects for the two word categories were measured in non-demented PD patients off and on dopaminergic treatment, and in healthy participants. Our results revealed that although overall performances did not differ between verbs and nouns, priming effects showed a clear dissociation between word categories. While priming for concrete nouns was not affected by Levodopa intake, it dissociated as a function of treatment for action verbs. No priming was actually obtained for action verbs in PD patients off dopaminergic treatment. Following Levodopa intake, this deficit recovered, however, because priming effects for verbs became comparable to those for concrete nouns and similar to performance of healthy participants. Overall, this study thus brings compelling evidence that processing lexico-semantic information about action words depends on the integrity of the motor system.",

This can occur, in part, by modulation of glial function following activation by soluble or insoluble modified alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), a chief component of Lewy bodies that is released from affected dopaminergic neurons. alpha-Syn is nitrated during oxidative stress responses and in its aggregated form, induces inflammatory microglial functions. Elucidation of these microglial function changes in PD could lead to new insights into disease mechanisms. To this end, PD-associated inflammation was modeled by stimulation of microglia with aggregated and nitrated alpha-syn. These activated microglia were ameboid in morphology and elicited dopaminergic neurotoxicity. A profile of nitrated, aggregated alpha-syn-stimulated microglia was generated using combinations of genomic (microarrays) and proteomic (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, differential gel electrophoresis, and protein array) assays. Genomic studies revealed a substantive role for nuclear factor-kappa B transcriptional activation. Qualitative changes in the microglial proteome showed robust increases in inflammatory, redox, enzyme, and cytoskeletal proteins supporting the genomic tests. Autopsy brain tissue acquired from substantia nigra and basal ganglia of PD patients demonstrated that parallel nuclear factor-kappa B-related inflammatory processes were, in part, active during human disease. Taken together, the transcriptome and proteome of nitrated alpha-syn activated microglia, shown herein, provide new potential insights into disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "[(11)C]PIB ((11)C-6-OH benzothiazole) reflects the regional distribution of amyloid (beta-sheeted proteins) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Proteinaceous inclusions in Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), so-called Lewy bodies, also consist of fibrillar, misfolded proteins, chiefly alpha-synuclein. To test whether PDD subjects show specific amyloid binding in vivo and whether this could reflect fibrillar alpha-synuclein accumulation, we investigated 10 PDD subjects with [(11)C]PIB-PET. Radioligand binding was compared to that in 11 control and 6 AD subjects. Furthermore, postmortem sections of 4 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), therefrom 2 with dementia (PDD), and of 6 controls were stained with PIB to evaluate the histological distribution of the fluorescent ligand in the brainstem. In PET, only 2 PDD patients displayed increased PIB binding to cortical amyloid comparable to AD patients. The other 8 patients showed control-like cortical findings but elevated PIB binding in the pons and mesencephalon. Fluorescence microscopy showed PIB binding to Lewy bodies and neuromelanin in the substantia nigra of PD and PDD brainstem sections, but not in controls. These data suggest that PIB-PET can be used to further differentiate PDD with respect to cortical amyloid. Furthermore, we provide evidence that--in addition to nonspecific binding--PIB uptake in the brainstem may also reflect PDD related amyloid.",

    "abstract": "Several rodent models of deep brain stimulation (DBS) have been developed in recent years. Electrophysiological and neurochemical studies have been performed to examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of DBS. In vitro studies have provided deep insights into the role of ion channels in response to brain stimulation. In vivo studies reveal neural responses in the context of intact neural circuits. Most importantly, recording of neural responses to behaviorally effective DBS in freely moving animals provides a direct means for examining how DBS modulates the basal ganglia thalamocortical circuits and thereby improves motor function. DBS can modulate firing rate, normalize irregular burst firing patterns and reduce low frequency oscillations associated with the Parkinsonian state. Our current efforts are focused on elucidating the mechanisms by which DBS effects on neural circuitry improve motor performance. New behavioral models and improved recording techniques will aide researchers conducting future DBS studies in a variety of behavioral modalities and enable new treatment strategies to be explored, such as closed-loop stimulations based on real time computation of ensemble neural activity.",

The future of PD gene therapy will depend upon resolving a number of important issues that are discussed in this special issue. Of particular importance is the identification of novel targets that are amenable to early intervention prior to the substantial loss of DAN. However, for the most part the etiopathogenesis of PD is unknown making early intervention a challenge and the development of early biomarker diagnostics imperative.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) with selectivity and specificity for MAO type B (MAO-B) prolong the duration of action of both endogenously and exogenously derived dopamine. Rasagiline [N-propargyl-l(R)-aminoindan] is a second-generation propargylamine pharmacophore that selectively and irreversibly inhibits brain MAO-B and is specifically designed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe aim of this study was to review the pharmacology, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of rasagiline in the treatment of PD.\nMEDLINE (1966-April 2007), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 2007) were searched for original research and review articles published in English. The search terms were monoamine oxidase, neuroprotection, Parkinson disease, propargylamine, rasagiline, and selegiline. The reference lists of articles were also consulted, as was information provided by the manufacturer of rasagiline.\nData from 63 clinical and laboratory studies were analyzed. Based on the results from those studies, we concluded that rasagiline PO QD, at the therapeutic dosage range of 0.5 to 1 rag/d, is effective and well tolerated and completely, selectively, and specifically inhibited MAO-B. Pharmacologically, rasagiline was found to be < or =10-fold more potent than selegiline and was not metabolized to amphetamine derivatives. Rasagiline was effective both as monotherapy in early PD and as adjunctive treatment in patients with advancing PD and motor fluctuations. As monotherapy, rasagiline provided modest yet clinically meaningful benefit. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that, after 26 weeks of treatment, the adjusted effect size for total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score was -4.20 (95% CI, -5.66 to -2.73) for rasagiline 1 mg/d versus placebo (P < 0.001). Preliminary long-term data from an open-label study suggest a sustained therapeutic advantage when rasagiline is initiated early (before the need for dopaminergic agents) rather than later. In patients with more advanced disease who received treatment with dopaminergic agents, rasagiline and entacapone were associated with reductions of \"off\" time significantly greater than placebo (-1.18 and -1.2 vs 0.4 hour; both, P < or = 0.001). Rasagiline was well tolerated in younger (aged <;70 years) and older (aged > or =70 years) patients with early or advanced PD. Pharmacologically, rasagiline has the potential to augment the vasopressor effects of diet-derived tyramine (ie, the \"cheese reaction\"). However, clinical challenge studies of tyramine have found this unlikely to occur even with ingestion of supraphysiologic amounts of tyramine. In experimental models, rasagiline has been found to have neuroprotective properties that may be independent of MAO-B inhibition.\nBased on this review, rasagiline has been found to be well tolerated and effective in the treatment of early PD and as adjunctive treatment in motor fluctuations. Whether rasagiline is associated with clinically significant neuroprotection (ie, disease modification) in PD is the subject of ongoing clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder. The neuropathology is characterized by the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Transplants of fetal/embryonic midbrain tissue have exhibited some beneficial clinical effects in open-label trials. Neural grafting has, however, not become a standard treatment for several reasons. First, the supply of donor cells is limited, and therefore, surgery is accompanied by difficult logistics. Second, the extent of beneficial effects has varied in a partly unpredictable manner. Third, some patients have exhibited graft-related side effects in the form of involuntary movements. Fourth, in two major double-blind placebo-controlled trials, there was no effect of the transplants on the primary endpoints. Nevertheless, neural transplantation continues to receive a great deal of interest, and now, attention is shifting to the idea of using stem cells as starting donor material. In the context of stem cell therapy for PD, stem cells can be divided into three categories: neural stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and other tissue-specific types of stem cells, e.g., bone marrow stem cells. Each type of stem cell is associated with advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we review recent advances of stem cell research of direct relevance to clinical application in PD and highlight the pros and cons of the different sources of cells. We draw special attention to some key problems that face the translation of stem cell technology into the clinical arena.",

The type of the disease was defined according to subscore of UPDRS concerning postural instability, gait difficulty and tremor assessment. The two groups were compared in regard to number and causes of falls, gender, age, disease duration, age at the onset of the disease, UPDRS score, Hoehn and Yahr stage, Schwab and England score, the occurrence of dyskinesia, fluctuations, mental function (MMSE) and depressive mood.\nThere were 76 patients (71.6%) in the PIGD group and 21 (19.8%) in the TD group. There were no significant differences between PIGD and TD regarding age, gender, disease duration, age at the onset of the disease, UPDRS score, Hoehn and Yahr stage, Schwab and England score, mental status and depression. Dyskinesia, fluctuations and gait disorders occurred more often in PIGD. Falls were significantly more common in PIGD-PD (57.9%) than in TD-PD (23.8%) (p=0.03). The number of falls in PIGD- -PD was significantly higher than in TD-PD (mean number of falls in PIGD-PD 3.6+/-6.0 and in T-PD 0.6+/-1.8, p=0.02). Sudden falls were the main cause of falls in both groups.\nPIGD patients are significantly more predisposed to falls.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disease, is caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Although the underlying cause of the neuronal loss is unknown, oxidative stress is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of PD. The amino acid methionine is readily oxidized to methionine sulfoxide, and its reduction is catalyzed by a family of enzymes called methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRs). The reversible oxidation-reduction cycle of methionine involving MSRs has been postulated to act as a catalytic antioxidant system protecting cells from oxidative damage. Here, we show that one member of the MSR family, MSRA, inhibits development of the locomotor and circadian rhythm defects caused by ectopic expression of human alpha-synuclein in the Drosophila nervous system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one way to enhance the MSRA antioxidant system is dietary supplementation with S-methyl-L-cysteine (SMLC), found abundantly in garlic, cabbage, and turnips. SMLC, a substrate in the catalytic antioxidant system mediated by MSRA, prevents the alpha-synuclein-induced abnormalities. Therefore, interventions focusing on the enzymatic reduction of oxidized methionine catalyzed by MSRA represent a new prevention and therapeutic approach for PD and potentially for other neurodegenerative diseases involving oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we examined whether omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may exert neuroprotective action in Parkinson's disease, as previously shown in Alzheimer's disease. We exposed mice to either a control or a high n-3 PUFA diet from 2 to 12 months of age and then treated them with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 140 mg/kg in 5 days). High n-3 PUFA dietary consumption completely prevented the MPTP-induced decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-labeled nigral cells (P<0.01 vs. MPTP mice on control diet), Nurr1 mRNA (P<0.01 vs. MPTP mice on control diet), and dopamine transporter mRNA levels (P<0.05 vs. MPTP mice on control diet) in the substantia nigra. Although n-3 PUFA dietary treatment had no effect on striatal dopaminergic terminals, the high n-3 PUFA diet protected against the MPTP-induced decrease in dopamine (P<0.05 vs. MPTP mice on control diet) and its metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (P<0.05 vs. MPTP mice on control diet) in the striatum. Taken together, these data suggest that a high n-3 PUFA dietary intake exerts neuroprotective actions in an animal model of Parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate changes in perceptual and several acoustic parameters of voice in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to find out any relation with these parameters and motor components of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) in this patient group.\nTwenty patients with PD (12 male and 8 female) were given objective and subjective voice tests and results were compared with those of 20 age- and sex-matched controls. Patient's perceptual voice analysis was assessed using GRBAS scale including Grade of Dysphonia, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia and Strain items. Measurements for objective voice analysis, acoustic assessment tests including frequency perturbation [jitter (jitt)%], intensity perturbation [shimmer (shim)%], noise to harmonic ratio (NHR), fundamental frequency (F0), variability of fundamental frequency (vF0), diadochokinetic rate (DDK) and maximum phonation time (MPT) were used. An assessment of disability caused by voice disorders was scored according to the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) by the patient. All subjects also underwent videolaryngostroboscopic (VLS) examination. Motor components of UPDRS and acoustic parameters of voice were investigated for any correlations.\nCompared with controls, roughness (P = 0.15), breathiness (P = 0.004) and asthenia (P = 0.031) values of males and breathiness (P = 0.043) and asthenia (P = 0.023) values of females were higher in patients with PD. Mean VHI scores of patients with PD were higher for both male and female patients (P = 0.0001 for male, P = 0.002 for female). The mean values for MPT (P = 0.02) and DDK (P = 0.025) were shorter in patients with PD. Jitt%, shim% and mean F0 values were similar among the two groups. But mean vF0 values were significantly higher in male patients with PD (P = 0.05). On VLS examination, non-closure glottic pattern was found to be more frequent in the PD group.\nAlthough it is well known that pathophysiological changes in PD affect the voice, the present study found only few significant correlations between motor component of UPDRS and voice parameters.",

    "abstract": "We examined the effects of 7-nitroindazole on the dopaminergic system in mice after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment. The mice received four intraperitoneal injections of MPTP (20 mg/kg) at 2 h-intervals. Administration of 7-nitroindazole showed dose-dependent neuroprotective effects against striatal dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) depletion 7 days after MPTP treatment. Behavioral testing showed that MPTP-treated mice exhibited motor deficits in the catalepsy test after 7 days, but 7-nitroindazole prevented the appearance of motor abnormalities in this test. The MPTP-treated mice exhibited the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-containing dopaminergic neurons in mice after 1, 3 and 7 days, but 7-nitroindazole-treated mice showed a protective effect. GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein)-positive astrocytes were accumulated in the striatum 3 and 7 days and in the substantia nigra 1, 3 and 7 days after MPTP treatment. In contrast, 7-nitroindazole prevented a significant increase in the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes in the striatum and substantia nigra after MPTP treatment. The reactive astrocytes in the striatum and substantia nigra after MPTP treatment increased the production of S100beta protein, which is thought to promote neuronal damage, but 7-nitoindazole suppressed the expression of S100 beta protein. Activation of microglia, with an increase in staining intensity and morphological changes, was observed in the striatum and substantia nigra 1 and 3 days after MPTP treatment, but 7-nitroindazole prevented a significant increase in the number of isolectin B(4) positive microglia in the striatum and substantia nigra. On the other hand, nestin-immunoreactive cells were increased significantly in the striatum 3 and 7 days after MPTP treatment. 7-Nitroindazole treatment facilitated nestin expression in the striatum 7 days after MPTP treatment. Thus, nNOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole protected dopaminergic neurons against MPTP neurotoxicity in mice and ameliorated neurological deficits. The results suggest that the neuroprotection is mediated though the modulation of glial activation, including the inhibition of S100beta synthesis and the prevention of microglial activation. These results suggest the therapeutic strategy targeted to glial modulation with 7-nitoindazole offers a great potential for the development of new neuroprotective therapies for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "It has been previously reported that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) struggle with fine adjustments of finger forces while manipulating an object. However, impairments in everyday activities can not only be attributed to difficulties with the linear forces applied on an object, but also to the application of rotational forces (torque). This study examined finger strength and isometric torque control in elderly persons with PD. Six individuals with PD (66.1 +/- 0.7 years), six elderly healthy controls (65.3 +/- 0.2 years) matched by age, gender and handedness, and six young adults (22.3 +/- 0.2 years) participated in this study. The subjects were asked to perform two tasks: maximum voluntary thumb-index pinching torque production (MVT) and constant isometric thumb-index torque control at 40% of their MVT for 20 s. The results showed decreased strength and increased difficulty in isometric torque control in individuals with PD as compared to their healthy peers. This study demonstrates that PD affects isometric finger torque production and control.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, identification of the genes involved in familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) has advanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of different aspects of PD. However the available animal models still remain as the main limiting factor for the development of neuroprotective therapies that can halt the progression of the disease, through which we wish to provide a better quality of life for the PD patients. Here, we review the recently developed animal models based on overexpression of PD-associated genes using recombinant viral vectors. Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors, in particular, have been very useful in targeting the nigral dopamine neurons both in the rodent and the primate brain. In order to provide insights into the establishment of these models in the laboratory, we will not only give an overview of the results from these studies but also cover practical issues related to the production and handling of the viral vectors, which are critical for the successful application of this approach.",

    "abstract": "Multiple investigations have determined that healthy adults swallow most often during exhalation and that exhalation regularly follows the swallow, even when a swallow occurs during inhalation. We hypothesized that persons with idiopathic Parkinson's disease would demonstrate impaired breathing and swallowing coordination during spontaneous eating. Twenty-five healthy volunteers and 25 Parkinson's disease patients spontaneously swallowed calibrated pudding and cookie portions while simultaneous nasal airflow and respiratory inductance plethysmography were used to track spontaneous breathing. Surface EMG was used to record the timing of each swallow within the respiratory cycle. When compared to the healthy control group, those with Parkinson's disease swallowed significantly more often during inhalation and at low tidal volumes. The Parkinson's participants also exhibited significantly more postswallow inhalation for both consistencies. Only the healthy subjects exhibited significantly longer deglutitive apnea when swallows that occurred during inhalation were compared with those that occurred during exhalation. The high incidence of oropharyngeal dysphagia and risk of aspiration pneumonia found in Parkinson's disease patients may be partially attributable to impaired coordination of breathing and swallowing.",

This article discusses the nature of the relations between Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, and what can be learned from them about the causes of dementia in patients with established Parkinson's disease. This is an area of clinical practice which is of increasing importance as greater numbers of ageing patients survive longer with good treatment of their motor symptoms. Precise use of terminology and a clear understanding of the biological substrates underlying symptom formation are particularly helpful to both clinicians and patients.",

    "abstract": "To document the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on communication and to further clarify the role of the basal ganglia in the processing of emotional speech prosody, this investigation compared how PD patients identify basic emotions from prosody and judge specific affective properties of the same vocal stimuli, such as valence or intensity. Sixteen non-demented adults with PD and 17 healthy control (HC) participants listened to semantically-anomalous pseudo-utterances spoken in seven emotional intonations (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, pleasant surprise, neutral) and two distinct levels of perceived emotional intensity (high, low). On three separate occasions, participants classified the emotional meaning of the prosody for each utterance (identification task), rated how positive or negative the stimulus sounded (valence rating task), or rated how intense the emotion was expressed by the speaker (intensity rating task). Results indicated that the PD group was significantly impaired relative to the HC group for categorizing emotional prosody and showed a reduced sensitivity to valence, but not intensity, attributes of emotional expressions conveying anger, disgust, and fear. The findings are discussed in light of the possible role of the basal ganglia in the processing of discrete emotions, particularly those associated with negative vigilance, and of how PD may impact on the sequential processing of prosodic expressions.",

    "abstract": "Studies suggest motor deficit asymmetry may help predict the pattern of cognitive impairment in individuals with Parkinson disease (PD). We tested this hypothesis using a highly validated and sensitive spatial memory task, spatial delayed response (SDR), and clinical and neuroimaging measures of PD asymmetry. We predicted SDR performance would be more impaired by PD-related changes in the right side of the brain than in the left. PD (n=35) and control (n=28) participants performed the SDR task. PD participants either had worse motor deficits on the right (RPD) or left (LPD) side of the body. Some participants also had magnetic resonance imaging for measurement of their substantia nigra (SN) volumes. The LPD group performed worse on the SDR task than the RPD and control groups. Right SN volume accounted for a unique and significant portion of the variance in SDR error, with smaller volume predicting poorer performance. In conclusion, left motor dysfunction and smaller right SN volume are associated with poorer spatial memory.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial impairment, glutathione depletion and oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), linked recently to proteasomal dysfunction. Our study analysed how these factors influence the various activities of the proteasome in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with the PD mimetics MPP+ (a complex 1 inhibitor) or dopamine. Treatment with these toxins led to dose- and time-dependent reductions in ATP and glutathione and also chymotrypsin-like and post-acidic like activities; trypsin-like activity was unaffected. Antioxidants blocked the effects of dopamine, but not MPP+, suggesting that oxidative stress was more important in the dopamine-mediated effects. With MPP+, ATP depletion was a prerequisite for loss of proteasomal activity. Thus in a dopaminergic neuron with complex 1 dysfunction both oxidative stress and ATP depletion will contribute independently to loss of proteasomal function. We show for the first time that addition of MPP+ or dopamine to purified samples of the human 20S proteasome also reduced proteasomal activities; with dopamine being most damaging. As with toxin-treated cells, chymotrypsin-like activity was most sensitive and trypsin-like activity the least sensitive. The observed differential sensitivity of the various proteasomal activities to PD mimetics is novel and its significance needs further study in human cells.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder and the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease, affecting an increasing number of patients due to the demographic trend towards an aged population. The etiology of sporadic PD is only poorly understood, thus, the identification of genes that are responsible for familial variants of PD was a major breakthrough. Insight into the function of these genes can promote the understanding of the molecular causes of PD and help to focus research on key biochemical pathways. Mutations in the parkin gene, encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, are responsible for the majority of autosomal recessive PD. Recent research revealed that parkin has a remarkably wide neuroprotective capacity, preventing cell death under various stress conditions. This property makes parkin an attractive target for therapeutic strategies to prevent or halt the loss of dopaminergic neurons.",

Transdermal rotigotine is an effective and generally well tolerated addition to the armamentarium for the control of Parkinson's disease, with the once-daily transdermal patch system offering several practical advantages and the possible benefits of avoiding pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation. Transdermal rotigotine was superior to placebo in patients with early-stage and advanced Parkinson's disease, although noninferiority to the oral dopamine agonists ropinirole or pramipexole was not consistently demonstrated. Additional active comparator trials would be of interest. In the meantime, transdermal rotigotine offers a convenient new treatment option for patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "A 79-year-old woman with a 4-year history of Parkinson's disease was admitted due to unique dyspneic attacks with cyanosis while eating. Dyspneic attacks with cyanosis occurred mainly during actions such as taking meals or rehabilitation. Due to increased tonus of the orbicularis oris muscle, she was unable to open her mouth and breathe out, and finally experienced hypoxemia as revealed by pulse oxymetry. Dystonic hypertonus was relieved by touching the mandible with the fingers, and she was able to open her mouth again. These symptom was compatible with the sensory trick. Based on these findings, we considered that dyspneic attacks were produced by focal oromandibular dystonia. Polysomnography also showed central sleep apnea. We report herein a rare case of Parkinson's disease presenting with respiratory insufficiency caused by focal dystonia and central sleep apnea.",

    "abstract": "The histological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the presence of fibrillar aggregates called Lewy bodies (LBs). LB formation has been considered to be a marker for neuronal degeneration, because neuronal loss is found in the predilection sites for LBs. To date, more than 70 molecules have been identified in LBs, in which alpha-synuclein is a major constituent of LB fibrils. Alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry reveals that diffuse cytoplasmic staining develops into pale bodies via compaction, and that LBs arise from the peripheral portion of pale bodies. This alpha-synuclein abnormality is found in 10% of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra and more than 50% of those in the locus ceruleus in PD. Recent studies have suggested that oligomers and protofibrils of alpha-synuclein are cytotoxic, and that LBs may represent a cytoprotective mechanism in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has been modeled in humans, lower primates, and to a lesser extent in some other vertebrates by the administration of the potent neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The MPTP model has thus drawn considerable attention during the past 15 years, as a system to search for anti-PD drugs. It has been previously reported that a Parkinsonian syndrome can be elicited in the common goldfish (Carassius auratus) by a single dose of MPTP. This protocol describes the relatively simple and inexpensive MPTP model of PD in goldfish. The procedure takes 14-30 d, depending on how many animals are tested and on the planned study. The accessibility of the goldfish nervous system, neural density, the evolutionary equivalent subcortical circuitry and the greatly abbreviated blood-brain barrier of the goldfish brain, make it an attractive system for study of PD as well as potential drugs for therapy.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have great difficulty in performing two tasks simultaneously, but the neural contribution to this problem has not been identified. In the current study, we investigated the pathophysiology of dual task performance in PD.\nWe studied 15 patients with PD and 14 healthy controls. Functional MRIs were obtained before and after practicing dual tasks with different complexities.\nAfter practice, 12 normal subjects performed all dual tasks correctly. Twelve patients performed the simpler dual tasks correctly. However, only 3 patients could perform the more complex dual task correctly. Dual tasks activated similar brain regions in both groups. The bilateral precuneus was additionally activated during performance of dual tasks compared with the component tasks in both groups. Patients had greater activity in the cerebellum, premotor area, parietal cortex, precuneus and prefrontal cortex compared with normal subjects.\nDifficulty in performing two tasks simultaneously in patients with PD is probably due to limited attentional resources, defective central executive function and less automaticity in performing the tasks. Practice can diminish dual task interference and improve performance in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Peroxiredoxins (Prx), a family of peroxidases that reduce intracellular peroxides with the thioredoxin system as the electron donor, are highly expressed in various cellular compartments. Among the antioxidant Prx enzymes, Prx2 is the most abundant in mammalian neurons, making it a prime candidate to defend against oxidative stress. Here we report that Prx2 is S-nitrosylated (forming SNO-Prx2) by reaction with nitric oxide at two critical cysteine residues (C51 and C172), preventing its reaction with peroxides. We observed increased SNO-Prx2 in human Parkinson's disease (PD) brains, and S-nitrosylation of Prx2 inhibited both its enzymatic activity and protective function from oxidative stress. Dopaminergic neurons, which are lost in PD, become particularly vulnerable. Thus, our data provide a direct link between nitrosative/oxidative stress and neurodegenerative disorders such as PD.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has indicated that common mechanisms play roles among multiple neurological diseases. However, the specifics of these pathways are not completely understood. Stroke is caused by the interruption of blood flow to the brain, and cumulative evidence supports the critical role of oxidative stress in the ensuing neuronal death process. DJ-1 (PARK7) has been identified as the gene linked to early-onset familial Parkinson's disease. Currently, our work also shows that DJ-1 is central to death in both in Vitro and in Vivo models of stroke. Loss of DJ-1 increases the sensitivity to excitotoxicity and ischemia, whereas expression of DJ-1 can reverse this sensitivity and indeed provide further protection. Importantly, DJ-1 expression decreases markers of oxidative stress after stroke insult in Vivo, suggesting that DJ-1 protects through alleviation of oxidative stress. Consistent with this finding, we demonstrate the essential role of the oxidation-sensitive cysteine-106 residue in the neuroprotective activity of DJ-1 after stroke. Our work provides an important example of how a gene seemingly specific for one disease, in this case Parkinson's disease, also appears to be central in other neuropathological conditions such as stroke. It also highlights the important commonalities among differing neuropathologies.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the ubiquitously expressed gene PTEN-induced kinase 1 (Pink1) cause autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease. Pink1 encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. The mechanism that leads to selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons via Pink1 mutations is unknown. A full-length pre-protein (66 kDa) and an N-terminally truncated mature form (55 kDa) have been described in human brain. Here, we report that the endogenous 66 kDa and 55 kDa Pink1 forms in cultured cells are not exclusive to mitochondria but also occur in cytosolic and microsome-rich fractions. Pink1 66 kDa is the predominant isoform in cultured cells. Using unbiased analyses of immunoisolated Pink1 complexes by mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation and Hsp90 inhibitor studies, we identify Pink1 as a novel Cdc37/Hsp90 client kinase. This chaperone system influences both the subcellular distribution and the 66/55 kDa protein ratio of Pink1. PD-causing Pink1 mutations decrease whereas Parkin expression increases the Pink1 66/55 kDa protein ratio, biochemically linking Pink1 and Parkin and highlighting the potential relevance of this ratio for PD pathogenesis. Finally, we document the influence of Parkin on Pink1 subcellular distribution, providing further evidence for a common pathogenic pathway in recessive PD.",

    "abstract": "The effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation and L-dopa administration on the arm and leg swing movements associated with overground walking were studied in a group of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Ten patients undergoing deep brain stimulation and twenty controls were tested using 3D kinematic motion analysis. Parkinsonian patients under basal conditions walked more slowly and with reduced arm and leg swing compared to controls. Moreover, they displayed significant impairments of the normal interlimb coordination. Both STN stimulation and L-dopa increased the walking speed and the amplitude of arm and leg swing movements. Additional improvements of the coordination between upper and lower limb were documented by reductions of the phase-shift between arm and ipsilateral leg motion, with displacement toward the control range (perfect counterphase). STN stimulation alone and L-dopa alone produced similar effects on the variables analyzed. The combination of the two treatments, instead, yielded additive effects on the gait speed and a slight increase of the upper and lower limb range of motion, in the absence of further improvements in the inter-segmental coordination. Moreover, whereas the increased arm swing could be accounted by the sole adoption of a higher gait speed, both the increment of the leg movement amplitude and the decreased interlimb phase shift appeared to imply an additional effect, possibly related to the treatment. These results may suggest that differential supraspinal controls operate on the neural networks subserving upper and lower limb motion during human walking.",

    "abstract": "Identifying active regions of the brain that are task-related is important in fMRI study. Current methods of determining functional Regions of Interest (ROIs) are unsatisfactory because they either reduce the effect size or bias the statistical results. We propose a spectral clustering method for assessing those voxels within an ROI that are suitable for further task-activation analysis. Different similarity functions are studied and the correlation index is chosen based on the simulation study. In real fMRI study, further group analysis employing regression is investigated to identify different brain activation patterns between groups in order to reveal the effects of disease and medicine. A real fMRI case study in Parkinson's disease suggests that the technique is promising, warranting further study.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second largest neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. This disease results from the loss of dopamine producing neurons in parts of the basal ganglia of the brain. Previous studies have shown the involvement of the dopamine system in the basal ganglia in balance control. Sensations of balance in the body are detected by the vestibular apparatus. In this project, electrovestibulography (EVestG) has been used to measure neuronal activity of the vestibular apparatus and nuclei from Parkinson's patients. A wavelet based signal processing technique, a Neural Event Extraction Routine, has been used to extract biomarkers from these EVestG recordings. These measurements appear to be correlated with scores from mobility tests which indicate disease progression and mobility impairment in Parkinson's patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a measuring system of contact force in finger-tapping of Parkinson's disease patients and to show its effectiveness for quantitative diagnosis. This system was composed of a pair of 3-axis accelerometers, a touch sensor an analog to digital converter and a personal computer (PC). Firstly, a transfer function representing relation between the contact force and the accelerometer output during the finger contact phase of finger-tapping was determined. This means that the finger-tapping contact force could be estimated from the measured acceleration by using the determined transfer function. Secondly the developed system was applied to 27 normal subjects and 16 Parkinson's diseases subjects. Score of UPDRS finger tap test was evaluated for each subject by a neurologist. Finally, these sensors were attached to subject's index finger and thumb, and sensor signals were recorded and processed within the PC. The subjects were asked to execute continuous finger taps movement for 60 s. It was shown that the contact force was smaller as the subject was with the larger UPDRS score of tap test.",

    "abstract": "Single photon emission computed tomography image (SPECT) of dopamine transporter with 99mTc-TRODAT-1 has recently been proposed to be a valuable and feasible means of assessing the integrity of dopamine neurons. In order to measure the specific-to-nonspecific binding ratio of the nuclear medicine within the specific-binding tissues, i.e. putamens and caudate nuclei, the corresponding MRI is needed to be registered to SPECT for bounding the regions of interest. Therefore, an automatic labeling algorithm which enables contouring the putamens and caudate nuclei is necessary because segmenting these tissues manually from MRI costs tons of time and energy of physicians. We have built a computer-aided clinical diagnosis system which integrates MRI/SPECT registration and MRI labeling for the evaluation of Parkinson's disease. Clinical MRI and SPECT data including eighteen healthy subjects and thirteen patients were involved to validate the performance of the proposed system.",

    "abstract": "We immunohistochemically examined the neostriatum from 25 patients with symptomatic and presymptomatic Parkinson's disease (PD) with various degrees of Lewy body pathology, using anti-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (alphaS) antibody. These patients were classified according to the PD staging proposed by Braak et al. (Neurobiol Aging 24:197-211, 2003): stage II (alphaS pathology confined to the medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum), stage III (alphaS pathology confined to the brainstem), stage IV (limbic stage), and stages V and VI (neocortical stage). alphaS immunohistochemistry revealed neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions and neuritic changes in the neostriatum. alphaS inclusions were found in the medium-sized neurons (GABAergic neurons that project to the globus pallidus) and large neurons (cholinergic interneurons); the former began to appear at stage III and the latter was noted at stages V and VI. Neuritic changes and glial inclusions also began to appear at stage III. The numbers of neuronal and glial inclusions, and the extent of neuritic changes, correlated with the PD stage (P < 0.001). These findings suggest that intrinsic neostriatal neurons degenerate through alphaS aggregation during PD progression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Despite intense investigations, no effective therapy is available to stop its onset or halt its progression. The present study evaluates the ability of peptide corresponding to the NF-kappaB essential modifier-binding domain (NBD) of IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) or IKKbeta to prevent nigrostriatal degeneration in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD and establish a role for NF-kappaB in human parkinsonism. First, we found that NF-kappaB was activated within the substantia nigra pars compacta of PD patients and MPTP-intoxicated mice. However, i.p. injection of wild-type NBD peptide reduced nigral activation of NF-kappaB, suppressed nigral microglial activation, protected both the nigrostriatal axis and neurotransmitters, and improved motor functions in MPTP-intoxicated mice. These findings were specific because mutated NBD peptide had no effect. We conclude that selective inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by NBD peptide may be of therapeutic benefit for PD patients.",

Patients Thirty patients with the A3243G mutation and MELAS syndrome enrolled in a clinical trial to assess the effect of dichloroacetate on neurologic symptoms.\nMedical histories and electrocardiograms were reviewed and DNA samples from fibroblasts, urine and cheek epithelial cells, leukocytes, and hair were analyzed to determine mitochondrial mutation abundance and estimate total mutation burden.\nFour of 30 patients (13%) had a clinical history of, or electrocardiographic findings consistent with, WPW syndrome. In 2 patients, WPW syndrome preceded MELAS syndrome by 15 and 21 years. The tissue burden of mutant mitochondria was similar in patients with (49.4%) and without (39.1%) WPW syndrome.\nThe prevalence of WPW syndrome among patients with MELAS syndrome and the A3243G mutation appears much higher than in the normal population and may become manifest earlier than neurologic symptoms. Patients with WPW syndrome and neurologic abnormalities consistent with MELAS syndrome, such as seizures, deafness, short stature, and stroke, should be screened for the A3243G mutation. Moreover, patients with MELAS syndrome should be monitored for cardiac anomalies including cardiomyopathy and WPW syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Rivastigmine patch is the first transdermal treatment to be approved for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia in the USA and for AD in Europe. It provides smooth, continuous drug delivery, and has the potential to maintain rivastigmine concentrations within an optimal therapeutic window while avoiding the peaks and troughs associated with oral drug delivery. The target dose, rivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h patch (a 10 cm(2) patch), is given once daily and requires a simple one-step dose titration to the therapeutic dose. In a 24-week study in 1195 AD patients, the rivastigmine 9.5 mg/24 h patch provided similar efficacy to the highest dose range of capsules, with approximately three-times fewer reports of nausea and vomiting. Patients in the 9.5 mg/24 h patch and 12 mg/day capsule groups evidenced significant improvements versus placebo on both primary outcome measures: the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale; and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change; in addition to the following secondary outcome measures: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale; Mini-Mental State Examination; and Trail Making Test Part A for assessment of attention, visual tracking and motor processing speed. Treatment differences on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Ten Point Clock-drawing Test did not reach statistical significance in this study. The patch may be the optimal way to treat dementia patients with rivastigmine.",

The experimental group received eight weekly 2-hour sessions for 10-15 literate adults of all ages, while the control group did not receive any intervention.\nThe experimental group showed significant improvements in muscle strength, balance, self-efficacy, depression, quality of life(QL), quality of sleep, and discomfort of constipation. It also reduced the number of participants using assistive walking devices. There were no significant changes in fear of falling and duration of sleep.\nThe eight week SMP in patients with PD was found to be significantly effective in enhancing muscle strength, balance, self-efficacy, QL, and quality of sleep. It also decreased depression, discomfort of constipation, and assistive walking devices.

Pons area, midbrain area, MCP width, and SCP width were measured in 33 consecutive patients with PSP (16 possible, 17 probable), 108 consecutive patients with PD, 19 consecutive patients with MSA-P, and 50 healthy control participants on T1-weighted MR images. The pons area-midbrain area ratio (P/M) and MCP width-SCP width ratio (MCP/SCP) were also used, and an index termed MR parkinsonism index was calculated [(P/M).(MCP/SCP)]. Differences in MR imaging measurements among groups were evaluated with Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Bonferroni correction.\nMidbrain area and SCP width in patients with PSP (23 men, 10 women; mean age, 69.3 years) were significantly (P < .001) smaller than in patients with PD (62 men, 46 women; mean age, 65.8 years), patients with MSA-P (five men, 14 women; mean age, 64.0 years), and control participants (25 men, 25 women; mean age, 66.6 years). P/M and MCP/SCP were significantly larger in patients with PSP than in patients in other groups and control participants.

No patient with PSP received a misdiagnosis when the index was used (sensitivity and specificity, 100%).\nThe MR parkinsonism index can help distinguish patients with PSP from those with PD and MSA-P on an individual basis.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have shown associations between Parkinson Disease (PD) risk and individual foods and nutrients with inconsistent results.\nWe examined associations between dietary patterns and risk of PD in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2002) and the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2000).\nWe included 49 692 men and 81 676 women free of PD at baseline and used principal components analysis to identify major dietary patterns and the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and the alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed) to assess diet quality. Relative risks (RRs) were computed by using Cox proportional hazards models within each cohort and were pooled by using a random-effects model.\nWe documented 508 new PD cases after 16 y of follow-up. The principal components analysis identified 2 dietary patterns: prudent and Western. The prudent dietary pattern, characterized by high intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fish, was inversely associated with PD risk, but the Western pattern was not. The pooled multivariate-adjusted RR for the top compared with the bottom quintiles of the prudent score was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.07; P for trend = 0.04). For the AHEI, the pooled multivariate-adjusted RR for the top compared with the bottom quintile was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.94; P for trend = 0.01) and for aMED was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.00; P for trend = 0.07).\nDietary patterns with a high intake of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, fish, and poultry and a low intake of saturated fat and a moderate intake of alcohol may protect against PD. Benefits of a plant-based dietary pattern including fish to PD merit further investigation.",

The prudent dietary pattern, characterized by high intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fish, was inversely associated with PD risk, but the Western pattern was not. The pooled multivariate-adjusted RR for the top compared with the bottom quintiles of the prudent score was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.07; P for trend = 0.04). For the AHEI, the pooled multivariate-adjusted RR for the top compared with the bottom quintile was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.94; P for trend = 0.01) and for aMED was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.00; P for trend = 0.07).",

    "abstract": "The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of frailty in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and the relationship between individual frailty criteria and the severity of PD. We measured the five components of frailty (Fried et al.) and the severity of PD (unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS)) in 50 optimally treated PD patients. Frailty was more prevalent in PD patients. While UPDRS scores differed between frail and non-frail participants (44.8+/-15.8 vs. 31.4+/-12.7, P<0.002), higher scores were not indicative of frailty. Weekly caloric expenditure best predicted frailty status (OR=22.0 [4.5,107.8]). Frailty and PD bear distinct therapeutic and prognostic significance; however, their clinical picture may overlap and screening PD patients for frailty may be warranted.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects have increased gait variability, reflecting greater attentional demand during walking. This study aimed to investigate the attentional cost of three cueing strategies by examining their effect on gait variability. Fourteen PD and 12 age matched control subjects were studied under single and dual walking tasks. Gait variability of PD subjects tended to reduce with all cues, the most consistent reductions in variability seen with a combination of an attentional strategy (focussing on big steps) and a rhythmical auditory cue. The reduction in gait variability of PD subjects with cues, suggests they may reduce the attentional cost of walking.",

    "abstract": "We used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure the earliest change in dopaminergic synapses and glial cell markers in a chronic, low-dose MPTP non-human primate model of Parkinson's disease (PD). In vivo levels of dopamine transporters (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter-type 2 (VMAT2), amphetamine-induced dopamine release (AMPH-DAR), D2-dopamine receptors (D2R) and translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) were measured longitudinally in the striatum of MPTP-treated animals. We report an early (2 months) decrease (46%) of striatal VMAT2 in asymptomatic MPTP animals that preceded changes in DAT, D2R, and AMPH-DAR and was associated with increased TSPO levels indicative of a glial response. Subsequent PET studies showed progressive loss of all pre-synaptic dopamine markers in the striatum with expression of parkinsonism. However, glial cell activation did not track disease progression. These findings indicate that decreased VMAT2 is a key pathogenic event that precedes nigrostriatal dopamine neuron degeneration. The loss of VMAT2 may result from an association with alpha-synuclein aggregation induced by oxidative stress. Disruption of dopamine sequestration by reducing VMAT2 is an early pathogenic event in the dopamine neuron degeneration that occurs in the MPTP non-human primate model of PD. Genetic or environmental factors that decrease VMAT2 function may be important determinants of PD.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal pentraxin II (NPTX2) is the most highly upregulated gene in the Parkinsonian substantia nigra based on our whole genome expression profiling results. We show here that it is a novel component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). NPTX2 is also known as the neuronal activity-regulated protein (Narp), which is secreted and involved in long-term neuronal plasticity. Narp further regulates AMPA receptors which have been found to mediate highly selective non-apoptotic cell death of dopaminergic neurons. NPTX2/Narp is found in close association with alpha-synuclein aggregates in both substantia nigra and cerebral cortex in PD but unlike alpha-synuclein gene expression, which is down-regulated in the Parkinsonian nigra, NPTX2 could represent a driver of the disease process. In view of its profound (>800%) upregulation and its established role in synaptic plasticity as well as dopaminergic nerve cell death, NPTX2 is a very interesting novel player which is likely to be involved in the pathway dysregulation which underlies PD.",

However, issues relating to compound delivery and potential side effects have limited the clinical application of this treatment strategy. The identification of CDNF and MANF, which constitute a new class of neurotrophic factors active against dopaminergic neurons, may provide new hope for therapeutic approaches to neurodegenerative disorders based on neurotrophic factors or downstream components of their signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-15 promotes T-cell proliferation, induction of cytolytic effector cells including natural killer (NK) and cytotoxic cells and stimulates B-cell to proliferate and secrete immunoglobulins. RANTES is a C-C beta chemokine with strong chemoattractant activity for T lymphocytes and monocytes.\nThe objective of our study was to find out whether IL-15 and RANTES are involved in the possible inflammatory reactions of PD.\nWe measured by immunoassay serum IL-15 and RANTES levels in 41 patients with PD in comparison with serum levels in 19 healthy subjects age and sex-matched. IL-15 and RANTES levels were correlated with sex, age, disease duration. H-Y stage and the UPDRS III score in all the studied groups and were also correlated with treatment status in PD patients.\nThe PD group presented with significantly increased RANTES levels as compared to the control group (P = 0.0009). No difference was observed as regards IL-15 levels. A strong and significant correlation between RANTES levels and UPDRS III score was observed in PD patients (R(s) = 0.42, P = 0.007). Untreated patients had significantly higher RANTES levels as compared to the controls.\nOur findings may suggest a recruitment of activated monocytes, macrophages and T lymphocytes to sites of inflammation in the central nervous system of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "To assess the relationship between the presence of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and the cognitive profile of nondemented patients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nCognitive impairment is an important nonmotor symptom in PD. Waking EEG slowing in nondemented PD has been related to the presence of RBD, a parasomnia affecting brainstem structures and frequently reported in PD. For this reason, RBD may be associated with cognitive impairment in PD.\nThirty-four patients with PD (18 patients with polysomnographic-confirmed RBD and 16 patients without RBD) and 25 healthy control subjects matched for age and educational level underwent sleep laboratory recordings and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment.\nPatients with PD and concomitant RBD showed significantly poorer performance on standardized tests measuring episodic verbal memory, executive functions, as well as visuospatial and visuoperceptual processing compared to both patients with PD without RBD and control subjects. Patients with PD without RBD had no detectable cognitive impairment compared to controls.\nThis study shows that cognitive impairment in nondemented patients with Parkinson disease (PD) is closely related to the presence of REM sleep behavior disorder, a sleep disturbance that was not controlled for in previous studies assessing cognitive deficits in PD.",

    "abstract": "Markers of neuroinflammation, including activated microglia and increased levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines, have been observed in the brains and CSF of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Yet the link between anti-inflammatory agents and PD in humans remains uncertain, despite indications that neuroinflammation may contribute to cell death in the PD brain and experimental evidence of anti-inflammatory agents such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exerting neuroprotective effects in animal models.\nUsing a population-based approach, we studied NSAID use among 293 incident idiopathic PD cases and 286 age-, race-, and gender-matched controls from three rural California counties.\nOur data suggested a decreased risk of PD among regular (>or=2 pills/week for at least 1 month) aspirin NSAID users (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.15). A stronger protective effect was observed for regular nonaspirin NSAID users (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.79), particularly those who reported 2 or more years of use (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.74).

Given our results and the biologic plausibility of a neuroprotective function for NSAIDs there is a pressing need for further studies elucidating the protective role such drugs may play in PD.",

    "abstract": "Methylphenidate (MPH) is a centrally acting (psycho)stimulant which reversibly blocks the dopamine re-uptake transporter. At present MPH is one of the most frequently prescribed drugs for the symptomatic treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although MPH has been in use for about 50 years, there is no information available concerning the long-term benefits and risks of medication. Based on experiments in rats it has been suggested that MPH treatment may affect the maturation of central dopaminergic systems and may be a risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the present case-control study was to gain information about (1) ADHD-like symptoms that may precede PD motor symptoms, and (2) the exposure to psychostimulants in childhood. We used a German short version of the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS-k, Retz-Junginger et al., 2002) which is a reliable measure for the retrospective diagnosis of childhood ADHD, and another questionnaire including a rating scale for symptoms of ADHD in childhood (Q-ADHD-Child) according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. A total of 92 patients with PD and 115 control subjects were enrolled in this study. Ninety-six percentage of PD patients (N = 88) completed the two rating scales. The data of these patients and of 88 randomly selected individuals of the controls were included for analysis. In the WURS-k, the PD group showed higher total scores compared to control subjects. In addition, we found increased scores in PD patients regarding the items attention deficit, hyperactivity and anxious and depressive symptoms, but not regarding impulsivity, oppositional behaviour and deficits in social adaptation. The results of the Q-ADHD-Child also showed increased scores in PD patients regarding attention deficit and hyperactivity. However, one cannot conclude that the PD patients enrolled in this study had suffered from childhood ADHD, since the average total WURS-k score of (14.4) was far below the cut-off score of 30 or higher which is considered to identify childhood ADHD. Finally, we found no evidence that PD patients had been exposed to psychostimulants such as MPH and amphetamine.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a tool in the neurosciences to study motor functions and nervous disorders, amongst others. Single pulses of TMS applied over the primary motor cortex lead to a so-called cortical silent period in the recording from the corresponding muscle, i.e. a period of approximately 100ms with no muscle activity. We here show that in Parkinson's disease (PD), this cortical silent period in some cases is interrupted by short bursts of EMG activity. We describe in detail these interruptions in two patients with PD. These interruptions may number up to 3 per cortical silent period and show a consistent frequency across trials and hemispheres within a given patient; the two patients described here do differ, however, in the time-delay of the interruptions and hence the induced frequency. For one patient, the frequency of the interruptions proved to be around 13 Hz, the other patient showed a frequency of around 17 Hz. The results corroborate earlier findings of cortical oscillations elicited by pulses of TMS and may be related to abnormal oscillatory activity found in the cortical-subcortical motor system in PD.",

    "abstract": "Five men with advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) were examined to assess the effect of low dose methylphenidate (MPD) on gait. The patients were tested during \"off\" state before and two hours after the intake of 10 mg MPD while walking an \"8 trajectory\". The total walking time, total freezing time, number of freezing episodes and the non-freezing walking time were assessed. The obtained data were compared by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test with a type I error rate of 0.05. The results showed a statistically significant improvement in all gait parameters after MPD intake. Moreover, a good correlation in the grade of improvement for each individual gait characteristic was found. The study demonstrates that low dose of MPD may improve gait, and especially freezing, in patients with severe PD, without the need for exogenous L-dopa. The mechanism of MPD action in patients with advanced PD is further discussed.",

    "abstract": "Strategies of cell therapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) are focused on replacing damaged neurons with cells to restore or improve function that is impaired due to cell population damage. In our studies, we used mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from mouse bone marrow. Following our novel neuronal differentiation method, we found that the basic cellular phenotype changed to cells with neural morphology that express specific markers including those characteristic for dopaminergic neurons, such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Intrastriatal transplantation of the differentiated MSCs in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned mice led to marked reduction in the amphetamine-induced rotations. Immunohistological analysis of the mice brains four months post transplantation, demonstrated that most of the transplanted cells survived in the striatum and expressed TH. Some of the TH positive cells migrated toward the substantia nigra. In conclusion, transplantation of bone marrow derived stem cells differentiated to dopaminergic-like cells, successfully improved behavior in an animal model of PD suggesting an accessible source of cells that may be used for autotransplantation in patient with PD.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases, a therapeutic strategy has been proposed to halt progressive cell death. Propargylamine derivatives, rasagiline and (-)deprenyl (selegiline), have been confirmed to protect neurons against cell death induced by various insults in cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. In this paper, the mechanism and the markers of the neuroprotection are reviewed. Propargylamines prevent the mitochondrial permeabilization, membrane potential decline, cytochrome c release, caspase activation and nuclear translocation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. At the same time, rasagiline induces anti-apoptotic pro-survival proteins, Bcl-2 and glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor, which is mediated by activated ERK-NF-kappaB signal pathway. DNA array studies indicate that rasagiline increases the expression of the genes coding mitochondrial energy synthesis, inhibitors of apoptosis, transcription factors, kinases and ubiquitin-proteasome system, sequentially in a time-dependent way. Products of cell survival-related gene induced by propargylamines may be applied as markers of neuroprotection in clinical samples.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical studies on postmortem brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have greatly contributed to our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. The discovery by 1960 of a dopamine deficiency in the nigro-striatal dopamine region of the PD brain was a landmark in research on PD. At that time we collaborated with Hirotaro Narabayashi and his colleagues in Japan and with Peter Riederer in Germany on the biochemistry of PD by using postmortem brain samples in their brain banks. We found that the activity, mRNA level, and protein content of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), as well as the levels of the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) cofactor of TH and the activity of the BH4-synthesizing enzyme, GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCHI), were markedly decreased in the substantia nigra and striatum in the PD brain. In contrast, the molecular activity (enzyme activity/enzyme protein) of TH was increased, suggesting a compensatory increase in the enzyme activity. The mRNA levels of all four isoforms of human TH (hTH1-hTH4), produced by alternative mRNA splicing, were also markedly decreased. This finding is in contrast to a completely parallel decrease in the activity and protein content of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) without changes in its molecular activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in PD. We also found that the activities and/or the levels of the mRNA and protein of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC, DOPA decarboxylase), DBH, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), which synthesize dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline, respectively, were also decreased in PD brains, indicating that all catecholamine systems were widely impaired in PD brains. Programmed cell death of the nigro-striatal dopamine neurons in PD has been suggested from the following findings on postmortem brains: (1) increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6; (2) increased levels of apoptosis-related factors such as TNF-alpha receptor R1 (p 55), soluble Fas and bcl-2, and increased activities of caspases 1 and 3; and (3) decreased levels of neurotrophins such as brain-derived nerve growth factor (BDNF). Immunohistochemical data and the mRNA levels of the above molecules in PD brains supported these biochemical data. We confirmed by double immunofluorescence staining the production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in activated microglia in the putamen of PD patients. Owing to the recent development of highly sensitive and wide-range analytical methods for quantifying mRNAs and proteins, future assays of the levels of various mRNAs and proteins not only in micro-dissected brain tissues containing neurons and glial cells, but also in single cells from frozen brain slices isolated by laser capture micro-dissection, coupled with toluidine blue, Nissl staining or immunohistochemical staining, should further contribute to the elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of PD and other neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric diseases.",

Analyses were performed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) and Sector Field Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS). Significantly lower levels of Co, Cr, Fe, Pb, Si and Sn were observed in the CSF of PD patients compared with those in controls, with a percentage of depletion up to 50% for Cr and Pb. No such variations were detected for all the other elements. Results suggested that Pb, Cr, Fe were the most suitable elements to distinguish between normality and PD. Different cut-off concentrations for these elements could be tentatively proposed as a predictive tool for the PD condition.",

    "abstract": "The present manuscript reviews novel data on the progressive involvement of different regions of the central nervous system as well as peripheral nerves in Parkinson's disease. Most of these regions are involved in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system, and their damage is concomitant with the specific loss of sympathetic cardiac axon terminals. This causes a cardiovascular dysfunction, which occurs solely in Parkinsonian patients. In order to specify the peculiarity of this cardiovascular alteration we coined the term \"Parkinsonian Heart\". This is characterized by a severe loss of the physiological noradrenergic innervation and a slight impairment of central autonomic control and it is often characterized by drug-induced morpho-functional alterations. In fact, the current dopamine substitution therapy could make worse such an already abnormal heart. For instance, structure-activity studies on dopamine substitutive drugs report that dopamine agonists belonging to the class of ergot derivatives may produce, with a high frequency, valvular fibrosis in Parkinsonian patients. These effects recently became a major issue and led to consider all ergot dopamine agonists as dangerous for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In the present review we re-describe the effects of dopamine agonist within the specific context of the Parkinsonian heart. In line with this, additional factors need to be considered: 1--The lack of noradrenergic innervation which might play a significant role in the fibrogenic mechanism. 2--The ergot structure per se, which is not sufficient, but it is rather the ability to act as agonist at 5HT(2B) or alpha-noradrenergic receptors to determine the fibrotic reaction. Therefore, we suggest that binding to these receptor subtypes, joined with the lack of endogenous noradrenergic innervation, might synergize to produce the cardiac fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this mini-symposium is to discuss some of the inherited forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) in view of recent data suggesting that some of the proteins affect cellular signaling pathways. As an illustration, we shall focus on two different kinases associated with recessive and dominant forms of PD. Mutations in the mitochondrial kinase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog)-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are loss-of-function mutations in a normally neuroprotective protein. Loss-of-function mutations in model organisms have variable effects, from dramatic muscle and spermatid defects in Drosophila to more subtle neurophysiological abnormalities in mice. Several lines of evidence relate these to the action of a second gene for familial PD, parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase shown recently to have effects on Akt signaling. Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a cytosolic kinase, are dominant and have the opposite effect of causing neuronal damage. The mechanism(s) involved are uncertain at this time because LRRK2 is a large and complex molecule with several domains. Increased kinase activity accounts for the action of at least some of the mutations, suggesting that hyperactive or misregulated kinase activity may lead to the damaging effects of LRRK2 in neurons. For both PINK1 and LRRK2, the following key question that needs to be answered: what are the physiological substrates that mediate effects in cells? Here, we will discuss some of the recent thinking about physiological and pathological roles for signaling in PD and how these may have therapeutic implications for the future.",

    "abstract": "In addition to motor symptoms, patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) show deficits in sensory processing. These deficits are thought to result from deficient gating of sensory information due to basal ganglia dysfunction in PD. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) has been shown to improve sensory deficits in PD, e.g. STN-DBS normalizes the perception of urinary bladder filling in patients with PD. This study aimed at investigating how STN-DBS modulates the processing of urinary bladder information to elucidate the (patho-)physiology of sensory gating mechanisms in PD. Nine PD patients with bilateral STN-DBS switched on (STN-DBS ON) or off (STN-DBS OFF) were studied during dynamic bladder filling and an empty bladder condition (for control), while changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were measured by PET. Urinary bladder filling led to an increased rCBF in the periaqueductal grey (PAG), the posterior thalamus, the insular cortex as well as in the right frontal cortex and the cerebellum bilaterally. A significant interaction between bladder condition and STN-DBS was observed in the posterior thalamus and the insular cortex, with enhanced modulation of these areas during STN-DBS ON compared to STN-DBS OFF. Furthermore, regression analyses revealed a modulation of the neural activity in the thalamus and the insular cortex by the PAG activity during STN-DBS ON only. Thus, STN-DBS led to a significant enhancement of afferent urinary bladder information processing. The data suggest that STN-DBS facilitates the discrimination of different bodily states by supporting sensory perception and the underlying neural mechanisms. Furthermore, this is the first imaging study, which shows an effect of STN-DBS on sensory gating in PD patients and its neural basis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a chronic Parkinson's disease mouse model will display less certainty in its gait pattern due to basal ganglia dysfunction. A chronic Parkinson's disease mouse model was induced by injecting male C57/BL mice with 10 doses of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (25mg/kg) (MPTP) and probenecid (250 mg/kg) (P) over 5 weeks. This chronic model produces a severe and persistent loss of nigrostriatal neurons resulting in dopamine depletion and locomotor impairment. The control mice were treated with probenecid alone. Fifteen weeks after the last MPTP/P treatment, the mice were videotaped in the sagittal plane with a digital camera (60 Hz) as they ran on a motorized treadmill at a speed of 10 m/min. The indices of gait and gait variability were calculated. Stride length was significantly (p=0.016) more variable in the chronic MPTP/P mice. Additionally, the chronic MPTP/P mice had a statistically less certain gait pattern when compared to the control mice (p=0.02). These results suggest that variability in the gait pattern can be used to evaluate changes in neural function. Additionally, our results imply that disorder of the basal ganglia results in less certainty in modulating the descending motor command that controls the gait pattern.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to examine the dynamics of bilateral multiple segment resting and postural tremor in 12 young, older subjects and eight Parkinson's (PD) patients in their different medication states. A second aim was to investigate whether bilateral independence of upper limb tremor was preserved for PD patients with amplified tremor under conditions where no upper limb segment was supported. Under these conditions, the likelihood for mechanical transmission between segments was increased. Tremor was recorded, bilaterally, from the hand and finger segments of all subjects. In addition to the PD subjects exhibiting greater tremor under both on/off medication states than the young/old control subjects, the tremor increase within limb from the hand to the finger was 2-3 times greater for the PD group in comparison to the healthy subjects. Despite this increased tremor, no differences were observed in the level of coupling between limbs across groups. Furthermore, the degree of coupling between limbs for the PD group was unaffected by their medication state. Overall, these results demonstrate that bilateral independence of tremor in PD participants is preserved despite conditions which maximised the chance of increased coupling.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms involved in neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) are not known, although recent studies performed in PD experimental models suggest that cdk5/p25 plays a predominant role. In the present study, we examined the gyrus cinguli of cases with PD and compared them with age-matched controls, and we demonstrated an activation of the calpain/cdk5 pathway. We found an increase in the p25/p35 immunoreactivity ratio and in the expression of transcription factor E2F-1. Our results implicate the cdk5/p25 pathway and re-entry into the cell cycle in the process of neuronal loss in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, multifactorial neurodegenerative disease affecting about 2% of the population over 65\u2005years. Etiopathogenetic mechanisms of PD are not fully understood, although a number of factors contributing to the selective degeneration of substantia nigra neurons have been identified, including mitochondrial dysfunction, proteasomal impairment, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and inflammation. Although a global view of the disease at the molecular level can be obtained only from the biochemical analysis of the affected human tissue, difficulties in obtaining human specimens of the affected area have limited substantially the number of reports published to date. Therefore, cellular and animal models of the disease have been developed to investigate single factors contributing to disease pathogenesis, e.g., protein aggregation or altered dopamine homeostasis. In this review, we report how proteomic methodologies have been used so far to investigate cellular and animal models of PD, as well as to compare postmortem specimens of substantia nigra of affected patients to that of control subjects. Proteomic studies concur to highlight the role of a compromised antioxidant defense in PD pathogenesis. The proteomic approach in the investigation of etiopathogenetic mechanisms of PD is still at its beginning, however, the findings reviewed here should serve as a useful foundation to further work.",

In the present review, the aim was to define the ECG characteristics before and after ablation of an accessory A-V pathway in patients with Ebstein's anomaly. In a series of 224 patients studied at the Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia \"Ignacio Ch\u00e1vez\", Sixty-four patients (28%) had documented tachycardia. Thirty-three patients with recurrent tachycardia were found to have a single right-sided AP that was successfully ablated. Only 21 of 33 patients (62%), had typical of ECG pattern of preexcitation. In addition, none of the patients had an ECG pattern of RBBB during sinus rhythm. Radiofrequency catheter ablation resulted in appearance of RBBB in 94% patients. The absence of RBBB in patients with Ebstein's anomaly and recurrent tachycardia had a 98% sensitivity and 92% specificity for the diagnosis of an AP. One third of patients with Ebstein's anomaly and symptomatic tachyarrhythmias have minimal or absent ECG features of ventricular preexcitation. In these patients, the absence of RBBB pattern is a strong predictor of an AP.",

The effect of the treatment on lexical tone was of particular interest. Four Cantonese speakers with idiopathic Parkinson's disease received treatment based on the principles of Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT). Outcome measures included perceptual measures and acoustic correlates of loudness, pitch, intonation, and tone (only intonation and tone are detailed in this study). All four participants demonstrated an increase in loudness, an increase in pitch and pitch range, and improved intonation during connected speech, as measured perceptually and acoustically. However, there were no obvious changes in the accuracy of lexical tone production, based on either phonetic transcription or acoustic analysis. The lack of improvement in lexical tones may support previous claims of a dissociation in fundamental frequency control for intonation and lexical tone production.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the concurrent validity of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (Ham-A) for evaluating anxiety in a group of 46 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The magnitude of correlations between the scales was high (all p<0.01), indicating a good concurrent validity. The item-by item analysis indicated that the main characteristics of anxiety in PD patients were 'inability to relax', 'restlessness or inability to feel calm' and 'feeling tense'. The association between anxiety, as measured by the HADS-A, with demographic characteristics or clinical features of PD was not significant, supporting existing data suggesting that anxiety in PD is not closely correlated with the severity of motor symptoms or the degree of disability. The HADS-A may be the most appropriate scale for documenting patient-reported anxiety in depression.",

This study analyzed the feasibility of a prospective investigation of Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP) and standard Physical Therapy (PT) treatments in individuals with mild-moderate PD. Treatment took place at two sites: 1) CDP therapy at the Southeast Parkinson's Disease Research Education and Clinical Center (PADRECC) within a Veterans Affairs Medical Center and 2) standard physical therapy at a community outpatient rehabilitation center. Final analysis compared 15 patients randomly assigned for therapy to either the CDP or PT treatments. Therapy time was eight weeks (four weeks of CPD or PT followed by home therapy for four weeks). The CDP therapy included gradually intensified closed chain and mobility training. Standard PT consisted of upright, mat, and theraball exercises and gait training. The home exercise phase was identical for both groups. The pilot data demonstrated treatment was tolerated by 68 percent of the sample despite the occurrence of a progressive neurological condition and medical comorbidities. While results failed to reveal any differences between treatment groups, both groups demonstrated improvement on selected outcome measures. An expanded prospective study with methodological improvements appears warranted.",

    "abstract": "Classical Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the appearance of Lewy bodies (LBs) in affected brain regions, showing mostly compact alpha-synuclein deposition, in contrast with punctate or granular deposition, hypothesized to represent early stages of aggregation. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the commonest mutated gene in inherited and idiopathic PD. LRRK2 mutation carriers display a diverse neuropathology, including alpha-synuclein and tau inclusions, suggesting an upstream role for LRRK2 in protein aggregation. We studied LRRK2 expression throughout the normal human brain with three different antibodies. We also examined the pattern of LRRK2 expression in relation to alpha-synuclein aggregation and LB formation in the brainstem of sporadic LB disease. Physiological LRRK2 expression was not restricted to regions preferentially affected in PD and LRRK2 often localized to the nuclear envelope in addition to the known cytoplasmic expression. In PD, we were able to consistently detect LRRK2 in the halo of a minority (approximately 10%) of nigral LBs using three different antibodies. Only one antibody detected LRRK2 in the core of approximately 80% of classic LBs. In the lower brainstem, most notably in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, we found previously unrecognized LRRK2 labelling of complex globular lesions, filled with LB-like matter showing a punctate or granular staining for alpha-synuclein. This was often accompanied by strong LRRK2 expression within dystrophic neurites. Our findings confirm widespread physiological LRRK2 expression in the human brain and suggest an association of LRRK2 with possible early-stage alpha-synuclein pathology in the brainstem of PD.",

The ferritin L-chain is one of these genes, but the rare insertional mutations that cause neuroferritinopathy with basal ganglia degeneration have not yet been identified in PD.\nWe used denaturing HPLC (DHPLC) to investigate 124 PD patients and 180 controls for variations in the coding and in the 5' untranslated regions of the H- and L-ferritin genes.\nIn the H-ferritin gene, we found one new and rather common intronic polymorphism and the K54R substitution in two controls. The L-ferritin gene showed a very common L55L polymorphism and four other types of DNA variations, three of which were in the patient cohort. A mutation of the conserved His133 to Pro was found in a PD patient and in his daughter. The patient did not show signs of neuroferritinopathy, but the mutation was associated with low L-ferritin levels and with mild chronic anemia.\nThe results support the hypothesis that DNA variations in the ferritin genes are not a common cause for PD.",

    "abstract": "Four decades after L-dopa introduction to PD therapy, the cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown despite the intensive research and the discovery of a number of gene mutations and deletions in the pathogenesis of familial PD. Different model neurotoxins have been used as preclinical experimental models to study the neurodegenerative process in PD, such as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and rotenone. The lack of success in identifying the molecular mechanism for the degenerative process in PD opens the question whether the current preclinical experimental models are suitable to understand the degeneration of neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons in PD. We propose aminochrome as a model neurotoxin to study the neurodegenerative processes occurring in neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons in PD. Aminochrome is an endogenous compound formed during dopamine oxidation and it is the precursor of neuromelanin, a substance whose formation is a normal process in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. However, aminochrome itself can induce neurotoxicity under certain aberrant conditions such as (i) one-electron reduction of aminochrome catalyzed by flavoenzymes to leukoaminochrome o-semiquinone radical, which is a highly reactive neurotoxin; or (ii) the formation of aminochrome adducts with alpha-synuclein, enhancing and stabilizing the formation of neurotoxic protofibrils. These two neurotoxic pathways of aminochrome are prevented by DT-diaphorase, an enzyme that effectively reduces aminochrome with two-electrons preventing both aminochrome one-electron reduction or formation alpha synuclein protofibrils. We propose to use aminochrome as a preclinical experimental model to study the neurodegenerative process of neuromelanin containing dopaminergic neurons in PD.",

    "abstract": "Among the cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) rest tremor is the least responsive to dopaminergic treatment, raising the assumption that it may not be directly related to the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Apomorphine is a potent short-acting dopamine agonist that rapidly ameliorates symptoms of PD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to which apomorphine can suppress tremor in patients with idiopathic PD compared to other symptoms. The study group included 18 patients with Parkinson's disease. Increasing doses of 1mg, 2mg, and 4 mg of subcutaneous apomorphine were used. Treatment response was assessed with the motor section of the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS). Tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia were scored using specific items of the UPDRS. UPDRS motor score improved from 31.5+/-9 at baseline to 20.0+/-6.4 after treatment. The scores for tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity improved after administration of apomorphine. The improvement in each of these scores for each individual patient was not significantly different, i.e., the magnitude of improvement was similar for all symptoms. These results indicate that subcutaneous apomorphine appears to be as effective in the treatment of tremor in Parkinson's disease as compared to the other symptoms.",

Results revealed that there were no differences of the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism between PD patients and the controls. Analysis of age at onset stratified by MTHFR C677T polymorphism showed a trend of early age at onset in the PD patients carrying with T allele. The genetic influence was particularly significant in late-onset PD (onset age at or older than 60 years) with an early age at onset for 3.4 years. However, the MTHFR C677T polymorphism was not associated with the risk to develop dyskinesia, motor fluctuation and psychosis induced by levodopa in PD patients. In conclusion, results of the study revealed that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism could significantly influence age at onset of PD in Chinese population, but neither as a genetic susceptibility nor as a predictor of levodopa-induced adverse effects in PD.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the cognitive and psychiatric outcome 6 months after bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using a disease control group.\n23 patients who underwent DBS were compared with 28 medically treated patients with PD at baseline and at 6 months for neuropsychological measures. In addition to the group outcomes, we report reliable change indices (RCI) and a dementia caseness analysis.\nPatients who underwent DBS demonstrated a significant decline in verbal memory compared with the control group (p<0.003), and trends for decline on oral information processing, including verbal fluency, timed transcription and word naming. Patients who underwent DBS demonstrated declines in attention, set shifting and semantic fluency but these changes were similar to the rate of decline in the PD group. RCI indicated that patients who underwent DBS demonstrated clinically significant declines in verbal fluency (p<0.01) and inhibition of a dominant response (p<0.003), with trends for declines in set shifting (p<0.02) and verbal long term recall (p<0.08), indicative of frontostriatal dysfunction. Patients who underwent DBS did not demonstrate significant changes in depression, anxiety or psychological distress scores. The caseness analysis revealed that one of the patients who underwent DBS (4%) converted to dementia over 6 months compared with none of the PD controls.\nOur findings demonstrated that patients who underwent DBS experienced declines in verbal recall and trends for declines in oral information processing 6 months following surgery, even when good motor outcome was achieved. Potential candidates should be counselled about the risk of mild frontostriatal cognitive declines following DBS to weigh the risks and benefits of surgery.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has opened important perspectives on the pathophysiological bases and potential targets of treatment strategies for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Studies have been mainly focusing on motor cortical inhibitory phenomena. However, differences in patients and methods caused several discrepancies, particularly on the so-called long-latency cortical inhibition (LICI). We wanted to challenge such controversies by studying early, drug-na\u00efve patients, and by reproducing the original method that detected a pathologic LICI in IPD. We studied the motor potentials evoked in the first dorsal interosseous muscle on the more and the less parkinsonian side of the body in 18 asymmetrical untreated IPD patients in the early stages of their disease. We had 12 healthy controls. The TMS variables were the active motor threshold, the size of the motor-evoked potential, the cortical silent period and LICI. Average active motor threshold was similar in patients and controls, but its variability was significantly higher among patients (P<0.05). There was a trend for the cortical silent period to be shorter on the more affected side of the patients (P=0.1). Patients, especially on their more affected side, exhibited a late LICI peak, which was absent among controls (P<0.05). This effect was independent of the silent period duration. However, patients and controls having a short silent period also had a shorter LICI (P<0.05). Changes in LICI had a strong trend to correlate to the severity of the parkinsonian signs (P=0.1). Thus, the present study definitely reinforced several previous TMS findings in IPD as a feature of the \"pure\" disease pathophysiology. The pathologic enhancement of late LICI can act as a candidate physiological hallmark of IPD, to be tested in various diagnostic or therapeutic circumstances.",

    "abstract": "Enhancement of neurogenesis could be a suitable treatment approach to up-regulate dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, we focused on the kinetics of the subventricular zone (SVZ) in a mouse model of PD induced by MPTP injection. We showed recently the proliferation potential of neuronal stem cells (NSCs) prepared from the olfactory bulb of an animal model of PD [Hayakawa, H., Hayashita-Kinoh, H., Nihira, T., Seki, T., Mizuno, Y., Mochizuki, H., 2007. The isolation of neural stem cells from the OB of Parkinson's disease model. Neurosci. Res.]. In this study, we examined the relationship between proliferation and differentiation of NSCs in SVZ of both acute and chronic PD models. Only acute MPTP treatment significantly increased the areas of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing cells and decreased the areas of polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM)-expressing cells in the SVZ. In the case of caspase-11 knockout mice, MPTP did not induce alteration in the areas of GFAP-expressing cells and PSA-NCAM-expressing cells. Our results suggest that neuroinflammation related to the caspase-11 cascade in the striatum regulates differentiation of neural stem cells in the SVZ of our mouse model of PD.",

    "abstract": "The main pathology underlying disease symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons. No effective disease-modifying treatment currently exists. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects and it enhances dopaminergic function in animal models of PD. These findings raise the possibility that intrastriatal administration of GDNF might be developed into a new clinical strategy for functional preservation and restoration also in PD patients. Gene therapy is a novel tool to increase local levels of GDNF. Transplantation of encapsulated, GDNF-secreting cells is one strategy for ex vivo cell-based gene delivery which has the advantage to allow for removal of the cells if untoward effects occur. Here we summarize studies with such cells in animals, and discuss the results from previous trials with GDNF in PD patients and their implications for the further development of neuroprotective/neuroregenerative therapies. Finally, we describe the different scientific and regulatory issues that need to be addressed in order to reach the clinic and start the first trial in patients.",

    "abstract": "The development of a cell therapy for the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease is a realistic ambition. It is pursued by researchers and companies alike, and spans different donor tissue types of embryonic, fetal and adult origins. In this review, we briefly outline the past and current status of research and clinical trials with cell transplantation in Parkinson's disease. We discuss studies on donor tissue derived from embryonic ventral mesencephalon and assess the current research on various forms of stem cells of both embryonic and adult origins in the quest to develop a cell-based therapy for this debilitating movement disorder.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that sporadic Parkinson's disease has a long prodromal period during which several non-motor features develop, in particular, impairment of olfaction, vagal dysfunction and sleep disorder. Early sites of Lewy pathology are the olfactory bulb and enteric plexus of the stomach. We propose that a neurotropic pathogen, probably viral, enters the brain via two routes: (i) nasal, with anterograde progression into the temporal lobe; and (ii) gastric, secondary to swallowing of nasal secretions in saliva. These secretions might contain a neurotropic pathogen that, after penetration of the epithelial lining, could enter axons of the Meissner's plexus and, via transsynaptic transmission, reach the preganglionic parasympathetic motor neurones of the vagus nerve. This would allow retrograde transport into the medulla and, from here, into the pons and midbrain until the substantia nigra is reached and typical aspects of disease commence. Evidence for this theory from the perspective of olfactory and autonomic dysfunction is reviewed, and the possible routes of pathogenic invasion are considered. It is concluded that the most parsimonious explanation for the initial events of sporadic Parkinson's disease is pathogenic access to the brain through the stomach and nose - hence the term 'dual-hit'.",

    "abstract": "We sought to explore the phenomenon of disproportionate antecollis in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The etiology is much debated and the main issue is whether it represents a primary myopathy or is secondary to the underlying motor disorder. The clinical, electrophysiological, and biopsy data of MSA or PD patients with antecollis were reviewed. We reviewed 16 patients (7 MSA and 9 PD) who developed antecollis during the course of their disease. The interval between onset of motor symptoms and of antecollis was shorter in the MSA group (4.6 +/- 1.7 years vs. 10.5 +/- 7.0 years). In 6 patients, the antecollis developed subacutely, and in 2 the abnormal neck flexion was initially an off-period phenomenon. Two additional patients also showed some dopa-responsiveness. Clinically, the antecollis was characterized by a forward flexion and anterior shift of the neck, with prominent cervical paraspinal and levator scapulae muscles, usually without weakness of residual neck extension. Electromyography of cervical paraspinal muscles showed mixed myopathic, normal, and neurogenic units, without early recruitment. Cervical paraspinal muscle biopsy in 2 patients disclosed fibrosis and nonspecific myopathic changes. We suggest that, in the context of MSA or PD, the initiating event in antecollis could be a disproportionately increased tone in anterior neck muscles that leads to secondary fibrotic and myopathic changes. However, a primary but yet unexplained neck extensor myopathy still remains the alternative possibility and longitudinal studies are necessary to settle this issue.",

    "abstract": "There have been a few studies and inconsistent results regarding the coincidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) and atherosclerotic diseases, such as cerebrovascular disease. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is a known marker for subclinical atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the carotid IMT between PD patients and controls. We studied 43 patients with PD and 86 matched controls. The carotid IMT in PD patients was significantly smaller than in controls (0.796 +/- 0.179 mm vs. 0.913 +/- 0.237 mm, P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, the carotid IMT was inversely associated with the duration of levodopa medication and the severity of PD. These results suggest that PD patients have a lower risk of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation in Parkinson's disease (PD) is well-established but little is known about the lifetime of implanted pulse generators (IPG). To investigate the lifetime of the bilaterally implanted Itrel II(R) (Medtronic, Minneapolis) pulse generator, the first 49 consecutive patients with PD having been operated on at our center for bilateral STN chronic stimulation were reviewed with noting of the stimulation parameters in use prior to IPG replacement. The mean electrical voltage was 3.2 +/- 0.3 V, mean pulse width was 65 +/- 10 mus, and mean frequency was 145 +/- 16 Hz. Replacement of an IPG was anticipated in 25% due to unilateral low-battery signaling, or end of life. In either case, replacement of the contralateral IPG was undertaken simultaneously. The mean IPG lifetime was 83 +/- 14 [40-113] months. The IPG lifetime correlated with the total electrical energy delivered (P = 0.002, r = -0.496). Unilateral IPG end-of-life generally led to subacute worsening of contralateral parkinsonism. In 25% of patients, there was also a worsening of axial symptoms leading to potential medical emergencies such as falls (10%), aspiration pneumonia (10%), or psychosis (5%). A close monitoring of patients and an anticipation of IPG replacement in the case of a low-battery signal are recommended.",

Heterozygous LRRK2 Gly2385Arg variant was identified in 14 of 235 patients with Parkinson's disease (5.69%), but not in 214 unrelated healthy controls. Multivariate analysis indicated the frequency of Gly2385Arg variant in the female patients with early age at onset is higher than their male counterparts. The founder haplotype analysis showed the variant carriers shared the same founder. Clinically, the LRRK2 Gly2385Arg carriers presented with classical Parkinson's disease symptoms.

    "abstract": "Our previous studies and those of others have strongly suggested that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway plays a critical role in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced dopaminergic neuron injury in the substantia nigra. However, the downstream mechanism that accounts for the proapoptotic actions of JNK in 6-OHDA lesion remains to be investigated in detail. Fas, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family with proapoptotic functions, was reported to be elevated within the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. In the present study, we examined the changes in the protein level of Fas ligand (FasL) and its interaction with Fas in a rat model of PD. We demonstrate that the expression of FasL and not Fas was increased after 6-OHDA lesion; additionally, the interaction of FasL and Fas was increased due to 6-OHDA lesion. This indicates that the 6-OHDA-induced activation of Fas signaling pathway is mediated by JNK and that FasL may be a promising target in the therapeutic approach for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the development of a fluorogenic substrate for 17beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 10 (17beta-HSD10), which is a multifunctional metabolic enzyme fulfilling several metabolic roles (beta-oxidation of fatty acids, catabolism of isoleucine, and metabolism of steroids). In recent years, it has emerged as an important stress and pathological marker in neurons and glial cells (expression down-regulation in Parkinson's disease, up-regulation and association with beta-amyloid peptide in Alzheimer's disease). Through the iterative molecular design and chemical synthesis described herein, compound 1 was developed, which possesses all required properties for a selective optical reporter substrate: alcohol-ketone optical switching, the ability to function as a good enzyme substrate (expressed in kinetic parameters), cell permeability, and cell retention. Probe 1 provides a blue-to-green/yellow bright switch and enables non-invasive, real-time imaging of 17beta-HSD10 in live human cells. The selectivity of reporter 1 was established by the quantitative correlation of metabolic activity to protein expression in human kidney cell line HEK-293T.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation is thought to involve a remapping of the kinematic and kinetic parameters associated with movements performed within a changing environment. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are known to be affected on this type of learning process, although the specific role of dopamine depletion in these deficits has not yet been elucidated. The present study was an attempt to clarify whether dopamine depletion in PD may directly affect the capacity to internally reorganize the visuomotor remapping of a distorted environment. Fourteen PD patients were tested twice, while they were treated and while they were withdrawn from their regular levodopa treatment. Fourteen control subjects were also enrolled and tested twice. Two parallel forms of the Computed Mirror Pointing Task (CMPT), requiring making a reaching movement in a visually transformed environment (mirror inversion), were administered to each participant. Each of them had to perform 40 trials at each of the 2 testing sessions. At each trial, sensorimotor adaptation was evaluated by the initial direction angle (IDA), which reflects the direction of movement before any visually guided readjustment. Results revealed no IDA difference at baseline, between control subject and PD patients, whether they were treated or not. In all group, IDA values at that time were large, reflecting a tendency to make movements according to the real life visuomotor mapping (based on the natural direct vision). However, striking differences appeared during sensorimotor learning, in that IDA reduction along trials was poorer in patient not treated with levodopa than both control subjects and the same PD patient treated with levodopa. No difference was observed between the treated PD patients and control subjects. Given that IDA is thought to reflect the internal representation of the visuomotor mapping, it is concluded that dopamine depletion in PD would affects sensorimotor adaptation, in that it facilitates old and poorly adapted movements (real life mapping), instead of new and more adapted ones (mirror transformed mapping).",

    "abstract": "Interest in serotonergic involvement in Parkinson's disease (PD) has focussed recently on the possibility that the remaining serotonin neurons innervating striatum (caudate and putamen) might release dopamine as a 'false transmitter'--an action that could have both beneficial and harmful (e.g. promotion of levodopa-induced dyskinesias) consequences. Evidence for a brain serotonergic disturbance in PD is derived in large part from findings of decreased binding of different radioligands to the serotonin transporter (SERT), one 'marker' of serotonin neurons. However, it is not known whether the reported changes in SERT binding reflect actual changes in levels of SERT protein or whether concentrations of all serotonin markers are similarly and markedly decreased in the two striatal subdivisions. We measured levels of SERT immunoreactivity, and for comparison, protein levels of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH; the marker synthetic enzyme) using a Western blot procedure, as well as concentrations of serotonin, its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and dopamine by HPLC in post-mortem striatum of patients with PD and normal controls. Whereas concentrations of dopamine were severely decreased (caudate, -80%; putamen, -98%) and showed little (caudate) or no (putamen) overlap between individual control and patient values, levels of all four serotonin markers were less markedly reduced (-30% to -66%) with some patients having distinctly normal levels. Unlike the preferential loss of dopamine in putamen, the caudate was affected more than putamen by loss of all serotonin markers: serotonin (-66% versus -51%), 5-HIAA (-42% versus -31%), SERT (-56% versus -30%) and TPH (-59% versus -32%). Striatal serotonin concentration was similar in the subset of patients reported to have had dyskinesias versus those not reported to have had this drug complication. Previous findings of decreased SERT binding are likely explained by loss of SERT protein. Reduced striatal levels of all of the key serotonergic markers (neurotransmitter and metabolite, transporter protein, synthesizing enzyme protein) provide strong evidence for a serotonergic disturbance in PD, but with some patients affected much more than others. The more marked caudate reduction suggests that raphe neurons innervating this area are more susceptible to 'damage' than those innervating putamen and that any functional impairment caused by striatal serotonin loss might primarily involve the caudate. Questions related to the, as yet undetermined, clinical consequences in PD of a striatal serotonin deficiency (caudate: cognitive impairment?) and preservation (putamen: levodopa-induced dyskinesias?) should be addressed in prospective brain imaging and pharmacological studies.",

    "abstract": "Our collective thinking about Parkinson disease (PD) has been heavily influenced by the dramatic response to dopamine replacement therapy. For progress to continue, however, we need to take a broad view of this disorder, which includes recognition of the following. First, substantial evidence now indicates that dopamine oxidation is unlikely to substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Second, levodopa therapy is not associated with neurotoxicity. Third, the first neurons affected in PD are nondopaminergic; the substantia nigra and other dopaminergic nuclei are affected only later in the course. Thus, PD is much more than degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system. Fourth, in the current era, most of the disability of advancing PD is from involvement of nondopaminergic systems, including levodopa-refractory motor symptoms, dementia, and dysautonomia. Motor complications associated with levodopa therapy can be problematic, but they can be controlled in most, using available medications and deep brain stimulation surgery. We have reached the point of diminishing therapeutic returns with drugs acting on dopamine systems; more dopaminergic medications will provide only modest incremental benefit over current therapies. Finally, the benefits from transplantation surgeries aimed at restoring dopaminergic neurotransmission will be limited because later-stage PD disability comes from nondopaminergic substrates.

    "abstract": "Several reports suggest that higher levels of serum uric acid are associated with a lower risk of Parkinson disease (PD). None of these studies, however, evaluated the potential association between gout, a condition characterized by hyperuricemia, and the risk of PD.\nTo estimate prospectively the association between gout diagnosis and the risk of PD.\nWe conducted a case-control study nested in the General Practice Research Database, a computerized database that gathers information on more than 3 million Britons followed up by their general practitioners. PD cases occurring between January 1995 and December 2001 were identified, and matched with up to 10 controls by sex, age, practice, and start of follow-up. We obtained information on history of gout and use of anti-gout medication using the computerized medical records.\nDuring the study period, we identified 1,052 PD cases and 6,634 controls. Individuals with previous history of gout had a lower risk of developing PD (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48, 0.99). This association was evident among men (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40, 0.91) but not among women (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.57, 2.81; p for interaction: 0.11). Initiation of anti-gout medication was associated with a lower risk of PD (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.19, 1.70).\nGout is associated with a lower risk of Parkinson disease (PD). Our findings provide additional support for a potential link between uric acid and PD. Further research is required to explore a potential effect modification by sex.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) walk with a shortened stride length and high stride-to-stride variability, a measure associated with fall risk. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) improves stride length but the effects on stride-to-stride variability, a marker of fall risk, are unknown. The effects of RAS on stride time variability, swing time variability and spatial-temporal measures were examined during 100-m walks with the RAS beat set to 100 and 110% of each subject's usual cadence in 29 patients with idiopathic PD and 26 healthy age-matched controls. Carryover effects were also evaluated. During usual walking, variability was significantly higher (worse) in the patients with PD compared with the controls (P < 0.01). For the patients with PD, RAS at 100% improved gait speed, stride length and swing time (P < 0.02) but did not significantly affect variability. With RAS at 110%, reductions in variability were also observed (P < 0.03) and these effects persisted 2 and 15 min later. In the control subjects, the positive effects of RAS were not observed. For example, RAS increased stride time variability at 100 and 110%. These results demonstrate that RAS enables more automatic movement and reduces stride-to-stride variability in patients with PD. Further, these improvements are not simply a by-product of changes in speed or stride length. After walking with RAS, there also appears to be a carryover effect that supports the possibility of motor plasticity in the networks controlling rhythmicity in PD and the potential for using RAS as an intervention to improve mobility and reduce fall risk.",

The aim of this study is to assess the usefulness of the Parkinson's disease questionnaire--PDQ-39 (Brazilian Portuguese Version) in measuring QoL of PD patients with or without motor fluctuations. Fifty-six PD patients with mean disease duration of 7.4 years were assessed and 41 of them (73.3%) had motor fluctuations. The PDQ-39 has eight dimensions ranging from 0 to 100; being the higher the score, the worse the QoL. Comparing groups with and without motor fluctuations showed that the dimensions mobility, activities of daily living (ADL), communication and bodily discomfort scored higher in the fluctuating group. There was a tendency to see that the higher the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) scale stages, the higher the PDQ-39 scores. Patients suffering from the disease for more than five years had worse PDQ-39 scores only in the items ADL and communication, when compared with those with the disease for < 5 years. The PDQ-39 is an instrument that detects decrease in QoL of PD patients and the presence of motor fluctuations predicts QoL reduction.",

    "abstract": "Excessive synchronization of basal ganglia neural activity at low frequencies is considered a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, few studies have unambiguously linked this activity to movement impairment through direct stimulation of basal ganglia targets at low frequency. Furthermore, these studies have varied in their methodology and findings, so it remains unclear whether stimulation at any or all frequencies < or = 20 Hz impairs movement and if so, whether effects are identical across this broad frequency band. To address these issues, 18 PD patients chronically implanted with deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in both subthalamic nuclei were stimulated bilaterally at 5, 10 and 20 Hz after overnight withdrawal of their medication and the effects of the DBS on a finger tapping task were compared to performance without DBS (0 Hz). Tapping rate decreased at 5 and 20 Hz compared to 0 Hz (by 11.8+/-4.9%, p=0.022 and 7.4+/-2.6%, p=0.009, respectively) on those sides with relatively preserved baseline task performance. Moreover, the coefficient of variation of tap intervals increased at 5 and 10 Hz compared to 0 Hz (by 70.4+/-35.8%, p=0.038 and 81.5+/-48.2%, p=0.043, respectively). These data suggest that the susceptibility of basal ganglia networks to the effects of excessive synchronization may be elevated across a broad low-frequency band in parkinsonian patients, although the nature of the consequent motor impairment may depend on the precise frequencies at which synchronization occurs.",

In situ hybridization studies in rodent brains have suggested a predominantly neuronal expression of PINK1 mRNA but immunocytochemistry of human brain tissue has shown PINK1-like immunoreactivity in both neurons and glia. In this study, we assessed the comparative distribution of PINK1 mRNA in human, rat and mouse brain. We observe that in humans PINK1 message is expressed in neurons with very little to no signal in glia and confirms similar findings in rodent tissue. Highest levels of expression were observed in hippocampus, substantia nigra and cerebellar Purkinje cells. We also show that PINK1 mRNA expression is similar in nigral neurons from neurologically normal controls and sporadic Parkinson's disease cases.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in alpha-synuclein were the first genetic defect linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). The relevance of alpha-synuclein to sporadic PD is strongly supported by the presence of alpha-synuclein aggregates in neurons of patients. This has prompted the development of numerous animal models based on alpha-synuclein overexpression, primarily through genetic methods in mice and viral transduction in rats. In mice, different promoters and transgenes lead to a wide variety of phenotypes accompanied by non-existent, late onset, or non-specific neurodegeneration. Rapid neurodegeneration, in contrast, is observed after viral transduction but is limited to the targeted region and does not mimic the broad pathology observed in the disease. Overall, each model reproduces a subset of features of PD and can be used to identify therapeutic targets and test disease-modifying therapies. The predictive value of all models of the disease, however, remains speculative in the absence of effective neuroprotective treatments for PD in humans.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of PD can be difficult in elderly patients because some of the key PD symptoms also may be manifestations of normal aging. Asymmetrical symptom onset, resting tremor,and sustained response to levodopa are key features that suggest a diagnosis of PD. For most patients, PD progresses fairly slowly. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms, thereby allowing quality of life and functional ability to be maintained. Pharmacologic therapies are primarily targeted at stimulating dopaminergic receptors, either by increasing the levels of dopamine or by using dopamine agonists. Levodopa, the main therapy for PD and a precursor of dopamine, has a short half-life and is quickly metabolized.Accordingly, decarboxylase inhibitors, like carbidopa, are almost always administered with levodopa to prevent breakdown in the periphery. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)inhibitors, which increase dopamine levels by inhibiting the metabolism of levodopa and dopamine, recently have become available, including a tablet containing carbidopa, levodopa,and entacapone. Other pharmaceutical therapies for PD include dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, anticholinergic agents, and amantadine. Dopamine agonists, anticholinergic agents, and amantadine are associated with an increased risk of hallucinations or other adverse events in elderly patients; therefore, use of these should be avoided in this population. Surgical management, particularly deep brain stimulation(DBS), is an option for patients who are refractory to pharmaceutical therapy. Although patients may not need levodopa as an initial treatment, over time most patients will require this drug to control symptoms. With chronic levodopa therapy, patients ultimately experience a wearing off in levodopa response and other motor complications. Management of wearing off is a significant challenge in the treatment of patients with advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have been performed with automatic motion analysis techniques to investigated the locomotor disorders of patients with severe Parkinson's disease (PD). These are mainly related to steady-state walking. Aim of the present study was to investigate the presence and the degree of these disorders in patients at early stages of PD. For this purpose a group of patients with mild PD (H&Y < or =2) and a group of age-matched controls were assessed by means of multifactorial analysis of kinematic and kinetic variables, during the execution of the following motor tasks: steady-state walking, gait initiation and turning around an obstacle. Results showed that PD patients did not differ from controls in steady-state walking, while significant differences emerged in gait initiation and turning strategies. Main differences consisted in a limitation of the amplitude of the imbalance phase and of the first step, and, for the turning task, in a delayed initiation of the turning movement, with an altered head-trunk rotational strategy. It is concluded that patients in early stages of PD do not reveal, during steady state walking, consistent impairments of kinematic and kinetic patterns typical of severe PD patients. Nevertheless, they present significant alterations in transient conditions such as gait initiation and change of walking direction. The above results suggest that a quantitative analysis of locomotor tasks which imply the transition from one condition to another, could provide parameters useful for the characterization of early stage PD patients and, potentially, markers for a precox differential diagnosis respect other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by parkinsonisms.",

The occurrence of dyskinesias in three short trials was too low to draw any conclusion. The results of the longer trials indicate a lower occurrence of dyskinesias in the BR tier. In five trials that evaluated dystonia, this motor complication occurred less frequently in the BR tier. However, for both dyskinesias and dystonia a statistically significant difference in favour of BR emerged only in the largest trial. There was a trend for wearing-off and on-off fluctuations to occur less frequently in the BR group. Although all trials evaluated participants at the impairment level, only the largest trial reported a significantly larger improvement for the LD tier during the first year of therapy. Concerning disability, which was evaluated by five trials no statistically significant differences were found. Overall, a statistically larger number of dropouts occurred in the BR group because of an inadequate therapeutic response or intolerable side effects.\nBased on a qualitative review of the available data we conclude that in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease, bromocriptine may be beneficial in delaying motor complications and dyskinesias with comparable effects on impairment and disability in those patients that tolerate the drug.",

    "abstract": "In a case-control study involving 400 study subjects, we found a higher prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in our Parkinson's disease (PD) patients compared to controls (3.0% vs 0.5%) (odds ratio 6.2) (p=0.07). Polysomnographic studies confirmed that study subjects with RLS had grossly elevated PLMS index, PLMS arousal index and reduced sleep efficiency. None of these PD patients reported a family history of PD or RLS. The average age of onset of RLS was 61.7+/-10.8 years old. The mean global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of PD patients was significantly higher than the controls (9.1+/-4.5 vs 4.3+/-2.8, p<0.0001). All the seven components of PSQI in PD patients were significantly different from controls (p<0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that only Hoehn and Yahr staging correlated with the global PSQI score (p<0.0001). Similar results were obtained when we compared the PSQI score between PD patients without RLS with controls. Our case-control study demonstrated a weak association between RLS and PD. PD patients have significant poor quality of sleep, and this correlated with the severity of PD. RLS did not play an important role in sleep dysfunction in our PD cohort. A high index of suspicion for sleep problems in advanced PD patients is important as early management could improve their quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Gene therapy is now a very promising approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, for which there are currently few treatment options. However, gene therapy is invasive and irreversible, and its long-term effects are not yet known. Regulatable vectors allow the expression of the introduced gene to be adjusted or stopped by changing the dose of an oral inducer drug, thus adding an important safety mechanism as well as the ability to tailor the dose to an individual patient's needs. Although the use of conventional gene therapy should not be delayed until regulatable systems are available, clinical trials of regulatable gene therapies are imminent. Regulatable systems provide the best hope for safely delivering effective, flexible treatments over the long course of Parkinson's disease, and their development should be actively supported.",

    "abstract": "There are recent reports that alexithymia may be associated with brain dysfunction involving frontal lobes or right hemisphere regions. However, little is known about the relationship between alexithymia and cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). The authors investigated the neuropsychological correlates of alexithymia in a population of 70 nondemented PD patients and 70 controls. Alexithymia was screened using the 20-item version of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Standardized scales that measure verbal episodic memory, executive functions, abstract reasoning, and visual-spatial and language abilities were adopted. PD patients with alexithymia performed worse than both PD patients without alexithymia and controls with or without alexithymia on tasks requiring visual-spatial processing. Moreover, regression analyses showed that, in PD patients, but not in controls, poor performance on a constructional praxis task predicted high scores on the TAS-20 subscale, which assesses difficulty in identifying emotions. These data evidence an association between alexithymia and visual-spatial processing alterations in PD patients, supporting the view that the right hemisphere could be specifically involved in the modulation of some facets of alexithymia.",

    "abstract": "A meta-analysis was conducted on 25 longitudinal studies involving 901 initially non-demented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients to examine the magnitude of decline across multiple cognitive domains associated with disease progression. Pooled effect sizes reflecting the standardized difference between baseline and follow-up neuropsychological performance were calculated for 8 cognitive domains using a random-effects model. Relatively small effect sizes were found across all cognitive domains (d = .00 - .40). During a mean follow-up interval of 29 months, significant declines were detected in global cognitive ability (d = .40), visuoconstructive skills (d = .32), and memory (d = .29). Age showed a significant relation with decline in global cognitive ability and memory. Lower educational level was associated with greater decline in all cognitive domains. Studies with longer follow-up intervals yielded larger effect sizes for global cognitive ability. In non-demented PD patients, changes in cognitive functions over time appear to be modest. Educational level, age, and length of the follow-up interval are likely to affect the magnitude of decline in several domains. Methodological flaws, such as selection bias and uncontrolled practice effects, may have caused underestimation of the true extent of decline.",

    "abstract": "Whether nicotine has therapeutic effects on Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms is controversial, but high doses and chronic treatment have never been tested. We report the results of a pilot, open-label trial to assess the safety and possible efficacy of chronic high doses of nicotine. Six patients with advanced idiopathic PD received increasing daily doses of transdermal nicotine up to 105 mg/day over 17 weeks. All patients but one accepted the target dose. Nausea and vomiting were frequent but moderate, and occurred in most of the patients (four of six) who received over 90 mg/day and 14 weeks of nicotine treatment. During the plateau phase, patients improved their motor scores and dopaminergic treatment was reduced. These results confirm the feasibility of chronic high dose nicotinic treatment in PD but warrant validation of the beneficial effects by a randomized controlled trial.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) share many similar aspects, and making a clinical diagnosis of one disorder over the other relies heavily on an arbitrary criterion, so-called 1-year rule. This study was designed to search for any difference of metabolic patterns in these two disorders using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) images. We enrolled 16 patients with PD, 13 patients with PDD, and seven patients with DLB. FDG PET was performed, and images were reconstructed by iterative reconstruction using the computed tomography (CT) images, and were normalized to a standard template. Statistical comparison between groups were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis using t-statistics (two-sample t-test). Compared with the patients with PD, both PDD and DLB patients showed similar patterns of decreased metabolism in bilateral inferior and medial frontal lobes, and right parietal lobe (P(uncorrected) < 0.001). In a direct comparison, DLB patients had significant metabolic decrease (p(uncorrected) < 0.005) in the anterior cingulate compared with those with PDD. These findings support the concept that PDD and DLB have similar underlying neurobiological characteristics, and that they can be regarded as a spectrum of Lewy body disorders.",

    "abstract": "We analysed non-motor symptoms (NMS) related to autonomic dysfunction in 3414 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) enrolled in the multicentre registry of the German Competence Network on PD. Orthostatic hypotension (> 20 mmHg systolic or > 10 mmHg diastolic) was reported for 10% of women and 11% of men, urinary incontinence for 22% of women and 21% of men, sexual dysfunction for 8% of women and 30% of men (50% of whom reported erectile dysfunction) and sleep disturbances for 43% of women and 35% of men. Autonomic symptoms occurred in a frequency similar to severe disabling dyskinesia which was reported for 16% of women and 11% of men. A logistic regression analyses with age, sex and disease duration as covariates revealed a significant correlation of orthostatic hypotension and urinary incontinence with age and disease duration whilst sexual dysfunction was related to age only. These observations suggests that the effects of the PD process and ageing contribute to non-levodopa responsive NMS. Sleep disturbances were more common in women and a correlation was found with disease duration only supporting the notion that sleep is specifically affected in PD.",

    "abstract": "The number of dopamine agonists (DA) used in Parkinson's disease (PD) is gradually increasing. They have different affinity to the dopamine receptor subtypes. When choosing one of these drugs one should consider its efficacy in monotherapy in early phase and in combined therapy with levodopa in advanced PD, side effects profile, effectiveness in non-motor symptoms of PD, dosing and route of administration. The efficacy of new DA (pramipexol, ropinirol, cabergoline) is probably higher than bromocriptine and comparable to pergolide with similar profile of the most common side effects (headache, vertigo, nausea, somnolence, oedema). However, fibrosis of the pleura, peritoneum and pericardium as well as valvular heart disease (caused by noninflammatory fibrotic degeneration) are significantly more common after ergoline DA (pergolide, cabergoline). Pramipexol shows antidepressant activity. Ropinirol is metabolised by the liver and can be safely administered in renal insufficiency. Pramipexol is excreted in urine and the risk of interaction with other drugs metabolised in the liver is reduced. Rotigotine is the only DA available as skin patches. Whenever necessary, one DA agent can be changed safely overnight to another one.",

    "abstract": "There is a long lasting discussion in the literature how should we begin the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The author presents the arguments, why the treatment should not be started with agonists of dopamine receptors but with levodopa. The clinical efficacy of levodopa is certainly much higher than that of agonists. It is probably related to the fact that levodopa leads to the production of natural neurotransmitter in the striatum - the dopamine. Even the best artificial agonist cannot fully mimic the function of dopamine. And there are no doubts that levodopa does not hasten the parkinsonian neurodegeneration. Starting the treatment with an agonist one does not achieve as good results as with levodopa, and later when the addition of levodopa becomes a necessity, there is already such a destruction of substantia nigra that the effect is unsatisfactory for patients. Therefore the treatment of Parkinson's disease should be started with levodopa.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine agonists (DA) are a class of drugs which is currently developing and expanding. They started to be used as a supplement to levodopa therapy for reducing fluctuations and dyskinesia in the 80's and 90's. In the past 10 years dopamine agonists have more often been considered as an initiating therapy in PD. Dopamine agonist therapy was chosen ahead of levodopa because it reduced the risk of motor complication development and probable neuroprotective effect. Dopamine agonists offers other advantages over levodopa: they act directly on dopamine receptors, and therefore metabolic conversion is not required for the effect to be exerted; the circulating plasma amino acids do not compete with DA for absorption and transport into the brain; DA have a longer half-life than levodopa and they do not undergo oxidative metabolism and do not generate free radicals or induce oxidative stress. The efficiency and safety of DA therapy in the early stage of PD has been proven in many evidence-based medicine trials. The antiparkinsonian effect of DA was superior to the placebo and comparable to levodopa in early-stage PD. The most important advantage of DA is proven reduced occurrence of motor complications in comparison with levodopa.",

    "abstract": "Environmental toxins, genetic predisposition and old age are major risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the mechanism(s) underlying selective dopaminergic (DA) neurodegeneration remain unclear, molecular studies in both toxin based models and genetic based models of the disease suggest a major etiologic role for mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of PD. Further, recent studies have presented clear evidence for a high burden of mtDNA deletions within the substantia nigra neurons in individuals with PD. Ultimately, an understanding of the molecular events which precipitate DA neurodegeneration in idiopathic PD will enable the development of targeted and effective therapeutic strategies. We review recent advances and current understanding of the genetic factors, molecular mechanisms and animal models of PD.",

    "abstract": "Even early in Parkinson disease (PD), individuals have reduced economy of movement. In this case report, the effects of endurance exercise training are examined on walking economy and other measures for 3 individuals in early and middle stages of PD.\nThe patients were 1 woman and 2 men with PD, aged 52 to 72 years, classified at Hoehn and Yahr stages 2 to 2.5.\nEach patient completed 4 months of supervised endurance exercise training and 12 months of home exercise, with monthly clinic follow-up sessions. Strategies were included to enhance adherence to exercise.\nThe main outcome measure was economy of movement (rate of oxygen consumption during gait) measured at 4 treadmill speeds. Secondary outcome measures included the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Continuous-Scale Physical Functional Performance Test (CS-PFP), Functional Reach Test (FRT), and Functional Axial Rotation Test (FAR). Economy of movement improved for all 3 patients after 4 months of supervised exercise and remained above baseline at 16 months. Two patients also had scores that were above baseline for UPDRS total score, CS-PFP, FRT, and FAR, even at 16 months.\n: Evidence from these 3 individuals suggests that gains may occur with a treadmill training program that is coupled with specific strategies to enhance adherence to exercise.",

    "abstract": "At present, dopamine agonists play an important role in antiparkinsonian therapy since they were proved effective in the management of both advanced- and early-stage Parkinson's disease. In the latter, they are often regarded as first-choice medication to delay the introduction of levodopa therapy. Despite sharing the capacity to directly stimulate dopamine receptors, dopamine agonists show different pharmacological properties as they act on different subsets of dopamine receptors. This, in theory, provides the advantage of obtaining a different antiparkinsonian activity or safety profile with each agent. However, there is very little evidence that any of the marketed dopamine agonists should be consistently preferred in the management of patients with Parkinson's disease. Pergolide and cabergoline are now considered a second-line choice after the proven association with valvular fibrosis. Transdermal administration (rotigotine) and subcutaneous infusion (apomorphine) of dopamine receptor agonists are now available alternatives to oral administration and provide continuous dopaminergic stimulation. Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion during waking hours leads to a large reduction in daily 'off' time, dyskinesias and levodopa daily dose. Almost all currently used dopamine agonists are able to provide neuroprotective effects towards dopaminergic neurons during in vitro and in vivo experiments. This neuroprotection may be the result of different mechanisms including antioxidation, scavenging of free radicals, suppression of lipid peroxidation and inhibition of apoptosis. However, the disease-modifying effect of these agents in Parkinson's disease remains to be ascertained.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common genetic determinant of Parkinson disease (PD) identified to date, and have been implicated in both familial and sporadic forms of the disease. The G2019S change in LRRK2 exon 41 has been associated with disease at varying frequencies in Asian, European, North American, and North African populations, and is particularly prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews.\nWe assessed the occurrence of the LRRK2 G2019S, I2012T, I2020T, and R1441G/C/H mutations in our cohort of Jewish Israeli patients with PD, and determined the LRRK2 haplotypes in 76 G2019S-carriers detected and in 50 noncarrier Ashkenazi patients, using six microsatellite markers that span the entire gene.\nOnly the G2019S mutation was identified among our patients with PD, 14.8% in the Ashkenazi and 2.7% in the non-Ashkenazi patients, and in 26% and 10.6% of the Ashkenazi familial and apparently sporadic cases. The carrier frequencies in the Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi control samples were 2.4% and 0.4%. A common shared haplotype was detected in all non-Ashkenazi and half-Ashkenazi carriers and in all full-Ashkenazi carriers tested, except two. Women and patients with a positive family history of PD were significantly over-represented among the G2019S mutation carriers. Age at disease onset was similar in carriers and noncarriers.\nOur data suggest that the LRRK2 G2019S mutation plays an important role in the causality of familial and sporadic Parkinson disease (PD) in Israel and that gender affects its frequency among patients. Although testing symptomatic patients may help establish the diagnosis of PD, the value of screening asymptomatic individuals remains questionable until the penetrance and age-dependent risk of this mutation are more accurately assessed, and specific disease prevention or modifying interventions become available.",

    "abstract": "The bioavailability of drugs used to treat chronic diseases such as Parkinson's disease may have important implications for their clinical utility. Drugs with low bioavailability may cause a wide variation in clinical response between patients and even in the same patient. In addition, numerous factors - including gender, age, and gastric motility - may affect a drug's bioavailability. This is especially important in patients with Parkinson's disease, who develop response fluctuations as the disease progresses. Strategies that may improve the bioavailability of levodopa, the most efficacious medication for Parkinson's disease, include coadministering levodopa with carbidopa, a decarboxylase inhibitor, or with a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor or using an alternative route of administration. Other adjunctive therapies used to treat Parkinson's disease have a wide range of bioavailabilities, which may also affect clinical outcomes. The bioavailability of adjunctive medications may be improved by the use of alternative formulations as well, such as orally disintegrating tablets or transdermal delivery. Considering bioavailability of a medication when prescribing drugs to treat Parkinson's disease may improve patient response and minimize adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative/nitrosative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra during Parkinson's disease (PD). During early stages of PD, there is a significant depletion of the thiol antioxidant glutathione (GSH), which may lead to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately neuronal cell death. Mitochondrial complex I (CI) is believed to be the central player to the mitochondrial dysfunction occurring in PD. We have generated a dynamic, mechanistic model for mitochondrial dysfunction associated with PD progression that is activated by rotenone, GSH depletion, increased nitric oxide and peroxynitrite. The potential insults independently inhibit CI and other complexes of the electron transport chain, drop the proton motive force, and reduce ATP production, ultimately affecting the overall mitochondrial performance. We show that mitochondrial dysfunction significantly affects glutathione synthesis thereby increasing the oxidative damage and further exacerbating the toxicities of these mitochondrial agents resulting in neurodegeneration. Rat dopaminergic neuronal cell culture and in vitro experiments using mouse brain mitochondria were employed to validate important features of the model.\nUsing a combination of experimental and in silico modeling approaches, we have demonstrated the interdependence of mitochondrial function with GSH metabolism in relation to neurodegeneration in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and typically treated by dopamine replacement. This treatment, although very effective in the early stages of the disease, is not curative and has side-effects. As such there has been a search for a more definitive treatment for this condition, which has mainly concentrated on replacing the lost neurons with neural grafts. Possible cell sources for replacement range from autologous grafts of dopamine secreting cells to allografts of fetal ventral mesencephalon and neural precursor cells derived from fetal tissue or embryonic stem cells. Some of these cells have been the subject of clinical trials, which to date have produced disparate outcomes. Therefore, whilst cell therapies remain a promising treatment for PD, there is need for further refinement of the techniques involved in this experimental procedure, before any new trials in patients are undertaken.",

    "abstract": "Rotigotine is a new, non-ergot dopamine agonist formulated in a transdermal delivery system. The present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the rotigotine transdermal patch in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease. Patients (n = 561) were randomized to rotigotine, ropinirole, or placebo. The titration period was up to 13 weeks, and there was a minimum dose-maintenance period of 24 weeks for ropinirole and 33 weeks for rotigotine. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a minimum of 20% decrease in the combined Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part II and Part III scores. The responder rate in the rotigotine group was significantly higher than in the placebo group (52% vs. 30%, P < 0.0001). Transdermal rotigotine at doses < or =8 mg/24 h did not show noninferiority to ropinirole at doses < or =24 mg/day. In a post-hoc subgroup analysis, rotigotine < or =8 mg/24 hours had a similar efficacy to ropinirole at doses < or =12 mg/day. The rotigotine transdermal patch was well tolerated. The most common adverse events were application-site reactions, nausea, and somnolence. Application-site reactions were predominantly mild or moderate in intensity. In conclusion, the rotigotine transdermal patch represents an effective and safe option for the treatment of patients with early Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Altered glutamatergic neurotransmission is central to the expression of Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms and may underlie l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Drugs acting on glutamate metabotropic receptors (mGluR) of group I can modulate subthalamic nucleus (STN) overactivity, which plays a pivotal role in these phenomena, and may counteract dyskinesias. To address these issues, we investigated the effects of a 3-week treatment with mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), or of a subthalamic lesion, on abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) and associated striatal expression of transcription factor FosB/Delta FosB caused by chronic l-DOPA administration, in rats with a nigrostriatal lesion. MPEP virtually abolished AIMs and reduced, dramatically, striatal expression of FosB/Delta FosB. Reduced FosB/Delta FosB expression, coupled with nonsignificant reduction of AIMs, was also observed in STN-lesioned rats. Our data confirm the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the pathogenesis of dyskinesias and the potential of mGluR5 antagonists in the treatment of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias.",

    "abstract": "Electric stimulation therapy is one of the surgical treatments for Parkinson's disease whereby a chronic stimulating electrode is placed on the subthalmic nucleus (STN). Because medical treatments centered around L-dopa have limitations in severe Parkinson's disease, electric stimulation therapy is regarded as an appropriate treatment modality. Most Parkinson's disease patients experience lower urinary tract disorders such as urgency, daytime frequency or nocturia, due to detrusor overactivity. We conducted an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) analysis and a pressure flow study (PFS) on 6 patients before and after a chronic stimulating electrode was placed on the STN and evaluated how the subjective symptoms and bladder functions changed. As a result, the IPSS total value, involuntary detrusor contraction threshold volume and maximum bladder capacity were all found to significantly improve (P<0.05). The average IPSS decreased from 11.2 to 7.0. The average involuntary detrusor contraction threshold volume increased from 90.7 ml to 172.7 ml. The average maximal bladder capacity increased from 104.0 ml to 177.2 ml. These findings suggest that the STN the positively contributes to an improvement in urinary function.",

The control group consisted of 21 normal cases. The optic nerve head images were taken with Heidelberg Retina Tomograph; rim area, rim volume, mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and the results of Moorfields regression analysis were calculated. The measurement results were evaluated with Kruskal Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U-test.\nThere was no significant difference in mean age among groups (p=0.093). Retinal nerve fiber layer was measured to be significantly decreased in cases with Parkinson disease (p=0.004) while rim area and rim volume did not show a significant change (p=0.224, p=0.804 respectively). Rim area, rim volume, and retinal nerve fiber layer were significantly greater in the group treated with levodopa while it was the thinnest in the group receiving dopamine agonists.\nLevodopa can have a protective affect to retinal nerve fiber layer in Parkinson disease compared to dopamine agonists.",

    "abstract": "Different Parkinson's disease (PD) animal models reproduce the early phase of the disease, which deny the possible existence of a synergic effect of consecutive insults to the dopaminergic neurons. We proposed a novel protocol of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) nigrostriatal lesion, which consists in repeated MPTP intranigral administrations intending to differentiate effects of a single lesion in relation to repeated lesions. For this purpose, a schedule of 3-day intervals between the MPTP administrations, totalizing 3 infusions in 9 days were adopted. A persistent locomotor deficit was produced after the 2nd infusion, remaining until the last time-point. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive neurons were reduced in 50% 1 day after the 1st infusion and the neuronal loss remained constant even after the 2nd and 3rd MPTP infusions. In parallel, (TH) protein expression in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) revealed to be a sensitive target for MPTP, once it was found to be down-regulated immediately after the 1st MPTP exposure until the last time-point. These findings corroborate the concept of an early phase model of PD elicited by MPTP even when this neurotoxin was used according to the protocol currently proposed. The current protocol provided relevant insights about TH expression and irreversible locomotor impairment.",

    "abstract": "Despite the increased comprehension of the role of the basal ganglia in cognitive functions such as learning, attention, and executive functions, the exact implication of these structures in language remains unclear. A specific role of basal ganglia in language has been proposed. Nonetheless, a recent hypothesis gives the basal ganglia a non-language specific role in the inhibition of competing alternatives during later controlled processes of language production. In this study we assessed the production of both nouns and verbs in a population of 20 nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease (NDPD). Aspects of selection demands and stimulus-response association strength were investigated in both tasks. Performance of NDPD patients was compared with that of 20 matched elderly subjects. An impairment in verb production was found in PD patients. A selection effect on verb production was found in PD patients along with a greater effect of stimulus-response association strength. PD patients had the greatest difficulty in situations of weak stimulus-response association strength. A \"Task-Relevant-Response\" analysis carried out on stimuli (nouns) in condition of free association suggested that verb production happens in the context of strongly activated nouns. This means that, in order to produce a verb a switch has to be done from a task irrelevant to a task relevant response. Our results are in line with the proposed non-language specific involvement of the basal ganglia in the supervisory rather than the routine semantic processes required during lexical retrieval.",

The recent development of an orally disintegrating dosage form using Zydis technology allows pregastric drug absorption and, thus, greatly improving the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic drug profiles. This new formulation provides higher drug bioavailability and a substantially reduced concentration of active metabolites.

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is common in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), is resistant to treatment and negatively impacts quality of life. In this study an ambulatory FOG monitor was validated in 11 PD patients. The vertical linear acceleration of the left shank was acquired using an ankle-mounted sensor array that transmitted data wirelessly to a pocket PC at a rate of 100 Hz. Power analysis showed high-frequency components of leg movement during FOG in the 3-8 Hz band that were not apparent during volitional standing, and power in this 'freeze' band was higher (p=0.00003) during FOG preceded by walking (turning or obstacles) than FOG preceded by rest (gait initiation). A freeze index (FI) was defined as the power in the 'freeze' band divided by the power in the 'locomotor' band (0.5-3 Hz) and a threshold chosen such that FI values above this limit were designated as FOG. A global threshold detected 78% of FOG events and 20% of stand events were incorrectly labeled as FOG. Individual calibration of the freeze threshold improved accuracy and sensitivity of the device to 89% for detection of FOG with 10% false positives. Ambulatory monitoring may significantly improve clinical management of FOG.",

    "abstract": "Although the Tower of London (TOL) has been extensively used to assess planning ability in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the reported presence or extent of any planning deficits has been inconsistent. This may partly be due to the heterogeneity of the TOL tasks used and a failure to consider how structural problem parameters may affect task complexity. In the present study, planning in PD patients was assessed by systematically manipulating TOL problem structure. Results clearly disprove the identity assumption of problems with an equal number of minimum moves. Instead, substantial parts of planning performance were related to more subtle aspects of problem structure, such as subgoaling patterns and goal hierarchy. Planning in PD patients was not impaired in general but was affected when the information provided by the problem states was ambiguous in terms of the sequential order of subgoals, but not by increases in search depth.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) may be associated with increased energy metabolism in overactive regions of the basal ganglia. Therefore, we hypothesized that treatment with the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist memantine would decrease regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and oxygen metabolism in the basal ganglia of patients with early-stage PD.\nQuantitative positron emission tomography (PET) recordings were obtained with 15O]water and 15O]oxygen in 10 patients, scanned first in a baseline condition, and again 6 weeks after treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg memantine. Dynamic PET data were analyzed using volume of interest and voxel-based approaches.\nThe treatment evoked rCBF decreases in basal ganglia, and in several frontal cortical areas. The regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2) did not decrease in any of the a priori defined regions, and consequently the oxygen extraction fraction was increased in these regions. Two peaks of significantly decreased rCMRO2 were detected near the frontal poles in both hemispheres, using a posteriori voxel-based analysis.\nAlthough we did not find the predicted decrease in basal ganglia oxygen consumption, our data suggest that treatment with memantine actively modulates neuronal activity and/or hemodynamic response in basal ganglia of PD patients. This finding may be relevant to the putative neuroprotective properties of NMDAR antagonists.",

    "abstract": "In the present report, we extend our previous observations on corticomotor facilitation associated with covert (action observed or imagined) and overt (action imitated) action execution in old adults (Leonard and Tremblay in Exp Brain Res 117:167-175, 2007) to investigate the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD). Participants consisted of 22 older adults (age range 58-76 years) of whom 11 were medicated patients diagnosed with PD (patient group) and 11 were age-matched healthy controls (healthy group). Corticomotor facilitation was assessed by monitoring the changes in the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEP) in muscles of the right hand (first dorsal interosseous: FDI; and abductor digiti minimi: ADM) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex. In each group, corticomotor facilitation was assessed with participants seated in front of a computer screen under four testing conditions: (1) REST: eyes closed and instructions to relax for 10 s, (2) OBS: observe action, (3) IMAG: imagine action and (4) IMIT: imitate action. The action depicted in the video displayed the hand of a male subject cutting a piece of material with scissors. Comparison of variations in MEP amplitude revealed a significant interaction between groups and conditions. In the healthy group, the OBS and IMAG conditions were both associated with significant facilitation in the FDI and ADM, whereas the same conditions failed to produce facilitation in the PD group. In both groups, the IMIT condition produced the largest facilitation in hand muscles. Further planned comparisons revealed a significant difference between groups in the FDI for the OBS condition. From these findings, we conclude that, even when properly medicated, old adults with PD may experience major difficulties in engaging the motor system for covert actions, particularly when asked to observe another person's action. This failure of corticomotor facilitation for covert actions appears to be linked with the deficit in motor activation associated with basal ganglia dysfunction in PD and in line with the difficulty experienced in general by patients \"to energize\" the motor system in preparation for action.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease has traditionally been considered as a pure motor condition; characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and slow postural reflexes. The concomitant presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including dementia, has been increasingly recognized during the last decade.\nLiterature on epidemiology, neuropathology and clinical characteristics of dementia in Parkinson's disease was retrieved from PubMed.\nDementia in Parkinson's disease is more common than previously assumed. According to cross-sectional studies, up to 30% of the Parkinson patients have dementia and almost all patients with Parkinson' disease develop dementia over time. Dementia is associated with higher mortality, an increased risk of institutionalisation and increased caregiver distress. Reduced visuospatial and executive functions, severe motor symptoms and high age are risk factors for development of dementia. REM sleeping disorders, psychotic symptoms and depression are frequent comorbid conditions. Dementia in Parkinson's disease correlates with increased Lewy body pathology and reduced levels of neurotransmitters (especially acetylcholine) in neocortical and limbic structures of the brain. Treatment with acetylcholine esterase inhibitors has been shown to have moderate symptomatic effect.",

In addition, we identified in PGRN only 1 other null mutation, the nonsense mutation p.Arg535X, in 1 patient with probable AD.

    "abstract": "The etiology of sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) is not well established. Recent studies revealed that inflammatory processes might also play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. We hypothesized that genetically determined differences in the immune response, especially in anti-inflammatory cytokines production, might influence the risk of sporadic PD development and/or onset. To prove this hypothesis, two DNA polymorphisms at IL-10 promoter (-1082 and -519) were examined in sporadic PD patients.\nThe study enrolled 341 patients with diagnosed idiopathic PD. All cases of secondary parkinsonism were excluded from the study. For the purpose of this study the patients were also divided into two subgroups: group 1: patients with onset of Parkinson's disease, i.e., <50 years of age (early onset) included 60 patients, as well as group 2: patients with onset of Parkinson's disease >50 years of age (late onset) comprising 281 subjects. Control samples were from 315 randomly selected healthy individuals from the same geographical region who were free from signs of parkinsonism as evaluated by consultant neurologists. PCR-RFLP methods were used for genotyping.\nNo statistically significant differences between PD patients and controls were found in the frequency of a single locus (-1082, -519) of IL-10 promoter. Likewise, haplotype analysis did not demonstrate any significant differences between evaluated groups. The frequency of the evaluated IL-10 genotypes was also similar in EOPD and LOPD patients.\nResults from our study revealed that the IL-10 (-1082G>A, -592C>A) polymorphism is not a risk factor of sporadic Parkinson's disease in a Polish population.",

    "abstract": "We investigated executive function in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and focused on executive dysfunction in PD with hallucinations, but without dementia.\nPD patients were classified by cognitive or neuropsychotic status as PD group, PD with vivid dreaming group, PD with hallucinations group and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) group. Psychomotor speed tests, the Stroop test, a verbal fluency test and the Self-rating Depression Scale were performed.\nThe PDD group showed poorer scores in every test compared with the PD group. The PD with hallucinations group showed results similar to those of the PDD group, while the PD with vivid dreaming group was similar to the PD group.\nThe study suggests that PD patients with hallucinations, not extensive enough to qualify as dementia, already have executive dysfunction similar to that seen in PDD patients.

    "abstract": "Surgeries involving transplantation of fetal dopamine (DA) neurons into the caudate-putamen of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been performed in various clinical trials to examine a potential restoration of motor function. The absence of studies in non-human primates to define the best transplantation protocols have lead to the use of a broad variety of techniques that potentially could have a major impact on the clinical outcome. The effects of using different cell and tissue preparation, and surgical targets, remain unknown. For this purpose, 20 St. Kitts African Green Monkeys (AFG) rendered parkinsonian by i.m. injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) were balanced into 4 groups and unilaterally grafted in the (a) caudate or (b) putamen with fetal ventral mesencephalic (VM) tissue as (c) solid pieces or as a (d) cell suspension. By 9 months post-transplantation all animals showed significant and similar behavioral improvement as determined by a UPDRS based PD scale. Postmortem analyses showed that VM transplants survived in all animals. They were located in both surgical target sites, producing a broad DA reinnervation of the targeted nuclei that could also extend to the non-grafted nucleus on the ipsilateral side. Although no differences between groups were found in survival of DA neurons or degree of DA reinnervation, there was a significant correlation between striatal reinnervation and behavioral recovery only in animals transplanted in the putamen surgical target. Additionally, there was in general a stronger glial reaction to solid grafts than to cell suspensions. These studies provide data for the optimal time course, cell preparation and surgical targets for systematic examinations of both potential benefits and side effects of dopamine neuron cell transplantation in primate models of PD.",

    "abstract": "No current therapy for Parkinson disease has been shown to slow or reverse the progressive course of the disease. As a departure from traditional treatments, gene therapy approaches provide a new hope for realizing this long-sought goal; but before they can be widely employed for use in patients, they must first be submitted to the rigorous safety and efficacy standards of the clinical trial. Some of the challenges of gene therapy clinical trial design are similar to those in studies of conventional pharmacological agents and include addressing the heterogeneity of the disease, the need for clinical and surrogate endpoints, and the issue of distinguishing \"symptomatic\" from \"neuroprotective\" effects. Gene therapy trials also raise the issues of the risks of viral therapy, issues of dose-response, the need for sham surgery, and the long duration of risks and benefits. We conclude that the most feasible designs are for those treatments that are expected to produce a rapid improvement in directly observable symptoms. Trials of agents which are expected to produce only a slowing of progression and not a reversal of the disease course are likely to take much longer and will require the development of methods to assess quality of life and other non-motor aspects of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) increases greatly with age, and the baby-boomer population can expect to generate a large number of individuals with the disease, all of whom will have significantly increased medical care needs over periods of 20 years or more. This emerging healthcare burden to our society calls for accelerated efforts to understand this disease better and treat it more effectively. The growing interest in gene therapy grew out of a recognition that new medicines may be needed to combat the relentless progression of the disease in the face of conventional pharmaco-therapies and surgical interventions that have so far failed to offer more than palliative relief. The potential of gene therapy to alter dramatically the course of the disease lies very much with the challenge of converting a research tool into a medical option, a process that clearly requires a unique combination of rigor and flexibility. In this review, we examine the unique aspects of gene therapy that make its use in PD attractive, but also analyze the difficulties of employing a medicine that acts for the rest of the patient's life.",

The development of levodopa was the first breakthrough and, since then, other compounds have been developed. Each antiparkinsonian medication has its own profile of efficacy and adverse effects, and these can largely be explained by their modes of action. As patients receive a number of different compounds, physicians should be aware of the differences of agents and understand how these differences may relate to clinical practice.

    "abstract": "The PARK10 locus is associated with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD), but the responsible gene remains to be identified. Genes associated with familial PD, as well as biochemical evidence from sporadic PD and animal models, have implicated components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in PD pathogenesis. One attractive candidate gene at the PARK10 locus is RING-Finger Protein 11 (RNF11), the deduced amino acid sequence of which predicts a RING-H2 domain common to E3 ubiquitin ligases such as parkin. To facilitate understanding of this protein and its possible role in PD, we characterized the expression and localization of RNF11 in brain. We detected RNF11 transcript and protein and provided the first direct evidence that RNF11 is expressed in brain. Immunohistochemical analysis of RNF11 protein in rat and human brain, using 2 different antibodies, corroborated the mRNA findings. Both antibodies show that RNF11 is restricted to neurons and excluded from white matter. Moreover, RNF11 is expressed by vulnerable neurons of the substantia nigra and sequestered into Lewy bodies in brains of patients with idiopathic PD. Collectively, these findings identify RNF11 as a strong candidate gene at the PARK10 locus and highlight its potential significance in the development of the common form of PD.",

    "abstract": "Although the neuropsychological differences between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) have been scrutinized in several studies, no study to date has directly compared the cognitive impairment profiles of patients with mild PDD and those with mild AD. In this study, we investigated the cognitive changes of mild PDD patients as compared with age- and education-matched normal controls and matched mild AD patients.\nThirty-one patients with PDD, 24 patients with probable AD (pAD), and 50 controls were recruited prospectively. All the subjects were evaluated with a battery of detailed neuropsychological tests for the assessment of attention, memory, language, and the visuospatial and frontal executive functions.\nThe PDD and pAD groups demonstrated significant impairments in all cognitive domains compared with the control group. These cognitive declines attributable to dementia were similar in the PDD and pAD patients, but they were not identical. In the subdomain analysis, the pAD group demonstrated more marked changes in delayed memory performance than did the PDD group.\nOur result showed that the cognitive changes in mild PDD patients did not differ from those in the mild pAD patients, except for delayed memory items. We concluded that it is difficult to sharply distinguish between mild PDD and mild AD.",

    "abstract": "Human MTH1, an oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphatase, hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP thereby preventing its misincorporation into DNA. The present study was designed to investigate a possible link between the MTH1 Ile45Thr polymorphism and the development of sporadic Parkinson disease (PD). This case-control study consisted of 106 PD patients and 135 unrelated controls. MTH1 polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The results showed that Ile45/Thr45 heterozygote and Thr45 allele tended to be more frequent in sporadic PD, although statistically not significant (0.085 vs. 0.044, corrected p = 0.591 and 0.052 vs. 0.022, p = 0.080, respectively). Stratification analysis by gender showed that Ile45/Thr45 heterozygote tended to be more frequent in male PD patients than in male controls (0.113 vs. 0.038, corrected p = 0.480). The male PD patients exhibited a borderline statistically significant higher frequency of the Thr45 allele than the controls (0.073 vs. 0.019, corrected p = 0.050). These results suggested to us that the Thr45 allele of MTH1 might be associated with sporadic PD in the Chinese male population.",

The present review focuses on direct in vivo gene transfer vectors that have been developed to a degree that they have been successfully used in animal model of Parkinson's disease. Accordingly, the properties of recombinant adenovirus, recombinant adeno-associated virus, herpes simplex virus, and lentivirus are described and contrasted. In order for viral vectors to be developed into clinical grade reagents, they must be manufactured and tested to precise regulatory standards. Indeed, clinical lots of viral vectors can be produced in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) regulations using industry accepted manufacturing methodologies, manufacturing controls, and quality systems. The viral vector properties themselves combined with physiological product formulations facilitate long-term storage and direct in vivo administration.",

Therefore, cell therapies that aim to restore this degenerated dopaminergic network represent a promising strategy in helping to cure PD. In this review, the authors start by discussing the progress of research on the use of fetal ventral mesencephalic (VM) tissue in transplantation therapies in PD, both from the clinical and experimental perspectives. Then the issues pertinent to its adoption in the clinic are discussed, including the ethical and practical problems with its use, the varied composition of VM tissue that is implanted with the graft and how this may account for some of the problems seen in the clinical trials using this tissue, especially graft-induced dyskinesia. Finally other promising sources of tissue for PD cell therapy are described, including mesenchymal and embryonic stem cells, before concluding on what is the best approach to the cellular repair of the parkinsonian brain.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) for Parkinson's disease (PD) has recently been linked to the development of a number of nonmotor behavioral control problems. Punding, one of these nonmotor problems, is a term used to describe complex, purposeless stereotyped behaviors such as the repetitive handling or sorting of objects. A self-report questionnaire was adapted to assess punding in the context of dysfunctional hobby-related activities. We report the results of a survey of PD outpatients from a PD research clinic (n = 141) and non-PD controls (n = 103); conducted to identify clinical and psychological factors predictive of punding behaviors. The PD group reported hobbies and activities, which scored significantly higher on the Punding Scale than controls. Higher impulsivity, poorer disease-related quality of life, younger age of disease onset, and concomitant daily medication dosage from dopamine receptor agonists were independently predictive of higher Punding Scale scores in the PD group. These findings are similar to those seen in dopamine dysregulation syndrome, and provide further evidence for the role of impulsivity and age at disease onset in DRT-related nonmotor behavioral problems in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common disorder caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and other brain areas. Mutations in several genes have been associated with both autosomal dominant PD and recessive early onset Parkinsonism (EOP). Genomic rearrangements such as deletions or multiplications of one or more exons represent a common mutational mechanism for most of these genes and are not detectable with routine mutation screening techniques. MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification), is a cheap, simple, rapid, and sensitive tool to detect exon dosage alterations and specific point mutations in selected genes. We tested the recently developed PD-MLPA assay by using 13 positive control samples carrying known mutations in SNCA, LRRK2, Parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1 genes. We then applied this technique to screen 16 EOP patients who were then cross-tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR). All the mutations present in the positive control samples were clearly detected by MLPA. Moreover, three novel Parkin rearrangements were identified among EOP patients and confirmed by qPCR. Only two samples generated false positive duplications of LRRK2 exon 1 and UCH-L1 exon 9, respectively. These results show that PD-MLPA assay can simultaneously and effectively detect rearrangements in most PD genes (SNCA, Parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1) as well as the LRRK2 G2019S common mutation. Thus, the use of this novel platform can improve the analysis of such mutations, facilitating comprehensive genetic testing in PD and EOP.",

    "abstract": "We report on a patient who developed left arm rest/postural tremor at age 24 and responded well to trihexyphenidyl. One year later spastic paraparesis appeared, and multiple sclerosis was diagnosed on the basis of clinical, radiological, and laboratory evidence. Although paraparesis improved after immunosuppressant therapy, a complete picture of an asymmetric parkinsonian syndrome gradually developed. Excellent response to levodopa, drug-induced dyskinesias, and DaTSCAN revealing pathology congruent with Parkinson's disease (PD) indicate a coincidental etiopathogenetic relationship of both clinical entities: multiple sclerosis and PD. Genetic analyses focusing on autosomal recessive parkinsonism (parkin, DJ1, and PINK1) were negative. To the best of our knowledge, only 15 cases of parkinsonism in association with multiple sclerosis have been reported, and their relationship has been interpreted to be either causal or coincidental. This is the first report of a coincidence of both entities, in which the parkinsonian syndrome developed first and before age 30.",

Four different unimanual upper limb motor tasks were applied to 13 newly diagnosed, untreated PD patients and 13 age- and sex-matched controls. In a handwriting task, PD patients had significantly reduced sentence length and writing velocity, and decreasing letter height in the course of writing. Furthermore, PD patients performed an aiming task slower with than without target, and showed increased transposition in a pointing task. The results of this study extend previous observations of impaired complex upper limb movements to newly diagnosed, untreated PD patients.",

    "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) has been documented to precede or to co-occur with Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurological conditions associated with visual hallucinations. Cognitive dysfunction is present in PD, even at the early stages of these diseases. In this study we aimed to investigate the relationship between visual hallucinations and RBD in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Additionally, we evaluated the association of the cognition and the pattern of cognitive impairment with VHs and RBD, effects of factors like duration and severity of the disease and duration of levodopa usage.\nSeventy-nine patients, diagnosed as PD, were included the study and then, patients were divided into four groups; with RBD and VHs (group 1), with RBD but no VHs (group 2), with VHs but no RBD (group 3), without RBD and VHs (group 4). We compared each group with the others according to demographic characteristics and neuropsychological test scores.\nOf all patients, in 46% (n=36) RBD and in 48% (n=38) VHs were observed. Our study established VHs in 58% of patients with RBD, and RBD in 55% of patients with VHs. However, due to a 40% incidence of VHs in patients without RBD, RBD and VHs were not found to be correlated. All of the neuropsychometric test scores did not reveal significant difference between groups.\nAlthough it seems like there is a small association between RBD and VHs in our patients, it was not significant. Group 1 presented with significantly worse scores in UPDRS total scores and I, II subscores.",

The aim of the present study was to measure noun/verb generation abilities in PD and to determine whether noun/verb generation is affected by stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN).\n8 participants who had been diagnosed with PD and had received surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN as well as 15 control participants completed a noun/verb generation task with four probe-response conditions-namely, noun-noun, verb-noun, noun-verb and verb-verb conditions. Patients with PD were assessed while receiving STN stimulation and without stimulation.\nDuring the off stimulation condition, patients with PD presented with a selective deficit in verb generation compared with control participants. However, when receiving STN stimulation, patients with PD produced significantly more errors than controls during the noun-noun and verb-verb conditions, supporting evidence from previous studies that STN stimulation modulates a frontotemporal network associated with word generation. Finally, errors during verb generation were significantly correlated with item selection constraint (ie, the degree to which a response competes with other response alternatives) in the on stimulation condition, but not the off stimulation condition.\nOur results suggest that STN stimulation affects the ability to select from many competing lexical alternatives during verb generation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by a profound and selective loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Clinical manifestations of this complex disease include motor impairments involving resting tremor, bradykinesia, postural instability, gait difficulty and rigidity. Current medications only provide symptomatic relief and fail to halt the death of dopaminergic neurons. A major hurdle in development of neuroprotective therapies are due to limited understanding of disease processes leading to death of dopaminergic neurons. While the etiology of dopaminergic neuronal demise is elusive, a combination of genetic susceptibilities and environmental factors seems to play a critical role. The majority of PD cases are sporadic however, the discovery of genes linked to rare familial forms of disease (encoding alpha-synuclein, parkin, DJ-1, PINK-1 and LRRK2) and studies from experimental animal models has provided crucial insights into molecular mechanisms in disease pathogenesis and identified probable targets for therapeutic intervention. Recent findings implicate mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, abnormal protein accumulation and protein phosphorylation as key molecular mechanisms compromising dopamine neuronal function and survival as the underlying cause of pathogenesis in both sporadic and familial PD. In this review we provide an overview of the most relevant findings made by the PD research community in the last year and discuss how these significant findings improved our understanding of events leading to nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration, and identification of potential cell survival pathways that could serve as targets for neuroprotective therapies in preventing this disabling neurological illness.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new method for quantification of rigidity in elbow joint of Parkinsonian patients is introduced. One of the most known syndromes in Parkinson's disease (PD) is increased passive stiffness in muscles, which leads to rigidity in joints. Clinical evaluation of stiffness in wrist and/or elbow, commonly used by clinicians, is based on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating System (UPDRS). Subjective nature of this method may influence the accuracy and precision of evaluations. Hence, introducing an objective standard method based on quantitative measurements may be helpful. A test rig was designed and fabricated to measure range of motion and viscous and elastic components of passive stiffness in elbow joint. Measurements were done for 41 patients and 11 controls. Measures were extracted using Matlab-R14 software and statistic analyses were done by Spss-13. Relation between each computed measure and the level of illness were analyzed. Results showed a better correlation between viscous component of stiffness and UPDRS score compared to the elastic component. Results of this research may help to introduce a standard objective method for evaluation of PD.",

    "abstract": "We examined the coordination of multi-digit grasping forces as they developed during object grasping and lifting. Ten subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD; OFF and ON medication) and ten healthy age-matched control subjects lifted a manipulandum that measured normal forces at each digit and the manipulandum's position. The center of mass (CM) was changed from trial to trial in either a predictable (blocked) or unpredictable (random) order. All subjects modulated individual fingertip forces to counterbalance forces exerted by the thumb and minimize object tilt after lift-off. However, subjects with PD OFF exhibited an impaired ability to use anticipatory mechanisms resulting in less differentiated scaling of individual finger forces to the object CM location. Remarkably, these between-group differences in force modulation dissipated as subjects reached peak grip forces during object lift, although these occurred significantly later in subjects with PD OFF than controls and PD ON. Analysis of the tilt of the object during lift revealed all subjects had similar deviations of the object from the vertical, the direction of which depended on CM location. Thus these findings in subjects with PD indicate that: (a) PD-induced impairments in anticipatory force mechanisms appear to be greatly increased in multi-digit grasping as opposed to previous reports from two-digit grasping; (b) inaccurate scaling of fingertip force amplitude and sharing patterns before object lift is recovered during object lift; (c) the implementation of appropriate force amplitude and sharing among the digits during the lift occurs significantly later than for controls; (d) medication improves the temporal recovery of multi-digit force coordination. These results are discussed within the framework of PD-related deficits in sensorimotor integration and control of multi-degrees of freedom movement.",

    "abstract": "Selegiline orally disintegrating tablet (ODT; Zelapar) is a selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitor developed as an adjunct to levodopa (LD) for Parkinson disease. Most patients on long-term LD therapy eventually experience deterioration at the end of the LD dosing interval, with predictable \"wearing off\" and \"on-off\" fluctuations.\nWe conducted a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design trial of selegiline ODT. The primary efficacy point was reduction in the percentage of average daily \"off\" time. Secondary measures included reductions in daily off hours and total daily off time, Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I), and Patient Global Impression-Improvement (PGI-I). Patients on LD received selegiline ODT (1.25 mg/d for 6 weeks, then 2.5 mg/d for 6 weeks) or placebo. Safety and tolerability were measured.\nThe intent-to-treat population included 98 patients receiving selegiline ODT and 50 patients receiving placebo. Combined efficacy results for weeks 10 and 12 revealed an 11.6% reduction in percentage of daily off time for selegiline ODT versus a 9.8% reduction for placebo (NS). PGI-I detected a statistically significant difference between treatment groups in favor of selegiline ODT (P = 0.02), whereas CGI-I detected a strong trend toward improvement (P = 0.06). Selegiline ODT was safe and well tolerated.\nThis study showed no significant difference in improvement in percentage of off time with selegiline ODT versus placebo. Some clinical impressions (e.g., PGI-I, CGI-I) improved. This result contrasts with an identically designed study that showed a significant improvement in off time with selegiline ODT. A combined analysis of both studies suggested overall efficacy.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the Patient Card (PC), an instrument derived from the Patient Questionnaire by Stacy et al, for detection of wearing-off (W-O), in a very first application to a Spanish population with Parkinson disease. Patients were classified as experiencing W-O on the basis of the clinician's Follow-up Questionnaire, the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-Item 36, or improvement, after the following scheduled dose of medication, of 1 or more symptoms included in the PC. The highest proportion of patients with W-O was identified by the PC (79.8%), followed by the Follow-up Questionnaire (55.4%), and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (35.1%) (Cochran Q, P < 0.01). The PC Spanish version performed adequately, capturing W-O symptoms more frequently than did the other methods, as in the original Patient Questionnaire study by Stacy et al. Accordingly, the PC may potentially help clinicians identify W-O phenomena and thereby allow for better management of patients with Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "To assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy outcomes of an overnight switch from oral ropinirole, pramipexole, or cabergoline to rotigotine, a dopaminergic agonist with transdermal delivery over 24 hours in subjects with established Parkinson disease (PD).\nIn this open-label multicenter study, we hypothesized that the selected doses of transdermal rotigotine would provide at least equivalent antiparkinsonian actions in subjects with idiopathic PD not adequately controlled with oral ropinirole (up to 9 mg/d), pramipexole (up to 2 mg/d), or cabergoline (up to 3 mg/d). The tolerability of the rotigotine switch was evaluated by the number of subjects completing the scheduled 28-day treatment period, need for rotigotine dose reductions, and dropouts due to adverse events. Efficacy assessment relied on changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale from the baseline to the end of treatment in PD symptoms and subject preference of dopaminergic agonist.\nOf 116 PD subjects enrolled, 104 completed the 28-day rotigotine treatment. Fifteen subjects required rotigotine dose adjustment; of these, 11 completed the trial. The most common adverse events (generally mild or moderate in intensity) were application site reactions, nausea, and somnolence. The change to rotigotine was well tolerated. Rotigotine was preferred by 77% of subjects who were not adequately controlled by their previous oral dopaminergic agonist. The predetermined rotigotine substitutions provided improvements over baseline in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale II and III subscales.\nSubjects and clinicians found the overnight switch to rotigotine convenient, well tolerated, and effective for control of PD signs and symptoms for subjects previously receiving low-to-moderate doses of oral dopaminergic agonists.",

    "abstract": "To develop an efficient clinical screening battery to accurately predict the fitness to drive in people with Parkinson disease (PD).\nThis prospective study included 80 participants: 40 patients with PD and 40 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects. All participants were assessed using a driving simulator, a driving history survey, and the Clinical Dementia Rating. The patients with PD also underwent a clinical test battery and an evaluation of fitness to drive performed by an official center, which included visual, cognitive, and on-road tests. A two-class decision from this driving assessment center was the main outcome measure.\nA screening battery assessing four clinical variables (disease duration, contrast sensitivity, Clinical Dementia Rating, and motor part of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) provided the best model (R(2) = 0.52) to predict the fitness to drive and correctly classified 36 (90%) of the patients with PD as pass or fail (sensitivity = 91%, specificity = 90%). The Test Ride for Investigating Practical fitness to drive (TRIP) driving simulator score discriminated significantly between drivers with PD and their healthy peers (p = 0.0008). When the TRIP driving simulator score was added to the clinical model, the total explained variance increased (R(2) = 0.60) and correctly classified 39 (97.5%) of drivers with PD into the pass/fail category (sensitivity = 91%, specificity = 100%).\nA short clinical screening battery that measures disease duration, contrast sensitivity, cognitive and motor functions can predict fitness to drive in people with Parkinson disease with a high degree of accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to establish the safety and efficacy of bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with disabling motor fluctuations performed with an expedient procedure with limited intraoperative mapping.\nBilateral STN DBS systems were implanted in 110 PD patients. Targeting of STN was achieved with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging guidance and a stereotactic navigation system confirmed by limited electrophysiological mapping. The safety of the procedure was analyzed in all 110 patients. The efficacy of the procedure was assessed in the practically-defined off medication state in the 72 patients who underwent evaluations 3 to 12 months after electrode implantation.\nAdverse effects were infrequent and transient with no incidence of death, hemiparesis, or seizure. In the 72 patients, STN DBS reduced total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores at the time of the follow-up evaluation by 47% from 43.4 +/- 16.1 with stimulators off to 22.8 +/- 11.6 with stimulators on (P < 0.001). The changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor subscores improved as follows: rest tremor, 74% (P < 0.001); rigidity, 58% (P < 0.001); bradykinesia, 37% (P < 0.001); pull test, 35% (P < 0.001); gait, 44% (P < 0.001); axial signs, 42% (P < 0.001); and speech, 13% (P = 0.002). The prescribed total daily levodopa-equivalent dose decreased 45 +/- 32%. We averaged 1.3 +/- 0.9 electrodes passes per lead implantation. The mean operating time from the mounting of the stereotactic frame to its removal was 5 hours 42 minutes (median, 5 h 25 min; standard deviation, 1 h 12 min).\nThis STN DBS surgical technique for PD is expedient with effective outcomes and low complication rates.",

    "abstract": "The unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion rat model is a well-known acute model for Parkinson's disease (PD). Its validity has been supported by invasive histology, behavioral studies and electrophysiology. Here, we have characterized this model in vivo by multitracer imaging [glucose metabolism and dopamine transporter (DAT)] in relation to behavioral and histological parameters.\nEighteen female adult Wistar rats (eight 6-OHDA-lesioned, ten controls) were investigated using multitracer [(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) and [(18)F]-FECT {2'-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl-(1R-2-exo-3-exe)-8-methyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-azabicyclo(3.2.1)-octane-2-carboxylate} small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Relative glucose metabolism and parametric DAT binding images were anatomically standardized to Paxinos space and analyzed on a voxel-basis using SPM2: , supplemented by a template-based predefined volumes-of-interest approach. Behavior was characterized by the limb-use asymmetry test; dopaminergic innervation was validated by in vitro tyrosine hydroxylase staining.\nIn the 6-OHDA model, significant glucose hypometabolism is present in the ipsilateral sensory-motor cortex (-6.3%; p = 4 x 10(-6)). DAT binding was severely decreased in the ipsilateral caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens and substantia nigra (all p < 5 x 10(-9)), as confirmed by the behavioral and histological outcomes. Correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between the degree of DAT impairment and the change in glucose metabolism in the ipsilateral hippocampus (p = 3 x 10(-5)), while cerebellar glucose metabolism was inversely correlated to the level of DAT impairment (p < 3 x 10(-4)).\nIn vivo cerebral mapping of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats using [(18)F]-FDG and [(18)F]-FECT small animal PET shows molecular-functional correspondence to the cortico-subcortical network impairments observed in PD patients. This provides a further molecular validation supporting the validity of the 6-OHDA lesion model to mimic multiple aspects of human PD.",

    "abstract": "In mice, targeted deletion of the serine protease HtrA2 (also known as Omi) causes mitochondrial dysfunction leading to a neurodegenerative disorder with parkinsonian features. In humans, point mutations in HtrA2 are a susceptibility factor for Parkinson's disease (PARK13 locus). Mutations in PINK1, a putative mitochondrial protein kinase, are associated with the PARK6 autosomal recessive locus for susceptibility to early-onset Parkinson's disease. Here we determine that HtrA2 interacts with PINK1 and that both are components of the same stress-sensing pathway. HtrA2 is phosphorylated on activation of the p38 pathway, occurring in a PINK1-dependent manner at a residue adjacent to a position found mutated in patients with Parkinson's disease. HtrA2 phosphorylation is decreased in brains of patients with Parkinson's disease carrying mutations in PINK1. We suggest that PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of HtrA2 might modulate its proteolytic activity, thereby contributing to an increased resistance of cells to mitochondrial stress.",

    "abstract": "Antioxidants from plants were known to reduce the oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals, chelating metal ions and reducing inflammation. As increased oxidative stress was implicated in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD), we have assessed whether the plant extracts protects the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in the animal model of PD.\nMale adult Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally between 10 am-11 am each day with the extracts from tangerine peel, grape seeds, cocoa and red clover for four days. One hour after the final dosing, the left medial forebrain bundle was lesioned by infusing the dopaminergic neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 12 microg) under anaesthesia. Seven days post-lesion, the number of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the levels of dopamine and its metabolites 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the striata were quantified and compared with the vehicle-treated groups.\nCompared to the unlesioned side, 6-OHDA lesions significantly reduced the number of dopaminergic cells and the levels of dopamine and its metabolites DOPAC and HVA in the vehicle-treated animals. Pretreatment of animals with extracts of tangerine peel (rich in polymethoxylated flavones; 35 mg/kg/day), cocoa-2 (rich in procyanidins; 100 mg/kg/day) and red clover (rich in isoflavones; 200 mg/kg/day) significantly attenuated the 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic loss. However, no significant protection was seen in animals supplemented with red and white grape seeds (rich in catechins; 100 mg/kg/day), and cocoa-1 (rich in catechins; 100 mg/kg/day).\nPre-treatment of plant extracts rich in polymethoxylated flavones, procyanidins and isoflavones but not catechins protected the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in the rat model of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with typical motor symptoms due to the preferential loss of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons in the Substantia nigra pars compacta. Several proteins of the homeodomain family are crucial for the development of mDA neurons. These proteins remain expressed into adulthood with largely unknown functions, but potentially influence mDA neuronal survival. To determine whether genetic variation in these genes plays a role in sporadic PD, we performed a genetic association study in a screening sample of 340 PD patients and 680 controls and a large replication sample of 669 PD patients and 669 controls using 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms in and around the Engrailed 1/2, PITX3, LMX1B and OTX2 genes. We provide evidence for a novel, strong and reproducible association of the PITX3 promoter SNP rs3758549: C>T (p=0.004) with PD. The C-allele appears to be a recessive risk allele with an estimated population frequency of 83%. An allele-dependent dysregulation of PITX3 expression might contribute to the susceptibility to PD.",

    "abstract": "Multiple targets and pathways may be amenable to the development of gene therapy approaches for Parkinson's disease. This article discusses some of the cellular and brain circuit pathways relevant to Parkinson's disease that would be clinically amenable to gene therapy. Approaches could be classified according to two main categories, i.e. symptomatic vs. neuroprotective/neurorestorative strategies. Examples of the different possibilities currently in development are given and feature both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic symptomatic treatments of parkinsonian symptoms and/or L-DOPA-induced side effects, anti-apoptotic neuroprotective strategies and growth-factor delivery for neuroprotection/neurorestoration. While gene therapy has been mostly used so far for enhancing the expression of the target gene, the use of dominant negative or siRNA opens new possibilities. This, combined with the key feature of gene delivery that offers access to intracellular signalling pathways, is likely to further expand the number of proposed targets to be studied.",

    "abstract": "Genetically engineered neural stem cell (NSC) lines are promising vectors for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). Neurturin (NTN), a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family, has been demonstrated to act specifically on mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, suggesting its therapeutic potential for PD. In our previous work, we demonstrated that NTN-overexpressing c17.2 NSCs exerted dopaminergic neuroprotection in a rat model of PD. In this study, we transplanted NTN-c17.2 into the striatum of the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) PD model to further determine the regenerative effect of NTN-c17.2 on the rat models of PD.\nAfter intrastriatal grafting, NTN-c17.2 cells differentiated and gradually downregulated nestin expression, while the grafts stably overexpressed NTN. Further, an observation of rotational behavior and the contents of neurotransmitters tested by high-performance liquid chromatography showed that the regenerative effect of the NTN-c17.2 group was significantly better than that of the Mock-c17.2 group, and the regenerative effect of the Mock-c17.2 group was better than that of the PBS group. Further research through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays and in vivo histology revealed that the regenerative effect of Mock-c17.2 and NTN-c17.2 cell grafts may be attributed to the ability of NSCs to produce neurotrophic factors and differentiate into tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells.\nThe transplantation of NTN-c17.2 can exert neuroregenerative effects in the rat model of PD, and the delivery of NTN by NSCs may constitute a very useful strategy in the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Protein nitration due to oxidative and nitrative stress has been linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its relationship to the loss of dopamine (DA) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity is not clear. Here we quantified protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) by a novel gas chromatography/negative chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry technique and DA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) by HPLC in tissues or medium of organotypic, mouse mesencephalon cultures after acute or chronic treatments with the peroxynitrite donor 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1), the dopaminergic toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) or the lipophilic complex I inhibitor rotenone. Incubation with SIN-1 (24 h) or MPP(+) treatments (48 h) caused dose-dependent protein nitration reaching a maximum of eightfold increase by 10 mM SIN-1 or twofold by 10 microM MPP(+), but significant DA depletions occurred at much lower concentrations of MPP(+) (1 microM). Chronic MPP(+) or rotenone treatments (3 weeks) caused maximum protein nitration by 1 microM (twofold) or 10nM (fourfold), respectively. Co-treatment with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor l-NAME (300 microM) prevented protein nitration by MPP(+), but did not protect against MPP(+)-induced DA depletion or inhibition of TH activity. Acute incubation with 100 microM SIN-1 inhibited TH activity, which could be blocked by co-treatment with the tetrahydrobiopterin precursor l-sepiapterin, but tissue DA depletions required higher doses of SIN-1 (>1 mM, 24 h) and longer survival. In conclusion, protein nitration and TH activity or DA depletion are not directly related in these models.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa is the most commonly prescribed drug for Parkinson's disease (PD). Although levodopa improves PD symptoms in the initial stages of the disease, its long-term use is limited by the development of side effects, including abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesias) and psychiatric complications. The endocannabinoid system is emerging as an important modulator of basal ganglia functions and its pharmacologic manipulation represents a promising therapy to alleviate levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Rats with 6-OHDA lesions that are chronically treated with levodopa develop increasingly severe axial, limb, locomotor and oro-facial abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs). Administration of the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 attenuated levodopa-induced axial, limb and oral AIMs dose-dependently via a CB(1)-mediated mechanism, whereas it had no effect on locomotive AIMs. By contrast, systemic administration of URB597, a potent FAAH inhibitor, did not affect AIMs scoring despite its ability to increase anandamide concentration throughout the basal ganglia. Unlike WIN, anandamide can also bind and activate transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) receptors, which have been implicated in the modulation of dopamine transmission in the basal ganglia. Interestingly, URB597 significantly decreased all AIMs subtypes only if co-administered with the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine. Our data indicate that pharmacological blockade of TRPV1 receptors unmasks the anti-dyskinetic effects of FAAH inhibitors and that CB(1) and TRPV1 receptors play opposite roles in levodopa-induced dyskinesias.",

    "abstract": "10% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have young-onset PD (YOPD). We compared YOPD patients to control patients in terms of hospital utilization and outcomes and medical comorbidities during hospitalization.\nThe Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) provides yearly data on hospital admissions and discharges from approximately 1,000 hospitals. NIS data sets (1998-2003) were used to identify persons aged 18-40 years, including 714 PD patients and 2,007 randomly selected control patients (1:3 matching).\nHospital length of stay (p < 0.001) and number of discharge diagnoses (p < 0.001) were higher in PD patients than controls. PD patients were more likely than controls to be discharged to a short-term hospital (odds ratio, OR, 2.23, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.30-3.84, p = 0.004) or a skilled nursing facility (OR 4.14, 95% CI 3.06-5.61, p < 0.001); 20.4% required transfer to a short-term hospital or another facility. The most common discharge Diagnosis-Related Group code in PD patients was psychosis (23% of patients) whereas pneumonia and hip or pelvic fractures were not associated with PD.\nYOPD patients had greater healthcare utilization and hospital morbidity than controls. Upon discharge, 1 in 5 required transfer to a short-term hospital or another facility. Psychosis was the most common comorbidity whereas several comorbidities associated with older PD patients were not common.",

    "abstract": "A 73-year-old man with a 10-year history of progressive Parkinson\u2019s disease is referred for psychiatric evaluation and treatment by a neurologist for new-onset confusion and visual hallucinations of strangers in his house. Treatment of the early Parkinson\u2019s symptoms began with a dopamine agonist, and /-dopa was added later to combat worsening tremor, rigidity, slowed mobility, and difficulty performing basic activities of daily living. A more detailed history elicits new-onset depression and vivid dreaming with insomnia. The patient\u2019s wife is concerned about the hallucinations, worsening cognitive impairment, and disturbed sleep, all of which have an impact on her quality of life. Treatment options for addressing these new symptoms include lowering the dosages of antiparkinsonian medications, which can cause or aggravate visual hallucinations and confusion, or adding quetiapine, the atypical antipsychotic drug that is least likely to worsen the parkinsonism. After discussions with the patient and his wife, the decision is made to initiate quetiapine at a dose of 50 mg at bedtime and not to change the antiparkinsonian medication regimen. However, after only a few doses, the patient stops taking the quetiapine because of excessive sedation and increased confusion. An attempt is then made to slowly taper the dopamine agonist, which is more likely than /-dopa to cause psychiatric complications and is less effective as an antiparkinsonian medication. The patient\u2019s parkinsonism worsens, however, so the dosage is restored to the previously effective level. The patient\u2019s condition continues to deteriorate because of increasing visual hallucinations (now accompanied by persecutory delusions regarding the strangers in the house), confusion, and disturbed sleep. An urgent follow-up evaluation is arranged.",

    "abstract": "Linear hyperintensity along the medial margin of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) on T2-weighted images from patients with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) was recently reported. In this study, we aimed to compare the prevalence of this linear hyperintensity between patients with MJD and patients with Parkinson disease, and in control subjects.\nWe report the prevalence of linear hyperintensity along the GPi in 10 consecutive patients with MJD, 38 with Parkinson disease (PD), and 25 control subjects. We evaluated the prevalence of linear hyperintensities on T2-weighted axial images in these groups, and in nearly age-matched subjects younger than 60 years. We performed statistical analysis using the chi(2) test and Fisher exact test to compare the prevalence of the hyperintensity in each group.\nThe prevalence of the linear hyperintensity in patients with MJD was significantly higher than that in patients with PD and in control subjects (P = .014 and .006, respectively). In subjects younger than 60 years, the prevalence of the hyperintensity in patients with MJD was significantly higher than that in patients with PD and control subjects (P = .011 and P < .001, respectively). In the control subjects, the linear hyperintensity tended to be greater in subjects older than 60 years (8/14 [57%] patients) than in subjects younger than 60 years (2/11 [18%] patients; P = .058). In patients with PD, the prevalence did not differ between patients older than 60 years and patients younger than 60 years.\nLinear hyperintensity along the globus pallidus is frequently found in patients with MJD, but it can be also found in patients with PD and in control subjects, probably because of the normal aging process.",

    "abstract": "The migration of peripheral bone-marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) to the brain was studied in a chronic mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). BMDCs expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) were aseptically obtained from C57 BL/6-EGFP-Tg mice and intravenously injected into C57 BL/6j mice which had received a total body irradiation of 8 Gy to induce bone marrow ablation. Implanted GFP-BMDCs replenished the bone marrow of irradiated mice, and progressively crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB), penetrating different mesencephalic and telencephalic brain regions in the following months. The progressive degeneration of dopamine (DA) cells with a small daily dose (4 mg/kg/day for 20 days) of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine (MPTP) increased the penetration of GFP-BMDCs into the brain, particularly into those regions with marked DA innervation and which showed the clearest DA cell loss. BMDC penetration increased before the DA cell loss was evident and persisted for a long time after MPTP withdrawal. Under these conditions, most BMDCs differentiated into microglia (CD68 expression was observed in 50% of GFP cells 60 days after MPTP administration). BMDC-derived microglia showed morphological characteristics of cell activation, with the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor only being expressed in 3% of the cells. No differentiation into neurons (NeuN expression), astrocites (GFAP), cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8) and T-helper lymphocytes (CD4) was observed. Taken together, the present data suggest that a significant portion of microglial cells is of a peripheral origin. Bearing in mind that microglial reaction is a significant part of the degenerative process in PD, the increase of BMDC penetration into DA-rich areas during DA cell degeneration and their differentiation into microglia suggest that cells coming across the BBB may participate in the neurodegeneration process. The precise role of such a cell inflow into the brain requires further study. Nevertheless, this may represent an opportunity to develop neuroprotective therapeutic strategies for PD.",

    "abstract": "Long-term dopaminomimetic therapy, not limited to levodopa, is complicated by the emergence of variations of motor response in a majority of Parkinson disease (PD) patients. These variations can occur in different forms, as early wearing off during the initial stage of motor complications, dyskinesias in the intermediate stage, and complex fluctuations in the advanced stage. Considered to be a major source of disability in advanced PD patients, recognition of these complications is critical in order to develop different strategies designed not only to treat these problems when they develop, but also to prevent troublesome complications associated with potential risk factors. In this article, authors classify a wide clinical spectrum of motor complications into different stages as the disease progresses through the treatment. A number of strategies are proposed in order to manage these complications as well as to avoid them. Better understanding of these potential complications will result in better management of these problems and lessen the disability associated with advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "The loss of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline occurs constantly in Parkinson's disease. This is supposed to worsen disease progression, either by increasing the vulnerability of dopamine-containing neurons or by reducing the recovery once they are damaged. Novel data also show that the loss of noradrenergic innervation facilitates the onset of dyskinesia occurring in Parkinsonian patients during dopamine replacement therapy. In the first part of the manuscript we review the evidence showing the loss of the noradrenergic system as an early event in the natural history of Parkinsonism. This evidence is discussed in light of novel reports showing the deleterious effects produced by the noradrenergic deficit on the survival of nigral dopamine neurons. In particular, we analyze the biochemical and morphological changes produced in the nigrostriatal system by the loss of endogenous noradrenaline. In a dedicated paragraph we specifically evaluate the cross affinity between dopamine and noradrenaline systems. In fact, this is critical during dopamine/noradrenaline replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease. In the last part, we overview novel therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring the activation of noradrenaline receptors to reduce the dyskinesia occurring in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, with consequent reduction in striatal dopamine levels leading to characteristic motor symptoms. The most effective treatment for this disease continues to be the dopamine replacement therapy with levodopa together with an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). The efficacy of this therapy, however, decreases with time and most patients develop fluctuating responses and dyskinesias. The last decade showed that the use of catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors as adjuvants to the levodopa/AADC inhibitor therapy, significantly improves the clinical benefits of this therapy. The purpose of this article is to review the current knowledge on the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and the role of COMT inhibitors in PD as a new therapeutic approach to PD involving conversion of levodopa to dopamine at the target region in the brain and facilitation of the continuous action of this amine at the receptor sites. A historical overview of the discovery and development of COMT inhibitors is presented with a special emphasis on nebicapone, presently under clinical development, as well as entacapone and tolcapone, which are already approved as adjuncts in the therapy of PD. This article reviews human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs as well as their clinical efficacy and safety.",

    "abstract": "Over and above typical motor alterations, executive and working memory (WM) impairment can also occur in early idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to investigate the compensatory neural processes involved in WM performance, as well as the networks involved in the long-term memory transfer from short-term stores in PD.\nRelative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was mapped with H2O(15)-PET in eight treated nondemented PD patients while performing a WM verbal double-task (Brown-Peterson paradigm) using both short (6-second) and long (18-second) delays.\nAs compared to nine age-matched healthy subjects, performance of the PD group was only slightly reduced on the short-delay but markedly impaired on the long-delay task. Underlying the relatively preserved short-delay performance, the PD group exhibited overactivation of prefrontal and parietal areas involved in attention-demanding processes, suggestive of efficient compensatory processes. Further supporting this, significant positive correlations were found between short-delay performance and rCBF in the bilateral inferior parietal cortex. In contrast, the lack of overactivation with the long-delay task together with posterior cingulate hypoactivation would support the idea of functional disconnection impairing transfer of information from prefrontal onto (para)limbic areas. These findings suggest novel areas of investigation into early cognitive impairments in PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to determine the progression of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with or without hallucinations. Two years after the first assessment, 36 PD patients were re-evaluated on standardized neuropsychological tests, including the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and on rating scales for overall cognitive functioning, functional autonomy, behavioral disorders. Nine patients had hallucinations at baseline and endpoint assessments; 12 patients developed hallucinations during the follow-up; and 15 patients were hallucination-free throughout the study. Cognitive performance significantly declined in all three groups, but at endpoint assessment PD hallucinators scored significantly lower than nonhallucinators on phonological and semantic fluency tasks, immediate free recall and the go/no-go FAB subtest; moreover, they showed more severe apathy than nonhallucinators. Reduced phonological fluency at baseline (odds ratio [OR], 13.5; 95% CI: 1.34-135.98, P = 0.027) was the only independent predictor of onset of hallucinations after 2 years, whereas hallucinations (OR, 10.1; 95% CI: 1.94-51.54, P = 0.006) and poor phonological fluency (OR, 6.1; 95% CI: 1.04-35.03, P = 0.045) independently predicted development of diffuse cognitive impairment. We concluded that reduced verbal fluency scores may predict the onset of hallucinations, while hallucinations and poor phonological fluency may predict development of dementia in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the diagnostic value of brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) in the differentiation of multiple system atrophy (MSA) from Parkinson's disease (PD). Thirty-five patients with MSA (23 MSA-P and 12 MSA-C) and 17 patients with PD were included in this study. Overall correct diagnosis rates between clinical and imaging diagnosis among MSA-P, MSA-C, and PD patients were 80% for visual MRI analysis, 88.5% for visual (18)F-FDG PET analysis, and 84.3% for SPM-supported analysis of (18)F-FDG PET. The sensitivity of brain MRI, and visual and SPM analysis of (18)F-FDG PET in differentiating MSA from PD was 72.7%, 90.9%, and 95.5%, respectively, the specificity was 100% for each imaging analysis, the positive predictive value was 100% for each imaging analysis, and the negative predictive value was 60%, 81.8%, and 90%, respectively. Our results suggest that brain MRI and (18)F-FDG PET are diagnostically useful in differentiating MSA (MSA-P and MSA-C) from PD, and indicate that (18)F-FDG PET has a tendency toward higher sensitivity compared to brain MRI, but a larger longitudinal study including pathological data will be required to confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "In a 5-year, double-blind study, subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) who were randomized to initial treatment with ropinirole had a significantly lower incidence of dyskinesia compared with subjects randomized to levodopa, although Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores were significantly more improved in the levodopa group. Subjects who completed the original study were eligible to participate in a long-term extension study conducted according to an open, naturalistic design and were evaluated approximately every 6 months until they had been followed for a total of 10 years. Comparing subjects randomized to initial treatment with ropinirole (n = 42) and levodopa (n = 27), the incidence of dyskinesia was significantly lower in the ropinirole group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1, 1.0; P = 0.046) and the median time to dyskinesia was significantly longer (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.8; P = 0.007). The incidence of at least moderate wearing off (\"off\" time >/=26% of the awake day) was also significantly lower in the ropinirole group (adjusted OR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.03; P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in change in UPDRS activities of daily living or motor scores, or scores for the 39-item PD questionnaire, Clinical Global Impression, or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Early treatment decisions for individual patients depend largely on the anticipated risk of side effects and long-term complications. Both ropinirole and levodopa are viable treatment options in early PD.",

    "abstract": "There has been some evidence that electrical stimulation of the primary motor cortex (MCS) may relieve motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). This surgical technique is being studied as alternative for PD patients who are considered poor candidates for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subthalamic nucleus (STN). In 4 PD patients with unilateral MCS, we used [(15)O] H(2)O positron emission tomography to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) while testing motor performance with a joystick motor task during different stimulation frequencies, OFF-condition, 50 and 130 Hz. We found that different stimulation settings did neither improve performance on joystick task nor modify the pattern of movement-related rCBF. Similarly, no changes were observed in UPDRS motor score between Off and On stimulation while off medication. We conclude that while MCS may be a simpler and safer surgical procedure than DBS of STN, it failed to provide evidence of clear effect on motor performance and movement-related activation pattern in patients with advanced PD.",

Previous studies point to an association between swallowing problems and sialorrhea. The aim of this study was to determine if drooling is associated with dysphagia in PD patients. Sixteen PD patients with diurnal drooling were assessed using a modified barium swallowing with videofluoroscopy, and a drooling score. Changes in the oral stage of swallowing were seen in 100% of the patients; and in the pharyngeal stage, in 94% of the patients. The results showed a correlation between the drooling scale score and the level of dysphagia (-0.426; p<0.05). Patients with the worst dysphagia had the worst drooling.",

    "abstract": "Experimental and postmortem evidence indicates a role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The authors prospectively examined whether plasma concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers assessed before Parkinson's disease diagnosis were predictive of future risk of the disease in a nested case-control study in the United States (1993-2002), including 84 incident cases and 165 matched controls. Blood was collected from patients on average 4.3 years before the diagnosis. After adjustment for potential confounders, higher level of interleukin-6 was associated with a greater risk of Parkinson's disease. Compared with the lowest quintile, the odds ratios were 1.5 for the second, 1.6 for the third, 2.7 for the fourth, and 3.4 for the fifth quintiles (p for trend = 0.03). In contrast, concentrations of other inflammatory biomarkers including C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors were not related to the risk. These data suggest that men with high plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 have an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size and the lack of associations with other biomarkers of inflammation.",

The sample consisted of 150 patients. The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Charlson co-morbidity index were used for analysis. Demographic data were obtained in a structured interview. T-test, chi(2)-test and general linear regression were used. Fatigue was reported in 81% of the patients, with the worst scores in physical fatigue. Mood disorders and worse UPDRS scores were associated with fatigue.",

    "abstract": "The orphan nuclear receptor NURR1 is critical for the development of mesencephalic dopamine neurons and directly regulates tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) via specific NGFI-B response elements (NBRE). We identified a Parkinson's disease patient with a NURR1 mutation, resulting in a p.Ser125Cys change, immediately adjacent to the putative ERK1/2 phosphorylation site. Here we show, in dopaminergic SK-N-AS human neuroblastoma cells, that this substitution markedly attenuated NURR1-induced transcriptional activation through a human TH promoter NBRE. Furthermore, in SK-N-AS cells co-transfected with the dopamine-D2S receptor and NURR1, the dopamine-D2 agonist quinpirole stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and enhanced transcriptional activation by wild-type NURR1 but not the p.Ser125Cys NURR1 mutant, and these actions were blocked by the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059. These results indicate that Ser125 is critical for basal and ERK1/2-induced NURR1 activity and suggest a role for this and other NURR1 mutations in the regulation of dopamine synthesis and predisposition to Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the relationships between gait and dynamic balance in people with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD). We assessed 18 participants diagnosed with stage I-II idiopathic PD and 17 healthy age-matched volunteers. Temporo-spatial gait variables were analyzed using the GAITRite system and participants were asked to walk at a comfortable walking speed. Dynamic balance was assessed using the Balance Master. Movement velocity (MV), maximal excursion (ME), and directional control (DC), obtained through the limits of stability test, quantified dynamic balance. People with early stage PD exhibited significantly slower walking speed, shorter stride length, and smaller forward MV than the comparison group. In the PD group, stride length and speed significantly correlated with forward MV, forward ME, and forward DC. Thus, in people with early PD, gait speed and stride length are correlated with dynamic balance, particularly in the forward direction in standing.",
