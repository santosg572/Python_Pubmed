    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, resulting in motor symptoms. Ongoing research shows promise for long-term solutions.\nStudies highlight the dysregulation of Syt11 and \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in PD. Disrupted \u03b1-syn homeostasis due to palmitoylation of Syt11 contributes to its aggregation, potentially playing a role in PD pathology. \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in stool samples show promise as an early diagnostic biomarker. Vocal impairments in PD may be linked to \u03b1-syn-induced neuropathology. Irisin, produced after exercise, promotes the degradation of pathologic \u03b1-syn. Progress has been made in identifying PD biomarkers. Retinal thinning and abnormal protein aggregates in skin biopsies provide noninvasive diagnostic indicators. Blood-based biomarkers like \u03b1-syn, DJ-1, and LRRK2 hold promise but face limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) models enhance mitophagy, detect PD through sleep-breathing signals, and improve survival. AI analysis aids noninvasive assessment and risk prediction. Further understanding of PD involves studying pathological seeds and genetic mutations. Adenosine receptor regulation relates to early-onset PD, and specific gene mutations impact patient survival. Differentiated-induced pluripotent stem cells offer the potential for cell replacement therapy. Autoimmune features and T-cell involvement suggest intervention targets. Stem cell-based therapies and neurostimulation strategies show promise for improving motor function. Imaging reveals increased central inflammation in PD, suggesting an inflammatory role. Machine learning algorithms and home gait speed monitoring aid in diagnosis and disease progression tracking. Abnormal putamen gradients reflect dopaminergic loss and motor dysfunction. Antiepileptic drug prescriptions are associated with an increased PD risk. Personalized medicine, gut-brain axis involvement, and vestibular stimulation therapy offer potential PD treatment avenues. Genetic engineering techniques and deep brain stimulation show promise for alleviating PD symptoms.\nOngoing research and technological advancements promise to improve PD screening, diagnosis, and treatment, bringing hope to affected individuals.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss, Lewy body build-up, and motor dysfunction. One of the primary pathogenic mechanisms of PD development is autophagy dysfunction and nitric oxide-mediated neurotoxicity.\nThe current study focuses on autophagy and nitric oxide (NO) signaling roles in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated PD mice and their protection by their modulators.\nBALB/c mice were administered MPTP (30 mg/kg/i.p/day) for five consecutive days in order to create a PD model. Following MPTP poisoning, the doses of GA (16.8 mg/kg/day/i.p.), 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) (10 mg/kg/day/i.p.), and their combination were administered once daily for 14 days. Animals were observed for behavioral and locomotor changes, biochemical examination, inflammatory mediators, and analysis of molecular markers.\nGA, 7-NI alone significantly reduced MPTP-induced locomotor, behavioral, and oxidative damage. Additionally, in MPTP-intoxicated animals, 7-NI and GA had protective effects on dopamine levels, TH positive DA neurons, inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) concentration. Furthermore, GA increases LC3BII expression, which in turn increases autophagy. It also decreases total NO content, and a significant response of 7-NI demonstrates their interaction, which is neuroprotective.\nPresent research suggests that dysregulation of autophagy and NO-mediated neuroinflammation are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of MPTP-induced PD. The use of two pharmacotherapeutics, GA and 7-NI, respectively, significantly reduces MPTP-induced PD distortions and their interaction enhances the overall protective effect, suggesting that these pharmacological agents may be used for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the effects of a physical therapy intervention on the muscle strength and power of the knee flexors and extensors and functional balance in older adults with Parkinson's disease (PD), according to its clinical severity.\nForty older adults diagnosed with PD were evaluated before and after 48-week of a basic exercise program (two 20-min sessions a week) to improve functional balance and quadriceps strength. The variables analyzed were: motor aspects of PD, assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS); functional mobility; peak torque (PT) and mean power (MP) at the knee flexors and extensors, evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer (CYBEX\u00ae) on both legs at 60\u00b0/s (PT) and 240\u00b0/s (P); Timed Up and Go (TUG) test; and Tinetti Index. The participants were divided into three groups (GI, GII, GIII) according to their stage (I-III) of PD on the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale.\nMuscle strength and power were greater in GI (PT: 131.14\u00a0N/kg \u00b161.73; P: 102.29\u00a0W/kg \u00b139.16) than in GII and GIII (PT: 82\u00a0N/kg \u00b138.27 and 89.29\u00a0N/kg \u00b168.78; p\u00a0=\u00a00.047; P: 56.17\u00a0W/kg \u00b131.99 and 68.14\u00a0W/kg \u00b158.18; p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). In addition, an improvement in functional balance was shown by higher indices after the intervention (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nThese findings suggest that training to increase leg strength in the early stages of PD (GI) may benefit this population and this will help in the design of interventions to improve the functional abilities of older adults with PD.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aims to examine the conceptualization and measurement of participation among people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and the factors, such as facilitators and barriers, linked to participation in this population.\nPubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov from inception to July 2022.\nStudies were screened using primary inclusion criteria of peer-reviewed articles that measure participation in adults with PD.\nThe reviewers independently assessed quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and extracted data regarding sample characteristics, study design, country, properties of assessments, and factors examined in relation to participation.\nOut of 64,427 records, we included 36 articles. Among them, less than half explicitly defined participation, and those articles used four different participation-related terms. Eighteen different assessments have been used to measure participation, and 56% of them were originally developed to measure constructs other than participation. Among aspects of participation assessed by the evaluation tools, participation problem was the most frequently measured, followed by participation accomplishment and satisfaction with participation. Many impairment-level factors, including disease severity, depression, and cognition, were found to be associated with participation.\nParticipation is a central concept and important outcome in the field of rehabilitation. This systematic review provides a summary and synthesis of the existing quantitative studies on participation among people with PD. It identified inconsistencies in the conceptualization and measurement of participation across studies. Additionally, the aspect of satisfaction with participation and the association of environmental (or social) factors with participation have received relatively little attention. Future research should investigate satisfaction with participation, examine the impact of environmental factors on participation, and include longitudinal studies to better understand participation in individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease sleep scale (PDSS) was recommended by the Movement Disorder Society task force for screening and grading the severity of sleep problems in Parkinson's disease (PD). This work aimed to examine the validity and reliability of an Arabic version of PDSS-2.\nThis cross-sectional study was carried out on 133 patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for PD. The patients were clinically assessed using the following scales: Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale (H&Y), non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). PDSS-2 scale was translated according to approved translation standards into Arabic and back-translated into English. Patients were asked to respond based on their experience in the last week.\nThe mean PDSS2 score for the included PD patients was 17\u00b110. Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient value was 0.89, indicating good internal consistency. Most items showed high item-total correlation; the lowest was 0.375, considered higher than the conventional cut-off of 0.3. Test-retest reliability showed good agreement (ICC: 0.848). The exploratory factor analysis showed that items had been loaded over four factors. Total PDSS-2 score was positively correlated to age, disease duration, modified H&Y scale, MDS-UPDRS, NMSS, BDI, and global PSQI score. A cut-off point of 13 could differentiate poor sleepers from good sleepers with 91% sensitivity and 70% specificity (AUC 0.893, P<0.001).\nThe Arabic version of PDSS-2 has appropriate validity and can be reliably used for assessing sleep-related problems in Arabic-speaking patients with PD.",

Most items showed high item-total correlation; the lowest was 0.375, considered higher than the conventional cut-off of 0.3. Test-retest reliability showed good agreement (ICC: 0.848). The exploratory factor analysis showed that items had been loaded over four factors. Total PDSS-2 score was positively correlated to age, disease duration, modified H&Y scale, MDS-UPDRS, NMSS, BDI, and global PSQI score. A cut-off point of 13 could differentiate poor sleepers from good sleepers with 91% sensitivity and 70% specificity (AUC 0.893, P<0.001).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is typified by inflammation of dopaminergic neurons leading to the release of various inflammatory mediators. These mediators activate the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which in turn activates inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), leading to increased inflammation.\nThis study was intended to study the effect of combination of mangiferin, a specific inhibitor of NF-\u03baB with low-dose nitric oxide (NO) modulators.\nA total of eight Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g were used in each group. Stereotactic surgery was performed to induce 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions. The treatment period extended from day 14 to day 42, during which time behavioral tests were performed to evaluate the effects of mangiferin and its combination with NO modulators. On day 42, the brains of the rats were removed for biochemical and molecular analyzes.\nMangiferin significantly improved locomotor activity and decreased inflammatory chemokines levels in rats with 6-OHDA lesions. Mangiferin therapy decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels and reduced oxidative stress. In particular, caspase-3, caspase-9 and COX-2 activities were significantly reduced after the mangiferin treatment. A combination of 45-\u00b5g mangiferin and 10-mg/kg L-NAME showed the greatest improvement in locomotor, behavioral, biochemical, and molecular parameters impaired by 6-OHDA.\nIn this study, mangiferin was found to protect rats with 6-OHDA lesions by inhibiting inflammation causing chemokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Besides, the grouping of iNOS inhibitor L-NAME at a dose of 10 mg/kg with 45-\u00b5g mangiferin enhanced the anti-inflammatory and anti-Parkinsonian activity of mangiferin. Consequently, the combination therapy of mangiferin and L-NAME is promising for the treatment of PD. However, clinical trials will be required to evaluate the efficacy of this combination therapy in humans.",

    "abstract": "The Michael J. Fox Foundation has been funding research on Parkinson's disease for 35 years, but has yet to find a cure. This is due to a problem with the philosophy behind the development of modern medical treatments. In this paper, we will introduce \"smart medicine\" with a substance that can solve all the problems of central nervous system drugs. The substance is the smallest diatomic molecule, the hydrogen molecule. Due to their size, hydrogen molecules can easily penetrate the cell membrane and enter the brain. In the midbrain of Parkinson's disease patients, hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction cause a chain reaction of oxidation of dopamine, but hydrogen entering the midbrain can convert the hydroxyl radicals into water molecules and inhibit the oxidation of dopamine. In this paper, we focus on the etiology of neurological diseases, especially Parkinson's disease, and present a case in which hydrogen inhalation improves the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as body bending and hand tremor. And we confidently state that if Michael J. Fox encountered \"smart medicine\" that could be realized with molecular hydrogen, he would not be a \"lucky man\" but a \"super-lucky man.\"",

    "abstract": "Parkinsonian disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), dementia with Lewy body (DLB), corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are often misdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms and the absence of precise biomarkers. Furthermore, there are no current methods to ascertain the progression and conversion of prodromal conditions such as REM behaviour disorder (RBD). Extracellular vesicles (EVs), containing a mixture of biomolecules, have emerged as potential sources for parkinsonian diagnostics. However, inconsistencies in previous studies have left their diagnostic potential unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis, following PRISMA guidelines, to assess the diagnostic accuracy of general EVs isolated from various bodily fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, serum, urine or saliva, in differentiating patients with parkinsonian disorders from healthy controls (HCs). The meta-analysis included 21 studies encompassing 1285 patients with PD, 24 with MSA, 105 with DLB, 99 with PSP, 101 with RBD and 783 HCs. Further analyses were conducted only for patients with PD versus HCs, given the limited number for other comparisons. Using bivariate and hierarchal receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) models, the meta-analysis revealed moderate diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing patients with PD from HCs, with substantial heterogeneity and publication bias. The trim-and-fill method revealed at least two missing studies with null or low diagnostic accuracy. CSF-EVs showed better overall diagnostic accuracy, while plasma-EVs had the lowest performance. General EVs demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy compared to CNS-originating EVs, which are more time-consuming, labour- and cost-intensive to isolate. In conclusion, while holding promise, utilizing biomarkers in general EVs for PD diagnosis remains unfeasible due to existing challenges. The focus should shift toward harmonizing the field through standardization, collaboration, and rigorous validation. Current efforts by the International Society For Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV)\u00a0aim to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of EV-related research through rigor and standardization, aiming to bridge the gap between theory and practical clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Genetic testing is essential to identify research participants for clinical trials enrolling people with Parkinson disease (PD) carrying a variant in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) or leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) genes. The limited availability of professionals trained in neurogenetics or genetic counseling is a major barrier to increased testing. Telehealth solutions to increase access to genetics education can help address issues around counselor availability and offer options to patients and family members.\nAs an alternative to pretest genetic counseling, we developed a web-based genetics education tool focused on GBA and LRRK2 testing for PD called the Interactive Multimedia Approach to Genetic Counseling to Inform and Educate in Parkinson's Disease (IMAGINE-PD) and conducted user testing and usability testing. The objective was to conduct user and usability testing to obtain stakeholder feedback to improve IMAGINE-PD.\nGenetic counselors and PD and neurogenetics subject matter experts developed content for IMAGINE-PD specifically focused on GBA and LRRK2 genetic testing. Structured interviews were conducted with 11 movement disorder specialists and 13 patients with PD to evaluate the content of IMAGINE-PD in user testing and with 12 patients with PD to evaluate the usability of a high-fidelity prototype according to the US Department of Health and Human Services Research-Based Web Design & Usability Guidelines. Qualitative data analysis informed changes to create a final version of IMAGINE-PD.\nQualitative data were reviewed by 3 evaluators. Themes were identified from feedback data of movement disorder specialists and patients with PD in user testing in 3 areas: content such as the topics covered, function such as website navigation, and appearance such as pictures and colors. Similarly, qualitative analysis of usability testing feedback identified additional themes in these 3 areas. Key points of feedback were determined by consensus among reviewers considering the importance of the comment and the frequency of similar comments. Refinements were made to IMAGINE-PD based on consensus recommendations by evaluators within each theme at both user testing and usability testing phases to create a final version of IMAGINE-PD.\nUser testing for content review and usability testing have informed refinements to IMAGINE-PD to develop this focused, genetics education tool for GBA and LRRK2 testing. Comparison of this stakeholder-informed intervention to standard telegenetic counseling approaches is ongoing.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting approximately 1% of the world's population. Increasing evidence suggests that aerobic physical exercise can be beneficial in mitigating both motor and nonmotor symptoms of the disease. In a recent pilot study of the role of exercise on PD, we sought to confirm exercise intensity by monitoring heart rate (HR). For this purpose, we asked participants to wear a chest strap HR monitor (Polar Electro Oy) and the Fitbit Charge 4 (Fitbit Inc) wrist-worn HR monitor as a potential proxy due to its convenience. Polar H10 has been shown to provide highly accurate R-R interval measurements. Therefore, we treated it as the gold standard in this study. It has been shown that Fitbit Charge 4 has comparable accuracy to Polar H10 in healthy participants. It has yet to be determined if the Fitbit is as accurate as Polar H10 in patients with PD during rest and exercise.\nThis study aimed to compare Fitbit Charge 4 to Polar H10 for monitoring HR in patients with PD at rest and during an intensive exercise program.\nA total of 596 exercise sessions from 11 (6 male and 5 female) participants were collected simultaneously with both devices. Patients with early-stage PD (Hoehn and Yahr \u22642) were enrolled in a 6-month exercise program designed for patients with PD. They participated in 3 one-hour exercise sessions per week. They wore both Fitbit and Polar H10 during each session. Sessions included rest, warm-up, intense exercise, and cool-down periods. We calculated the bias in the HR of the Fitbit Charge 4 at rest (5 min) and during intense exercise (20 min) by comparing the mean HR during each of the periods to the respective means measured by Polar H10 (HRFitbit - HRPolar). We also measured the sensitivity and specificity of Fitbit Charge 4 to detect average HRs that exceed the threshold for intensive exercise, defined as 70% of an individual's theoretical maximum HR. Different types of correlations between the 2 devices were investigated.\nThe mean bias was 1.68 beats per minute (bpm) at rest and 6.29 bpm during high-intensity exercise, with an overestimation by Fitbit Charge 4 in both conditions. The mean bias of the Fitbit across both rest and intensive exercise periods was 3.98 bpm. The device's sensitivity in identifying high-intensity exercise sessions was 97.14%. The correlation between the 2 devices was nonlinear, suggesting Fitbit's tendency to saturate at high values of HR.\nThe performance of Fitbit Charge 4 is comparable to Polar H10 for assessing exercise intensity in a cohort of patients with PD (mean bias 3.98 bpm). The device could be considered a reasonable surrogate for more cumbersome chest-worn devices in future studies of clinical cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that has a wide range of motor symptoms, such as tremor. Tremors are involuntary movements that occur in rhythmic oscillations and are typically categorized into rest tremor or action tremor. Action tremor occurs during voluntary movements and is a debilitating symptom of PD. As noninvasive interventions are limited, there is an ever-increasing need for an effective intervention for individuals experiencing action tremors. The Microsoft Emma Watch, a wristband with 5 vibrating motors, is a noninvasive, nonpharmaceutical intervention for tremor attenuation.\nThis pilot study investigated the use of the Emma Watch device to attenuate action tremor in people with PD.\nThe sample included 9 people with PD who were assessed on handwriting and hand function tasks performed on a digitized tablet. Tasks included drawing horizontal or vertical lines, tracing a star, spiral, writing \"elelelel\" in cursive, and printing a standardized sentence. Each task was completed 3 times with the Emma Watch programmed at different vibration intensities, which were counterbalanced: high intensity, low intensity (sham), and no vibration. Digital analysis from the tablet captured kinematic, dynamic, and spatial attributes of drawing and writing samples to calculate mathematical indices that quantify upper limb motor function. APDM Opal sensors (APDM Wearable Technologies) placed on both wrists were used to calculate metrics of acceleration and jerk. A questionnaire was provided to each participant after using the Emma Watch to gain a better understanding of their perspectives of using the device. In addition, drawings were compared to determine whether there were any visual differences between intensities.\nIn total, 9 people with PD were tested: 4 males and 5 females with a mean age of 67 (SD 9.4) years. There were no differences between conditions in the outcomes of interest measured with the tablet (duration, mean velocity, number of peaks, pause time, and number of pauses). Visual differences were observed within a small subset of participants, some of whom reported perceived improvement. The majority of participants (8/9) reported the Emma Watch was comfortable, and no problems with the device were reported.\nThere were visually depicted and subjectively reported improvements in handwriting for a small subset of individuals. This pilot study was limited by a small sample size, and this should be taken into consideration with the interpretation of the quantitative results. Combining vibratory devices, such as the Emma Watch, with task specific training, or personalizing the frequency to one's individual tremor may be important steps to consider when evaluating the effect of vibratory devices on hand function or writing ability in future studies. While the Emma Watch may help attenuate action tremor, its efficacy in improving fine motor or handwriting skills as a stand-alone tool remains to be demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Advanced Parkinson's disease affects patients with existing Parkinson's disease by further deteriorating their physical and cognitive functions. In this commentary we critically assess an economic evaluation which compared the cost-effectiveness of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel against standard of care in treating patients with Advanced Parkinson's disease. While the economic evaluation indicated that levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel could be cost-effective within the UK parameters, we highlight important limitations related to its design, modelling and analysis. Future research should consider the incorporation of a separate arm dedicated to the re-infusion of apomorphine on eligible Advanced Parkinson's disease patients, a wider set of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel adverse events and related costs, and a sub-group analysis on different socio-economic strata.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe, progressive, neurological disorder. PD is not a single disease, but rather resembles a syndrome. PD includes two types of pathogenesis (i.e., classical PD and new PD). Clinically, PD patients present with a range of motor symptoms including decreased spontaneous movement, bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, changes in speech, and resting tremors. PD patients also often exhibit non-motor symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disorders, and emotional and mental health disturbances. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) performed in clinical neurosurgery has demonstrated considerable efficacy in the treatment of dyskinesia that occurs in PD patients. However, the specific neural mechanism of DBS remains unknown and is limited by several shortcomings that have hampered the popularization and development of the procedure. To address this issue, this study established a theoretical model of DBS for PD to investigate and understand the mechanism of DBS using several artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This model was used to investigate both classical PD and unheard-of new PD. The research described in this paper was as follows: a single neuron was used to establish a theoretical model of the basal ganglia circuit and to simulate the characteristic indicators of the potential release of the basal ganglia circuit in both normal and PD states. The state of the deep brain electrical stimulation in PD was then analyzed to identify the critical electrical stimulation index and the optimal target. We showed that the use of AI algorithms such as particle swarm optimization and other AI algorithms was beneficial for more detailed exploration and understanding of the mechanisms of DBS compared to those used in previous studies. This discovery may lead to advances in DBS technology and provide better treatment options for neurological diseases such as PD.",

    "abstract": "In this study, Event-Related Potential (ERP) analyzes were performed to detect cognitive impairments in PD with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). A total of 85 volunteers underwent ERP analysis and neuropsychological testing (NPT) to determine cognitive level. In ERP analyses, prolonged latencies were observed in PD groups. However, patients implanted with DBS showed a decrease in latencies, a decrease in symptoms and statistical improvements in both cognitive and attention skills. Considering all these data, ERP results are promising as a noninvasive method that can be used in both disease status and diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Human brain development is spatially and temporally complex. Insufficient access to human brain tissue and inadequacy of animal models has limited the study of brain development and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent advancements of brain organoid technology have created novel opportunities to model human-specific neurodevelopment and brain diseases. In this review, we discuss the use of brain organoids to model the midbrain and Parkinson's disease. We critically evaluate the extent of recapitulation of PD pathology by organoids and discuss areas of future development that may lead to the model to become a next-generation, personalized therapeutic strategy for PD and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Both aging and neurodegenerative illnesses are thought to be influenced by mitochondrial malfunction and free radical formation. Deformities of the energy metabolism, mitochondrial genome polymorphisms, nuclear DNA genetic abnormalities associated with mitochondria, modifications of mitochondrial fusion or fission, variations in shape and size, variations in transit, modified mobility of mitochondria, transcription defects, and the emergence of misfolded proteins associated with mitochondria are all linked to Parkinson's disease.\nThis review is a condensed compilation of data from research that has been published between the years of 2014 and 2022, using search engines like Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus.\nMitochondrial transplantation is a one-of-a-kind treatment for mitochondrial diseases and deficits in mitochondrial biogenesis. The replacement of malfunctioning mitochondria with transplanted viable mitochondria using innovative methodologies has shown promising outcomes as a cure for Parkinson's, involving tissue sparing coupled with enhanced energy generation and lower oxidative damage. Numerous mitochondria-targeted therapies, including mitochondrial gene therapy, redox therapy, and others, have been investigated for their effectiveness and potency.\nThe development of innovative therapeutics for mitochondria-directed treatments in Parkinson's disease may be aided by optimizing mitochondrial dynamics. Many neurological diseases have been studied in animal and cellular models, and it has been found that mitochondrial maintenance can slow the death of neuronal cells. It has been hypothesized that drug therapies for neurodegenerative diseases that focus on mitochondrial dysfunction will help to delay the onset of neuronal dysfunction.",

    "results": "Mitochondrial transplantation is a one-of-a-kind treatment for mitochondrial diseases and deficits in mitochondrial biogenesis. The replacement of malfunctioning mitochondria with transplanted viable mitochondria using innovative methodologies has shown promising outcomes as a cure for Parkinson's, involving tissue sparing coupled with enhanced energy generation and lower oxidative damage. Numerous mitochondria-targeted therapies, including mitochondrial gene therapy, redox therapy, and others, have been investigated for their effectiveness and potency.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Genetic factors, inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, metabolic disorders, cytotoxic factors, and mitochondrial dysfunction are all involved in neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases. The risk of PD can be higher in aging individuals due to decreased mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) function. The potential of AMPK to regulate neurodegenerative disorders lies in its ability to enhance antioxidant capacity, reduce oxidative stress, improve mitochondrial function, decrease mitophagy and macroautophagy, and inhibit inflammation. In addition, it has been shown that modulating the catalytic activity of AMPK can protect the nervous system. This article reviews the mechanisms by which AMPK activation can modulate PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is typically characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Many studies have been performed based on the supplementation of lost dopaminergic neurons to treat Parkinson's disease. The initial strategy for cell replacement therapy used human fetal ventral midbrain and human embryonic stem cells to treat Parkinson's disease, which could substantially alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in clinical practice. However, ethical issues and tumor formation were limitations of its clinical application. Induced pluripotent stem cells can be acquired without sacrificing human embryos, which eliminates the huge ethical barriers of human stem cell therapy. Another widely considered neuronal regeneration strategy is to directly reprogram fibroblasts and astrocytes into neurons, without the need for intermediate proliferation states, thus avoiding issues of immune rejection and tumor formation. Both induced pluripotent stem cells and direct reprogramming of lineage cells have shown promising results in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, there are also ethical concerns and the risk of tumor formation that need to be addressed. This review highlights the current application status of cell reprogramming in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, focusing on the use of induced pluripotent stem cells in cell replacement therapy, including preclinical animal models and progress in clinical research. The review also discusses the advancements in direct reprogramming of lineage cells in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, as well as the controversy surrounding in vivo reprogramming. These findings suggest that cell reprogramming may hold great promise as a potential strategy for treating Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with a global burden that affects more often in the elderly. The basal ganglia (BG) is believed to account for movement disorders in PD. More recently, new findings in the original regions in BG involved in motor control, as well as the new circuits or new nucleuses previously not specifically considered were explored. In the present review, we provide up-to-date information related to movement disorders and modulations in PD, especially from the perspectives of brain regions and neuronal circuits. Meanwhile, there are updates in deep brain stimulation (DBS) and other factors for the motor improvement in PD. Comprehensive understandings of brain regions and neuronal circuits involved in motor control could benefit the development of novel therapeutical strategies in PD.",

    "abstract": "This comprehensive review explores the intricate relationship between nutrition, the gut microbiome, steroid hormones, and Parkinson's disease within the context of the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis plays a pivotal role in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, encompassing diverse components such as the gut microbiota, immune system, metabolism, and neural pathways. The gut microbiome, profoundly influenced by dietary factors, emerges as a key player. Nutrition during the first 1000 days of life shapes the gut microbiota composition, influencing immune responses and impacting both child development and adult health. High-fat, high-sugar diets can disrupt this delicate balance, contributing to inflammation and immune dysfunction. Exploring nutritional strategies, the Mediterranean diet's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties show promise in reducing Parkinson's disease risk. Microbiome-targeted dietary approaches and the ketogenic diet hold the potential in improving brain disorders. Beyond nutrition, emerging research uncovers potential interactions between steroid hormones, nutrition, and Parkinson's disease. Progesterone, with its anti-inflammatory properties and presence in the nervous system, offers a novel option for Parkinson's disease therapy. Its ability to enhance neuroprotection within the enteric nervous system presents exciting prospects. The review addresses the hypothesis that \u03b1-synuclein aggregates originate from the gut and may enter the brain via the vagus nerve. Gastrointestinal symptoms preceding motor symptoms support this hypothesis. Dysfunctional gut-brain signaling during gut dysbiosis contributes to inflammation and neurotransmitter imbalances, emphasizing the potential of microbiota-based interventions. In summary, this review uncovers the complex web of interactions between nutrition, the gut microbiome, steroid hormones, and Parkinson's disease within the gut-brain axis framework. Understanding these connections not only offers novel therapeutic insights but also illuminates the origins of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with psychosocial distress that affects patients' quality of life. The distress thermometer (DT) is an 11-point visual analogue scale that is used as a screening tool for the assessment of psychosocial distress, originally developed for oncological diseases.\nTo validate the DT for PD and to explore contributing factors.\nThe DT scale was administered to 105 people with Parkinson's Disease (PwPD). Along with it, we assessed motor symptoms (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III [UPDRS III], Hoehn and Yahr-stage [H&Y]), non-motor symptoms (Non-motor Symptom Questionnaire [NMSQ]), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS], Fear of Progression-Questionnaire Short Form [FOP-Q-SF], Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 [GAD-7], 9-question Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]), the feeling of hope (Herth Hope Index [HHI]) and quality of life (Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life [SEIQoL]).\nWith a cut-off of 4, the DT identified PwPD with distress with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 38%. With this cut-off, the DT will yield false negative results in 1 out of 100 cases. Factor analyses and a random forest regression of the dataset revealed that distress can be predicted by two factors, which we termed \"anxiety\" and \"depression/resilience/motor symptoms\".\nThe DT is an ultra-short and reliable screening tool for distress in PwPD. DT values below 4 rule out distress with a high degree of certainty. Anxiety and depression are important factors in distress but are counterbalanced by the individuals' psychological resilience.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the cognitive degenerative disorders of the central nervous system that affects the motor system. Gait dysfunction represents the pathology of motor symptom while gait analysis provides clinicians with subclinical information reflecting subtle differences between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Currently neurologists usually assess several clinical manifestations of the PD patients and rate the severity level according to some established criteria. This is highly dependent on clinician's expertise which is subjective and ineffective. In the present study we address these issues by proposing a hybrid signal processing and machine learning based gait classification system for gait anomaly detection and severity rating of PD patients. Time series of vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) data are utilized to represent discriminant gait information. First, phase space of the VGRF is reconstructed, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear gait system dynamics are preserved. Then Shannon energy is used to extract the characteristic envelope of the phase space signal. Third, Shannon energy envelope is decomposed into high and low resonance components using dual ",

    "abstract": "Levodopa-entacapone-carbidopa intestinal gel (LECIG) is a novel device assisted treatment option for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been available in Finland since 2020. There is paucity of scientific studies considering LECIG treatment in clinical practice.\nObjectives of this study were to evaluate the changes in medication, adverse events and early discontinuations of LECIG treatment in real life clinical practice.\nThe records of 30 consecutive patients, who received LECIG between years 2020 and 2022 in Helsinki University Hospital, were retrospectively analyzed. Data considering changes in medication, discontinuations, and adverse events during the first six months of LECIG treatment was collected.\nMean levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) rose significantly between baseline before LECIG and six months with treatment (1230\u2009mg vs. 1570\u2009mg, P\u2009=\u20090.001). Three patients were discarded during nasojejunal tube test phase and seven discontinued the treatment during six-month follow-up. Most common reasons for discontinuation were difficulty in finding suitable infusion rate and neuropsychiatric problems. Safety issues encountered were similar to those reported with levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) treatment. One case of rhabdomyolysis due to severe dyskinesia during LECIG treatment was observed. Patients were satisfied with the small size of the pump system.\nLEDD seems to increase during the first months of LECIG treatment. When compared to studies on LCIG, safety profile of LECIG appears similar, but early discontinuation rate is higher than expected. However, long-term studies are lacking. Only clear advantage to LCIG appears to be the smaller LECIG pump size.",

In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial we explored the role of nVNS in the treatment of gait and other motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. In a subgroup of patients, we measured selected neurotrophins, inflammatory markers and markers of oxidative stress in serum. Thirty-three PD patients with freezing of gait (FOG) were randomized to either active nVNS or sham nVNS. After baseline assessments, patients were instructed to deliver six 2\u2009 min stimulations (12 \u2009min/day) of the active nVNS/sham nVNS device for 1 \u2009month at home. Patients were then re-assessed. After a one-month washout period, they were allocated to the alternate treatment arm and the same process was followed. Significant improvements in key gait parameters (speed, stance time and step length) were observed with active nVNS. While serum tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 decreased, glutathione and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels increased significantly (",

    "abstract": "The neuroprotective effects of dietary patterns have been reported in previous studies. This study aimed to examine the association between the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH), the Mediterranean diet (MeDi), and the Mediterranean-DASH intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) with the severity and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this comparative cross-sectional study, 120 patients with PD and 50 healthy participants participated. Adherence to DASH, MeDi, and MIND dietary patterns was determined according to the dietary intake data using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The Severity of PD was determined by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The mean score of the DASH was significantly lower in the PD group compared to the healthy group (",

Using Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines to examined the associations between use of fish oil supplements, PA and PD risk.\nDuring a median 12.52-year follow-up, 2,131 participants incident PD. Analysis showed that fish oil supplement users had a lower PD risk [hazard ratio (HR), 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.82-0.98]. The adjusted HRs for the PD incidence were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.98) for total PA; 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96) for moderate PA; 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.99) for vigorous PA and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.98) for walking activity. Significant interactions were found between fish oil supplement use and total PA (\nBoth fish oil supplement use and PA were associated with a reduced risk of PD, and the effect of PA in reducing the risk of PD was more pronounced when fish oil supplement was used.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) often necessitates immediate medical intervention following diagnosis. In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in clinical investigations assessing the efficacy of acupuncture in PD, with many studies reporting positive outcomes. Ethical guidelines commonly endorse pharmaceutical therapies for PD, leading ongoing research to combine acupuncture with standard drug-based treatments. At present, there is a conspicuous absence of dedicated clinical research exclusively examining the independent impact of acupuncture on PD treatment.\nIn a clinical observation, we documented a case involving a 75-year-old male displaying progressive, characteristic PD symptoms, including evident limb tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, fatigue, and additional non-motor symptoms. The patient received a confirmed diagnosis of PD. Due to the refusal of the patient to take medication, we exclusively administered acupuncture therapy. The outcomes indicated a noteworthy enhancement in the clinical symptoms of the patient solely through acupuncture intervention.\nThis case affirms that using acupuncture in isolation significantly improved both the motor and non-motor symptoms in the patient. Acupuncture could potentially serve as an alternative therapy for patients who decline or are intolerant to anti-Parkinson drugs. However, further studies are needed to assess its long-term efficacy. This case report obtained approval from the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (Ethics number: K-2023-127).",

Among these non-motor symptoms, cognitive dysfunction has emerged as an area of particular interest where the clinical aspects are covered in Chapter 2 of this volume. This chapter explores the rationale for investigating the underlying neurobiology of cognitive dysfunction by utilising translational animal models of PD, from rodents to non-human primates. The objective of this chapter is to review the various animal models of cognition that have explored the dysfunction in animal models of Parkinson's disease. Some of the more advanced pharmacological studies aimed at restoring these cognitive deficits are reviewed, although this chapter highlights the lack of systematic approaches in dealing with this non-motor symptom at the pre-clinical stages.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and often appear from the early-phase disease or prodromal stages. In this chapter, we will discuss the current evidence addressing the links between sleep dysfunctions in PD, focusing most closely on those data from animal and mathematical/computational models, as well as in human-based studies that explore the electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms by which PD and sleep may be intertwined, whether as predictors or consequences of the disease. It is possible to clearly state that leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) is significantly related to alterations in sleep architecture, particularly affecting rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep, thus impacting sleep quality. Also, decreases in gamma power, observed after dopaminergic lesions, correlates negatively with the degree of injury, which brings other levels of understanding the impacts of the disease. Besides, abnormal synchronized oscillations among basal ganglia nuclei can be detrimental for information processing considering both motor and sleep-related processes. Altogether, despite clear advances in the field, it is still difficult to definitely establish a comprehensive understanding of causality among all the sleep dysfunctions with the disease itself. Although, certainly, the search for biomarkers is helping in shortening this road towards a better and faster diagnosis, as well as looking for more efficient treatments.",

    "abstract": "Affective neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety and apathy are among the most frequent non-motor symptoms observed in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). These conditions often emerge during the prodromal phase of the disease and are generally considered to result from neurodegenerative processes in meso-corticolimbic structures, occurring in parallel to the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Depression, anxiety, and apathy are often treated with conventional medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and dopaminergic agonists. The ability of these pharmacological interventions to consistently counteract such neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD is still relatively limited and the development of reliable experimental models represents an important tool to identify more effective treatments. This chapter provides information on rodent models of PD utilized to study these affective neuropsychiatric symptoms. Neurotoxin-based and genetic models are discussed, together with the main behavioral tests utilized to identify depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, anhedonia, and apathy. The ability of various therapeutic approaches to counteract the symptoms observed in the various models is also reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Bromocriptine is a partial antagonist for D1 dopamine receptors while also serving as a selective agonist on D2 dopamine receptors as a dopamine receptor agonist. Apart from prolactin inhibiting action, bromocriptine has some beneficial effects on the blood pressure, plasma norepinephrine levels and vascular resistance. Dopamine D2 receptor activation of bromocriptine is associated with the antihypertensive effect, which lowers blood pressure via inhibiting sympathetic nerve activity and Na/K ATPase activity. Plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1B and IL-18, chemokine CCL2/ MCP-1/, and the pro-inflammatory hormone prolactin, all of which are elevated and linked to accelerated cardiometabolic illness, were decreased because of bromocriptine therapy. The most common side effects of Bromocriptine use are dizziness, nausea, headache, vomiting and hypotension. Bromocriptine is mainly contraindicated in patients with syncope with hypotension, psychosis, and type I diabetes mellitus. The authors suggest that developing therapies directed to increase D2 receptor expression and function by drugs like Bromocriptine can provide practical and novelistic approaches to prevent and manage myocardial and renal injury in the cardiovascular disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms, many of which are resistant to currently available treatments. Since the discovery that non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can cause dopamine release in PD patients, there has been growing interest in the use of TMS to fill existing gaps in the treatment continuum for PD. This review evaluates the safety and efficacy of a unique multifocal, bilateral Deep TMS protocol, which has been evaluated as a tool to address motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Six published clinical trials have delivered a two-stage TMS protocol with an H-Coil targeting both the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and motor cortex (M1) bilaterally (220 PD patients in total; 108 from two randomized, sham-controlled studies; 112 from open label or registry studies). In all studies TMS was delivered to M1 bilaterally (Stage 1) and then to the PFC bilaterally (Stage 2) with approximately 900 pulses per stage. For Stage 1 (M1), two studies delivered 10 Hz at 90% motor threshold (MT) while four studies delivered 1 Hz at 110% MT. For Stage 2 (PFC), all studies delivered 10 Hz at 100% MT. The results suggest that this two-stage Deep TMS protocol is a safe, moderately effective treatment for motor symptoms of PD, and that severely impaired patients have the highest benefits. Deep TMS also improves mood symptoms and cognitive function in these patients. Further research is needed to establish optimal dosing and the long-term durability of treatment effects.",

    "abstract": "The Nurse Professional Development Model (NPD) has been utilized to improve quality of care for several conditions. Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) are susceptible to higher risks while in the hospital. Educational efforts for this patient population are challenged by the small, disbursed number of patients as well as increased turn-over and reliance on temporary nursing staff. To properly care for this patient group, any education has to be hospital wide and ongoing for maintenance of competency. We have used the NPD Model to initiate education for new incoming nurses as well as for continued education for a program that requires hospital-wide reach. Our utilization of the NPD Model for this high risk, low volume patient population has helped us improve the safety of this patient population in the hospital. With this manuscript we detail the need and the educational platform with the hope of it serving as a reference for other institutions facing similar challenges.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was investigation the ratio of excitatory and depressor post-stimulus manifestations of Periaqueductal gray (PAG) single neuron activity during Locus coeruleus (LC) stimulation in a Parkinson's disease (PD) model to identify excitotoxicity in neurodegeneration and the formation of persistent pain, which is poorly treatable. The electrophysiological studies were performed on 6 Albino rats (230\u00b130g.): intact (n=3) and on the rotenone model of Parkinson's disease (PD) induced by unilateral injection of rotenone for 4 weeks holding of animals (n=3). The extracellular on-line registration of spike activity of 236 single neurons of the Periaqueductal gray (PAG) at high frequency stimulation (HFS) of Locus coeruleus (LC) in intact animals (116 neurons) and on the model of PD (120 neurons) was produced. According to programmed mathematical analyses were detected changes in depressor and excitatory responses (TD and TP), accompanied by post-tetanic depression and potentiation. In the neurons PAG at HFS LC on the model of PD the full suppression of synaptic depressor poststimulus manifestations of activity, accompanied by posttetanic and the prevalence of such excitatory has been revealed. Was the conclusion about serious neurodegenerative damage of the important antinociceptive structure - PAG, that promotes resistant chronic pain in parkinsonian patients.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies show that smokers have a lower incidence of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Nicotine has been hypothesized to slow progression in early Parkinson\u2019s disease. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial, we randomly assigned patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, diagnosed within 18 months, who were in Hoehn and Yahr disease stage less than or equal to 2 (range from 0 to 5; higher scores indicate greater impairment), who were therapy na\u00efve (except for stable monoamine-oxidase-B inhibition), and not requiring dopaminergic therapy, to transdermal nicotine or placebo. The primary end point was change in Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale parts I\u2013III (Total UPDRS) score (range from 0 to 172; higher scores indicate greater impairment) between baseline and 60 weeks (52 weeks of trial therapy, 8 weeks of washout). The first secondary end point was change in Total UPDRS from baseline to 52 weeks. Differences between groups were estimated using the Hodges\u2013Lehmann (HL) method and tested with the exact two-sided stratified Mann\u2013Whitney\u2013Wilcoxon test according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Among 163 participants, 101 were assessed for the primary end point. Mean worsening of Total UPDRS was 3.5 in the placebo versus 6.0 in the nicotine group (HL-difference with 95% CI: \u20133 [\u20136 to 0], P=0.06). For the first secondary end point, analysis of 138 participants showed a mean worsening of 5.4 in the placebo versus 9.1 in the nicotine group (HL-difference with 95% CI: \u20134 [\u20137 to \u20131]).\u00a0Dropout was mainly because of early treatment discontinuation or adverse events. Cutaneous adverse effects at the patch application site were common. In all, 34.6% of participants initiated dopaminergic therapy during participation. CONCLUSIONS: One-year transdermal nicotine treatment did not slow progression in early Parkinson\u2019s disease. (Funded by the Michael J.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is known as the second most destructive central nervous system (CNS) disorder, which leads to movement slowness, tremors, decreased balance, instability, and CNS disorders in affected patients. This study aimed to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises on the balance and the quality of life in patients with PD.\nThis was a quasi-experimental study, and the research population consisted of PD patients in Zahedan City who were present at the Zahedan Elderly Center during May, June, and July 2022. Twenty-four individuals who were 53 to 69 years old volunteered to participate in this study and were assigned to the experimental (N = 12) and control (N = 12) groups. In addition to the usual treatment, the experimental group performed Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises (CCE) exercises for 12 weeks, while the control group only received the usual treatment during this period. The CCE exercises were performed for 60-minute sessions, three days a week, for twelve weeks. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was used to evaluate balance, and the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQL 37) was used to assess the QOL of PD. The data were analyzed using Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U tests.\nThe Mann-Whitney U test results revealed that the experimental group exhibited significantly higher scores in all factors of QOL and balance during the post-test when compared to the control group ( \nThe study demonstrates that CCE exercises positively influence the balance and quality of life of Parkinson's disease patients, suggesting their potential as complementary therapy in the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Previous cross-sectional studies have shown that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations than controls. Other studies have not yet tested whether research findings from other regions are generalizable to Chinese populations. In this case-control study, we examined the correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and Parkinson's disease.\nWe established an association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and PD in a case-control study of 100 PD patients and 100 control subjects free of neurological disease at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University.\nTotal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were deficient in 21 % of patients with PD compared with 4 % of controls. In univariate analyses, plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were associated with PD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In multivariate analyses, vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <\u00a020\u00a0ng/mL) was significantly associated with PD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008, Odds Ratio =17.13, 95 % CI= 2.082-141.075). Individuals with 25(OH)D levels in the lowest quartile had the highest prevalence of PD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026, OR=11.786, 95 % CI =1.342-103.51 compared to individuals with values in the highest quartile).\nOur study reveals an association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and PD. Patients with incident PD had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations than age-matched controls. High-risk PD patients with vitamin D deficiency who have not yet developed exercise impairment should undergo vitamin D measurement and any necessary treatment as soon as possible. Limitations of the study: the study needs further assessment of populations with low vitamin D levels in other regions of China; further assessment of the effect of different sources of vitamin D on PD; further study of longitudinal cohorts at different time points.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to explore the prevalence and influencing factors of depression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThis was a cross-sectional study of the clinical data of 179 PD patients for retrospective analysis. Using the self-rating depression scale (SDS) and the Hamilton depression scale-21 (HAMD-21), we evaluated the prevalence of depression and analyzed the factors influencing depression in PD.\nThe prevalence of depression in PD patients was 45.25%, and the degree of depression was mainly mild to moderate. Sleep status, daily use of levodopa, a high Hoehn and Yahr stage, a high unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) II score, and a high UPDRS III score were all risk factors for depression in PD patients.\nThe prevalence of depression in PD patients is high, and the degree of depression is closely related to many factors, which should receive close attention in clinical work.",

    "abstract": "Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are often configured to address challenges and improve patient safety for persons with Parkinson's disease (PWP). For example, EHR systems can help identify Parkinson's disease (PD) patients across the hospital by flagging a patient's diagnosis in their chart, preventing errors in medication and dosing through the use of clinical decision support, and supplementing staff education through care plans that provide step-by-step road maps for disease-based care of a specific patient population. However, most EHR-based solutions are locally developed and, thus, difficult to scale widely or apply uniformly across hospital systems. In 2020, the Parkinson's Foundation, a national and international leader in PD research, education, and advocacy, and Epic, a leading EHR vendor with more than 35% market share in the United States, launched a partnership to reduce risks to hospitalized PWP using standardized EHR-based solutions. This article discusses that project which included leadership from physician informaticists, movement disorders specialists, hospital quality officers, the Parkinson's Foundation and members of the Parkinson's community. We describe the best practice solutions developed through this project. We highlight those that are currently available as standard defaults or options within the Epic EHR, discuss the successes and limitations of these solutions, and consider opportunities for scalability in environments beyond a single EHR vendor. The Parkinson's Foundation and Epic launched a partnership to develop best practice solutions in the Epic EHR system to improve safety for PWP in the hospital. The goal of the partnership was to create the EHR tools that will have the greatest impact on outcomes for hospitalized PWP.",

This study aimed to retrospectively investigate the records of patients with PD and analyze dental and general problems to establish countermeasures during dental treatments.\nWe retrospectively examined the medical records of patients with PD to obtain data on dental treatments and management methods.\nOf the 27 patients, 40% had severe grade IV or higher Hoehn-Yale (HY) scores, and the wearing-off phenomenon was observed in those with grade III or higher. Additionally, 19% of the patients were receiving levodopa 500\u00a0mg/day or more. Intravenous sedation was administered 21 times (three patients) and general anesthesia eight times (three patients). Discontinuation of tooth extraction was observed in four patients: two with difficulty in opening the mouth, one with respiratory failure caused by the wearing-off phenomenon, and one with excessively elevated blood pressure due to the interaction between adrenaline in local anesthesia and the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor. Tooth extraction was performed by adjusting the time of levodopa administration in two patients, under general anesthesia in one patient, and using adrenaline-free local anesthetics under intravenous sedation in one patient.\nWhen PD progresses, oral and swallowing functions decline and body motor function deteriorates. Thus, the respiratory and circulatory conditions and the wearing-off phenomenon during dental treatments should be properly managed in patients with severe PD.",

    "abstract": "Visual hallucination is a prevalent psychiatric disorder characterized by the occurrence of false visual perceptions due to misinterpretation in the brain. Individuals with Parkinson's disease often experience both minor and complex visual hallucinations. The underlying mechanism of complex visual hallucinations in Parkinson's patients is commonly attributed to dysfunction in the visual pathway and attention network. However, there is limited research on the mechanism of minor hallucinations.\nTo address this gap, we conducted an experiment involving 13 Parkinson's patients with minor hallucinations, 13 Parkinson's patients without hallucinations, and 13 healthy elderly individuals. We collected and analyzed EEG and MRI data. Furthermore, we utilized EEG data from abnormal brain regions to train a machine learning model to determine whether the abnormal EEG data were associated with minor hallucinations.\nOur findings revealed that Parkinson's patients with minor hallucinations exhibited excessive activation of cortical excitability, an imbalanced interaction between the attention network and the default network, and disruption in the connection between these networks. These findings is similar to the mechanism observed in complex visual hallucinations. The visual reconstruction of one patient experiencing hallucinations yields results that differ from those observed in subjects without such symptoms.\nThe visual reconstruction results demonstrated significant differences between Parkinson's patients with hallucinations and healthy subjects. This suggests that visual reconstruction techniques may offer a means of evaluating hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) affects 30%-40% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and has been linked to a higher risk of cognitive impairment, especially executive dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the brain activation patterns in PD patients with RBD (PD-RBD+) compared to those without RBD (PD-RBD-) and healthy controls (HCs), and to analyze the correlation between changes in cerebral cortex activity and the severity of RBD.\nWe recruited 50 PD patients, including 30 PD-RBD+, 20 PD-RBD-, and 20 HCs. We used functional near infrared spectroscopy during a verbal fluency task (VFT-fNIRS) and clinical neuropsychological assessment to explore the correlation between PD-RBD+ and executive function and changes in neural activity.\nThe VFT-fNIRS analysis revealed a significant reduction in activation among PD-RBD+ patients across multiple channels when compared to both the PD-RBD- and HC groups. Specifically, PD-RBD+ patients exhibited diminished activation in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) relative to their PD-RBD- counterparts. Furthermore, compared to the HC group, PD-RBD+ patients displayed reduced activation specifically in the right DLPFC. Significantly, a noteworthy negative correlation was identified between the average change in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (\u0394HbO\nOur study offers compelling evidence that RBD exacerbates cognitive impairment in PD, manifested as executive dysfunction, primarily attributed to reduced prefrontal activation. These aberrations in brain activation may potentially correlate with the severity of RBD.",

    "results": "The VFT-fNIRS analysis revealed a significant reduction in activation among PD-RBD+ patients across multiple channels when compared to both the PD-RBD- and HC groups. Specifically, PD-RBD+ patients exhibited diminished activation in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) relative to their PD-RBD- counterparts. Furthermore, compared to the HC group, PD-RBD+ patients displayed reduced activation specifically in the right DLPFC. Significantly, a noteworthy negative correlation was identified between the average change in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (\u0394HbO",

    "abstract": "In our previous study, istradefylline treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) improved postural abnormalities (PAs), as seen from a decrease in the mean Unified Dystonia Rating Scale (UDRS) total score from week 0 to week 24. A subgroup analysis based on baseline clinical characteristics investigated the association between improvement in the UDRS total score and istradefylline treatment. However, the association between an objective assessment of PAs and improvement in the UDRS total score is unclear. This ad hoc analysis investigated the association between improvement in the UDRS total score after istradefylline treatment and baseline trunk and neck angles, objective assessments of PAs, measured from patients' photographs taken in the previous study.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease with currently no cure. Most PD cases are sporadic, and about 5-10% of PD cases present a monogenic inheritance pattern. Mutations in more than 20 genes are associated with genetic forms of PD. Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered a prominent player in PD pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) allow rapid switching of protein functions and therefore impact various cellular functions including those related to mitochondria. Among the PD-associated genes, ",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThis single-center, prospective, and implementation study with before-after design included five participants diagnosed with PD. Auricular VNS was applied to each participant 3 times on different days. VNS was applied to the participants as the right ear, left ear, and bilateral ear. The cardiovascular parameters of the participants were evaluated with Kubios HRV Standard and tremor with UPDRS tremor subscale and smartphone application before and after the intervention.\nSignificant decrease in diastolic blood pressure (p=0.043) was found in participants who underwent bilateral auricular VNS. Although there was no significant change in the UPDRS tremor subscale, decreases in the maximum tremor amplitude in the x (p=0.043) and y (0.014) planes were detected in the measurements made with the smartphone application.\nIn this study, a decrease in the tremor amplitude measured in the 3D plane with auricular VNS was found in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Combined plantar pressure and vibratory stimulation has been shown to decrease freezing of gait (FOG) episodes and improve spatiotemporal gait parameters compared to single stimulation in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with FOG. However, the effect of combined plantar stimulations on plantar pressure analysis has never been explored.\nForty PD patients with frequent FOG were allocated to either FOG shoes embedded with a 100\u2009Hz vibratory stimulation at the Achilles tendons and a soft thickened silicone pad at the hallux and sole, or sham shoes with a non-working vibratory motor and a flat non-pressure silicone pad (20 patients per arm) while seated for 96\u2009s. The objective gait and plantar pressure analysis were measured immediately after the stimulation. Outcomes included the normalized percentage of changes in percent FOG (%FOG) and plantar pressure in the heel-strike and push-off phase that were compared between pre- and post-stimulations.\nThe FOG shoes group showed significantly decreased %FOG (81.5\u2009\u00b1\u200928.9% vs. 6.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.1%, \nOur study demonstrated that the FOG shoe could decrease FOG episodes by improving the heel-strike pressure, toe push-off and normalized heel-to-toe plantar pressure, suggesting that modification inputs from the peripheral sensory systems might significant improvement in FOG in PD.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus interna (GPi) are two main structures primarily targeted by deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). A subset of cases with unsatisfactory outcomes may benefit from rescue DBS surgery targeting another structure, while these patients' characteristics have not been well described and this phenomenon has not been well reviewed.\nThis monocentric retrospective study included patients with PD, who underwent rescue STN DBS following an unsatisfactory outcome of the initial bilateral GPi DBS in a retrospective manner. A short review of the current literature was conducted to report the clinical outcome of rescue DBS surgeries.\nEight patients were identified, and six of them were included in this study. The rescue STN DBS was performed 19.8 months after the initial GPi DBS. After 8.8 months from the rescue STN DBS, patients showed a significant off-medication improvement by 29.2% in motor symptoms compared to initial GPi DBS. Non-motor symptoms and the health-related quality of life were also significantly improved.\nOur findings suggest that the rescue STN DBS may improve off-medication motor and non-motor symptoms and quality of life in patients with failure of initial GPi DBS. The short review of the current literature showed that the target switching from GPi to STN was mainly due to poor initial outcomes and was performed by target substitution, whereas the switching from STN to GPi was mainly due to a gradual waning of benefits, long-term axial symptoms, dyskinesia, and dystonia and was performed by target addition.",

    "abstract": "The lost dopaminergic neurons in the brain prevent mobility in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is impossible to stop the disease's progress by means of symptoms management. Research focuses on oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal degeneration. Exploration of potential neuroprotective drugs against prosurvival B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein is ongoing. An investigable cause behind PD, as well as preventive measures, could be discovered considering the association between such behavioural manifestations (cataleptic behaviours) and PD. The compound Afzelin, known to guard the nervous system, was chosen for this study. The study was done on rats divided into six different groups. First, there was a control group. The other group was treated with Reserpine (RES) (1\u00a0mg/kg). The third group received RES (1\u00a0mg/kg) and levodopa (30\u00a0mg/kg). The remaining three groups were given RES (1\u00a0mg/kg) in conjunction with Afzelin at the following doses: 5\u00a0mg/kg, 10\u00a0mg/kg, and 20\u00a0mg/kg. Cataleptic behavior and mobility in rats was assessed using the rotarod, open field, and modified forced-swim tests. thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), nitric oxide (NO), biogenic amines, and Bcl-2 level in rat tissue homogenates were considered. According to the study's findings, the rats treated through co-administration of RES and Afzelin improved significantly in their cataleptic behaviours and locomotor activity. In addition, administering Afzelin itself caused Bcl-2 expression, which could have some neuroprotection properties. This study provides meaningful information on the effectiveness of Afzelin in handling catalepsy and other degenerative neurologic disorders. As a result, other studies need to be conducted to establish the reasons behind the reactions and determine the long-term effects of Afzelin on these conditions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms deteriorate with disease progression. Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) can effectively improve the motor signs of PD patients, it is not yet known whether DBS surgery, which is an invasive treatment modality, may change the progression of PD.\nThe aim of this work was to compare the effect of DBS with that of drug treatment on the progression of PD.\nA total of 77 patients with PD with the Hoehn and Yahr scale (HY) stage of 2.5 or 3 were included, and were divided into 34 in the drug therapy alone group (Drug-G) and 43 in the DBS therapy group (DBS-G). All patients were subjected to a follow-up of 2\u2009years, and disease severity was assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores. In addition, the quality of life of patients and the burden on their family were assessed by the 39-item PD questionnaire (PDQ-39) scores, daily levodopa equivalent dose (LED), patient's annual treatment-related costs, and the Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale (ZCBS) score. The changes in relevant scale scores between the two groups were compared at each follow-up stage.\nThe UPDRS-III score of the patients in the \"off\" state increased from year to year in both groups, and the degree of increase of this score was greater in the DBS-G than in the Drug-G group. The MOCA score in both groups began to decline in the 2nd year of follow-up, and the decline was greater in the Drug-G than in the DBS-G group. DBS treatment did not affect patients' psychiatric disorders. The PDQ39, LED, costs, and ZCBS were negatively correlated with the follow-up time in patients in the DBS-G group, and positively correlated with the follow-up time in patients in the Drug-G.\nPD is progressive regardless of treatment. The findings from this follow-up study suggest that the disease progression of patients in DBS-G may be slightly faster compared to the drug-G, but the advantages of DBS are also evident. Indeed, DBS better improves patient's motor signs and quality of life and reduces the family burden. In addition, DBS has less impact on patients in terms of cognitive and mental effects.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disease caused by antibodies against the neuromuscular junction. PD and comorbid MG are rarely seen.\nHere we report on a patient who was diagnosed with PD and MG. A 74-year-old man had a 4-year history of bradykinesia and was diagnosed with PD. He subsequently developed incomplete palpebral ptosis, apparent dropped head, and shuffling of gait. The results of neostigmine tests were positive. Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) showed significant decremental responses at 3 and 5 Hz in the orbicularis oculi. The patient's anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AchR) antibody serum level was also elevated. Meanwhile, 9-[\nAlthough PD with MG is rare, we still need to notice the possibility that a PD patient may have comorbid MG. The underlying mechanism of PD and comorbid MG remains unknown, but an imbalance between the neurotransmitters dopamine and acetylcholine and the immune system are likely to play significant roles in the pathogenesis. In this article, we present our case and a literature review on the co-occurrence of PD and MG, reviewing their clinical features, and discuss the underlying pathogenic mechanism of this comorbidity.",

    "abstract": "Available data suggest that there may be gender differences in the effect of STN-DBS in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study was to review data on gender discrepancies and gender differences in clinical outcomes in PD patients treated with deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS). Included were original studies that specifically examined gender discrepancies or gender differences in PD patients with STN-DBS. Men receive more DBS than women, for various indications. The decision-making process for DBS in women compared to men is more influenced by personal preferences and external factors. Motor symptoms improve in both genders, but bradykinesia improves more in men. The postoperative reduction of the levodopa equivalent daily dose seems to be more pronounced in men. Men show more cognitive deterioration and less improvement than women after STN-DBS. Women show more depressive symptoms before surgery, but they improve similarly to men. Men show more improvement in impulsivity and less decrease in impulsive behaviour symptoms than women. Anxiety and personality traits remain unchanged in both genders. Voice quality improves more in men and deteriorates less often than in women. Men gain fat-free mass and fat mass, but women only gain fat mass. Regarding sexual function the evidence is inconsistent. More urinary symptoms improve in women than in men. Pain and restless leg syndrome seems to improve more in men. Regarding quality of life, the evidence seems to be inconsistent, and activities of daily living seems to improve in both genders. Better prospective controlled studies, focusing directly on gender differences in PD patients treated with STN-DBS, are needed to better explain gender differences in STN-DBS for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disorder (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 1-3% of the population aged 60\u2009years and older. In addition to motor difficulties, PD is also marked by visual disturbances, including depth perception, abnormalities in basal ganglia functioning, and dopamine deficiency. Reduced ability to perceive depth has been linked to an increased risk of falling in this population. The purpose of this paper was to determine whether disturbances in PD patients' visual processing manifest through atypical performance on visual illusion (VI) tasks. This insight will advance understanding of high-level perception in PD, as well as indicate the role of dopamine deficiency and basal ganglia pathophysiology in VIs susceptibility. Groups of 28 PD patients (",

    "abstract": "Decreased melatonin levels have been linked to both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), which are the two most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. The development of sleep disorders is widespread in patients diagnosed with AD or PD. In this regard, calcification of the pineal gland, typically seen in the third decade, has been associated with a reduction in melatonin production. Recent studies have suggested that exogenous melatonin application can be utilized to treat sleep disorders in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, research has shown that deficiencies in melatonin levels in patients with AD or PD begin before a diagnosis of either\u00a0disease is made. These findings could encourage further research on melatonin as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis or a possible area for the early treatment of these diseases. Many clinical studies have also produced data denoting melatonin treatment as a method to reduce the detrimental neurocognitive effects of these diseases. Further research on the role of melatonin in neurodegenerative diseases could expand symptomatic and prophylactic treatment options for diseases such as AD and PD. This review investigates melatonin's physiological properties, its role in AD and PD, and current findings on its potential therapeutic benefits in AD and PD patients.",

    "abstract": "There is a critical need for accessible neuropsychological testing for basic research and translational studies worldwide. Traditional in-person neuropsychological studies are inherently difficult to conduct because testing requires the recruitment and participation of individuals with neurological conditions. Consequently, studies are often based on small sample sizes, are highly time-consuming, and lack diversity. To address these challenges, in the last decade, the utilization of remote testing platforms has demonstrated promising results regarding the feasibility and efficiency of collecting patient data online. Herein, we tested the validity and generalizability of remote administration of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. We administered the MoCA to English and Hebrew speakers from three different populations: Parkinson's disease, Cerebellar Ataxia, and healthy controls via video conferencing. First, we found that the online MoCA scores do not differ from traditional in-person studies, demonstrating convergent validity. Second, the MoCA scores of both our online patient groups were lower than controls, demonstrating construct validity. Third, we did not find differences between the two language versions of the remote MoCA, supporting its generalizability to different languages and the efficiency of collecting binational data (USA and Israel). Given these results, future studies can utilize the remote MoCA, and potentially other remote neuropsychological tests to collect data more efficiently across multiple different patient populations, language versions, and nations.",

    "abstract": "Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is an effective and safe therapy for the symptomatic treatment of several neurological disturbances. An important line of research has provided numerous pieces of evidence about the mechanisms of action of BoNT in the central nervous system, especially in the context of dystonia and spasticity. However, only a few studies focused on the possible central effects of BoNT in Parkinson's disease (PD). We performed a systematic review to describe and discuss the evidence from studies focused on possible central effects of BoNT in PD animal models and PD patients. To this aim, a literature search in PubMed and SCOPUS was performed in May 2023. The records were screened according to title and abstract by two independent reviewers and relevant articles were selected for full-text review. Most of the papers highlighted by our review report that the intrastriatal administration of BoNT, through local anticholinergic action and the remodulation of striatal compensatory mechanisms secondary to dopaminergic denervation, induces an improvement in motor and non-motor symptoms in the absence of neuronal loss in animal models of PD. In human subjects, the data are scarce: a single neurophysiological study in tremulous PD patients found that the change in tremor severity after peripheral BoNT administration was associated with improved sensory-motor integration and intracortical inhibition measures. Further clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging studies are necessary to clarify the possible central effects of BoNT in PD.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is a prevalent non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), affecting approximately 65-90% of subjects. PD patients may also report odor perception in the absence of any external source, often referred to as olfactory hallucinations (OHs) or phantosmia. This study aims to explore the current understanding of OHs in PD and offer a comprehensive overview of their prevalence and characteristics. We conducted a systematic search of the literature published on PubMed from inception to July 2023 regarding OHs in PD, following PRISMA guidelines. From the 2875 studies identified through database searching, 29 studies fulfilled the necessary criteria and underwent data extraction. The frequency of OHs in PD patients varies widely, ranging from 0.5% to 18.2%, with female prevalence ranging from 36% to 75% of the patients. Olfactory experiences may vary widely, ranging from pleasant scents to unpleasant odors. Several studies have indicated the concurrent presence of other types of hallucinations alongside phantosmia, especially visual and auditory hallucinations. OHs in PD are a type of hallucination that has been largely overlooked. To gain a deeper understanding of OHs in PD patients, the next crucial step should involve the development and validation of a dedicated questionnaire.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. An objective diagnosis method is urgently needed in clinical practice. In this study, deep learning and radiomics techniques were studied to automatically diagnose PD from healthy controls (HCs).\n155 PD patients and 154 HCs were randomly divided into a training set (246 patients) and a testing set (63 patients). The brain subregions identification and segmentation were automatically performed with a VB-net, and radiomics features of billateral thalamus, caudatum, putamen and pallidum were extracted. Five independent machine learning classifiers [Support Vector Machine (SVM), Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), random forest (RF), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and decision tree (DT)] were trained on the training set, and validated on the testing. Delong test was used to compare the performance of different models.\nOur VB-net could automatically identify and segment the brain into 109 regions. 2,264 radiomics features were automatically extracted from the billateral thalamus, caudatum, putamen or pallidum of each patient. After four step of features dimensionality reduction, Delong tests showed that the SVM model based on combined features had the best performance, with AUCs of 0.988 (95% CI: 0.979\u2009~\u20090.998, specificity\u2009=\u200991.1%, sensitivity =100%, accuracy\u2009=\u200989.4% and precision\u2009=\u200988.2%) and 0.976 (95% CI: 0.942\u2009~\u20091.000, specificity\u2009=\u2009100%, sensitivity\u2009=\u200987.1%, accuracy\u2009=\u200993.5% and precision\u2009=\u200988.6%) in the training set and testing set, respectively. Decision curve analysis showed that the clinical benefit of the line graph model was high.\nThe SVM model based on combined features could be used to diagnose PD with high accuracy. Our fully automatic model could rapidly process the MRI data and distinguish PD and HCs in one minute. It greatly improved the diagnostic efficiency and has a great potential value in clinical practice to help the early diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Dyskinesia-hyperpyrexia syndrome, a rare medical emergency in Parkinson's disease, is first described in 2010. It is characterized by severe continuous dyskinesia associated with rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia and subsequent alteration of the mental state. Gradual reduction of dopaminergic dose or DBS is recommended treatment. The prognosis is usually good, but sometimes fatal. But so far, this potentially fatal complication is not widely recognized by clinicians. In emergency, if clinicians fail to make prompt diagnosis and treatment, patients' conditions may get worse, and their lives may be threatened in serious cases.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss is one of the non-motor symptoms frequently seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). Weight loss in PwPD is known to be negatively associated with motor and other non-motor symptoms and has been shown to influence the prognosis of PD. In this study, we followed weight change over a 4-year period in PwPD at a single institution and investigated the relationship between weight change and patients' motor and non-motor symptoms.\nPwPD who visited our hospital from January 2018 to December 2022 were enrolled. Body weights were measured at two points in 2018 (at the start of observation, 'baseline') and 2022 (at the end of observation, 'end date'). In addition, motor symptoms, disease severity, cognitive function, and psychiatric symptoms were evaluated during the same period, and the relationship with weight loss was examined.\nData of 96 PwPD were available for a 4-year follow-up. At baseline, the mean age was 65.7\u2009\u00b1\u200910.0\u2009years, the mean disease duration was 6.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0\u2009years, and the mean Hoehn and Yahr stage was 2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7. Among them, 48 patients (50.0%) had a weight loss of \u22655% from baseline (weight loss group; mean loss was 6.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9\u2009kg). The weight loss group was older (\nWeight loss in PwPD in mid-stage was more likely with increasing age, and\u2009\u2265\u20095% weight loss was associated with worsening depression. Further research is needed regarding the significance of weight loss in PwPD.",

    "abstract": "Current evidence on the association between dietary vitamin E intake and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) is limited. The aim of the study was to explore the association of dietary vitamin E intake with PD in the United States among adults over 40 years.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study with data collected from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2009 to 2018. A total of the sample of 13,340 participants were included. To identify the different characteristics of the participants, we utilized propensity score matching (PSM) to reduce the effects of selection bias and confounding variables. Weighted univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine the association between dietary vitamin E intake and PD before and after matching. Then, restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to visually describe the possible non-linear relationships. Finally, we employed the subgroup analysis to further investigate the relationship between dietary vitamin E intake and PD.\nAccording to the weighted univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis, vitamin E intake was inversely associated with the risk of PD before and after matching. The results of RCS analysis revealed no non-linear inverse relationship between vitamin E intake and PD before and after matching. The subgroup analysis showed that age may influence the negative association between vitamin E and PD (\nAmong participants over 40 years of age, vitamin E intake was negatively associated with the risk of PD. Our data may support the supplementation of vitamin E to be used as an intervention strategy for the occurrence of PD.",

    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, emerging evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including long-non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and circular-RNA (circRNA) contribute to the molecular events underlying progressive neuronal degeneration, and a plethora of ncRNAs have been identified significantly misregulated in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and synucleinopathy. Although a direct link between neuropathology and causative candidates has not been clearly established in many cases, the contribution of ncRNAs to the molecular processes leading to cellular dysfunction observed in neurodegenerative diseases has been addressed, suggesting that they may play a role in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Aim of the present Review is to overview and discuss recent literature focused on the role of RNA-based mechanisms involved in different aspects of neuronal pathology in Parkinson's disease and synucleinopathy models.",

    "abstract": "Studies have suggested that intrinsic auricular muscle zones (IAMZ) stimulation alleviates motor features of Parkinson disease (PD).\nA randomized, blinded, active sham-controlled pilot trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and dose-response-time curve of Earstim using a 3-treatment, 3-period crossover design in PD patients experiencing OFF time on levodopa. Treatments were: short (20-min) IAMZ stimulation; long (60-min) IAMZ stimulation; and 20-min active sham stimulation of non-muscular areas. Assessment time points were: prior to treatment, and 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120\u00a0min after treatment onset. Primary safety endpoints were adverse events frequency and severity. Primary efficacy endpoint was the change in MDS-UPDRS motor score at 20\u00a0min after treatment onset in the IAMZ treatment groups versus sham.\nForty-six individuals consented; 38 were randomized (average age 64 years, 65\u00a0% male, mean 8.2 years from diagnosis). No serious adverse events or significant device-related events occurred. At 20\u00a0min after treatment onset, motor improvements did not differ between IAMZ treatments versus sham. However, at 60\u00a0min after treatment onset, motor improvement peaked on IAMZ treatments compared to sham (difference: 3.1 [-5.9 to 0.3], p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). While the difference in 120-min AUC change between IAMZ treatments versus sham was not significant, the short-stimulation IAMZ treatment showed the largest aggregate motor score improvement (AUC\u00a0=\u00a0-456 points, 95\u00a0% CI -691 to -221) compared to sham.\nEarstim was well-tolerated. The greatest motor improvement occurred at 60\u00a0min after stimulation onset in the short-stimulation IAMZ treatment, and supports its further study to alleviate OFF periods.",

    "abstract": "The motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD) are widely accepted and implemented. However, the motor subtypes have been thought to represent different stages of PD recently because some patients experience tremor-dominant (TD) conversion to the non-tremor-dominant subtype, such as postural instability-gait difficulty (PIGD). In this study, we explore the monoaminergic denervation features of the striatal and extra-striatal areas in patients with different subtypes of PD with \nSixty-five patients diagnosed with PD were included and classified as TD (n\u00a0=\u00a025) and PIGD (n\u00a0=\u00a040). We evaluated the difference of monoaminergic features of each subregion of brain between motor subtypes of PD, as well as associations between these features and Parkinsonian motor symptoms.\nThe striatal standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) showed that dopaminergic disruption of patients with PIGD was more symmetrical in the posterior ventral putamen (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and more severe in the ipsilateral posterior dorsal putamen (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 corrected) compared with that of patients with TD. The severity of PIGD scores was associated with striatal dopaminergic depletion, while tremor was associated with monoaminergic changes in extra-striatal areas, including pallidus, thalamus, and raphe nuclie.\nThese results indicate that patients with different motor subtypes may have different underlying mechanisms of PD pathogenesis. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of PD subtypes can aid prognosis evaluation and treatment decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Numerous observational studies have investigated the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, the existence of a definitive association remains uncertain.\nSystematic searches were performed on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies published up to October 1, 2023. For Mendelian randomized (MR) causal inference, we employed pooled data from the IPDGC and PRACTICAL Consortium. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method served as the principal technique for estimating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations under investigation.\nCumulative analysis of nine studies revealed no significant association between patients diagnosed with PD and the subsequent incidence of PCa ([relative ratio] RR = 0.89, 95%CI = 0.73 to 1.08, P = 0.237). However, subgroup analyses indicated a reduced occurrence of PCa in Caucasian patients with PD (RR = 0.81, 95%CI = 0.69 to 0.95, P = 0.011). MR analyses failed to establish a significant link between increased genetic susceptibility to PD and the risk of PCa (IVW OR = 1.025, 95%CI = 0.997 to 1.054, P = 0.082). Sensitivity analyses further corroborated the robustness of these results.\nBoth observational meta-analysis and MR analysis based on genetic variation do not support an association between PD patients and the subsequent risk of PCa. Further research is warranted to unravel the potential underlying mechanisms linking these two diseases.\nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier CRD42023473527.",

    "abstract": "Exercise and physical activity (PA) are increasingly recognized as important components in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD). Their promotion at diagnosis is essential for better management of symptoms and overall well-being. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are pivotal to the promotion of exercise and PA, but there is limited guidance on the content of such interventions. This study describes current practice, and explores views of HCPs around PA and exercise promotion at diagnosis for people with PD (PwP) DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using an anonymous online survey.\nHCPs working with PwP in the UK.\nTwenty-nine doctors, 17 nurses and 106 physiotherapists completed the survey. All nurses, 99% of physiotherapists and 72% of doctors reported that they always promote exercise and PA during clinic appointments. HCPs identified how PA impacts PD symptoms, evidence on the role of exercise, and signposting to support groups as core topics in PA promotion for PwP. However, these topics are mainly addressed during physiotherapy appointments. Referrals to physiotherapy occur most frequently when PwP experience falls or mobility issues, rather than at diagnosis. HCPs (52% doctors and 41% of nurses) identified lack of confidence as a barrier to prescribing exercise to PwP.\nThe importance of promoting PA at diagnosis is widely acknowledged by HCPs. There are variations between disciplines in terms of the tools used, and the timing and duration of interventions. Previously identified barriers to exercise promotion were also found in this study, and should be explored further in order to aid the implementation of effective interventions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PD, involving the activation of microglia cells, heightened production of proinflammatory cytokines, and perturbations in the composition of the gut microbiota. Rubusoside (Ru), the principal steviol bisglucoside present in Rubus chingii var. suavissimus (S.K.Lee) L.T.Lu (Rosaceae), has been documented for its anti-inflammatory properties in diverse disease models. Nonetheless, there is an imperative need to comprehensively assess and elucidate the protective and anti-inflammatory attributes of Ru concerning PD, as well as to uncover the underlying mechanism involved.\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of Ru on PD and investigate its potential mechanisms associated with microbes.\nWe pre-treated mice and cell lines with Ru in order to simulate the progression of PD and the neuroinflammatory state. The mouse model was induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), SN4741 cells were induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (mpp\nRu treatment reduces the release of pro-inflammatory mediators by inhibiting microglia activation. It also prevents neuronal apoptosis, thereby safeguarding dopaminergic neurons and ameliorating motor dysfunction. Furthermore, it induces alterations in the fecal microbiota composition and metabolites profile in PD mice. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that Ru inhibits neuronal apoptosis in SN4741 cells induced by mpp\nRu exhibits inhibitory effects on the MPTP-induced PD model by mitigating neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis while also inducing changes in the gut microbiota and metabolite composition.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD); however, it is unknown whether this association is dependent on continuous hyperglycemia, hypoglycemic events, or glycemic variability. We aimed to investigate the relationship between visit-to-visit fasting glucose variability and PDD development in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nUsing data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, we examined 9,264 patients aged \u226540\u2009years with \nDuring the 9.5-year follow-up period, 1,757 of 9,264 (19.0%) patients developed PDD. Patients with a higher visit-to-visit glucose variability had a higher risk of future PDD. In the multivariable adjusted model, patients with PD in the highest quartile (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]\u2009=\u20091.50, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.88), quartile 3 (SHR\u2009=\u20091.29, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.62), and quartile 2 (SHR\u2009=\u20091.30, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.63) were independently associated with a higher risk of PDD than those in the lowest quartile.\nWe highlighted the effect of long-term glucose variability on the development of PDD in patients with PD. Furthermore, our findings suggest that preventive measures for constant glucose control may be necessary to prevent PDD.",

    "abstract": "Gait initiation is preceded by three anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) phases. In Parkinson's disease (PD) generated force, displacement and timing during APA differ from healthy controls. APA might be influenced by disease status, weight or emotion. It is unknown how motor severity, disease duration or presence of apathy influences APA timing and displacement.\nWe included 99 people with PD and 50 healthy controls (HC) to perform five gait initiation trials following an auditory cue. Force plates measured timing and center of pressure (CoP) displacement during APA phases.\nTime to gait initiation (tGI) was higher in the PD group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, t\u00a0=\u00a02.74, 95%CI (0.008, 0.066)). The first two APA phases (APA1 and APA2a) lasted longer in PD (respectively p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, t\u00a0=\u00a03.87, 95%CI (0.091, 0.28) and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, t\u00a0=\u00a04.1, 95%CI (0.031, 0.091)). Mean CoP displacement, variability in timing and displacement did not differ. A multiple regression model was used to determine if clinical variables were related to gait initiation parameters. tGI was predicted by age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and weight (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). The duration of APA1 was predicted by weight (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and APA2a by age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Variability in duration of the locomotor phase (LOC) was predicted by age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\ntGI and initial APA phases are longer in PD than in HC. There are no significant differences in variability of timing or displacement between the two groups. Gait initiation parameters are independent of disease duration, motor severity, medication usage or apathy in PD. Our findings suggest that cueing does not speed up gait initiation but reduces variability.",

We present a 77-year-old woman with knee arthritis and PD who sustained an acute, recurrent TKA posterior dislocation, recalcitrant to polyethylene upsizing. Transient stability was obtained for a period of 1\u00a0year after postoperative hamstring injection with botulinum toxin A and short-term immobilization. Spontaneous instability recurred after 1\u00a0year, and stability was obtained with revision to a more constrained construct and has been monitored over a period of 2\u00a0years. This is the first report demonstrating the use of botulinum toxin A for acute posterior TKA instability associated with PD. We endorse the necessity of increased constraint to maintain long-term stability in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic progress in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease has been hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge of its molecular etiology. The advancements in genetics and genomics have provided fundamental insights into specific protein players and the cellular processes involved in the onset of disease. In this respect, the autophagy-lysosome system has emerged in recent years as a strong point of convergence for genetics, genomics, and pathologic indications, spanning both familial and idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Most, if not all, genes linked to familial disease are involved, in a regulatory capacity, in lysosome function (e.g., LRRK2, alpha-synuclein, VPS35, Parkin, and PINK1). Moreover, the majority of genomic loci associated with increased risk of idiopathic Parkinson's cluster in lysosome biology and regulation (GBA as the prime example). Lastly, neuropathologic evidence showed alterations in lysosome markers in autoptic material that, coupled to the alpha-synuclein proteinopathy that defines the disease, strongly indicate an alteration in functionality. In this Brief Review article, I present a personal perspective on the molecular and cellular involvement of lysosome biology in Parkinson's pathogenesis, aiming at a larger vision on the events underlying the onset of the disease. The attempts at targeting autophagy for therapeutic purposes in Parkinson's have been mostly aimed at \"indiscriminately\" enhancing its activity to promote the degradation and elimination of aggregate protein accumulations, such as alpha-synuclein Lewy bodies. However, this approach is based on the assumption that protein pathology is the root cause of disease, while pre-pathology and pre-degeneration dysfunctions have been largely observed in clinical and pre-clinical settings. In addition, it has been reported that unspecific boosting of autophagy can be detrimental. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms of specific autophagy forms and, even more, the adjustment of specific lysosome functionalities. Indeed, lysosomes exert fine signaling capacities in addition to their catabolic roles and might participate in the regulation of neuronal and glial cell functions. Here, I discuss hypotheses on these possible mechanisms, their links with etiologic and risk factors for Parkinson's disease, and how they could be targeted for disease-modifying purposes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with abnormal aggregation and accumulation of neurotoxic proteins, including \u03b1-synuclein, amyloid-\u03b2, and tau, in addition to the impaired elimination of these neurotoxic protein. Atypical parkinsonism, which has the same clinical presentation and neuropathology as Parkinson's disease, expands the disease landscape within the continuum of Parkinson's disease and related disorders. The glymphatic system is a waste clearance system in the brain, which is responsible for eliminating the neurotoxic proteins from the interstitial fluid. Impairment of the glymphatic system has been proposed as a significant contributor to the development and progression of neurodegenerative disease, as it exacerbates the aggregation of neurotoxic proteins and deteriorates neuronal damage. Therefore, impairment of the glymphatic system could be considered as the final common pathway to neurodegeneration. Previous evidence has provided initial insights into the potential effect of the impaired glymphatic system on Parkinson's disease and related disorders; however, many unanswered questions remain. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the growing literature on the glymphatic system in Parkinson's disease and related disorders. The focus of this review is on identifying the manifestations and mechanisms of interplay between the glymphatic system and neurotoxic proteins, including loss of polarization of aquaporin-4 in astrocytic endfeet, sleep and circadian rhythms, neuroinflammation, astrogliosis, and gliosis. This review further delves into the underlying pathophysiology of the glymphatic system in Parkinson's disease and related disorders, and the potential implications of targeting the glymphatic system as a novel and promising therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Patients often present with balance dysfunction. Several studies have applied visual feedback training to stroke patients and demonstrated significant improvement. However, the application of visual feedback balance training in PD patients has not been reported.\nTo observe the effects of visual feedback balance training combined with conventional rehabilitation training on the balance function of patients with early PD.\nFifty patients with early PD were randomly divided into control group and observation group. The control group received conventional rehabilitation training, including body position transfer, weight shifting, movement in all directions and gait training. The observation group were added with visual feedback balance training on the basis of the training above. All patients were trained 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Time Up-and-Go test (TUG) and Pro-Kin balance training instrument were used to evaluate the balance function of patients before and after treatment, and the balance function were compared between the two groups.\nThe BBS and TUG scores of the observation group and the control group were improved significantly (P<0.01), and the BBS and TUG scores of the observation group were improved more obviously than control group (P<0.01). The length and area of eye open and closed condition in the observation group and the control group were significantly reduced compared with those before training (P<0.01), and the degree of reduction in the observation group was more obvious (P<0.01). The length and area of the observation group and the control group before and after training when eye open were smaller than those when eye closed (P<0.01).\nThe conventional rehabilitation therapy can improve the balance function of PD patients, but the combination of visual feedback balance training and conventional rehabilitation therapy can improve the balance function more significantly.",

    "abstract": "Chronic constipation (CC) is a severe symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), with an unclear pathogenesis. Abnormalities of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and/or intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) may be pathophysiologically relevant in PD patients with CC. We investigated possible molecular changes of the IEB in PD/CCs compared with CCs and controls.\nTwelve PD/CCs (2 female, age range 51-80 years), 20 CCs (15 female, age range 27-78 years), and 23 controls (11 female, age range 32-74 years) were enrolled. Ten PD/CCs and 10 CCs were functionally characterized by anorectal manometry (AM) and transit time (TT). Colon biopsies were obtained and assessed for gene and protein expression, and localization of IEB tight junction markers claudin-4 (CLDN4), occludin-1 (OCCL-1), and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) by RT-qPCR, immunoblot and immunofluorescence labeling.\nPD/CCs were clustered in 2 functional categories: patients with delayed TT and altered AM (60%), and a second group showing only modifications in AM pattern (40%). Gene expression of CLDN4, OCCL-1 and ZO-1 was higher in PD/CCs than controls (P<0.05). Conversely, PD/CCs showed a trend to decrease (P>0.05) in CLDN4 and OCCL-1 protein levels than controls, whereas ZO-1 protein was comparable. In PD/CCs compared with controls, decreasing tendency of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide mRNA, protein and immunoreactive fiber density were observed, although the difference was not statistically significant.\nTransit and anorectal dysfunctions in PD/CCs are associated with difference in ZO-1, OCCL-1 and CLDN4 expression, thus supporting the role of an altered IEB as a contributory mechanism to possible neuronal abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Recent structural and functional imaging studies of depression in Parkinson disease (DPD) have failed to reveal the relevant mechanism, and relatively few studies have been conducted on limbic systems such as the hippocampus. This study thus aimed to gain new insights into the pathogenesis of DPD by detecting the changes in the hippocampal structure and the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of patients with DPD.\nThis study included 30 patients with DPD (DPD group), 30 patients with nondepressed Parkinson disease (NDPD; NDPD group), and 30 normal controls (NCs; NC group) with no significant age or gender differences with the DPD group. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and three-dimensional T1-weighted imaging and blood oxygen level-dependent imaging data of all patients were collected. The hippocampal volumes were measured using MATLAB software (MathWorks). The correlation between hippocampal volume and the HAMD score in the DPD group was analyzed with Pearson correlation coefficient. The bilateral hippocampi were used as the regions of interest and as the seed points for FC. FC analysis was performed between the preprocessed functional data of the whole brain and the two seed points with Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State and Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 software, respectively. The correlation between FC and HAMD scores in the patients with DPD was determined using partial correlation analysis.\nCompared with those in the NC group and the NDPD group, the bilateral hippocampal volumes in the DPD group were significantly decreased (P<0.05). There was a negative correlation between the bilateral hippocampal volume and the HAMD score in the DPD group (P<0.05). Compared with that of the NDPD group, the FC of the right hippocampus with the right occipital lobe and left precuneus was reduced in the DPD group. In the DPD group, the FC values of the right hippocampus, right occipital lobe, and left anterior cuneiform lobe were negatively correlated with HAMD scores.\nThe volume of bilateral hippocampi in patients with DPD is significantly decreased and negatively correlated with the severity of depressive disorder. The weakened FC of the right hippocampus to the right occipital lobe and the left precuneus may play an important role in the neurological basis of DPD.",

    "abstract": "The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) nucleases system (CRISPR/Cas9) is a popular gene-editing technology with an expanding scope in the field of medicine. Recent studies have investigated the role of CRISPR/Cas9 system in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Since the risk of occurrence of both conditions is strongly associated with genetic mutations and variations, the use of gene-editing technologies to rectify these genetic errors becomes relevant. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been tested in AD, which has led to a decrease in either amyloid beta deposition or tau phosphorylation in cells. Likewise, genetic mutations in cells affected by PD have been corrected with promising results in initial studies undertaken. Therefore, the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system should be expanded among different populations to understand its efficacy and safety in depth among neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "abstract": "To examine the impact of stepwise speech rehabilitation exercise therapy in the treatment of patients with Parkinson speech problems under psychological intervention on clinical results and cognitive functioning. Parkinson speech disorder patients who met the inclusion criteria were selected and divided into a control group and an observation group for training respectively. The control group used conventional nursing methods, including training in orofacial movement, vocalization, pitch, volume and breath control. The observation group used stepwise speech rehabilitation exercise intervention combined with psychotherapy nursing programme. In the statistical analysis, independent sample t-test and chi-square test were used to test the significance of the data processing methods. In the statistical analysis of baseline functional level (P\u2005>\u2005.05). The difference was not statistically significant. After 7 weeks of training, the mFDA level and speech intelligibility increased in both the observation and control groups. From the situation analysis of \"modified drinking test\" and the comparison of UPDRS-I scores, it can be seen that dysphagia and Parkinson dysphasia were reduced in both groups after training. The observation group spontaneous speech dimension was greater than the control group by around 0.07 in the aphasia comparison. Both groups displayed an upward trend in their MMSE and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) when measuring cognitive function; the evaluation of P300, constructive function, and quality of life revealed this. The observation group P300 potential score was 0.13 points higher than that of the control group. The therapeutic training of stepped speech rehabilitation exercise care combined with psychological intervention has significant nursing effects on patients with Parkinson disease speech disorders, and the patients' cognitive functions have been effectively improved.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment (CI) is a characteristic non-motor feature of Parkinson disease (PD) that poses a severe burden on the patients and caregivers, yet relatively little is known about its pathobiology. Cognitive deficits are evident throughout the course of PD, with around 25% of subtle cognitive decline and mild CI (MCI) at the time of diagnosis and up to 83% of patients developing dementia after 20 years. The heterogeneity of cognitive phenotypes suggests that a common neuropathological process, characterized by progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic striatonigral system and of many other neuronal systems, results not only in structural deficits but also extensive changes of functional neuronal network activities and neurotransmitter dysfunctions. Modern neuroimaging studies revealed multilocular cortical and subcortical atrophies and alterations in intrinsic neuronal connectivities. The decreased functional connectivity (FC) of the default mode network (DMN) in the bilateral prefrontal cortex is affected already before the development of clinical CI and in the absence of structural changes. Longitudinal cognitive decline is associated with frontostriatal and limbic affections, white matter microlesions and changes between multiple functional neuronal networks, including thalamo-insular, frontoparietal and attention networks, the cholinergic forebrain and the noradrenergic system. Superimposed Alzheimer-related (and other concomitant) pathologies due to interactions between \u03b1-synuclein, tau-protein and \u03b2-amyloid contribute to dementia pathogenesis in both PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). To further elucidate the interaction of the pathomechanisms responsible for CI in PD, well-designed longitudinal clinico-pathological studies are warranted that are supported by fluid and sophisticated imaging biomarkers as a basis for better early diagnosis and future disease-modifying therapies.",

    "abstract": "Cellular dysfunction during Parkinson's disease leads to neuroinflammation in various brain regions, inducing neuronal death and contributing to the progression of the disease. Different ion channels may influence the process of neurodegeneration. The peptides Ms 9a-1 and APHC3 can modulate the function of TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels, and we evaluated their cytoprotective effects in differentiated to dopaminergic neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells. We used the stable neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y, producing wild-type alpha-synuclein and its mutant A53T, which are prone to accumulation of thioflavin-S-positive aggregates. We analyzed the viability of cells, as well as the mRNA expression levels of TRPA1, TRPV1, ASIC1a channels, alpha-synuclein, and tyrosine hydroxylase after differentiation of these cell lines using RT-PCR. Overexpression of alpha-synuclein showed a neuroprotective effect and was accompanied by a reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase expression. A mutant alpha-synuclein A53T significantly increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX and made cells more susceptible to apoptosis. Generally, overexpression of alpha-synuclein could be a model for the early stages of PD, while expression of mutant alpha-synuclein A53T mimics a genetic variant of PD. The peptides Ms 9a-1 and APHC3 significantly reduced the susceptibility to apoptosis of all cell lines but differentially influenced the expression of the genes of interest. Therefore, these modulators of TRPA1 and TRPV1 have the potential for the development of new therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disease treatment.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the widespread accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) protein aggregates. \u03b1Syn aggregation disrupts critical cellular processes, including synaptic function, mitochondrial integrity, and proteostasis, which culminate in neuronal cell death. Importantly, \u03b1Syn pathology extends beyond neurons-it also encompasses spreading throughout the neuronal environment and internalization by microglia and astrocytes. Once internalized, glia can act as neuroprotective scavengers, which limit the spread of \u03b1Syn. However, they can also become reactive, thereby contributing to neuroinflammation and the progression of PD. Recent advances in \u03b1Syn research have enabled the molecular diagnosis of PD and accelerated the development of targeted therapies. Nevertheless, despite more than two decades of research, the cellular function, aggregation mechanisms, and induction of cellular damage by \u03b1Syn remain incompletely understood. Unraveling the interplay between \u03b1Syn, neurons, and glia may provide insights into disease initiation and progression, which may bring us closer to exploring new effective therapeutic strategies. Herein, we provide an overview of recent studies emphasizing the multifaceted nature of \u03b1Syn and its impact on both neuron and glial cell damage.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that ranks second in prevalence after Alzheimer's disease. The number of PD diagnoses increases annually. Nevertheless, modern PD treatments merely mitigate symptoms rather than preventing neurodegeneration progression. The creation of an appropriate model to thoroughly study the mechanisms of PD pathogenesis remains a current challenge in biomedicine. Recently, there has been an increase in data regarding the involvement of not only dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra but also astrocytes in the pathogenesis of PD. Cell models based on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their differentiated derivatives are a useful tool for studying the contribution and interaction of these two cell types in PD. Here, we generated two iPSC lines, ICGi034-B and ICGi034-C, by reprogramming peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a patient with a heterozygous mutation c.1226A>G (p.N370S) in the ",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate and compare the vertical Ground Reaction Forces (vGRFs) of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PwPD) and healthy subjects (HS) when the confounding effect of walking speed was absent. Therefore, eighteen PwPD and eighteen age- and linear walking speed-matched HS were recruited. Using plantar pressure insoles, participants walked along linear and curvilinear paths at self-selected speeds. Interestingly, PwPD exhibited similar walking speed to HS during curvilinear trajectories (",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurological disorder, pathologically characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) as well as the formation of Lewy bodies composed mainly of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregates. It has been documented that abnormal aggregation of \u03b1-syn is one of the major causes of developing PD. In the current study, administration of ellagic acid (EA), a polyphenolic compound (10 mg/kg bodyweight), significantly decreased \u03b1-syn spreading and preserved dopaminergic neurons in a male C57BL/6 mouse model of PD. Moreover, EA altered the autophagic flux, suggesting the involvement of a restorative mechanism meditated by EA treatment. Our data support that EA could play a major role in the clearing of toxic \u03b1-syn from spreading, in addition to the canonical antioxidative role, and thus preventing dopaminergic neuronal death.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibits divergent cognitive trajectories; however, the factors contributing to these variations remain elusive. This study aimed to examine the clinical features of patients with different long-term cognitive trajectories in de novo PD over a five-year follow-up.\nWe analyzed 258 patients who completed every annual evaluation for five years. According to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, we classified patients into three groups: cognitively normal (n\u00a0=\u00a0118, CN), remitting MoCA decline (n\u00a0=\u00a074, RMD), and progressive MoCA decline (n\u00a0=\u00a066, PMD).\nThe RMD group was associated with lower olfactory scores (Odds Ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a00.958, p\u00a0=\u00a00.040), whereas PMD was associated with higher depression scores (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.158, p\u00a0=\u00a00.045), probable RBD (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.169, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), older age (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.132, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and lower educational attainment (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.828, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). PMD had higher neurofilament light chain protein values than CN and RMD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006, 0.015, respectively). Longitudinally, PMD showed a greater decline in all cognitive scores and hippocampus volumes (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Meanwhile, RMD exhibited intermediate cognitive and volumetric trajectories between CN and PMD and displayed worse score changes in memory tasks than CN.\nWhile PMD exhibited known risk factors for cognitive impairment, along with worse cognitive performance and hippocampal volume decline, RMD displayed baseline lower olfactory scores and intermediate cognitive and hippocampal volume decline between the two groups. These findings suggest individuals in RMD may still be at risk for cognitive deficits. However, further long-term follow-up data are needed to unravel the determinants and dynamics of cognitive functions.",

    "abstract": "Associations between phenotypic traits, environmental exposures, and Parkinson's disease have largely been evaluated one-by-one, piecemeal, and pre-selections. A comprehensive picture of comorbidities, phenotypes, exposures, and polypharmacy characterizing the complexity and heterogeneity of real-world patients presenting to academic movement disorders clinics in the US is missing.\nTo portrait the complexity of features associated with patients with Parkinson's disease in a study of 933 cases and 291 controls enrolled in the Harvard Biomarkers Study.\nThe primary analysis evaluated 64 health features for associations with Parkinson's using logistic regression adjusting for age and sex. We adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) with \u00a3 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Exploratory analyses examined feature correlation clusters and feature combinations.\nDepression (OR = 3.11, 95% CI 2.1 to 4.71), anxiety (OR = 3.31, 95% CI 2.01-5.75), sleep apnea (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.47-4.92), and restless leg syndrome (RLS; OR 4.12, 95% CI 1.81-12.1) were significantly more common in patients with Parkinson's than in controls adjusting for age and sex with FDR \u00a3 0.05. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, sleep apnea, and RLS were correlated, and these diseases formed part of a larger cluster of mood traits and sleep traits linked to PD. Exposures to pesticides (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.37-2.6), head trauma (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.51-3.73), and smoking (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.75) were significantly associated with the disease consistent with previous studies. Vitamin supplementation with cholecalciferol (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.4-3.45) and coenzyme Q10 (OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.89-4.92) was more commonly used by patients than controls. Cumulatively, 43% (398 of 933) of Parkinson's patients had at least one psychiatric or sleep disorder, compared to 21% (60 of 291) of healthy controls.\n43% of Parkinson's patients seen at Harvard-affiliated teaching hospitals have depression, anxiety, and disordered sleep. This syndromic cluster of mood and sleep traits may be pathophysiologically linked and clinically important.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss (WL) is the most common symptom among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and has been reported to start several years before the diagnosis of PD. The relationship between WL and PD treatment is complex. This study aimed to characterize the impact of PD treatment on WL and find clues to establish the administration of nutrition for patients with PD.\nEighty-two patients with PD (mean age, 58.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.2 years; mean Hoehn and Yahr stage, 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7) were recruited. Their treatments included deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy (n\u00a0=\u00a034), levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) therapy (n\u00a0=\u00a013), and oral medication alone (n\u00a0=\u00a035). Based on the medical records, the age of onset, disease duration, treatment options, videofluoroscopic dysphagia scale, blood test results, and weight change were collected.\nThe median WL per year and rate of WL were -1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8\u00a0kg and -1.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7 %, respectively. Most patients (93 %) were classified into normal nutrition and mild malnutrition groups by their CONUT scores. The median WL of the DBS group was significantly lower than that of the oral medication alone group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The rate of WL showed a significant negative correlation with the age of onset (rho = -0.328, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), but showed a significant positive correlation with the disease duration (rho = 0.231, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).\nThese results highlighted WL in the early stages of PD and suggested the need for adequate monitoring for patients undergoing device-aided therapy as well as oral medicine-treated patients with greater WL.",

The rate of WL showed a significant negative correlation with the age of onset (rho = -0.328, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), but showed a significant positive correlation with the disease duration (rho = 0.231, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).",

    "abstract": "While dietary factors have shown an association with Parkinson's disease (PD), the available data remains a subject of ongoing debate and controversy.\nWe sought to evaluate potential relationships between dietary consumption of nutrients and micronutrients and risk of PD in a large sample.\nCross-sectional data were retrospectively analyzed for 10,651 adults aged 40-80\u2009years that had been collected in the US between 2007 and 2016 as a component of the nationwide National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Aspects of dietary intake were compared between those who reported having specific PD medication regimens or not when they completed the survey, and potential associations between diet and risk of PD were explored using binomial logistic regression. We employed Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to minimize the impact of potential confounding factors, thus enhancing the reliability of the results. Additionally, subgroup analysis based on gender and age was conducted to investigate these relationships.\nHigher dietary intake of iron was linked to greater PD risk [odds ratio (OR) 1.065, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.019-1.114, \nThe intake of micronutrients can influence risk of PD, which should be verified and explored further in prospective samples with other dietary habits and ethnic backgrounds.",

Parkinson 22 is a form of Parkinson's disease caused by variations in the coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2) protein. This study investigates an aspartic acid-to-alanine swap on amino acid position 130 (D130A) of the CHCHD2 protein. We have employed protein modeling, conservation analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations to gain an understanding of the effects of the D130A variant on CHCHD2 protein structure and movement.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are proposed to be important in the pathogenesis of prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. We report the first application of solid-state technology to perform multiplex analysis of single exosomes in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from the lumbar sac of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD, n=30) or Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD, n=30), as well as age-matched health controls (HCN, n=30). Single events were captured with mouse monoclonal antibodies to one of three different tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, or CD81) or with mouse (M) IgG control, and then probed with fluorescently labeled antibodies to prion protein (PrP) or CD47 to mark neuronal or presynaptic origin, as well as ADD- and PDD-related proteins: amyloid beta (A\u03b2), tau, \u03b1-synuclein, and Apolipoprotein (Apo) E. Data were collected only from captured events that were within the size range of 50 to 200 nm. Exosomes were present at approximately 100 billion per mL human CSF and were similarly abundant for CD9+ and CD81+ events, but CD63+ were only 22% to 25% of CD9+ (P<0.0001) or CD81+ (P<0.0001) events. Approximately 24% of CSF exosomes were PrP+, while only 2% were CD47+. The vast majority of exosomes were surface ApoE+, and the number of PrP-ApoE+ (P<0.001) and PrP+ApoE+ (P<0.01) exosomes were significantly reduced in ADD vs. HCN for CD9+ events only. A\u03b2, tau, and \u03b1-synuclein were not detected on the exosome surface or in permeabilized cargo. These data provide new insights into single exosome molecular features and highlight reduction in the CSF concentration of ApoE+ exosomes in patients with ADD.",

    "abstract": "Tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (TD-PD) can be further separated into levodopa-responsive and levodopa-resistant types, the latter being considered to have a different pathogenesis. Previous studies indicated that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the globus pallidus internus (GPi) individually was not sufficient for tremor control, especially for the levodopa-resistant TD-PD (LRTD-PD). The thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) has been regarded as a potent DBS target for different kinds of tremors. Therefore, we focused on the LRTD-PD subgroup and performed one-pass combined DBSs of STN and VIM to treat refractory tremors, aiming to investigate the safety and effectiveness of this one-trajectory dual-target DBS scheme.\nWe retrospectively collected five LRTD-PD patients who underwent a one-pass combined DBS of STN and VIM via a trans-frontal approach. The targeting of VIM was achieved by probabilistic tractography. Changes in severity of symptoms (measured by the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part III, UPDRS-III), levodopa equivalent daily doses (LEDD), and disease-specific quality of life (measured by the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, PDQ-39) were evaluated.\nThree-dimensional reconstruction of electrodes illustrated that all leads were successfully implanted into predefined positions. The mean improvement rates (%) were 53\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2 (UPDRS-III), 82.6\u2009\u00b1\u200911.4 (tremor-related items of UPDRS), and 52.1\u2009\u00b1\u200911.4 (PDQ-39), respectively, with a mean follow-up of 11.4\u2009months.\nOne-pass combined DBS of STN and VIM via the trans-frontal approach is an effective and safe strategy to alleviate symptoms for LRTD-PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are at increased risk for hospital acquired complications. Deviations from home medication schedules and delays in administration are major contributing factors. We had previously developed a protocol to ensure adherence to home medication schedules using \"custom\" ordering. In this study we are assessing the impact this order type may have on reducing delays in PD medication administration in the hospital.\nWe reviewed 31,404 orders placed for PD medications from January 2, 2016 to April 30 2021. We evaluated the orders to determine if they were placed in a Custom format or using a default non-custom order entry. We further evaluated all orders to determine if there was a relationship with the order type and timely administration of medications. We compared medications that were administered within 1\u2009min, 15\u2009min, 30\u2009min and 60\u2009min of due times across custom orders vs. non-custom default orders. We also evaluated the relationship between ordering providers and type of orders placed as well as hospital unit and type of orders placed.\n14,204 (45.23%) orders were placed using a custom schedule and 17,200 (54.77%) orders were placed using non-custom defaults. The custom group showed a significantly lower median delay of 3.06 minutes compared to the non-custom group (\nThis is the largest study to date examining the effects of order entry type on timely administration of PD medications in the hospital. Orders placed using a custom schedule may help reduce delays in administration of PD medications.",

    "abstract": "Dysphagia, a potentially fatal symptom of Parkinson's disease, is characterized by frequent silent aspiration, a risk factor for aspiration pneumonia. The transdermal dopamine agonist rotigotine alleviates dysphagia in patients with Parkinson's disease and is more effective than oral levodopa, suggesting the importance of continuous dopaminergic stimulation during swallowing. Rasagiline is a monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitor that facilitates continuous dopaminergic stimulation. We hypothesized that MAOB inhibition by rasagiline would be effective in improving swallowing function in patients with early- and mid-to late-stage Parkinson's disease. To this end, we performed an analytical observational study to determine the effects of rasagiline (1\u00a0mg/day) on swallowing function using videofluoroscopic swallowing study. This open-label, evaluator-blinded study enrolled 32 patients with Parkinson's disease, among whom 19 were drug-na\u00efve and 13 were receiving add-on therapy. Our results showed that rasagiline significantly improved all swallowing measures during the oral and pharyngeal phases, including oral transit time and pharyngeal transit time, in all enrolled patients. Similar results were found in drug-na\u00efve and mid-to late-stage patients, with no intergroup differences. In conclusion, drugs capable of continuous dopaminergic stimulation may effectively improve swallowing function in patients with Parkinson's disease, with similar effects in early- and mid-to late-stage Parkinson's disease. This study has been the first to show that rasagiline significantly improves swallowing function in mid-to late-stage patients receiving add-on therapy.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of Gait (FOG) is a motor symptom frequently observed in advanced Parkinson's disease. However, due to its paroxysmal nature and diverse presentation, assessing FOG in a clinical setting can be challenging. Before FOG can be fully investigated, it is critical that a reliable experimental setting is established in which FOG can be evoked in a standardized manner, but the efficacy of various gait tasks and triggers for eliciting FOG remains unclear.\nThis study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the existing literature and evaluate the available evidence for the relationship between specific motor tasks, triggers, and FOG episodes in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PwPD).\nWe conducted a literature search on four online databases (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library) using the keywords \"Parkinson's disease,\" \"Freezing of Gait\", \"triggers\" and \"tasks\". A total of 128 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in our analysis.\nThe review found that a wide range of gait tasks were employed in studies assessing FOG among PD patients. However, three tasks (turning, dual tasking, and straight walking) emerged as the most frequently used. Turning (28%) appears to be the most effective trigger for eliciting FOG in PwPD, followed by walking through a doorway (14%) and dual tasking (10%).\nThis review thereby supports the utilisation of turning, especially a 360-degree turn, as a reliable trigger for FOG in PwPD. This finding could be beneficial to clinicians conducting clinical evaluations and researchers aiming to assess FOG in a laboratory environment.",

    "abstract": "Clinical studies have suggested an association between migraine and the occurrence of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is unknown whether migraine affects PD risk. We aimed to investigate the incidence of PD in patients with migraine and to determine the risk factors affecting the association between migraine and PD incidence.\nUsing the Korean National Health Insurance System database (2002-2019), we enrolled all Koreans aged \u226540 years who participated in the national health screening program in 2009. International Classification of Diseases (10th revision) diagnostic codes and Rare Incurable Diseases System diagnostic codes were used to define patients with migraine (within 12 months of enrollment) and newly diagnosed PD.\nWe included 214,193 patients with migraine and 5,879,711 individuals without migraine. During 9.1 years of follow-up (55,435,626 person-years), 1,973 (0.92%) and 30,664 (0.52%) individuals with and without migraine, respectively, were newly diagnosed with PD. Following covariate adjustment, patients with migraine showed a 1.35-fold higher PD risk than individuals without migraine. The incidence of PD was not significantly different between patients with migraine with aura and those without aura. In males with migraine, underlying dyslipidemia increased the risk of PD (p=0.012). In contrast, among females with migraine, younger age (<65 years) increased the risk of PD (p=0.038).\nPatients with migraine were more likely to develop PD than individuals without migraine. Preventive management of underlying comorbidities and chronic migraine may affect the incidence of PD in these patients. Future prospective randomized clinical trials are warranted to clarify this association.",

The patients were separated into three groups based on tertiles of baseline CP volume. We then used a linear mixed model for longitudinal analysis and conducted path analysis to investigate mediating effects.\nAt baseline, the patients in both the upper and middle tertile group were older and had lower concentrations of CSF A\u03b2\nCP enlargement could be an independent risk factor for decreased cognition in patients with early-stage PD, and this risk may be mediated by CSF pathological proteins.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) could be viewed as a proteinopathy caused by changes in lipids, whereby modifications in lipid metabolism may lead to protein alterations, such as the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), ultimately resulting in neurodegeneration. Although the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is the major clinical manifestation of PD, the etiology of it is largely unknown. Increasing evidence has highlighted the important role of lipids in the pathophysiology of PD. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a signaling lipid, has been suggested to have a potential association with the advancement and worsening of PD. Therefore, better understanding the mechanisms and regulatory proteins is of high interest. Most interestingly, S1P appears to be an important target to offers a new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of PD. In this review, we first introduce the basic situation of S1P structure, function and regulation, with a special focus on the several pathways. We then briefly describe the regulation of S1P signaling pathway on cells and make a special focused on the cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis, etc. Finally, we discuss the function of S1P as potential therapeutic target to improve the clinical symptoms of PD, and even prevent the progression of the PD. In the context of PD, the functions of S1P modulators have been extensively elucidated. In conclusion, S1P modulators represent a novel and promising therapeutic principle and therapeutic method for PD. However, more research is required before these drugs can be considered as a standard treatment option for PD.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most debilitating motor symptoms experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). FOG detection is possible using acceleration data from wearable sensors, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is often used to determine the presence of FOG epochs. We compared the performance of a standard CNN for the detection of FOG with two more complex networks, which are well suited for time series data, the MiniRocket and the InceptionTime.\nWe combined acceleration data of people with PD across four studies. The final data set was split into a training (80%) and hold-out test (20%) set. A fifth study was included as an unseen test set. The data were windowed (2\u2009s) and five-fold cross-validation was applied. The CNN, MiniRocket, and InceptionTime models were evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and its area under the curve (AUC). Multiple sensor configurations were evaluated for the best model. The geometric mean was subsequently calculated to select the optimal threshold. The selected model and threshold were evaluated on the hold-out and unseen test set.\nA total of 70 participants (23.7\u2009h, 9% FOG) were included in this study for training and testing, and in addition, 10 participants provided an unseen test set (2.4\u2009h, 11% FOG). The CNN performed best (AUC\u2009=\u20090.86) in comparison to the InceptionTime (AUC\u2009=\u20090.82) and MiniRocket (AUC\u2009=\u20090.76) models. For the CNN, we found a similar performance for a seven-sensor configuration (lumbar, upper and lower legs and feet; AUC\u2009=\u20090.86), six-sensor configuration (upper and lower legs and feet; AUC\u2009=\u20090.87), and two-sensor configuration (lower legs; AUC\u2009=\u20090.86). The optimal threshold of 0.45 resulted in a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 58% for the hold-out set (AUC\u2009=\u20090.72), and a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 68% for the unseen test set (AUC\u2009=\u20090.90).\nWe confirmed that deep learning can be used to detect FOG in a large, heterogeneous dataset. The CNN model outperformed more complex networks. This model could be employed in future personalized interventions, with the ultimate goal of using automated FOG detection to trigger real-time cues to alleviate FOG in daily life.",

The CNN performed best (AUC\u2009=\u20090.86) in comparison to the InceptionTime (AUC\u2009=\u20090.82) and MiniRocket (AUC\u2009=\u20090.76) models. For the CNN, we found a similar performance for a seven-sensor configuration (lumbar, upper and lower legs and feet; AUC\u2009=\u20090.86), six-sensor configuration (upper and lower legs and feet; AUC\u2009=\u20090.87), and two-sensor configuration (lower legs; AUC\u2009=\u20090.86). The optimal threshold of 0.45 resulted in a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 58% for the hold-out set (AUC\u2009=\u20090.72), and a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 68% for the unseen test set (AUC\u2009=\u20090.90).",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is recommended for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), though individual reactions may be different. There are currently no clinically available biomarkers for predicting the responses of PD patients to DBS before surgery. This study aimed to determine serum biomarkers to predict DBS responses in PD.\nWe profiled differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in serum samples and identified potential biomarkers to predict the therapeutic responses to DBS in PD patients. Ten serum samples were selected from PD patients to identify DEPs via mass spectrometry proteomics; these were then verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in another 21 serum samples of PD patients.\nThe present study identified 14 DEPs (10 downregulated and four upregulated DEPs) with significantly different levels between non-responders and responders. Most of the DEPs were related to amino acid metabolism and protein modification pathways. Bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) and creatine kinase M-type (CKM) were found to be significantly downregulated in the responders. Additionally, subsequent logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to determine the diagnostic performance of candidate proteins.\nThe identified DEPs show potential as biomarkers for the accurate evaluation of DBS therapeutic responses before surgery. Furthermore, assessment of serum BLMH and CKM may be particularly useful for predicting the therapeutic responses to DBS in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by misfolding of \u03b1-synuclein. Clinical manifestations include slowly developing resting tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia and abnormal gait. The pathological mechanisms underlying PD are complex and yet to be fully elucidated. Clinical studies suggest that the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms may precede motor symptoms in PD patients. The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a bidirectional communication role between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system. This bidirectional communication between the brain and gut is influenced by the neural, immune and endocrine systems related to the gut microbiome. A growing body of evidence indicates a strong link between dysregulation of the gut microbiota and PD. In this review, we present recent progress in understanding the relationship between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and PD. We focus on the role of the gut microbiota, the unique changes observed in the microbiome of PD patients, and the impact of these changes on the progression of PD. Finally, we evaluate the role of current treatment strategies for PD, including probiotics, fecal microbial transplants, dietary modifications, and related drug therapies.",

    "abstract": "An extract of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge (XSB) oil called nervonic acid (NA) was studied for its potential to ameliorate oxidative stress and inflammation in people living with Parkinson's disease (PD). Recrystallization column chromatography was performed to isolate NA from the XSB oil. Twenty-five C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks old) were randomly assigned to one of five groups (control, model, low, medium, and high dosage).\nExcept for the control group, all of the experimental animals received an intraperitoneal injection of 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The next phase was administering varied doses of NA produced from XSB oil to mice. Control, model, low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups were created at random from SH-SY5Y and PC-12 cell cultures. Our study's control groups exhibited typical normative conduct.\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory factors (IFs) in cells. By the time recrystallization column chromatography had finished its analysis, the concentration of NA had increased by a factor of roughly 26.\nThe model and high-dose groups showed similar levels of apoptosis in behavior (\nNA synthesized from XSB oil will soon be available for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. With the use of deep learning, patients will be able to arrest their health deterioration and enjoy an improved standard of living.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neuronal loss of dopamine and drugs used for its management has several limitations. The present report determines the effect of exercise on mitochondrial autophagy against PD. Parkinson's disease was induced by 15 doses of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 30 mg/kg, i.p.) for 3 weeks, on five consecutive days in a week. Exposure of exercise was provided for 40 min for a period of 2 weeks after PD confirmation. Assessment of behaviour was performed to evaluate the effect of exercise on motor function and cognitive function in PD rats. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines were assessed in PD rats using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Expression of myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) and NADH dehydrogenase 6 (ND6) was estimated in PD rats. Exposure to exercise ameliorates the altered motor function and cognitive function in PD rats. There was a reduction in ROS and cytokine levels in the brain tissue of the exercise group compared to the negative control group. Exercise ameliorates the altered expression of apoptotic proteins and mRNA expression of MEF2D and ND6 in the brain tissue of MPTP induced PD rats. In conclusion, data of study reveal that exercise protects the mitochondrial autophagy in PD rats by reducing inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the potential for erucic acid (EA), an omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid, to act as a neuroprotective agent.\nIn this study, EA was investigated against N2a cell lines and a rotenone (ROT)-induced model of Parkinson's disease for its neuroprotective potential. The N2a cell line was incubated with fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin supplemented with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium, and the following assays were carried out: (i) MTT, (ii) biocompatibility, (iii) DCFDA, and (iv) diphenylamine. A cell morphology study was also performed. Further, ROT 1 mg/kg s.c. and EA 3 and 10 mg/kg p.o. were given to rats on a daily basis for 21 days, and the following parameters were assessed: (i) neurobehavioral studies, (ii) oxidative stress markers, (iii) neuroinflammatory markers, (iv) neurotransmitters, and (v) histopathological study.\nThe cell viability assay revealed that EA showed protection against ROT-induced toxicity in N2a cells, which was confirmed by a cell morphology study. EA decreased oxidative stress and % DNA fragmentation significantly. EA also prevented ROT-induced motor impairment and altered levels of oxidative stress markers, neurotransmitters, and neuroinflammatory markers significantly. When compared to the ROT group, a histological investigation of the EA group showed partial neuronal loss with the existence of intact neurons in between the vacuolated gaps.\nThis study revealed that EA possesses profound neuroprotective properties in in vitro and in vivo studies. Additional research can be carried out to study the mechanism of EA with respect to its neuroprotective potential.",

When compared to the ROT group, a histological investigation of the EA group showed partial neuronal loss with the existence of intact neurons in between the vacuolated gaps.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is related to renal insufficiency. The purpose of this study was to explore the correlation between PD and blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and proteinuria.\nThe case-control study method was adopted in this study. In total, 200 patients with PD who were hospitalized in the Department of Neurology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University were selected as the PD group, and 110 healthy patients during the same period were selected as the control group. The differences in clinical data and laboratory results between the two groups were compared. Logistic regression analysis, ROC curve, and Spearman correlation analysis were used to determine the correlation between PD and blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and urine protein.\nThe levels of cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein B in the PD group were lower than those in the control group. The levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen, and proteinuria in the PD group were higher than those in the control group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and urine protein levels were risk factors for PD, and elevated LDL-C levels were protective factors for PD. The blood urea nitrogen level of patients with PD was positively correlated with the course of PD, Hoehn-Yahr staging, and UPDRS exercise score (r = 0.309, 0.434, and 0.540, respectively; P < 0.01). Serum creatinine level was positively correlated with the course of PD, Hoehn-Yahr staging, and UPDRS exercise score (r = 0.139, 0.320, and 0.290, respectively; P < 0.01).\nBlood urea nitrogen, creatinine levels, and proteinuria can be regarded as the onset of PD and a biomarker of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Deep phenotyping of Parkinson's disease (PD) is essential to investigate this fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder. Since 2015, over 800 individuals with PD and atypical parkinsonism along with more than 800 control subjects have been recruited in the frame of the observational, monocentric, nation-wide, longitudinal-prospective Luxembourg Parkinson's study.\nTo profile the baseline dataset and to explore risk factors, comorbidities and clinical profiles associated with PD, atypical parkinsonism and controls.\nEpidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 1,648 participants divided in disease and control groups were investigated. Then, a cross-sectional group comparison was performed between the three largest groups: PD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and controls. Subsequently, multiple linear and logistic regression models were fitted adjusting for confounders.\nThe mean (SD) age at onset (AAO) of PD was 62.3 (11.8) years with 15% early onset (AAO\u2009<\u200950\u2009years), mean disease duration 4.90 (5.16) years, male sex 66.5% and mean MDS-UPDRS III 35.2 (16.3). For PSP, the respective values were: 67.6 (8.2) years, all PSP with AAO\u2009>\u200950\u2009years, 2.80 (2.62) years, 62.7% and 53.3 (19.5). The highest frequency of hyposmia was detected in PD followed by PSP and controls (72.9%; 53.2%; 14.7%), challenging the use of hyposmia as discriminating feature in PD vs. PSP. Alcohol abstinence was significantly higher in PD than controls (17.6 vs. 12.9%, \nLuxembourg Parkinson's study constitutes a valuable resource to strengthen the understanding of complex traits in the aforementioned neurodegenerative disorders. It corroborated several previously observed clinical profiles, and provided insight on frequency of hyposmia in PSP and dietary habits, such as alcohol abstinence in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) often presents with subtle early signs, making diagnosis difficult. F-DOPA PET imaging provides a reliable measure of dopaminergic function and is a primary tool for early PD diagnosis. This study aims to evaluate the ability of machine-learning (ML) extracted EEG features to predict F-DOPA results and distinguish between PD and non-PD patients. These features, extracted using a single-channel EEG during an auditory cognitive assessment, include EEG feature A0 associated with cognitive load in healthy subjects, and EEG feature L1 associated with cognitive task differentiation.\nParticipants in this study are comprised of cognitively healthy patients who had undergone an F-DOPA PET scan as a part of their standard care (\nThe prediction model correctly classified patients with unrevealed scores as positive F-DOPA. EEG feature A0 and the Delta band revealed distinct activity patterns separating between study groups, with controls displaying higher activity than PD patients. In controls, EEG feature L1 showed variations between resting state and high-cognitive load, an effect lacking in PD patients.\nOur findings exhibit the potential of single-channel EEG technology in combination with an auditory cognitive assessment to distinguish positive from negative F-DOPA PET scores. This approach shows promise for early PD diagnosis. Additional studies are needed to further verify the utility of this tool as a potential biomarker for PD.",

    "abstract": "The human gastrointestinal tract is inhabited by a diverse range of microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiota, which form a vast and complex ecosystem. It has been reported that the microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a crucial role in regulating host neuroprotective function. Studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, and experiments involving germ-free mice and fecal microbiota transplantation from PD patients have revealed the pathogenic role of the gut microbiota in PD. Interventions targeting the gut microbiota in PD, including the use of prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, have also shown efficacy in treating PD. However, the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease remains intricate. This study reviewed the association between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and PD from the perspectives of humoral pathway, cellular immune pathway and neuronal pathway. We found that the interactions among gut microbiota and PD are very complex, which should be \"multidirectional\", rather than conventionally regarded \"bidirectional\". To realize application of the gut microbiota-related mechanisms in the clinical setting, we propose several problems which should be addressed in the future study.",

    "abstract": "To determine the effect of a Best Practice Advisory (BPA) on the ordering and administration of contraindicated dopamine blocking agents (DBA) to hospitalized patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders.\nPatients with PD are more likely to require hospitalization and are at increased risk of complications. Administration of contraindicated DBA contributes to worsened outcomes in this patient population. Electronic medical record (EMR) warnings (also referred to as BPA) have been proposed as a way to prevent the administration of contraindicated medications.\nA BPA was launched in January 2020 within the University of Rochester EMR system, which alerts the provider when a contraindicated DBA is ordered in hospitalized patients with PD and related disorders. Patients with PD and related disorders hospitalized at two hospitals affiliated to the University of Rochester during a time period before (\n306 patients with PD and related disorders were hospitalized during \nThe results of this study increase the evidence of the potential benefit of EMR warnings for the optimization of inpatient medication management in patients with PD and related disorders. In particular, our results suggest that EMR warnings help reduce the administration of contraindicated medications, which is a known contributing factor for hospital complications in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Morning-off is a symptom experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), which markedly reduces patients' quality of life. The present study evaluated the effect of safinamide on morning-off in elderly PD patients.\nThis observational study included 30 PD patients treated with 50 or 100 mg/day of safinamide in the evening. Using patient-reported outcomes, we evaluated the effect of safinamide on daily/morning ON-time, daily/morning OFF-time, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III score, and non-motor symptoms. Data at baseline (treatment start) and at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after baseline were recorded.\nThe PD patients (75.8\u00b17.5 years old) in this study, who tended to be older than in previous phase 2/3 or 3 studies, may represent real-world Japanese PD patients. Compared with baseline, safinamide significantly increased the daily ON-time at eight weeks and morning ON-time at four weeks. Safinamide significantly reduced the daily OFF-time and morning OFF-time at four weeks. The UPDRS Part III score was significantly reduced by 1 point at 12 weeks. Safinamide showed a tendency to reduce non-motor symptoms, such as anxiety, pain, and depressive feelings. There was no marked difference in these parameters between patients treated with 50 and 100 mg of safinamide.\nOur results suggest that safinamide administered in the evening can benefit elderly patients who experience wearing off, especially morning off, and non-motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that either family history or polygenic risk score (PRS) is associated with developing Parkinson disease (PD). However, little is known about the longitudinal prognosis of PD according to family history and higher PRS.\nFrom the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database, 395 patients with PD who followed up for more than 2 years were grouped into those with family history within first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree relatives (N = 127 [32.2%]) vs those without (N = 268 [67.8%]). The PRS of 386 patients was computed using whole-genome sequencing data. Longitudinal assessment of motor, cognition, and imaging based on dopaminergic degeneration was conducted during the regular follow-up period. Effects of family history, PRS, or both on longitudinal changes of cognition, motor severity, and nigrostriatal degeneration were tested using a linear mixed model. The risk of freezing of gait (FOG) according to family history was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models.\nDuring a median follow-up of 9.1 years, PD with positive family history showed a slower decline of caudate dopamine transporter uptake (\u03b2 estimate of family history \u00d7 time = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.002-0.036, \nHaving a family history of PD predicts slower progression of cognitive decline and caudate dopaminergic degeneration, and less FOG compared with those without a family history independent of PRS. Taken together, information on family history could be used as a proxy for the clinical heterogeneity of PD.\nThe study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01141023), and the enrollment began June 1, 2010.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades there have been meaningful developments on biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, extensively (but not solely) focusing on their proteinopathic nature. Accordingly, in Alzheimer's disease determination of levels of total and phosphorylated tau (\u03c4 and p-\u03c4, usually p-\u03c4181) along with amyloid-beta1-42 (A\u03b21-42) by immunodetection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and currently even in peripheral blood, have been widely accepted and introduced to routine diagnosis. In the case of Parkinson's disease, \u03b1-synuclein as a potential biomarker (both for diagnosis and progression tracking) has proved more elusive under the immunodetection approach. In recent years, the emergence of the so-called seed amplification assays is proving to be a game-changer, with mounting evidence under different technical approaches and using a variety of biofluids or tissues, yielding promising diagnostic accuracies. Currently the least invasive but at once more reliable source of biosamples and techniques are being sought. Here we overview these advances.",

    "abstract": "Pathological accumulation of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (aSYN) is a common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanisms by which intracellular aSYN pathology contributes to dysfunction and degeneration of neurons in the brain are still unclear. A potentially relevant target of aSYN is the mitochondrion. To test this hypothesis, genetic and physiological methods were used to monitor mitochondrial function in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) cholinergic neurons after stereotaxic injection of aSYN pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the mouse brain.\naSYN PPFs were stereotaxically injected into the SNc or PPN of mice. Twelve weeks later, mice were studied using a combination of approaches, including immunocytochemical analysis, cell- type specific transcriptomic profiling, electron microscopy, electrophysiology and two-photon-laser- scanning microscopy of genetically encoded sensors for bioenergetic and redox status.\nIn addition to inducing a significant neuronal loss, SNc injection of PFFs induced the formation of intracellular, phosphorylated aSYN aggregates selectively in dopaminergic neurons. In these neurons, PFF-exposure decreased mitochondrial gene expression, reduced the number of mitochondria, increased oxidant stress, and profoundly disrupted mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production. Consistent with an aSYN-induced bioenergetic deficit, the autonomous spiking of dopaminergic neurons slowed or stopped. PFFs also up-regulated lysosomal gene expression and increased lysosomal abundance, leading to the formation of Lewy-like inclusions. Similar changes were observed in PPN cholinergic neurons following aSYN PFF exposure.\nTaken together, our findings suggest that disruption of mitochondrial function, and the subsequent bioenergetic deficit, is a proximal step in the cascade of events induced by aSYN pathology leading to dysfunction and degeneration of neurons at-risk in PD.",

In these neurons, PFF-exposure decreased mitochondrial gene expression, reduced the number of mitochondria, increased oxidant stress, and profoundly disrupted mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production. Consistent with an aSYN-induced bioenergetic deficit, the autonomous spiking of dopaminergic neurons slowed or stopped. PFFs also up-regulated lysosomal gene expression and increased lysosomal abundance, leading to the formation of Lewy-like inclusions. Similar changes were observed in PPN cholinergic neurons following aSYN PFF exposure.",

    "abstract": "The rapid transition to telehealth following the COVID-19 pandemic raised challenges for remote delivery of physical therapy. One challenge was identifying outcome measures for people with Parkinson Disease (PwP) that could safely be conducted via telehealth. This paper evaluates the feasibility of a telehealth physical therapy examination battery for PwP in early to middle stage of disease progression.\nWe reviewed recommended outcome measures from the American Physical Therapy Association's Academy of Neurologic Physical Therapy (ANPT) Parkinson Evidence Database to Guide Effectiveness (EDGE) document and evaluated their appropriateness for remote administration. A clinical decision tree was created to streamline the examination process, incorporating elements of the ANPT movement analysis of tasks as a movement screen. The examination battery was then conducted on three PwP and evaluated for safety and feasibility.\nThis physical therapy telehealth examination battery provides physical therapists with a method to conduct safe and efficient remote assessments for PwP.",

    "abstract": "Motor inhibitory control, a core component of cognitive control, is impaired in Parkinson's disease, dramatically impacting patients' abilities to implement goal-oriented adaptive strategies. A progressive loss of the midbrain's dopamine neurons characterizes Parkinson's disease and causes motor features responsive to dopaminergic treatments. Although such treatments restore motor symptoms, their impact on response inhibition is controversial. Most studies failed to show any effect of dopaminergic medicaments, although three studies found that these drugs selectively improved inhibitory control in early-stage patients. Importantly, all previous studies assessed only one domain of motor inhibition, i.e. reactive inhibition (the ability to react to a stop signal). The other domain, i.e. proactive inhibition (the ability to modulate reactive inhibition pre-emptively according to the current context), was utterly neglected. To re-examine this issue, we recruited cognitively unimpaired Parkinson's patients under dopaminergic treatment in the early (Hoehn and Yahr, 1-1.5, ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of patients. Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation (CL-DBS) is a therapy that can alleviate the symptoms of PD. The CL-DBS system consists of an electrode sending electrical stimulation signals to a specific region of the brain and a battery-powered stimulator implanted in the chest. The electrical stimuli in CL-DBS systems need to be adjusted in real-time in accordance with the state of PD symptoms. Therefore, fast and precise monitoring of PD symptoms is a critical function for CL-DBS systems. However, the current CL-DBS techniques suffer from high computational demands for real-time PD symptom monitoring, which are not feasible for implanted and wearable medical devices.\nIn this paper, we present an energy-efficient neuromorphic PD symptom detector using memristive three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs). The excessive oscillation at beta frequencies (13-35\u2009Hz) at the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is used as a biomarker of PD symptoms.\nSimulation results demonstrate that our neuromorphic PD detector, implemented with an 8-layer spiking Long Short-Term Memory (S-LSTM), excels in recognizing PD symptoms, achieving a training accuracy of 99.74% and a validation accuracy of 99.52% for a 75%-25% data split. Furthermore, we evaluated the improvement of our neuromorphic CL-DBS detector using NeuroSIM. The chip area, latency, energy, and power consumption of our CL-DBS detector were reduced by 47.4%, 66.63%, 65.6%, and 67.5%, respectively, for monolithic 3D-ICs. Similarly, for heterogeneous 3D-ICs, employing memristive synapses to replace traditional Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) resulted in reductions of 44.8%, 64.75%, 65.28%, and 67.7% in chip area, latency, and power usage.\nThis study introduces a novel approach for PD symptom evaluation by directly utilizing spiking signals from neural activities in the time domain. This method significantly reduces the time and energy required for signal conversion compared to traditional frequency domain approaches. The study pioneers the use of neuromorphic computing and memristors in designing CL-DBS systems, surpassing SRAM-based designs in chip design area, latency, and energy efficiency. Lastly, the proposed neuromorphic PD detector demonstrates high resilience to timing variations in brain neural signals, as confirmed by robustness analysis.",

    "results": "Simulation results demonstrate that our neuromorphic PD detector, implemented with an 8-layer spiking Long Short-Term Memory (S-LSTM), excels in recognizing PD symptoms, achieving a training accuracy of 99.74% and a validation accuracy of 99.52% for a 75%-25% data split. Furthermore, we evaluated the improvement of our neuromorphic CL-DBS detector using NeuroSIM. The chip area, latency, energy, and power consumption of our CL-DBS detector were reduced by 47.4%, 66.63%, 65.6%, and 67.5%, respectively, for monolithic 3D-ICs. Similarly, for heterogeneous 3D-ICs, employing memristive synapses to replace traditional Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) resulted in reductions of 44.8%, 64.75%, 65.28%, and 67.7% in chip area, latency, and power usage.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with high incidence rate. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), as a widely used method for studying neurodegenerative diseases, has not yet been combined with two important indicators, amplitude low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), for standardized analysis of PD.\nIn this study, we used seed-based d-mapping and permutation of subject images (SDM-PSI) software to investigate the changes in ALFF and CBF of PD patients. After obtaining the regions of PD with changes in ALFF or CBF, we conducted a multimodal analysis to identify brain regions where ALFF and CBF changed together or could not synchronize.\nThe final study included 31 eligible trials with 37 data sets. The main analysis results showed that the ALFF of the left striatum and left anterior thalamic projection decreased in PD patients, while the CBF of the right superior frontal gyrus decreased. However, the results of multimodal analysis suggested that there were no statistically significant brain regions. In addition, the decrease of ALFF in the left striatum and the decrease of CBF in the right superior frontal gyrus was correlated with the decrease in clinical cognitive scores.\nPD patients had a series of spontaneous brain activity abnormalities, mainly involving brain regions related to the striatum-thalamic-cortex circuit, and related to the clinical manifestations of PD. Among them, the left striatum and right superior frontal gyrus are more closely related to cognition.\nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/ PROSPERO (CRD42023390914).",

The main analysis results showed that the ALFF of the left striatum and left anterior thalamic projection decreased in PD patients, while the CBF of the right superior frontal gyrus decreased. However, the results of multimodal analysis suggested that there were no statistically significant brain regions. In addition, the decrease of ALFF in the left striatum and the decrease of CBF in the right superior frontal gyrus was correlated with the decrease in clinical cognitive scores.",

    "abstract": "To examine complications and outcomes of hospitalizations for common indications for hospitalization among patients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nWe identified and selected the ten most common indications for hospitalization among individuals \u226565\u2009years of age using principal diagnoses from the California State Inpatient Database, 2018-2020. Patients with comorbid PD were identified using secondary diagnosis codes and matched one-to-one to patients without PD based on principal diagnosis (exact matching), age, gender, race and ethnicity, and Elixhauser comorbidity index (coarsened exact matching). We identified potentially preventable complications based on the absence of present on admission indicators among secondary diagnoses. In the matched cohort, we compared inpatient complications, early Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders (placed within 24\u2009h of admission), use of life-sustaining therapies, new nursing facility requirement on discharge, and death or hospice discharge for patients with and without PD.\nWe identified 35,457 patients with PD among the ten leading indications for hospitalization in older adults who were matched one-to-one to patients without PD (\nPatients with PD are at greater risk of developing aspiration pneumonia and delirium as a complication of their hospitalization. While patients with PD more often have early DNR orders, they have greater utilization of life-sustaining therapies and experience worse outcomes of their hospitalization including new nursing facility requirement upon discharge and greater mortality.",

    "abstract": "To maximize clinical benefit and minimize stimulation-induced side effects, optimising deep brain stimulation (DBS) parameters is paramount. Recent literature suggests a potential benefit of short pulse width DBS (spDBS; \u226440\u00a0\u03bcs) over conventional pulse width DBS (cDBS; \u226560\u00a0\u03bcs) in movement disorders.\nTo compare therapeutic window (TW), therapeutic and side effects and energy consumption of spDBS and cDBS in movement disorders.\nWe systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Appropriate paired analyses were performed.\nNine Parkinson's disease (PD) (143 patients), 4 essential tremor (ET) (26 patients) and no dystonia studies were included in the meta-analysis. TW defined as therapeutic amplitude range was larger with spDBS vs. cDBS in PD (standardized mean difference (SMD)\u00a0=\u00a0-1.04, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and ET (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.71, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but the TW in terms of charge per pulse (CPP) did not differ. In PD, no differences were found in therapeutic and side effects (MDS-UPDRS-III, speech and gait, dyskinesia, non-motor symptoms and quality of life). In ET, Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale was lower with spDBS vs. cDBS (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.36, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A qualitative analysis suggested fewer stimulation-induced side effects with spDBS. CPP was lower with spDBS vs. cDBS in PD (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.79, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and ET (MD\u00a0=\u00a046.46\u00a0nC, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but real-world data on battery longevity are lacking.\nAlthough spDBS enlarges the TW as a wider amplitude range in both PD and ET, it does not alter TW defined by CPP. The therapeutic efficacy of spDBS is not different from cDBS in PD, but spDBS apparently induces more tremor reduction in ET.",

    "abstract": "Outpatient palliative care offers an opportunity to improve the quality of life of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and families. While there are efforts to improve clinicians' palliative care knowledge and skills, there is limited knowledge on patients and carepartners' knowledge and perceptions of palliative care. As part of a larger study on implementing outpatient palliative care, this study aimed to understand patients' and carepartners' knowledge and perceptions of palliative care, and their palliative care needs and preferences prior to the implementation.\nUsing qualitative descriptive research design, we completed semi-structured interviews with 47 patients and carepartners prior to the project implementation. De-identified transcripts of interviews were coded and analyzed.\nFive themes were identified that describe patients' and carepartners' palliative care knowledge, perceptions, needs and preferences: (a) Patients and carepartners have varied knowledge and perceptions of palliative care (b) Non-motor symptoms are challenging for patients and carepartners, (c) Addressing patients' grief and emotional needs is important to patients and carepartners, (d) Carepartners want a place for emotional care, well-being, and strategizing and (e) Patients and carepartners desire anticipatory guidance and care planning. Study participants desired guidance to manage non-motor symptoms, support for patients' emotional needs and for carepartners, and for anticipatory guidance to guide future planning.\nDespite varied palliative care knowledge, PD patients and carepartners universally desire care that addresses their palliative care needs. Palliative care education and integration of palliative care approaches into standard care may facilitate increased acceptance of outpatient palliative care throughout the disease trajectory.",

After longitudinal analyses, participants in wave 5 can be retrospectively divided into the following three subgroups: PwPD at wave 5 (n=559), people newly reported PD from wave 5 to wave 6 (prodromal PD; n=215) and people without PD (n=46 737).\nThe prevalence and associated factors of social deprivation in PD, its impact on quality of life (QoL) and its onset within the course of PD.\nPwPD had higher indices for material and social deprivation than non-PD participants, and 20% of PwPD were at risk of social exclusion. Social deprivation alone accounted for 35% and material deprivation for 21% of QoL variance and remained significant predictors of QoL after adjustment for cofactors. Social deprivation and risk of social exclusion were already increased in people with prodromal PD, and accordingly preceded PD diagnosis in wave 6.\nFor the treatment of PD, we should consider the impact of social deprivation and exclusion on QoL and their association with mental and physical functioning. However, the relevance of social deprivation as a prodromal phenomenon requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease (pwPD) have reduced adaptability to postural control during prolonged standing compared to neurologically healthy individuals (control). Objective. The study aimed to characterize postural changes during prolonged standing and their effect on postural control in pwPD compared to control. We recorded the body sway of the second lumbar vertebra of 23 pwPD and 23 control while they performed prolonged standing (15\u00a0min). The number and amplitude of the body sway patterns (shifts, fidgets, and drifts), the root mean square, velocity, and frequency of the body sway were analyzed. The number of shifts in the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions was greater for the pwPD than the control. In addition, the amplitudes of shifts in the AP direction and fidgets in the AP and ML directions were greater for the pwPD than the control. Our results show that: (1) A larger number of shifts of body sway suggest references positions are frequently changing; (2) Fidgets is a pumping mechanism and can be sensory-demand action to restore mechanoreceptors activity on the foot sole; and (3) No drift changes may suggest there is no slow migration of reference position. We conclude that pwPD exhibits different behavior than healthy ones during prolonged standing, suggesting that prolonged standing could distinguish individuals with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Depression is highly comorbid among individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD), who often experience unique challenges to accessing and benefitting from empirically supported interventions like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Given the role of reward processing in both depression and PD, this study analyzed a subset (N = 25) of participants who participated in a pilot telemedicine intervention of PD-informed CBT, and also completed a Reward- and Punishment-Learning Task (RPLT) at baseline. At the conclusion of CBT, participants were categorized into treatment responders (n = 14) and non-responders (n = 11). Responders learned more optimally from negative rather than positive feedback on the RPLT, while this pattern was reversed in non-responders. Computational modeling suggested group differences in learning rate to negative feedback may drive the observed differences. Overall, the results suggest that a within-subject bias for punishment-based learning might help to predict response to CBT intervention for depression in those with PD.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to observe the therapeutic effect of Gushen Shetuo decoction on Parkinson's disease (PD), so as to provide reference for clinical practice. In order to demonstrate the clinical value of Gushen Shetuo Decoction, we selected 80 patients with PD for the study. Among them, 38 patients received the Gushen Shetuo decoction (research group), and 42 patients received Levodopa and Benserazide Hydrochloride Tablets (control group). There was no difference in Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) scores between the research group and the control group (P>0. 05). However, the scores of motor complications in Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and those of Drooling Severity and Frequency Scale (DSFS) in the research group were lower than those in the control group (P<0. 05). Subsequently, we established PD model rats, and after Gushen Shetuo Decoction gavage treatment, we found that rats in the intervention group had increased mobility (P<0. 05), as well as notably improved pathological damage of substantia nigra and striatum. Also, the expression of PERK, ATF4 and CHOP in the brain tissues of rats in the intervention group was lower than those in the control group (P<0. 05). These results confirm that Gushen Shetuo decoction effectively improved the drooling of patients with PD and showed high safety.",

    "abstract": "Piper longum L., a medicinal and food homologous herb, has a traditional history of use in treating gastrointestinal and neurological disorders. Piperine (PIP) the main alkaloid of P. longum, exists neuroprotective effects on various animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism, particularly the role of PIP in promoting gut-brain autophagy for \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) degradation in PD, remains incompletely understood.\nTo explore the role of PIP in regulating the gut-brain autophagy signaling pathway to reduce \u03b1-Syn levels in both the colon and substantia nigra (SN) of PD model rats.\nBehavioral experiments were conducted to assess the impact of PIP on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats. The intestinal microbiome composition and intestinal metabolites were analyzed by metagenomics and GC-MS/MS. The auto-phagosomes were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting were performed to assess the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), \u03b1-Syn, LC3II/LC3I, p62, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in both the SN and colon of the rats. The pathway-related inhibitor and agonist were used to verify the autophagy mechanism in the SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing A53T mutant \u03b1-Syn (A53T-\u03b1-Syn).\nPIP improved autonomic movement and gastrointestinal dysfunctions, reduced \u03b1-Syn aggregation and attenuated the loss of dopaminergic neurons in 6-OHDA-induced PD rats. After oral administration of PIP, the radio of LC3II/LC3I increased and the expression of p62 was degraded, as well as the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT and mTOR decreased in the SN and colon of rats. The effect of PIP on reducing A53T-\u03b1-Syn through the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR-mediated autophagy pathway was further confirmed in A53T-\u03b1-Syn transgenic SH-SY5Y cells. This effect could be inhibited by the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 and the PI3K agonist 740 Y-P.\nOur findings suggested that PIP could protect neurons by activating autophagy to degrade \u03b1-Syn in the SN and colon, which were related to the suppression of PIP on the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by chronic and progressive symptoms; it is more prevalent in men than in women. The sex-specific influence of the intestinal microbiota has been associated with some neurodegenerative diseases, but the relationship with PD is currently unclear. In this study, we treated mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to establish a PD mouse model, and we utilised an antibiotic cocktail (Abx) to deplete the intestinal microbiota to evaluate the influence of the intestinal microbiota on male and female PD mice. MPTP treatment obviously caused bradykinesia and low mobility in female and male mice. Meanwhile, Abx treatment exerted a greater effect on male mice than female mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescence revealed that male mice treated with MPTP had higher expression of \u03b1-synuclein and proteins related to neuroinflammation and intestinal inflammation based on activation of glial cells and the TLR4-MyD88 signalling pathway. The sex-specific differences could be due to the different composition of the intestinal microbiota. Specifically, female mice had significantly higher abundance of Allobaculum, Turicibacter and Ruminococcus than male mice. Moreover, the abundance of the probiotic genus Bifidobacterium showed opposite trends in male and female mice. Our results indicate that the intestinal microbiota has an important effect on PD mice, especially male mice, by influencing neuroinflammation through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In the future, there should be a focus on providing more reliable evidence for the pathogenesis and precise treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of nanoplastics in our environment due to the widespread use of plastics poses potential health risks that are not yet fully understood. This study examines the physiological and neurotoxic effects of these minuscule nanoplastic particles on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as well as on human cells. Here, we find that 25\u00a0nm polystyrene nanoplastic particles can inhibit animal growth and movement at very low concentrations, with varying effects on their surface groups. Furthermore, these nanoplastic particles not only accumulate in the digestive tract but also penetrate further into extraintestinal tissues. Such nanoplastics significantly compromise the integrity of the intestinal barrier, leading to \"leaky gut\" conditions and cause mitochondrial fragmentation in muscles, which possibly explains the observed movement impairments. A striking discovery was that these nanoplastics exacerbate symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's disease (PD), including dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, locomotor dysfunction, and accumulation of \u03b1-Synuclein aggregates. Importantly, our study demonstrates that the detrimental effects of nanoplastics on the aggregation of \u03b1-Synuclein extend to both C. elegans and human cell models of PD. In conclusion, our research highlights the potential health hazards linked to the physicochemical properties of nanoplastics, underlining the urgency of understanding their interactions with biological systems. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION: The escalating prevalence of nanoplastics in the environment due to widespread plastic usage raises potential health risks. Studies conducted on C. elegans indicate that even low concentrations of 25\u00a0nm polystyrene nanoplastics can impair growth and movement. These particles accumulate in the digestive system, compromising the intestinal barrier, causing \"leaky gut\", as well as inducing Parkinson's-like symptoms. Importantly, in both C. elegans and human cell models of Parkinson's disease, such nanoplastics penetrate tissues or cells and increase \u03b1-Synuclein aggregates. This underscores the urgent need to understand the interactions of nanoplastics with biological systems and highlights potential environmental and health consequences.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease can negatively affect vocal functioning and social wellbeing, particularly in the latter stages of disease progression. Face-to-face group singing interventions can improve communication and wellbeing outcomes, yet not all people can access in-person sessions. To help overcome barriers to participation, exploration of the feasibility and utility of online therapeutic singing programs is needed.\nTo evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 12-week ParkinSong Online intervention on speech and wellbeing for people with Parkinson's disease.\nA total of 28 participants with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were recruited to a single-arm feasibility study. Weekly 90-minute online sessions were co-facilitated by a music therapist and speech pathologist. Speech and wellbeing assessments were conducted pre and post intervention. Participant and facilitator surveys were administered after each session, with focus group interviews at the end of the program.\nThe recruitment rate was high (90%) with no attrition, adverse events, or safety issues. There was good intervention fidelity, attendance (average 89%), and positive participant experience. Feasibility was good, with technology reported as the main challenge (connecting and navigating Zoom). No improvements were seen in voice measures or wellbeing outcomes in this small trial. The online format used in this study did not provide the same benefits as in-person ParkinSong sessions.\nParkinSong Online is feasible for recreational purposes and social engagement provided that people have adequate technological knowledge or support. The optimal online delivery format to achieve communication improvements in Parkinson's awaits confirmation.",

    "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) represents the most abundant modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) and is regulated by methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers), and m6A-binding proteins (readers). A dynamic modification process is implicated in nearly every critical stage of RNA metabolism, including mRNA stability, transcription, translation, splicing, nuclear export, and decay. Notably, m6A methylation is significantly enriched in the brain and has recently been shown to be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this review, we summarize the proteins involved in the process of m6A modification and elucidate the emerging role of m6A modification in PD, which could illuminate alternative strategies for the prevention and treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Alpha synuclein (\u03b1S) aggregates are the main component of Lewy bodies (LBs) associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). A longstanding question about \u03b1S and PD pertains to the autosomal dominant E46K \u03b1S mutant, which leads to the early onset of PD and LB dementias. The E46K mutation not only promotes \u03b1S aggregation but also stabilizes \u03b1S monomers in \"closed\" conformers, which are compact and aggregation-incompetent. Hence, the mechanism of action of the E46K mutation is currently unclear. Here, we show that \u03b1S monomers harboring the E46K mutation exhibit more extensive interactions with fibrils compared to those of WT. Such monomer-fibril interactions are sufficient to allosterically drive transitions of \u03b1S monomers from closed to open conformations, enabling \u03b1S aggregation. We also show that E46K promotes head-to-tail monomer-monomer interactions in early self-association events. This multipronged mechanism provides a new framework to explain how the E46K mutation and possibly other \u03b1S variants trigger early-onset PD.",

    "abstract": "Although over 90 independent risk variants have been identified for Parkinson's disease using genome-wide association studies, most studies have been performed in just one population at a time. Here we performed a large-scale multi-ancestry meta-analysis of Parkinson's disease with 49,049 cases, 18,785 proxy cases and 2,458,063 controls including individuals of European, East Asian, Latin American and African ancestry. In a meta-analysis, we identified 78 independent genome-wide significant loci, including 12 potentially novel loci (MTF2, PIK3CA, ADD1, SYBU, IRS2, USP8, PIGL, FASN, MYLK2, USP25, EP300 and PPP6R2) and fine-mapped 6 putative causal variants at 6 known PD loci. By combining our results with publicly available eQTL data, we identified 25 putative risk genes in these novel loci whose expression is associated with PD risk. This work lays the groundwork for future efforts aimed at identifying PD loci in non-European populations.",

    "abstract": "The clinical assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms can present reliability issues and, with visits typically spaced apart 6 months, can hardly capture their frequent variability. Smartphones and smartwatches along with signal processing and machine learning can facilitate frequent, remote, reliable and objective assessments of PD from patients' homes.\nTo investigate the feasibility, compliance and user experience of passively and actively measuring symptoms from home environments using data from sensors embedded in smartphones and a wrist-wearable device.\nIn an ongoing clinical feasibility study, participants with a confirmed PD diagnosis are being recruited. Participants perform activity tests, including Timed Up and Go (TUG), tremor, finger tapping, drawing and vocalisation, once a week for 2\u2009months using the Mobistudy smartphone app in their homes. Concurrently, participants wear the GENEActiv wrist device for 28 days to measure actigraphy continuously. In addition to using sensors, participants complete the Beck's Depression Inventory, Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest) and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) questionnaires at baseline, at 1 month and at the end of the study. Sleep disorders are assessed through the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale-2 questionnaire (weekly) and a custom sleep quality daily questionnaire. User experience questionnaires, Technology Acceptance Model and User Version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale, are delivered at 1 month. Clinical assessment (Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)) is performed at enrollment and the 2-month follow-up visit. During visits, a TUG test is performed using the smartphone and the G-Walk motion sensor as reference device. Signal processing and machine learning techniques will be employed to analyse the data collected from Mobistudy app and the GENEActiv and correlate them with the MDS-UPDRS. Compliance and user aspects will be informing the long-term feasibility.\nThe study received ethical approval by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Etikpr\u00f6vningsmyndigheten), with application number 2022-02885-01. Results will be reported in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. Results will be shared with the study participants.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has a complex genetic background involving both rare and common genetic variants. Although a small percentage of cases show a clear Mendelian inheritance pattern, it is much more relevant to identify patients who present with a complex genetic profile of risk variants with different severity. The \u00df-glucocerebrosidase coding gene (GBA1) is recognized as the most frequent genetic risk factor for PD and Lewy body dementia, irrespective of reduction of the enzyme activity due to genetic variants.\nIn a selected cohort of 190 Hungarian patients with clinical signs of PD and suspected genetic risk, we performed the genetic testing of the GBA1 gene. As other genetic hits can modify clinical features, we also screened for additional rare variants in other neurodegenerative genes and assessed the APOE-\u03b5 genotype of the patients.\nIn our cohort, we identified 29 GBA1 rare variant (RV) carriers. Out of the six different detected RVs, the highly debated E365K and T408M variants are composed of the majority of them (22 out of 32). Three patients carried two GBA1 variants, and an additional three patients carried rare variants in other neurodegenerative genes (SMPD1, SPG11, and SNCA). We did not observe differences in age at onset or other clinical features of the patients carrying two GBA1 variants or patients carrying heterozygous APOE-\u03b54 allele.\nWe need further studies to better understand the drivers of clinical differences in these patients, as this could have important therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "Although cognitive control is essential for efficient gait, the associations between cognitive and motor networks regarding gait in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) remain to be determined. Herein, we enrolled 28 PD and 28 controls to compare internetwork coupling among cognitive and motor networks and examine its relationship with single- and dual-task gait performance in PD.\nThe dorsal attention network (DAN), left and right frontoparietal control networks (FPNs), sensorimotor network, and lateral motor network were identified using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The time taken to complete a 10-m walk test during cognitive or physical dual-tasks in PD was calculated representing gait performance.\nWe observed that the internetwork couplings between the DAN and motor networks and between the motor networks decreased whereas those between the left FPN and DAN and motor networks increased in PD compared to controls using a permutation test. There was no significant correlation between the internetwork couplings and single- and dual-task gait performance in PD. Nevertheless, improved cognitive dual-task performance showed a positive correlation with the DAN and left FPN coupling and a negative correlation with the DAN and lateral motor network coupling in a good performance group. The opposite relationship was observed in the poor cognitive dual-task performance group.\nOur findings suggest a neural mechanism of cognitive control on gait to compensate for reduced goal-directed attention in PD who maintain cognitive dual-task performance.",

There was no significant correlation between the internetwork couplings and single- and dual-task gait performance in PD. Nevertheless, improved cognitive dual-task performance showed a positive correlation with the DAN and left FPN coupling and a negative correlation with the DAN and lateral motor network coupling in a good performance group. The opposite relationship was observed in the poor cognitive dual-task performance group.",

    "abstract": "Since its initial report by James Parkinson in 1817, Parkinson's disease (PD) has remained a central subject of research and clinical advancement. The disease is estimated to affect approximately 1% of adults aged 60 and above. Deep brain stimulation, emerging as an alternative therapy for end-stage cases, has offered a lifeline to numerous patients. This review aimed to analyze publications pertaining to the impact of deep brain stimulation on the motor pathway in patients with PD over the last decade.\nData were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection through the library of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (China). The search strategy encompassed the following keywords: \"deep brain stimulation\", \"Parkinson's disease\", \"motor pathway\", and \"human\", from January 1, 2012, to December 1, 2022. Additionally, this review visualized the findings using the Citespace software.\nThe results indicated that the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China were the primary contributors to this research field. University College London, Capital Medical University, and Maastricht University were the top 3 research institutions in the research area. Tom Foltynie ranked first with 6 publications, and the journals of Brain and Brain Stimulation published the greatest number of relevant articles. The prevailing research focal points in this domain, as determined by keywords \"burst analysis\", \"encompassed neuronal activity\", \"nucleus\", \"hyper direct pathway\", etc. CONCLUSION: This study has provided a new perspective through bibliometric analysis of the deep brain stimulation therapy for treating patients with PD, which can shed light on future research to advance our comprehension of this particular field of study.",

The general characteristics and outcome data (balance, exercise, mobility, quality of life, etc.) of the included studies were extracted, and the quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Finally, the outcome data were integrated for meta-analysis.\nA total of 149 articles were screened, and 5 high-quality RCTs involving 135 PD patients were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed positive long-term effects of hydrotherapy on balance function compared to the control group (SMD\u2009=\u20090.69; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.21, 1.17; \nThe long-term effects of hydrotherapy on PD patients mainly focus on balance function, and the continuous effects on motor function, mobility, and quality of life are not obvious.",

    "abstract": "Real-world monitoring using wearable sensors has enormous potential for assessing disease severity and symptoms among persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). Many distinct features can be extracted, reflecting multiple mobility domains. However, it is unclear which digital measures are related to PD severity and are sensitive to disease progression.\nThe aim was to identify real-world mobility measures that reflect PD severity and show discriminant ability and sensitivity to disease progression, compared to the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) scale.\nMulticenter real-world continuous (24/7) digital mobility data from 587 persons with PD and 68 matched healthy controls were collected using an accelerometer adhered to the lower back. Machine learning feature selection and regression algorithms evaluated associations of the digital measures using the MDS-UPDRS (I-III). Binary logistic regression assessed discriminatory value using controls, and longitudinal observational data from a subgroup (n\u2009=\u200933) evaluated sensitivity to change over time.\nDigital measures were only moderately correlated with the MDS-UPDRS (part II-r\u2009=\u20090.60 and parts I and III-r\u2009=\u20090.50). Most associated measures reflected activity quantity and distribution patterns. A model with 14 digital measures accurately distinguished recently diagnosed persons with PD from healthy controls (81.1%, area under the curve: 0.87); digital measures showed larger effect sizes (Cohen's d: [0.19-0.66]), for change over time than any of the MDS-UPDRS parts (Cohen's d: [0.04-0.12]).\nReal-world mobility measures are moderately associated with clinical assessments, suggesting that they capture different aspects of motor capacity and function. Digital mobility measures are sensitive to early-stage disease and to disease progression, to a larger degree than conventional clinical assessments, demonstrating their utility, primarily for clinical trials but ultimately also for clinical care. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate clinical features, influencing factors and neurobiochemical mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction (OD) in Parkinson disease (PD). Total 39 patients were divided into the\u00a0PD with OD (PD-OD) and PD with no OD (PD-nOD) groups according to overall olfactory function, including threshold, discrimination and identification, assessed by Sniffin' Sticks test. Motor function\u00a0and non-motor symptoms were rated by multiple scales. Dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured. We found that the\u00a0PD-OD group showed significantly lower score of Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, higher scores of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) Screening Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale than the\u00a0PD-nOD group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). RBD Screening Questionnaire score was independently associated with the scores of overall olfactory function and discrimination (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Dopamine and acetylcholine levels in CSF from the\u00a0PD-OD group was significantly lower than that from the\u00a0PD-nOD group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Dopamine and acetylcholine levels in CSF were significantly and positively correlated with the scores of overall olfactory function, threshold, discrimination and identification in PD patients (p\u2009<\u20090.05). RBD Screening Questionnaire score was significantly and negatively correlated with acetylcholine level in CSF in PD patients with poor olfactory detection (p\u2009<\u20090.05). This investigation reveals that PD-OD is associated with cognitive impairment, probable RBD and excessive daytime sleepiness. PD-OD is correlated with the decreased levels of dopamine and acetylcholine in CSF. RBD is an independent influencing factor of overall olfactory function and discrimination, and the\u00a0decreased acetylcholine level in CSF may be the common neurobiochemical basis of RBD and OD in PD patients.",

Epoch-by-epoch analysis showed greater specificity than sensitivity, with adequate accuracy across sleep stages (0.55-0.82).\nGreater Parkinson's disease duration and rapid eye movement behavior were associated with more wakefulness, and worse Parkinson's disease motor symptoms were associated with less deep sleep.\nThe Dreem Headband performs similarly in Parkinson's disease as it did in non-Parkinson's disease samples and shows promise for improving access to sleep assessment in people with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a range of motor and non-motor symptoms. Among the motor complaints, freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and disabling phenomenon that episodically hinders patients' ability to produce efficient steps. Concurrently, sleep disorders are prevalent in PD and significantly impact the quality of life of affected individuals. Numerous studies have suggested a bidirectional relationship between FOG and sleep disorders. Therefore, our objective was to systematically review the literature and compare sleep outcomes in PD patients with FOG (PD\u00a0+\u00a0FOG) and those without FOG (PD-FOG). By conducting a comprehensive search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases, we identified 20 eligible studies for inclusion in our analysis. Our review revealed that compared to PD-FOG, PD\u00a0+\u00a0FOG patients exhibited more severe symptoms of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in nine studies, increased daytime sleepiness in eight studies, decreased sleep quality in four studies, and more frequent and severe sleep disturbances in four studies. These findings indicate that PD\u00a0+\u00a0FOG patients generally experience worse sleep quality, higher levels of daytime sleepiness, and more disruptive sleep disturbances compared to those without FOG (PD-FOG). The association between sleep disturbances and FOG highlights the importance of evaluating and monitoring these symptoms in PD patients and open the possibility for future studies to assess the impact of managing sleep disturbances on the severity and occurrence of FOG, and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of gait function in People with Parkinson Disease (PwPD) is an important tool for monitoring disease progression in PD. While comprehensive gait analysis has become increasingly popular, only one study, Hass et al. (2014), has established minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for one spatiotemporal variable (velocity) in PwPD.\nWhat are the MCIDs for velocity and additional spatiotemporal variables, including mean, variability, and asymmetry of step length, time, and width?\nAs part of a larger clinic-based initiative, 382 medicated, ambulatory PwPD walked on an instrumented walkway during routine clinical visits. Distribution and anchor-based methods (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III, Modified Hoehn and Yahr, and the mobility subsection of the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire) were used to calculate MCIDs for variables of interest in a cross-sectional approach.\nDistribution measures for all variables are presented. Of nine gait variables, four were significantly associated with every anchor and pooled to the following values: velocity (8.2\u00a0cm/s), step length mean (3.6\u00a0cm), step length variability (0.7%), and step time variability (0.67%).\nThe finalized MCID for velocity (8.2\u00a0cm/s) was nearly half of the MCID of 15\u00a0cm/s reported by Hass et al., potentially due to differences in calculations. These results allow for evaluations of effectiveness of interventions by providing values that are specific to changes in gait for PwPD. Alterations of methodology including different versions of clinical or walking assessments, and/or different calculation and selection of gait variables necessitate careful reasoning when using presented MCIDs.",

    "abstract": "The alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) oligomers hold a central role in the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Achieving accurate detection of \u03b1-syn oligomers in vivo presents a promising avenue for early and accurate diagnosis of PD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with non-invasion and exceptional tissue penetration, offers a potent tool for visualizing \u03b1-syn oligomers in vivo. Nonetheless, ensuring diagnostic specificity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel MRI probe (ASOSN) is introduced, which encompasses highly sensitive antiferromagnetic nanoparticles functionalized with single-chain fragment variable antibodies, endowing it with the capacity for discerning recognition and binding to \u03b1-syn oligomers and triggering a switchable T1-T2 MRI signal. Significantly, ASOSN possesses the unique capability to accurately discriminate \u03b1-syn oligomers from neuroinflammation in vivo. Moreover, ASOSN facilitates the non-invasive and precise visualizing of endogenous \u03b1-syn oligomers in living systems. This innovative design heralds the development of a non-invasive visualization strategy for \u03b1-syn oligomers, marking a pivotal advancement for early and accurate diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neuron degenerative disease among the old, characterized by uncontrollable movements and an impaired posture. Although widely investigated on its pathology and treatment, the disease remains incompletely understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been applied to the area of PD, providing valuable data for related research. However, few works have taken deeper insights into the causes of neuron death and cell-cell interaction between the cell types in the brain. Our bioinformatics analyses revealed necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) enrichment in neuron degeneration and selecting the cells by NRGs levels showed two subtypes within the main degenerative cell types in the midbrain. NRG-low subtype was largely replaced by NRG-high subtype in the patients, indicating the striking change of cell state related to necroptosis in PD progression. Moreover, we carried out cell-cell interaction analyses between cell types and found that microglia (MG)'s interaction strength with glutamatergic neuron (GLU), GABAergic neuron (GABA), and dopaminergic neuron (DA) was significantly upregulated in PD. Also, MG show much stronger interaction with NRG-high subtypes and a stronger cell killing function in PD samples. Additionally, we identified CLDN11 as a novel interaction pattern specific to necroptosis neurons and MG. We also found LEF1 and TCF4 as key transcriptional regulators in neuron degeneration. These findings suggest that MG were significantly overactivated in PD patients to clear abnormal neurons, especially the NRG-high cells, explaining the neuron inflammation in PD. Our analyses provide insights into the causes of neuron death and inflammation in PD from single-cell resolution, which could be seriously considered in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder commonly characterized by motor impairments. The development of mobile health (m-health) technologies, such as wearable and smart devices, presents an opportunity for the implementation of clinical tools that can support tasks such as early diagnosis and objective quantification of symptoms.\nThis study evaluates a framework to monitor motor symptoms of PD patients based on the performance of standardized exercises such as those performed during clinic evaluation. To implement this framework, an m-health tool named Monipar was developed that uses off-the-shelf smart devices.\nAn experimental protocol was conducted with the participation of 21 early-stage PD patients and 7 healthy controls who used Monipar installed in off-the-shelf smartwatches and smartphones. Movement data collected using the built-in acceleration sensors were used to extract relevant digital indicators (features). These indicators were then compared with clinical evaluations performed using the MDS-UPDRS scale.\nThe results showed moderate to strong (significant) correlations between the clinical evaluations (MDS-UPDRS scale) and features extracted from the movement data used to assess resting tremor (i.e., the standard deviation of the time series: \nThese results suggest that the proposed framework could be used as a complementary tool for the evaluation of motor symptoms in early-stage PD patients, providing a feasible and cost-effective solution for remote and ambulatory monitoring of specific motor symptoms such as resting tremor or bradykinesia.",

    "abstract": "To assess and compare autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, especially cardiovascular dysautonomia, in Parkinson's Disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and healthy controls.\nAssessment of ANS can be useful in differential diagnosis. Dysautonomia affects quality of life and can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. There is very little literature data regarding dysautonomia in PSP in relation to other parkinsonian syndromes. This study expands the knowledge about ANS dysfunction in parkinsonisms, especially PSP.\nPatients with PD, MSA and PSP were prospectively recruited to our study. Demographic data and information about clinical and neuropsychological assessment, medication and comorbidities was collected. SCOPA-AUT questionnaire, 5-minute tilt test, and 5-minute heart rate variability (HRV) analysis in time and frequency domains were used to assess ANS. Analysis was also performed in patients with PSP-RS and PSP-P phenotypes, and in a subgroup with eliminated confounding factors, including age and disease duration.\n76 PD, 25 PSP, and 12 MSA patients, and 20 controls, were included. Symptoms of dysautonomia revealed by a SCOPA-AUT questionnaire were present in all groups of patients. Urinary dysfunction was more pronounced in atypical parkinsonisms, and cardiovascular symptoms in \u03b1-synucleinopathies. HRV was disrupted in all groups of patients. However, when PSP-P and PSP-RS phenotypes were considered, HRV was diminished in PSP-RS, but there were no differences in HRV parameters between PSP-P and controls. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension was present in 25% of PD and 58% of MSA patients, but it was absent in PSP patients and the control group. 13 PD and nine PSP patients and 16 controls were included in subanalysis. This revealed that PSP, but not PD, patients had significantly more symptoms of dysautonomia and lower HRV indices compared to controls, and that orthostatic hypotension was even more common in PD than in controls.\nOur study suggests that dysautonomia is common in PD, MSA and PSP, even though it has different profiles in the different diseases. NOH is present in PD and MSA, but not in PSP.",

    "abstract": "The risk of Parkinson's disease (PD)-related death in patients with cancer largely unexplored.\nWe analyzed data from the Neoplasms ANd other causes of DEath (NANDE) study, which investigates the causes of death in patients with cancer in Japan. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated to compare the risk of PD-related deaths in patients with cancer to that of the general population. Poisson regression models were employed to estimate the relative risk of PD-related death in the subgroups.\nThe cohort included 548,485 patients with cancer, yielding 2,047,398 person-years at risk from 1995 to 2013. During the study period, 242,250 patients died and 145 deaths were attributable to PD. The SMR for PD-related death was 2.34 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.99-2.75). Patients who were diagnosed with cancer before 70 years of age had a high SMR (>5) for PD-related deaths. The SMR of patients with mouth-to-stomach cancers (lip, oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and stomach cancers) was 3.72 (95% CI: 2.84-4.86), while that of those with other cancers was 1.93 (95% CI: 1.57-2.37). The multivariate Poisson regression model revealed that patients with mouth-to-stomach cancers were more likely to die of PD than those without (relative risk 2.07, 95\u00a0% CI; 1.46-2.93).\nPatients with cancer are at a high risk of PD-related death; particularly, mouth-to-stomach cancers and potentially obstructing medication for PD are attributable to a high mortality risk. Careful management, including adequate PD treatment, would benefit cancer survivors with PD and reduce the risk of PD-related death.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) reflects the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Besides the motor features, non-motor symptoms, such as constipation, are very common. There is accumulating evidence that neuroinflammation is associated with the PD pathological processes. Alterations of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites have been linked to the pathogenesis of PD. Previous research has shown that probiotic supplementation has beneficial effects on motor and non-motor symptoms and especially on constipation.\nIn this study, we examine the effectiveness of a combination of probiotic supplementation (butyrate triglyceride 302.86 mg, \nThe present study is a retrospective study that examined the existing medical records of patients with diagnosed PD, having chronic constipation and used the probiotic supplementation for its management. A total of 41 existing medical records were screened. Medical records were excluded in the case of participation in another study for PD, suffering from irritable bowel syndrome, organic constipation, long-term laxative use changes in the standard dopaminergic treatment, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score<24, hospitalization and antibiotic medication, and diarrheal syndrome. Nine medical records were excluded, and a final number of 32 medical records was finally examined. All 32 patients had evaluations carried out at baseline and three months after supplement administration. A stool diary questionnaire, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III), and the Schwab and England and the Hoehn and Yahr scales were used for the evaluation.\nThe median defecation frequency was significantly improved. The supplementation administration significantly improved UPDRS III\u00a0by 7.7% (from 35.72\u00b115.51 to 32.97\u00b115.71, p = 0.005) at month three, as compared to baseline.\u00a0A positive effect was also seen in the Schwab and England scale. There was no effect on the Hoehn and Yahr scale.\nThe enteric microbiome composition is altered in PD, and there is accumulating evidence that probiotic supplementation could alleviate disease symptoms in neuroinflammatory disorders.",

This study aims to evaluate MRgFUS's efficacy and safety in PD through a systematic review and meta-analysis, examining pre-and post-treatment MDS-UPDRSIII and/or CRST scores and associated adverse events.\nWe conducted an extensive literature search across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, screening studies based on set criteria and analyzing MDS-UPDRSIII, CRST, and adverse events pre- and post-MRgFUS treatment.\nOut of 468 retrieved articles, 20 studies involving 258 patients, spanning 2014-2023, were included.17 studies indicated significant MDS-UPDRSIII score reductions post-MRgFUS treatment, while 3 showed significant CRST score declines. In the \"on\" medication state, pooled MDS-UPDRSIII scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12\u2009months were 12.18 (95% CI: 5.83-18.52), 12.10 (95% CI: 8.22-15.97), 14.85 (95% CI: 9.28-20.41), and 20.65 (95% CI: 12.15-29.14) respectively.

The PD model was established by continuous gavage of rotenone for 4 weeks. EA was applied at \"Baihui\" (GV20), \"Quchi\" (LI11) and \"Zusanli\" (ST36) for 20 min, once a day for 14 days, with 2-day rest after every 5-day treatment. The open field test was used to evaluate the residence time in the central area, ave-rage movement speed, and total distance of the open field. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression le-vels of divalent metal ion transporter 1 (DMT1), membrane ferroportin 1 (FPN1), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), proapoptotic protein Bax, and anti apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in the substantia nigra. Immunohistochemical method was used to detect the morphological changes of neurons and the positive expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra of mice.\nAfter 4 weeks of modeling, compared with the blank group, the residence time in the central area, average speed and total distance of open field were significantly lower (\nEA has a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of midbrain in PD model mice, which may be related with its effect in regulating oxidative stress and cell apoptosis induced by ferroptosis.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases have been one of the major concerns for human health. Genetic and environmental factors are believed to be responsible for neuronal diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. It is difficult to restore normal nervous function after neurodegeneration; hence, prevention could be the best strategy against these diseases. Ayurved medicines such as Suvarna Bhasma (SB) have enormous potential to treat these neurological diseases.\nThe aim of this study is to examine the protective effect of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish.\nIn this study, we induced Parkinson's-like disease model in zebrafish by inducing it with rotenone (7\u00a0\u03bcg/L). We examined the behavioural, proteomics and dopamine alterations of rotenone induced zebrafish of SB pre-treated group as compared to the control group.\nThe behavioural experiments showed that due to rotenone exposure, Parkinson's-like behavioural abnormality was induced in zebrafish. However, because of SB treatment, this behavioural abnormality was reduced. The proteomics study of zebrafish brains clearly showed that the SB-treated group was not significantly affected due to rotenone exposure. However, in the SB non-treated group, expression of nine proteins that are linked to Parkinson's disease (gene name: sncgb, ywhae1, ywhah, uchl1, ywhaba, psma6a, ywhabl, ywhaqb, and ywhabb) were differentially expressed after rotenone exposure. Finally, prevention of dopamine alteration in SB-treated fish brains confirmed the protective action of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish.\nThis study finds that Suvarna Bhasma has neuroprotective effects against Parkinson's-like disease model.",

    "abstract": "This review aims to examine the association of Parkinson's disease (PD) with the increased risk of cardiovascular events.\nPubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and Scopus databases were electronically searched for papers published up to 5 May 2023. Studies reporting the association between PD and the subsequent risks of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and cardiovascular mortality were included.\nSixteen studies were included in this review. The clinical data of 101,712 PD patients were compared with that of the control group of 204,901 patients without PD in the included studies. Meta-analysis showed that PD patients had an increased risk of stroke compared with patients without PD (odds ratio (OR): 1.49; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.30, 1.72; \nPatients with PD may have an increased risk of stroke as compared with the age- and gender-matched general population. While our results show that PD does not increase the overall risk of MI and cardiovascular mortality, analysis of cohort studies alone demonstrated that these risks may be higher in patients with PD. The current evidence is of very low quality. Further prospective cohort studies from different countries that would account for important cardiovascular risk factors are needed to improve the current evidence.\nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, PROSPERO (CRD42023421924).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, age-related neurodegenerative disease. The disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, pars compacta of the midbrain. Pramipexole (PPX) is a novel drug used for the treatment of PD. It has a high affinity for the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor subfamily and acts as a targeted mitochondrial antioxidant. It is less effective in the treatment of PD due to its short half-life, highly inconvenient dosing schedule, and long-term side effects. In recent years, PPX-loaded nanoformulations have been actively reported to overcome these limitations. In the current study, we focused on increasing the effectiveness of PPX by minimizing the dosing frequency and improving the treatment strategy for PD. Herein, we report the synthesis of biodegradable polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-capped copper oxide nanoparticles (PVP-CuO NPs), followed by PPX anchoring on the surface of the PVP-CuO NPs (PPX-PVP-CuO NC), in a simple and inexpensive method. The newly formulated PPX-PVP-CuO NC complex was analyzed for its chemical and physical properties. The PPX-PVP-CuO NC was tested to protect against rotenone (RT)-induced toxicity in the ",

    "abstract": "Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, plays a crucial role in the development of various organ systems and exhibits neuroprotective properties. This study aims to investigate the effect of FOXA1 on Parkinson's disease (PD) and unravel the underlying mechanism. Transcriptome analysis of PD was conducted using three GEO datasets to identify aberrantly expressed genes. A mouse model of PD was generated by injecting neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP), resulting in reduced FOXA1 expression. FOXA1 decline was also observed in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Artificial upregulation of FOXA1 improved motor abilities of mice according to rotarod and pole tests, and it mitigated tissue damage, cell loss, and neuronal damage in the mouse substantia nigra or in vitro. FOXA1 was found to bind to the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) promoter, thereby inducing its transcription and inactivating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Further experimentation revealed that silencing NF1 in mice or SH-SY5Y cells counteracted the neuroprotective effects of FOXA1. In conclusion, this research suggests that FOXA1 activates NF1 transcription and inactivates the MAPK signaling pathway, ultimately ameliorating neuronal damage and motor disability in PD. The findings may offer novel ideas in the field of PD management.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a lack of effective treatment options. mangiferin, a bioactive compound derived from mango, has been shown to possess strong neuroprotective properties. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of mangiferin on PD and its underlying mechanisms using both in vitro and in vivo models of 6-OHDA-induced PD. Additionally, we conducted molecular docking experiments to evaluate the interaction between mangiferin and AKR1C3 and \u03b2-catenin. Our results demonstrated that treatment with mangiferin significantly attenuated 6-OHDA-induced cell damage in PC12 cells, reducing intracellular oxidative stress, improving mitochondrial membrane potential, and restoring the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a characteristic protein of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, mangiferin reduced the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein and inhibited the expression of AKR1C3, thereby activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. In vivo studies revealed that mangiferin improved motor dysfunction in 6-OHDA-induced PD mice. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the interaction between mangiferin and AKR1C3 and \u03b2-catenin. These findings indicate that mangiferin exerts significant neuroprotective effects in 6-OHDA-induced PD by inhibiting AKR1C3 and activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Therefore, mangiferin may emerge as an innovative therapeutic strategy in the comprehensive treatment regimen of PD patients, providing them with better clinical outcomes and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Foot dystonia occurs in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and leads to pain, malformation, and difficulty with walking. Botulinum toxin injections may be effective for foot dystonia, but the extent of improvement and effects on motor function are unclear.\nIn this study, we performed botulinum toxin injections for foot dystonia in 25 patients with PD. At 3 weeks and 3 months post-infection, we assessed changes in plantar pressure distribution utilizing the Pressure Plate system; dystonia using the Modified Ashworth Spasm score; pain using the visual analog scale (VAS) score; and lower extremity function using the Calf-raise Senior (CRS) test, Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and gait parameters (eg, stride length, step length).\nWe found improved Modified Ashworth Spasm score (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and VAS score (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) post-injection. CRS test score (3 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006; 3 months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.068), stride length (3 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012; 3 months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.715), and step length (3 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011; 3 months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.803) also improved. Plantar pressure distribution improved after botulinum toxin injection (metatarsal 1, 3 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.031; 3 months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.144; metatarsal 2, 3 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.049; 3 months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.065; metatarsal 3, 3 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; 3 months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.017; metatarsal 4, 3 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.017; 3 months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.144; medial heel, 3 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01; 3 months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.395; lateral heel, 3 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.035; 3 months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.109).\nBotulinum toxin injection for foot dystonia in patients with PD can reduce spasms and pain and normalize plantar pressure distribution, which improves balance and lower extremity function.",

    "abstract": "A shared biological component between melanoma and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been suggested. Yet, epidemiological evidence is scarce.\nTo examine the association of hair color and family history of melanoma, two strong predictors of melanoma risk, with the occurrence of PD.\nWe followed 131,342 women and men for \u223c30 years for the development of PD. We calculated the cumulative incidence of PD from ages 40 to 90 according to hair color, and estimated the hazard ratio of PD according to hair color and family history of melanoma.\nHair color was not strongly associated with the risk of PD, especially at advanced ages. In contrast, individuals with a family history of melanoma had a 1.4-fold higher risk of PD compared to those without a history.\nOur results support the hypothesis of a shared biological component between PD and melanoma. Both pigmentary and non-pigmentary pathways may play a role.",

The present study aimed to assess the potential efficacy of Tele-VR apps in enhancing cognitive performance and improving social skills in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThirty-four patients with PD were included in the study. Patients were assigned to one of the following treatment groups: Experimental Group 1 (EG1) underwent a Tele-VR program using two cognitive rehabilitation applications (app) on smartphones (Neuronation-Brain Training and Train your Brain); Experimental Group 2 (EG2) received a Tele-VR program through one cognitive rehabilitation app (Neuronation-Brain Training) and one socio-cognitive rehabilitation App (The Sims) on smartphones; Active Control Group (aCG) performed a conventional training using pencil and paper exercises (Not-VR).\nAt the end of the study, the aCG and EG1 presented an improvement in the executive, attentional and visuospatial cognitive domains. Mood and subjective memory also improved in the EG1. Moreover, in the EG2 group, a significant improvement was found in all cognitive domains, including social cognition skills (theory of mind). The inter-group comparison showed that both EG1 and EG2 had significantly greater improvements than aCG in MoCA score. Finally, both EG1 and EG2 showed a higher improvement in the FAB score, as compared to the aCG.\nRehabilitation with smartphone apps could be more useful than conventional rehabilitation in improving cognitive and social cognition skills in patients with PD.

    "abstract": "Here, we hypothesized that the reactivity of posterior resting-state electroencephalographic (rsEEG) alpha rhythms during the transition from eyes-closed to -open condition might be lower in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) than in patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD). A Eurasian database provided clinical-demographic-rsEEG datasets in 73 PDD patients, 35 ADD patients, and 25 matched cognitively unimpaired (Healthy) persons. The eLORETA freeware was used to estimate cortical rsEEG sources. Results showed substantial (greater than -10%) reduction (reactivity) in the posterior alpha source activities from the eyes-closed to the eyes-open condition in 88% of the Healthy seniors, 57% of the ADD patients, and only 35% of the PDD patients. In these alpha-reactive participants, there was lower reactivity in the parietal alpha source activities in the PDD group than in the healthy control seniors and the ADD patients. These results suggest that PDD patients show poor reactivity of mechanisms desynchronizing posterior rsEEG alpha rhythms in response to visual inputs. That neurophysiological biomarker may provide an endpoint for (non) pharmacological interventions for improving vigilance regulation in those patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is becoming a growing global concern by being the second most prevalent disease next to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Henceforth new exploration is needed in search of new aspects towards the disease mechanism and origin. Evidence from recent studies has clearly stated the role of Gut Microbiota (GM) in the maintenance of the brain and as a root cause of various diseases and disorders including other neurological conditions. In the case of PD, with an unknown etiology, the GM is said to have a larger impact on the disease pathophysiology. Although GM and its metabolites are crucial for maintaining the normal physiology of the host, it is an undeniable fact that there is an influence of GM in the pathophysiology of PD. As such the Enteroendocrine Cells (EECs) in the epithelium of the intestine are one of the significant regulators of the gut-brain axis and act as a communication mediator between the gut and the brain. The communication is established via the molecules of neuroendocrine which are said to have a crucial part in neurological diseases such as AD, PD, and other psychiatry-related disorders. This review is focused on understanding the proper role of GM and EECs in PD. Here, we also focus on some of the metabolites and compounds that can interact with the PD genes causing various dysfunctions in the cell and facilitating the disease conditions using bioinformatical tools. Various mechanisms concerning EECs and PD, their identification, the latest studies, and available current therapies have also been discussed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which only symptomatic treatments are available. Both preclinical and clinical studies suggest that moderate hypoxia induces evolutionarily conserved adaptive mechanisms that enhance neuronal viability and survival. Therefore, targeting the hypoxia response pathway might provide neuroprotection by ameliorating the deleterious effects of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which underlie neurodegeneration in PD. Here, we review experimental studies regarding the link between PD pathophysiology and neurophysiological adaptations to hypoxia. We highlight the mechanistic differences between the rescuing effects of chronic hypoxia in neurodegeneration and short-term moderate hypoxia to improve neuronal resilience, termed \"hypoxic conditioning\". Moreover, we interpret these preclinical observations regarding the pharmacological targeting of the hypoxia response pathway. Finally, we discuss controversies with respect to the differential effects of hypoxia response pathway activation across the PD spectrum, as well as intervention dosing in hypoxic conditioning and potential harmful effects of such interventions. We recommend that initial clinical studies in PD should focus on the safety, physiological responses, and mechanisms of hypoxic conditioning, as well as on repurposing of existing pharmacological compounds. \u00a9 2023 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

Using seed-based functional connectivity analyses, we investigated the RSNs supposedly related to hallucinations in PD: the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), and visual network (VN). We compared the cognitive function and RSN connectivity among the three groups. In addition, we performed a seed-to-seed analysis to examine the inter-network connectivity within each group using the corresponding RSN seeds.\nPD-MH group had lower test scores for attention and visuospatial functions compared with those in the other groups. The connectivity of the right intracalcarine cortex within the DAN was lower in the PD-MH group than in the others. The PD-mH and PD-MH groups showed higher connectivity in the left orbitofrontal cortex within DMN compared with the PD-nH group, whereas the connectivity was lower in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) within ECN, precuneus cortex within VAN, right middle temporal gyrus and precuneus cortex within DAN, and left MFG within VN. The PD-mH and PD-MH groups showed different inter-network connectivity between the five RSNs, especially regarding DAN connectivity.\nDAN dysfunction may be a key factor in the progression from mH to MH in patients with PD. \u00a9 2023 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system, specifically the motor system. It is mainly caused by the loss of dopamine due to the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) protein in the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Previous studies have reported that immunization may be a potential preventive strategy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, the aim of the study was to design an \u03b1-syn specific epitope vaccine and investigate its effect in PD-related pathophysiology using an \u03b1-syn-induced mouse model. We used an in silico model to identify and design a non-toxic \u03b1-syn-based peptide epitope vaccine and, to overcome poor immunogenicity, the vaccine was coupled with immunogenic carrier proteins, i.e., ovalbumin (OVA) and keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Our results showed that vaccinated PD mouse models, especially with vaccines with carrier proteins, improved in motor functions compared with the non-vaccinated PD model. Additionally, the vaccinated groups showed increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the spleen and plasma as well as decreased interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in the plasma. Furthermore, vaccinated groups, especially OVA and KLH groups, showed decrease in \u03b1-syn levels and increased dopamine-related markers, i.e., tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), vesicle monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and dopamine transporter (DAT), and autophagy activities in the striatum and SNpc. Lastly, our data showed decreased neuroinflammation by reducing the activation of microglia and astrocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the immunized groups, especially with OVA and KLH carrier proteins. Overall, these results suggest that vaccination, especially with immunogenic carrier proteins, is effective in reducing the accumulation of \u03b1-syn aggregates in the brain and ameliorate PD-related pathophysiology. Hence, further development of this approach might have a potential role in preventing the development of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta with a reduction in dopamine concentration in the striatum. It is a substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons that is responsible for the classic triad of PD symptoms, i.e., resting tremor, muscular rigidity, and bradykinesia. Several current therapies for PD may only offer symptomatic relief and do not address the underlying neurodegeneration of PD. The recent developments in cellular reprogramming have enabled the development of previously unachievable cell therapies and patient-specific modeling of PD through Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs). iPSCs possess the inherent capacity for pluripotency, allowing for their directed differentiation into diverse cell lineages, such as dopaminergic neurons, thus offering a promising avenue for addressing the issue of neurodegeneration within the context of PD. This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of dopamine on PD patients, illustrates the versatility of iPSCs and their regenerative abilities, and examines the benefits of using iPSC treatment for PD as opposed to current therapeutic measures. In means of providing a treatment approach that reinforces the long-term survival of the transplanted neurons, the review covers three supplementary avenues to reinforce the potential of iPSCs.",

Oral administration of ARC at 10 or 20 units/kg/day for 3 days prior to intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10 mg/kg) effectively preserved dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum by preventing LPS-induced cell death. ARC also normalized the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the SN, providing further evidence for its neuroprotective properties. In the liver, ARC downregulated the LPS-induced increase in inflammatory cytokines and reversed the LPS-induced decrease in antioxidant-related genes. These findings indicate that ARC exerts potent antioxidant, anti-aldehyde, and anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, suggesting its potential as a disease-modifying agent for the prevention and treatment of neuroinflammation-related diseases, including Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have revealed the existence of electrode displacement during subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). However, the effect of electrode displacement on treatment outcomes is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to analyze the related factors of electrode displacement and assess postoperative electrode displacement in relation to the motor outcomes of STN-DBS.\nA total of 88 patients aged 62.73 \u00b1 6.35 years (55 males and 33 females) with Parkinson's disease undergoing STN-DBS, with comprehensive clinical characterization before and 1 month after surgery, were involved retrospectively and divided into a cross-incision group and cannula puncture group according to different dura opening methods. The electrode displacement, unilateral pneumocephalus volume percent (uPVP), and brain volume percent were estimated.\nA significant anterior and lateral electrode displacement was observed among all implanted electrodes after pneumocephalus absorption (\nElectrode displacement had a negative impact on the therapeutic efficacy of STN-DBS. Opening the dura via cannula puncture is recommended to increase the accuracy of the lead implantation.",

We conducted a clinical-demographic evaluation of 126 patients with PD, all of whom were Caucasian and of Sicilian ancestry. DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood for each patient, followed by sequencing using a Next-Generation Sequencing system. This system was based on a custom gene panel comprising 162 genes. The sample underwent further filtering, taking into account the allele frequencies of genetic variants, their presence in the Human Gene Mutation Database, and their association in the literature with PD or other movement/neurodegenerative disorders.

    "abstract": "To investigate whether impaired plantar cutaneous vibration perception contributes to axial motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and whether anti-parkinsonian medication and subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) show different effects.\nThree groups were evaluated: PD patients in the medication \"on\" state (PD-MED), PD patients in the medication \"on\" state and additionally \"on\" STN-DBS (PD-MED-DBS), as well as healthy subjects (HS) as reference. Motor performance was analyzed using a pressure distribution platform. Plantar cutaneous vibration perception thresholds (VPT) were investigated using a customized vibration exciter at 30 Hz.\nMotor performance of PD-MED and PD-MED-DBS was characterized by greater postural sway, smaller limits of stability ranges, and slower gait due to shorter strides, fewer steps per minute, and broader stride widths compared to HS. Comparing patient groups, PD-MED-DBS showed better overall motor performance than PD-MED, particularly for the functional limits of stability and gait. VPTs were significantly higher for PD-MED compared to those of HS, which suggests impaired plantar cutaneous vibration perception in PD. However, PD-MED-DBS showed less impaired cutaneous vibration perception than PD-MED.\nPD patients suffer from poor motor performance compared to healthy subjects. Anti-parkinsonian medication in tandem with STN-DBS seems to be superior for normalizing axial motor symptoms compared to medication alone. Plantar cutaneous vibration perception is impaired in PD patients, whereas anti-parkinsonian medication together with STN-DBS is superior for normalizing tactile cutaneous perception compared to medication alone. Consequently, based on our results and the findings of the literature, impaired plantar cutaneous vibration perception might contribute to axial motor symptoms in PD.",

    "results": "Motor performance of PD-MED and PD-MED-DBS was characterized by greater postural sway, smaller limits of stability ranges, and slower gait due to shorter strides, fewer steps per minute, and broader stride widths compared to HS. Comparing patient groups, PD-MED-DBS showed better overall motor performance than PD-MED, particularly for the functional limits of stability and gait. VPTs were significantly higher for PD-MED compared to those of HS, which suggests impaired plantar cutaneous vibration perception in PD. However, PD-MED-DBS showed less impaired cutaneous vibration perception than PD-MED.",

    "abstract": "Neural transplantation represents a promising approach to repairing damaged brain circuitry. Cellular grafts have been shown to promote functional recovery through \"bystander effects\" and other indirect mechanisms. However, extensive brain lesions may require direct neuronal replacement to achieve meaningful restoration of function. While fetal cortical grafts have been shown to integrate with the host brain and appear to develop appropriate functional attributes, the significant ethical concerns and limited availability of this tissue severely hamper clinical translation. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cells and tissues represent a more readily scalable alternative. Significant progress has recently been made in developing protocols for generating a wide range of neural cell types in vitro. Here, we discuss recent progress in neural transplantation approaches for two conditions with distinct design needs: Parkinson's disease and cortical injury. We discuss the current status and future application of injections of dopaminergic cells for the treatment of Parkinson's disease as well as the use of structured grafts such as brain organoids for cortical repair.",

    "abstract": "Sporadic Parkinson's disease, characterised by a decline in dopamine, usually manifests in people over 65 years of age. Although 10% of cases have a genetic (familial) basis, most PD is sporadic. Genome sequencing studies have associated several genetic variants with sporadic PD. Our aim was to analyse the promoter region of the ATG16L1 and ATG5 genes in sporadic PD patients and ethnically matched controls. Genotypes were obtained by using the Sanger method with primers designed by us. The number of haplotypes was estimated with DnaSP software, phylogeny was reconstructed in Network, and genetic divergence was explored with ",

    "abstract": "The detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) in its early stages is of great importance for its treatment and management, but consensus is lacking on what information is necessary and what models should be used to best predict PD risk. In our study, we first grouped PD-associated factors based on their cost and accessibility, and then gradually incorporated them into risk predictions, which were built using eight commonly used machine learning models to allow for comprehensive assessment. Finally, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method was used to investigate the contributions of each factor. We found that models built with demographic variables, hospital admission examinations, clinical assessment, and polygenic risk score achieved the best prediction performance, and the inclusion of invasive biomarkers could not further enhance its accuracy. Among the eight machine learning models considered, penalized logistic regression and XGBoost were the most accurate algorithms for assessing PD risk, with penalized logistic regression achieving an area under the curve of 0.94 and a Brier score of 0.08. Olfactory function and polygenic risk scores were the most important predictors for PD risk. Our research has offered a practical framework for PD risk assessment, where necessary information and efficient machine learning tools were highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Several studies showed an association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The linking mechanisms remain unclear. MetS promotes low-grade peripheral oxidative stress and inflammation and dysregulation of the adipose renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Interestingly, brain RAS dysregulation is involved in the progression of dopaminergic degeneration and PD. Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) from MetS fat tissue can cross the brain-blood barrier and may act as linking signals. We isolated and characterized EVs from MetS and control rats and analyzed their mRNA and protein cargo using RT-PCR and the ExoView R200 platform, respectively. Furthermore, cultures of the N27 dopaminergic cell line and the C6 astrocytic cell line were treated with EVs from MetS rats. EVs were highly increased in MetS rat serum, which was inhibited by treatment of the rats with the angiotensin type-1-receptor blocker candesartan. Furthermore, EVs from MetS rats showed increased pro-oxidative/pro-inflammatory and decreased anti-oxidative/anti-inflammatory RAS components, which were inhibited in candesartan-treated MetS rats. In cultures, EVs from MetS rats increased N27 cell death and modulated C6 cell function, upregulating markers of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which were inhibited by the pre-treatment of cultures with candesartan. The results from rat models suggest EVs and their RAS cargo as a mechanism linking Mets and PD.",

    "abstract": "Familial Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently linked to multiple disease-causing mutations within Leucine-Rich Repeat Protein Kinase 2 (LRRK2), leading to aberrant kinase activity. Multiple pathogenic effects of enhanced LRRK2 activity have been identified, including loss of cilia and centrosomal cohesion defects. When phosphorylated by LRRK2, Rab8a and Rab10 bind to phospho-specific RILPL effector proteins. RILPL-mediated accumulation of pRabs proximal to the mother centriole is critical for initiating deficits in ciliogenesis and centrosome cohesion mediated by LRRK2. We hypothesized that Rab-derived phospho-mimics may serve to block phosphorylated Rab proteins from docking with RILPL in the context of hyperactive LRRK2 mutants. This would serve as an alternative strategy to downregulate pathogenic signaling mediated by LRRK2, rather than targeting LRRK2 kinase activity itself. To test this theory, we designed a series of constrained peptides mimicking phosphorylated Switch II derived from Rab8. These RILPL interacting peptides, termed RIP, were further shown to permeate cells. Further, several peptides were found to bind RILPL2 and restore ciliogenesis and centrosomal cohesion defects in cells expressing PD-associated mutant LRRK2. This research demonstrates the utility of constrained peptides as downstream inhibitors to target pathogenic LRRK2 activity and may provide an alternative approach to target specific pathways activated by LRRK2.",

    "abstract": "Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) is one of two diagnostic gold standards for pharyngeal dysphagia in Parkinson's disease (PD), however, validated global outcome measures at the patient level are widely lacking. The Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity for Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (DIGEST-FEES) represents such an outcome measure but has been validated primarily for head and neck cancer collectives. The objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the validity of the DIGEST-FEES in patients with PD. Content validity was evaluated with a modified Delphi expert survey. Subsequently, 66 FEES videos in PD patients were scored with the DIGEST-FEES. Criterion validity was determined using Spearman's correlation coefficient between the DIGEST-FEES and the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS), the Yale-Residue-Rating-Scale, the Functional-Oral-Intake-Scale (FOIS), and the swallowing-related Unified-Parkinson-Disease-Rating-Scale (UPDRS) items. Inter-rater reliability was determined using 10 randomly selected FEES-videos examined by a second rater. As a result, the overall DIGEST-FEES-rating exhibited significant correlations with the Yale-Valleculae-Residue-Scale (r\u2009=\u20090.84; p\u2009<\u20090.001), the Yale-Pyriform-Sinus-Residue-Scale (r\u2009=\u20090.70; p\u2009<\u20090.001), the FOIS (r\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.55, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and the UPDRS-Swallowing-Item-Score (r\u2009=\u20090.42, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Further, the DIGEST-FEES-safety subscore correlated with the PAS (r\u2009=\u20090.63, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Inter-rater reliability was high for the overall DIGEST-FEES rating (quadratic weighted kappa of 0.82). Therefore, DIGEST-FEES is a valid and reliable score to evaluate overall pharyngeal dysphagia severity in PD. Nevertheless, the modified Delphi survey identified domains where DIGEST-FEES may need to be specifically adapted to PD or neurological collectives in the future.",

    "abstract": "External sensory cues can reduce freezing of gait in people with Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the role of the basal ganglia in these movements is unclear. We used microelectrode recordings to examine modulations in single unit (SU) and oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) during auditory-cued rhythmic pedaling movements of the feet. We tested five blocks of increasing cue frequencies (1\u00a0Hz, 1.5\u00a0Hz, 2\u00a0Hz, 2.5\u00a0Hz, and 3\u00a0Hz) in 24 people with PD undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus internus (GPi). Single unit firing and beta band LFPs (13-30\u00a0Hz) in response to movement onsets or cue onsets were examined. We found that the timing accuracy of foot pedaling decreased with faster cue frequencies. Increasing cue frequencies also attenuated firing rates in both STN and GPi neurons. Peak beta power in the GPi and STN showed different responses to the task. GPi beta power showed persistent suppression with fast cues and phasic modulation with slow cues. STN beta power showed enhanced beta synchronization following movement. STN beta power also correlated with rate of pedaling. Overall, we showed task-related responses in the GPi and STN during auditory-cued movements with differential roles in sensory and motor control. The results suggest a role for both input and output basal ganglia nuclei in auditory rhythmic pacing of gait-like movements in PD.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the relationship of irisin with the severity of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dopamine (DOPA) uptake in patients with PD and to understand the role of irisin in PD.\nThe plasma levels of irisin and \u03b1-syn were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Motor and nonmotor symptoms were assessed with the relevant scales. DOPA uptake was measured with DOPA positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nThe plasma levels of \u03b1-syn and irisin in patients with PD gradually increased and decreased, respectively, with the progression of the disease. There was a negative correlation between plasma \u03b1-syn and irisin levels in patients with PD. The level of irisin in plasma was negatively correlated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III scores and positively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. The striatal/occipital lobe uptake ratios (SORs) of the ipsilateral and contralateral caudate nucleus and anterior and posterior putamen in the high-irisin group were significantly higher than those in the low-irisin group, and irisin levels in the caudate nucleus and anterior and posterior putamen contralateral to the affected limb were lower than those on the ipsilateral side. The level of irisin was positively correlated with the SORs of the ipsilateral and contralateral caudate nucleus and putamen in PD patients.\nIrisin plays a neuroprotective role by decreasing the level of \u03b1-syn. Irisin is negatively correlated with the severity of motor symptoms and cognitive impairment. More importantly, irisin can improve DOPA uptake in the striatum of patients with PD, especially on the side contralateral to the affected limb.",

There was a negative correlation between plasma \u03b1-syn and irisin levels in patients with PD. The level of irisin in plasma was negatively correlated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III scores and positively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. The striatal/occipital lobe uptake ratios (SORs) of the ipsilateral and contralateral caudate nucleus and anterior and posterior putamen in the high-irisin group were significantly higher than those in the low-irisin group, and irisin levels in the caudate nucleus and anterior and posterior putamen contralateral to the affected limb were lower than those on the ipsilateral side. The level of irisin was positively correlated with the SORs of the ipsilateral and contralateral caudate nucleus and putamen in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease behind Alzheimer's Disease, currently affecting more than 10 million people worldwide and 1.5 times more males than females. The progression of PD results in the loss of function due to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. The etiology of PD is multifactorial, including both genetic and environmental origins. Here we explored changes in RNA editing, specifically editing through the actions of the Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA (ADARs), in the progression of PD. Analysis of ADAR editing of skeletal muscle transcriptomes from PD patients and controls, including those that engaged in a rehabilitative exercise training program revealed significant differences in ADAR editing patterns based on age, disease status, and following rehabilitative exercise. Further, deleterious editing events in protein coding regions were identified in multiple genes with known associations to PD pathogenesis. Our findings of differential ADAR editing complement findings of changes in transcriptional networks identified by a recent study and offer insights into dynamic ADAR editing changes associated with PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Istradefylline, a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, is indicated in the US and Japan as adjunctive treatment to levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitors in adults with Parkinson's disease (PD) experiencing OFF time. This study aimed to observe patterns of dose escalation of levodopa over time in patients initiated on istradefylline.\nUsing Japanese electronic health record data, interrupted time series analyses were used to compare levodopa daily dose (LDD, mg/day) gradients in patients before and after initiation of istradefylline. Data were analyzed by period relative to istradefylline initiation (Month 1): pre-istradefylline (Months -72 to 0), early istradefylline (Months 1 to 24), and late istradefylline (Months 25 to 72). Subgroup analyses included LDD before istradefylline initiation (<400, \u2265400 to <600, \u2265600 mg/day) and treatment with or without monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, or dopamine agonists before istradefylline initiation.\nThe analysis included 4026 patients; mean (SD) baseline LDD was 419.27 mg (174.19). Patients receiving \u2265600 mg/day levodopa or not receiving MAO-B inhibitors or COMT inhibitors demonstrated a significant reduction in LDD increase gradient for pre-istradefylline vs late-phase istradefylline (\u2265600 mg/day levodopa, -6.259 mg/day each month, p<0.001; no MAO-B inhibitors, -1.819 mg/day each month, p = 0.004; no COMT inhibitors, -1.412 mg/day each month, p = 0.027).\nThis real-world analysis of Japanese prescription data indicated that slowing of LDD escalation was observed in patients initiated on istradefylline, particularly in those receiving \u2265600 mg/day levodopa, suggesting istradefylline may slow progressive LDD increases. These findings suggest that initiating istradefylline before other levodopa-adjunctive therapies may mitigate LDD increases, potentially reducing occurrence or severity of levodopa-induced complications in long-term istradefylline treatment.",

    "abstract": "We had attended a Parkinson's Disease (PD) patient for a non-healing wound who reported a marked decrease in his hand tremor and freezing of gait when his wound was exposed to a ceramic far-field infrared (cFIR) blanket. PD is the most frequent motor disorder and the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) affect up to 10 million people throughout the world, and the major contributing factor to the pathogenesis of PD is the accumulation and propagation of pathological \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) and the death of dopaminergic cells in the Nigrostriatal system. Efforts to slow or stop its spreading have resulted in the development and use of dopaminergic drug replacement therapy. Unfortunately, there is a loss of about 70-80% of substantia nigral dopaminergic neurons in patients by the time they are diagnosed with PD, and various dopaminergic drugs provide only temporary relief of their motor symptoms. There are limitations in treating PD with many conventional medications, necessitating a combination of pharmaceutical and non-pharmacological therapy as an essential adjunct to better address the health and welfare of PD patients. We used male adult A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice exposed to a ceramic far-infrared blanket. Motor activity was assessed using the rotarod apparatus, and mouse brains were examined to quantify the fluorescence intensities of the immunostained samples. A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice had a significantly shorter time stay on the rotating bar than the wild-type mice (B6C3H). The rotarod performance was significantly improved in A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice exposed to cFIR as well as B6C3H healthy wild mice exposed to cFIR. There was a significant statistical and substantive increase in the cellular composition of the Striatum and substantia nigra of cFIR-treated mice. Improvement in motor performance is seen in PD mice and wild mice and is associated with increases in cell volume in the substantia nigra and striatum after treatment.",

    "abstract": "Advances in stem cell technologies open up new avenues for modelling development and diseases. The success of these pursuits, however, relies on the use of cells most relevant to those targeted by the disease of interest, for example, midbrain dopaminergic neurons for Parkinson's disease. In the present study, we report the generation of a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line capable of purifying and tracing nascent midbrain dopaminergic progenitors and their differentiated progeny via the expression of a Blue Fluorescent Protein (BFP). This was achieved by CRISPR/Cas9-assisted knock-in of BFP and Cre into the safe harbour locus AAVS1 and an early midbrain dopaminergic lineage marker gene LMX1A, respectively. Immunocytochemical analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing of iPSC-derived neural cultures confirm developmental recapitulation of the human fetal midbrain and high-quality midbrain cells.

    "abstract": "Teleneurology is a specialist field within the realm of telemedicine, which is dedicated to delivering neurological care and consultations through virtual encounters. Teleneurology has been successfully used in acute care (e.g., stroke) and outpatient evaluation for chronic neurological conditions such as epilepsy and headaches. However, for some neurologic entities like Parkinson's disease, in which an in-depth physical examination by palpating muscles and performing neurologic maneuvers is the mainstay of monitoring the effects of medication, the yield and feasibility of a virtual encounter are low. Therefore, in this prospective review, we discuss two promising teleneurology approaches and propose adjustments to enhance the value of virtual encounters by improving the validity of neurological examination: 'hybrid teleneurology', which involves revising the workflow of virtual encounters; and 'artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted teleneurology', namely the use of biosensors and wearables and data processing using AI.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsonian bradykinesia is rated using a composite scale incorporating the slowed frequency of repetitive movements, decrement amplitude and arrhythmicity. Differential localization of these movement components within the basal ganglia will drive the development of more personalized network-targeted symptomatic therapies. In this study, using an optical motion sensor, we evaluated the amplitude and frequency of hand movements during a grasping task with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation 'on' or 'off' in 15 patients with Parkinson's disease. The severity of bradykinesia was assessed blindly using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Part III scale. The volumes of activated tissue of each subject were estimated where changes in amplitude and frequency were mapped to identify distinct anatomical substrates of each component in the subthalamic nucleus. The volumes of activated tissue were used to seed a normative functional connectome to generate connectivity maps associated with amplitude and frequency changes. Deep brain stimulation-induced change in amplitude was negatively correlated with a change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Part III scale for right (",

    "abstract": "Adaptive control has been studied in Parkinson's disease mainly in the context of proactive control and with mixed results. We compared reactive- and proactive control in 30 participants with Parkinson's disease to 30 age matched healthy control participants. The electroencephalographic activity of the participants was recorded over 128 channels while they performed a numerical Stroop task, in which we controlled for confounding stimulus-response learning. We assessed effects of reactive- and proactive control on reaction time-, accuracy- and electroencephalographic time-frequency data. Behavioural results show distinct impairments of proactive- and reactive control in participants with Parkinson's disease, when tested on their usual medication. Compared to healthy control participants, participants with Parkinson's disease were impaired in their ability to adapt cognitive control proactively and were less effective to resolve conflict using reactive control. Successful reactive and proactive control in the healthy control group was accompanied by a reduced conflict effect between congruent and incongruent items in midline-frontal theta power. Our findings provide evidence for a general impairment of proactive control in Parkinson's disease and highlight the importance of controlling for the effects of S-R learning when studying adaptive control. Evidence concerning reactive control was inconclusive, but we found that participants with Parkinson's disease were less effective than healthy control participants in resolving conflict during the reactive control task.",

    "abstract": "Nearly all genetic analyses of Parkinson disease (PD) have been in populations of European ancestry. We sought to test the ability of a machine learning method to extract accurate PD diagnoses from an electronic medical record (EMR) system, to see whether genetic variants identified in European populations generalize to individuals of African and Hispanic ancestries, and to compare the rates of PD across ancestries.\nA machine learning method using natural language processing was applied to EMRs of US veterans participating in the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) to identify individuals with PD. These putative cases were vetted via blind chart review by a movement disorder specialist. A polygenic risk score (PRS) of 90 established genetic variants whose genotypes were imputed from a customized Axiom Biobank Array was evaluated in different case groups.\nThe EMR prediction scores had a distinct trimodal distribution, with 97% of the high group and only 30% of the middle group having a credible diagnosis of PD. Using the 3,542 cases from the high group matched 4:1 to controls, the PRS was highly predictive in individuals of European ancestry (n = 3,137 cases; OR = 1.82; \nMachine learning can reliably classify PD using data from a large EMR. Larger studies of non-European populations are required to confirm the generalizability of PD risk variants identified in populations of European ancestry and the increased risk coming from a higher proportion of European DNA in African Americans.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The treatment of PD aims to alleviate motor symptoms by replacing the reduced endogenous dopamine. Currently, there are no disease-modifying agents for the treatment of PD. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have emerged as an effective tool for new drug discovery and screening in the age of translational research. The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is known to cause a similar loss of dopaminergic neurons in the human midbrain, with corresponding Parkinsonian symptoms. L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) have been implicated in the generation of mitochondrial oxidative stress, which underlies the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, we investigated the neuro-restorative effect of LTCC inhibition in an MPTP-induced zebrafish PD model and suggested a possible drug candidate that might modify the progression of PD.\nAll experiments were conducted using a line of transgenic zebrafish, Tg(dat:EGFP), in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) is expressed in dopaminergic neurons. The experimental groups were exposed to 500 \u03bcmol MPTP from 1 to 3 days post fertilization (dpf). The drug candidates : levodopa 1 mmol, nifedipine 10 \u03bcmol, nimodipine 3.5 \u03bcmol, diethylstilbestrol 0.3 \u03bcmol, luteolin 100 \u03bcmol, and calcitriol 0.25 \u03bcmol were exposed from 3 to 5 dpf. Locomotor activity was assessed by automated tracking and dopaminergic neurons were visualized in vivo by confocal microscopy.\nLevodopa, nimodipine, diethylstilbestrol, and calcitriol had significant positive effects on the restoration of motor behavior, which was damaged by MPTP. Nimodipine and calcitriol have significant positive effects on the restoration of dopaminergic neurons, which were reduced by MPTP. Through locomotor analysis and dopaminergic neuron quantification, we identified the neuro-restorative effects of nimodipine and calcitriol in zebrafish MPTP-induced PD model.\nThe present study identified the neuro-restorative effects of nimodipine and calcitriol in an MPTP-induced zebrafish model of PD. They restored dopaminergic neurons which were damaged due to the effects of MPTP and normalized the locomotor activity. LTCCs have potential pathological roles in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Zebrafish are highly amenable to high-throughput drug screening and might, therefore, be a useful tool to work towards the identification of diseasemodifying treatment for PD. Further studies including zebrafish genetic models to elucidate the mechanism of action of the diseasemodifying candidate by investigating Ca2+ influx and mitochondrial function in dopaminergic neurons, are needed to reveal the pathogenesis of PD and develop disease-modifying treatments for PD.",

    "abstract": "There is a bi-directional communication between the gut, including the microbiota, and the brain through the autonomic nervous system. Accumulating evidence has suggested a bidirectional link between gastrointestinal inflammation and neurodegeneration, in accordance with the concept of the gut-rain axis. An abnormal microbiota-gut-brain interaction contributes to the pathogeny of Parkinson's disease. This supports the hypothesis that Parkinson's disease originates in the gut to spread to the central nervous system, in particular through the vagus nerve. Targeting the gut-to-brain axis with vagus nerve stimulation, fecal microbiota transplantation, gut-selective antibiotics, as well as drugs targeting the leaky gut might be of interest in the management of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Cajanus cajan (L) Millsp (Fabaceae) seed decoction is used by traditional healers in Nigeria as nerve tonic, hence, could be beneficial in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disease that imposes great burden on the healthcare system globally.\nThis study aimed at investigating the neuroprotective effect of ethanol seed extract of Cajanus cajan (CC) in the treatment of rotenone-induced motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms associated with PD.\nTo assess the protective action of CC on rotenone-induced motor- and non-motor symptoms of PD, mice were first pretreated with CC (50, 100 or 200\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) an hour before oral administration of rotenone (1\u00a0mg/kg, p.o, 0.5% in carboxyl-methylcellulose) for 28 consecutive days and weekly behavioural tests including motor assessment (open field test (OFT), rotarod, pole and cylinder tests) and non-motor assessment (novel object recognition (NOR), Y-maze test (YM), forced swim and tail suspension, gastric emptying and intestinal fluid accumulation tests) were carried out. The animals were euthanized on day 28 followed by the collection of brain for assessment of oxidative stress, inflammatory markers and immunohistochemical analysis of the striatum (STR) and substantia nigra (SN). Phytochemicals earlier isolated from CC were docked with protein targets linked with PD pathology such as; catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Leucine rich receptor kinase (LRRK).\nthis study showed that CC significantly reduced rotenone-induced spontaneous motor impairment in OFT, pole, cylinder and rotarod tests in mice as well as significant improvement in non-motor features (significant reversal of rotenone-induced deficits discrimination index and spontaneous alternation behaviour in NORT and YM test, respectively, reduction in immobility time in forced swim/tail suspension test, gastrointestinal disturbance in intestinal transit time in mice. Moreso, rotenone-induced neurodegeneration, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation were significantly attenuated by CC administration. In addition, docking analysis showed significant binding affinity of CC phytochemicals with COMT, TH and LRRK2 receptors.\nCajanus cajan seeds extract prevented both motor and non-motor features of Parkinson disease in mice through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Hence, could be a potential phytotherapeutic adjunct in the management of Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurological illness that causes several motor and non-motor symptoms, most characteristically limb tremors and bradykinesia. PD is a slowly worsening disease that arises due to progressive neurodegeneration of specific areas of the brain, especially the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Even though PD has continuously been linked to a higher mortality risk in numerous epidemiologic studies, there have been significant discoveries regarding the connection between PD and stroke. The incidence of strokes such as cerebral infarction and hemorrhage is substantially associated with the development of PD. Moreover, cognitive impairments, primarily dementia, have been associated with stroke and PD. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this phenomenon is still obscure. This concise review focuses on the relationship between stroke and PD, emphasizing the molecular mechanism of cognition deficit and memory loss evident in PD and stroke. Furthermore, we are also highlighting some potential drug molecules that can target both PD and stroke.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. We downloaded data on Parkinson's disease and Ferroptosis-related genes from the GEO and FerrDb databases. We used WCGAN and Random Forest algorithm to screen out five Parkinson's disease ferroptosis-related hub genes. Two genes were identified for the first time as possibly playing a role in Braak staging progression. Unsupervised clustering analysis based on hub genes yielded ferroptosis isoforms, and immune infiltration analysis indicated that these isoforms are associated with immune cells and may represent different immune patterns. FRHGs scores were obtained to quantify the level of ferroptosis modifications in each individual. In addition, differences in interleukin expression were found between the two ferroptosis subtypes. The biological functions involved in the hub gene are analyzed. The ceRNA regulatory network of hub genes was mapped. The disease classification diagnosis model and risk prediction model were also constructed by applying hub genes based on logistic regression. Multiple external datasets validated the hub gene and classification diagnostic model with some accuracy. This study explored hub genes associated with ferroptosis in Parkinson's disease and their molecular patterns and immune signatures to provide new ideas for finding new targets for intervention and predictive biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a frequent nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), which seriously affects the quality of life of PD patients and exacerbates other nonmotor symptoms. Previous studies have used static analyses of these resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were measured under the assumption that the intrinsic fluctuations during MRI scans are stationary. However, dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis captures time-varying connectivity over short time scales and may reveal complex functional tissues in the brain.\nTo identify dynamic functional connectivity characteristics in PD-EDS patients in order to explain the underlying neuropathological mechanisms.\nBased on rs-fMRI data from 16 PD patients with EDS and 41 PD patients without EDS, we applied the sliding window approach, k-means clustering and independent component analysis to estimate the inherent dynamic connectivity states associated with EDS in PD patients and investigated the differences between groups. Furthermore, to assess the correlations between the altered temporal properties and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) scores.\nWe found four distinct functional connectivity states in PD patients. The patients in the PD-EDS group showed increased fractional time and mean dwell time in state IV, which was characterized by strong connectivity in the sensorimotor (SMN) and visual (VIS) networks, and reduced fractional time in state I, which was characterized by strong positive connectivity intranetwork of the default mode network (DMN) and VIS, while negative connectivity internetwork between the DMN and VIS. Moreover, the ESS scores were positively correlated with fraction time in state IV.\nOur results indicated that the strong connectivity within and between the SMN and VIS was characteristic of EDS in PD patients, which may be a potential marker of pathophysiological features related to EDS in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Intraneuronal inclusions of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-synuclein, \u03b1-syn) are commonly found in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathogenesis of the abundant \u03b1-syn protein in the blood has been extensively studied to understand its properties better. In recent years, peptidome analysis has received increasing attention. In this study, we identified and analyzed serum peptides from wild-type (WT) and the (Thy-1)-h[A30P] alpha-synuclein transgenic mice (SNCA-A30P mice) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). One thousand eight hundred fifty-six peptides from 771 proteins were analyzed. Among them, 151 peptides from 107 proteins were significantly differentially expressed. The glycoprotein VI platelet pathway (GP6) was the pathway's most significant differentially expressed signaling pathway. Cleavage sites of the differentially expressed peptides may reflect protease distribution and activity. We selected the most significantly differentially expressed peptide, VGGDPI, and found that it contained cathepsin K (Ctsk) and trypsin-1 cleavage sites, suggesting that Ctsk and trypsin-1 may be key peptidases in PD. \u03b1-syn is a protein associated with the pathogenesis of PD. mutations in several genes, including SNCA, which encodes \u03b1-syn, are associated with the development of PD. Bioinformatics analysis of the physiological pathways related to SNCA genes and apoptosis genes found the five most markedly up-regulated proteins: formin homology 2 domain-containing 1 (FHOD1), insulin receptor substrate 1(IRS1), TRPM8 channel-associated factor 1 (TCAF1), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and interleukin-16 (IL-16). Therefore, the differentially expressed peptides in the five precursor protein domains may be potential bioactive peptides associated with \u03b1-syn and apoptosis. This study provides a validated peptidomics profile of SNCA-A30P mice and identifies potentially bioactive peptides linked to \u03b1-syn and apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Visual hallucinations are prevalent, potentially disabling symptoms of Parkinson's Disease. Multiple impairments in bottom-up sensory processing and top-down perceptual modulation are implicated in the pathophysiology of these phenomena. In healthy individuals, visual illusions are elicited by illusory figures through parametric manipulations of geometrical configurations, contrast, color, or spatial relationships between stimuli. These illusory percepts provide insight on the physiologic processes subserving conscious and unconscious perception. In this exploratory, cross-sectional, controlled study, perceptual performance on illusory figures was assessed on 11 PD patients with hallucinations, 10 non-hallucinating PD patients, and 10 age-matched healthy individuals. In order to characterize potential neural substrates of perceptual performances, patients' brain metabolic patterns on FDG PET were also analyzed. Illusions relying on attentional modulation and global perception were attenuated in PD patients without hallucinations. This pattern was no longer recognizable in hallucinating patients. Conversely, illusory effects normally counteracted by figure to background segregation and overlapping figures recognition were enhanced in PD patients with hallucinations. FDG PET findings further suggest that perceptual differences between PD patients might be linked to abnormal top-down perceptual modulation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative pathology whose major clinical symptoms are movement disorders. The main pathological characteristics of PD are the selective death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies containing \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) within these neurons. PD is associated with numerous risk factors, including environmental factors, genetic mutations and aging. In many cases, the complex interplay of numerous risk factors leads to the onset of PD. The mutated \u03b1-Syn gene, which expresses pathological\u03b1-Syn protein, can cause PD. Another important feature of PD is neuroinflammation, which is conducive to neuronal death. \u03b1-Syn is able to interact with certain cell types in the brain, including through phagocytosis and degradation of \u03b1-Syn by glial cells, activation of inflammatory pathways by \u03b1-Syn in glial cells, transmission of \u03b1-Syn between glial cells and neurons, and interactions between peripheral immune cells and \u03b1-Syn. In addition to the aforementioned risk factors, PD may also be associated with aging, as the prevalence of PD increases with advancing age. The aging process impairs the cellular clearance mechanism, which leads to chronic inflammation and the accumulation of intracellular \u03b1-Syn, which results in DA neuronal death. In the present review, the age-associated \u03b1-Syn pathogenicity and the interactions between \u03b1-Syn and certain types of cells within the brain are discussed to facilitate understanding of the mechanisms of PD pathogenesis, which may potentially provide insight for the future clinical treatment of PD.",

This study assessed the safety and effectiveness of rasagiline in patients with PD in routine clinical practice in Japan.\nThis multicenter, prospective, observational study (148 sites) enrolled patients (1 November 2018-31 October 2020) with PD. Patients received rasagiline orally 1\u2009mg once daily; maximum observation period was 24\u2009months. The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was evaluated; effectiveness was assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III total score.\nThe safety analysis set comprised 961 patients (mean age, 72.50\u2009years; 53.80% female; mean duration of PD, 6.82\u2009years). Mean treatment duration was 14.74\u2009months, with 42.25% receiving rasagiline for\u2009\u2265\u200919\u2009months; 189 (19.67%) had\u2009\u2265\u20091 ADR. Common ADRs were dyskinesia (4.06%), orthostatic hypotension (2.29%), hallucination (1.87%), visual hallucination, nausea, fall (1.56% each), dizziness (1.35%), and somnolence (1.25%). Mean (standard deviation) UPDRS Part III total score was 28.5 (14.35) at baseline and 25.5 (14.98) at the final assessment.\nNo new concerns in safety and effectiveness regarding rasagiline in Japanese patients with PD were raised.\nClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03727139; Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center Clinical Trials Information: JapicCTI-184181.",

    "abstract": "According to recent research, selective neuronal vulnerability in Parkinson's disease (PD) results from several phenotypic traits, including calcium-dependent, feed-forward control of mitochondrial respiration leading to elevated reactive oxygen species and cytosolic calcium concentration, an extensive axonal arbor, and a reactive neurotransmitter. Therefore, antioxidant therapy is a promising direction in the treatment of PD. In vitro studies have indicated the survival-promoting activity of bacterial melanin (BM) on midbrain dopaminergic neuron cultures. It has been established that BM has a number of protective and anti-inflammatory properties, so there is a high probability of a protective effect of BM in the early stages of PD. In this study, PD was induced through the unilateral intracerebral administration of rotenone followed by bacterial melanin. Tissues (brain, lungs, and small intestine) from the observed groups underwent isolation and purification to extract isoforms of new thermostable superoxide (\u041e",

    "abstract": "Upper-limb bradykinesia occurs early in Parkinson's disease (PD) and bradykinesia is required for diagnosis. Our goal was to develop, implement and validate a game \"walking\" a frog through a maze using bimanual, alternating finger-tapping movements to provide a salient, objective, and remotely monitorable method of tracking disease progression and response to therapy in PD. Twenty-five people with PD and 16 people without PD participated. Responses on 5 different mazes were quantified and compared to spatiotemporal gait parameters and standard disease metrics in these participants. Intertap interval (ITI) on maze 2 & 3, which included turns, was strongly inversely related to stride-length and stride-velocity and directly related to motor UPDRS scores. Levodopa decreased ITI, except in maze 4. PD participants with freezing of gait had longer ITI on all mazes. The responses quantified on maze 2 & 3 were related to disease severity and gait stride-length, were levodopa responsive, and were worse in people with freezing of gait, suggesting that these mazes could be used to quantify motor dysfunction in PD. Programming our frog-in-maze game onto a remotely distributable platform could provide a tool to monitor disease progression and therapeutic response in people with PD, including during clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor symptoms such as gait dysfunction and postural instability. Technological tools to continuously monitor outcomes could capture the hour-by-hour symptom fluctuations of PD. Development of such tools is hampered by the lack of labelled datasets from home settings. To this end, we propose REMAP (REal-world Mobility Activities in Parkinson's disease), a human rater-labelled dataset collected in a home-like setting. It includes people with and without PD doing sit-to-stand transitions and turns in gait. These discrete activities are captured from periods of free-living (unobserved, unstructured) and during clinical assessments. The PD participants withheld their dopaminergic medications for a time (causing increased symptoms), so their activities are labelled as being \"on\" or \"off\" medications. Accelerometry from wrist-worn wearables and skeleton pose video data is included. We present an open dataset, where the data is coarsened to reduce re-identifiability, and a controlled dataset available on application which contains more refined data. A use-case for the data to estimate sit-to-stand speed and duration is illustrated.",

    "abstract": "Mental Flexibility oscillates between adaptive variability in behavior and the capacity to restore homeostasis, linked to mental health. It has recently been one of the most investigated abilities in mental and neurological diseases such as Anorexia nervosa and Parkinson's disease, studied for rigidity or cognitive inflexibility. Patients with anorexia nervosa have rigid cognitive processes about food and weight, which leads to restrictive eating and excessive exercise. People who struggle to adapt their cognitive processes and actions to change their diet and exercise habits may have a harder time recovering from the disorder. On the other hand, research suggests that Parkinson's disease patients may have cognitive flexibility impairments that impair their ability to perform daily tasks and adapt to new environments. Although of clinical interest, mental flexibility lacks theoretical liberalization and unified assessment. This study introduces \"IntellEGO\" a protocol for a new, multidimensional psychometric assessment of flexibility. This assessment evaluates a person's authentic ability to handle daily challenges using cognitive, emotional, and behavioral factors. Since traditional assessments often focus on one domain, we aim to examine flexibility from multiple angles, acknowledging the importance of viewing people as whole beings with mental and physical aspects. The study protocol includes two assessment phases separated by a rehabilitation period. T0, the acute phase upon admission, and T1, the post-rehabilitation phase lasting 15 days for Parkinson's patients and 4 weeks for eating disorder patients, will be assessed. Neuropsychological performance, self-report questionnaires, psychophysiological measures, and neuroendocrine measures will be collected from Anorexia Nervosa and Parkinson's Disease patients during each study phase. The objective of this procedure is to provide clinicians with a comprehensive framework for conducting meticulous assessments of mental flexibility. This framework considers emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors, and is applicable to various patient populations.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for patients with motor symptoms of Parkinson disease but can be complicated by disabling blepharospasm and apraxia of eyelid opening (ALO). Currently, there is no clear consensus on optimal management, and addressing these issues is further hindered by systemic morbidity and resistance to treatments. We aim to describe the different phenotypes of these eyelid movement disorders, to report our management approach and patient responses to treatment.\nA retrospective case series of all patients with blepharospasm/ALO secondary to STN-DBS that were treated at a tertiary center between 2011 and 2020. Data collected included date of Parkinson diagnosis, date of DBS surgery, date of development of blepharospasm/ALO symptoms, STN-DBS stimulation settings, and treatment given. Patients' symptoms before and after treatment were measured using the blepharospasm disability index and Jankovic Rating Scale.\nFive patients were identified with eyelid movement disorders secondary to STN-DBS. All patients had moderate-to-severe symptoms at presentation. Four patients received periocular botulinum toxin injections. Three patients underwent surgery in the form of frontalis suspension or direct brow lift with or without upper lid blepharoplasty. All reported an improvement in symptoms following treatment.\nA multimodality, patient-specific approach is required in the treatment of blepharospasm/ALO secondary to STN-DBS. Botulinum toxin injections can be effective, but patients may require surgery if toxin treatment alone becomes ineffective. Tailoring treatment to individual needs can result in a measurable improvement in symptoms.",

    "abstract": "To date, no study has longitudinally assessed the dose-response association between handgrip strength and incidence of Parkinson's Disease (PD).\nto investigate the longitudinal association between handgrip strength and the development of PD within a representative European population of older adults.\nIndividuals aged 50\u2009years and older from 27 European countries and Israel participated. We retrieved data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe waves 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Handgrip strength was measured using a hand dynamometer and participants reported whether they had a medical PD diagnosis. Time-varying exposure and covariates were modeled using both Cox regression and restricted cubic splines.\nA total of 71\u2009702 participants (mean age 65.2\u2009years) were followed over a median period of 5.0\u2009years. Among them, 314 participants developed PD. In the fully adjusted model, we observed a higher risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.50; 95% CI:1.92-3.32) of PD for participants with lower handgrip strength (third 1) and a lower risk of PD for participants in the second third (HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.06-1.87). In dose-response analyses, men showed lower risk of PD from 27\u2009kg (HR:0.94; 95% CI: 0.91-0.97) to 59\u2009kg (HR:0.10; 95% CI: 0.04-0.22), whereas women showed significant reductions from 24\u2009kg (HR:0.68; 95% CI: 0.46-0.99) to 38\u2009kg (HR:0.44; 95% CI: 0.22-0.88).\nHandgrip strength ought to be incorporated as one of the measures in the prognostic toolbox for the screening of older adults who are possibly at risk of developing PD.",

In the fully adjusted model, we observed a higher risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.50; 95% CI:1.92-3.32) of PD for participants with lower handgrip strength (third 1) and a lower risk of PD for participants in the second third (HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.06-1.87). In dose-response analyses, men showed lower risk of PD from 27\u2009kg (HR:0.94; 95% CI: 0.91-0.97) to 59\u2009kg (HR:0.10; 95% CI: 0.04-0.22), whereas women showed significant reductions from 24\u2009kg (HR:0.68; 95% CI: 0.46-0.99) to 38\u2009kg (HR:0.44; 95% CI: 0.22-0.88).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the common neurodegenerative diseases, and there has been an increasing interest in the potential role of intestinal dysbiosis in its pathogenesis and related gastrointestinal complications such as constipation.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effects of multi-strain probiotics on constipation and motor function in PD patients.\nThis study was a blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) that involved 27 PD patients who were diagnosed with constipation according to the ROME IV criteria for functional constipation. The primary outcome measured before and after the intervention in both the placebo and probiotic groups was the frequency of defecation. Secondary outcomes evaluated were laxative use, sense of complete evacuation, Bristol Stool Scale for consistency, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scale. The study lasted for eight weeks. Both groups also were educated about lifestyle modification.\nOf 30 included patients (15 in each group), 13 were women, and 17 were men. Three patients dropped out of the study. Between-group analysis showed that the frequency of bowel movements significantly increased in the probiotic group 4 [3 - 5] in comparison with 2 [2 - 3] in placebo (P = 0.02). Stool consistency also improved in the probiotic group (P = 0.04). However, there were no significant differences in other outcomes. The within-group analysis showed improvement in stool consistency in both probiotics and placebo groups (P = 0.01 and P = 0.007, respectively), while stool frequency and sense of complete evacuation significantly improved only in the probiotic group (P < 0.05).\nThis study demonstrated that multi-strain probiotics could improve frequency, consistency, and sense of complete evacuation in PD patients, while there was no significant effect on motor functions in 8 weeks. It is suggested that additional studies be conducted on longer-term effects.",

    "abstract": "Faced with the lack of physical activity caused by mandatory home isolation during special periods and patients' inconvenience in carrying out professionally supervised exercise, many home-based exercise programs have been developed. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of home-based exercise on measures of motor symptoms, quality of life and functional performance in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.\nWe performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, and searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane library, and Web of Science from their inception date to April 1, 2023. The quality of the literature was assessed using PEDro's quality scale. The data was pooled using R software. Results are presented as pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI).\nA total of 20 studies involving 1885 PD patients were included. Meta-analysis results showed that home-based exercise had a small effect in relieving overall motor symptoms in PD patients (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.29 [-0.45, -0.13]; P\u2009<\u20090.0001), improving quality of life (SMD\u2009=\u20090.20 [0.08, 0.32]; P\u2009<\u20090.0001), walking speed (SMD\u2009=\u20090.26 [0.05, 0.48]; P\u2009=\u20090.005), balance ability (SMD\u2009=\u20090.23 [0.10, 0.36]; P\u2009<\u20090.0001), finger dexterity (SMD\u2009=\u20090.28 [0.10, 0.46]; P\u2009=\u20090.003) and decreasing fear of falling (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.29 [-0.49, -0.08]; P\u2009=\u20090.001). However, home-based exercise did not significantly relieve the overall motor symptoms of PD patients when the training period was less than 8\u00a0weeks and the total number of sessions was less than 30.\nDuring times of limited physical activity due to pandemics such as COVID-19, home-based exercise is an alternative to maintain and improve motor symptoms in PD patients. In addition, for the minimum dose of home-based exercise, we recommend that the exercise period is no less than 8\u00a0weeks and the total number of sessions is no less than 30 times.\nPROSPERO registration number: CRD42022329780.",

    "abstract": "Misfolding of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) in the brain causes cellular dysfunction, leading to cell death in a group of neurons, and consequently causes the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although many studies have demonstrated the pathological connections between vascular dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases, it remains unclear how neuronal accumulation of \u03b1-Syn affects the structural and functional aspects of the cerebrovasculature to accelerate early disease progression. Here, we demonstrated the effect of aberrant \u03b1-Syn expression on the brain vasculature using a PD mouse model expressing a familial mutant form of human \u03b1-Syn selectively in neuronal cells. We showed that young PD mice have an underdeveloped cerebrovasculature without significant \u03b1-Syn accumulation in the vasculature. During the early phase of PD, toxic \u03b1-Syn was selectively increased in neuronal cells, while endothelial cell proliferation was decreased in the absence of vascular cell death or neuroinflammation. Instead, we observed altered neuronal activation and minor changes in the activity-dependent gene expression in brain endothelial cells (ECs) in young PD mice. These findings demonstrated that neuronal expression of mutant \u03b1-Syn in the early stage of PD induces abnormal neuronal activity and contributes to vascular patterning defects, which could be associated with a reduced angiogenic potential of ECs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive and disabling neurodegenerative disorder. The prevalence of PD has risen considerably over the past decades. A growing body of evidence suggest that exposure to environmental toxins, including pesticides, solvents and heavy metals (collectively called toxins), is at least in part responsible for this rapid growth. It is worrying that the current screening procedures being applied internationally to test for possible neurotoxicity of specific compounds offer inadequate insights into the risk of developing PD in humans. Improved screening procedures are therefore urgently needed. Our review first substantiates current evidence on the relation between exposure to environmental toxins and the risk of developing PD. We subsequently propose to replace the current standard toxin screening by a well-controlled multi-tier toxin screening involving the following steps: in silico studies (tier 1) followed by in vitro tests (tier 2), aiming to prioritize agents with human relevant routes of exposure. More in depth studies can be undertaken in tier 3, with whole-organism (in)vertebrate models. Tier 4 has a dedicated focus on cell loss in the substantia nigra and on the presumed mechanisms of neurotoxicity in rodent models, which are required to confirm or refute the possible neurotoxicity of any individual compound. This improved screening procedure should not only evaluate new pesticides that seek access to the market, but also critically assess all pesticides that are being used today, acknowledging that none of these has ever been proven to be safe from a perspective of PD. Importantly, the improved screening procedures should not just assess the neurotoxic risk of isolated compounds, but should also specifically look at the cumulative risk conveyed by exposure to commonly used combinations of pesticides (cocktails). The worldwide implementation of such an improved screening procedure, would be an essential step for policy makers and governments to recognize PD-related environmental risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Many people with Parkinson's (PwP) are not given the opportunity or do not have adequate access to participate in clinical research. To address this, we have codeveloped with users an online platform that connects PwP to clinical studies in their local area. It enables site staff to communicate with potential participants and aims to increase the participation of the Parkinson's community in research. This protocol outlines the mixed methods study protocol for the usability testing of the platform.\nWe will seek user input to finalise the platform's design, which will then be deployed in a limited launch for beta testing. The beta version will be used as a recruitment tool for up to three studies with multiple UK sites. Usability data will be collected from the three intended user groups: PwP, care partners acting on their behalf and site study coordinators. Usability questionnaires and website analytics will be used to capture user experience quantitatively, and a purposive sample of users will be invited to provide further feedback via semistructured interviews. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics, and a thematic analysis undertaken for interview data. Data from this study will inform future platform iterations.\nEthical approval was obtained from the University of Plymouth (3291; 3 May 2022). We will share our findings via a 'Latest News' section within the platform, presentations, conference meetings and national PwP networks.",

    "abstract": "Pimavanserin is FDA-approved to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) psychosis. We analyzed the effect of pimavanserin on psychosis in the PD dementia (PDD) subgroup from the phase 3 HARMONY trial.\nThis subgroup analysis included PDD patients enrolled in an international, multicenter, randomized discontinuation study of pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis. PDD patients with moderate-to-severe psychosis, age 50-90 years, received pimavanserin 34\u00a0mg/day for 12 weeks (open-label period). Those with a sustained psychosis response to pimavanserin at weeks 8 and 12 were randomized during the double-blind period to continue pimavanserin or receive placebo. Primary efficacy endpoint was time to psychosis relapse as measured by the SAPS-H\u00a0+\u00a0D and CGI-I. Safety was assessed, as were effects on motor symptoms and cognitive abilities using the ESRS-A and MMSE.\n392 patients were enrolled in HARMONY (mean age: 72.6 years; 38.8\u00a0% female): 59 had PDD; 49/59 remained on pimavanserin during the open-label period (safety analysis set), and 36/49 were randomized to pimavanserin (n\u00a0=\u00a016) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a020) in the double-blind phase (intent-to-treat analysis set). Risk of psychosis relapse was lower with pimavanserin 34\u00a0mg compared with placebo in the double-blind phase (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.052; 95\u00a0% CI 0.016-0.166; 1-sided nominal p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). During the open-label period, 46.9\u00a0% experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event; event incidence was similar across arms in the double-blind period. Pimavanserin did not adversely affect motor or cognitive function in either treatment phase.\nPimavanserin significantly reduced risk of psychosis relapse in patients with PDD, was well tolerated, and did not worsen motor or cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often have constipation. It is assumed that a disorder of the regulatory mechanism of colorectal motility by the central nervous system is involved in the constipation, but this remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether central neural pathways can modulate colorectal motility in a rat model of PD. PD model rats were generated by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into a unilateral medial forebrain bundle and destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Colorectal motility was measured in vivo in anesthetized rats. Intraluminal administration of capsaicin, as a noxious stimulus, induced colorectal motility in sham-operated rats but not in PD rats. Intrathecally administered dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT), which mediate the prokinetic effect of capsaicin, at the L6-S1 levels enhanced colorectal motility in PD rats similarly to that in sham-operated rats. In PD rats, capsaicin enhanced colorectal motility only when a GABA",

Most research has focused on the influence of doorway width, and little is known about other doorway characteristics influencing doorway freezing.\nFirstly, to provide guidelines on how to design doorways for people with freezing. Secondly, to compare people with doorway freezing to people without doorway freezing, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of doorway freezing.\nWe designed a web-based, structured survey consisting of two parts. Part I (\nPeople with doorway freezing (69% of Part I) had higher freezing severity, longer disease duration, and scored higher on all sub scores of the G-SAP (indicating heightened motor, attentional, and emotional thoughts when passing through doorways) than people without doorway freezing. The main categories provoking doorway freezing were: dimensions of the door and surroundings, clutter around the door, lighting conditions, and automatic doors.\nWe provide recommendations on how to maximally avoid freezing in a practical setting. Furthermore, we suggest that doorways trigger freezing based on visuomotor, attentional, and emotional processes.",

Key efficacy endpoints included Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and Patient and Clinical Global Impression scores. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded.\nImprovements in efficacy were maintained and dosing frequency and total daily dose remained stable through the trial. A total of 52.7% of patients experienced \u22651 treatment-emergent AE, mostly mild or moderate and occurred within the first 90\u2009days of treatment.\nIn this phase 3 open-label extension, IPX203 exhibited a favorable safety and tolerability profile and sustained efficacy of comparable magnitude to the end of the double-blind study. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

Subthalamic local field potentials (\u03b2 band power), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scales (UPDRS), and a digital timed-up-and-go test (TUG) were measured and compared with real versus sham taVNS during medication-off/DBS-OFF condition.\nThe left taVNS induced a reduction of the total \u03b2 power in the contralateral (ie, right) subthalamic nucleus and an improvement of TUG time, speed, and variability. The taVNS-induced \u03b2 reduction correlated with the improvement of gait speed.

    "abstract": "Inflammasomes in astrocytes have been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cannabinoid Receptor 2(CB2R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is considered a promising therapeutic target in inflammation-related disorders. This study aims to explore the role of CB2R in regulating NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated neuroinflammation in astrocytes.\nIn an in vivo animal model, specific targeting of astrocytic CB2R was achieved by injecting CB2R-specific adenovirus (or fork head box g1(foxg1) adenovirus) to knock down CB2R or administering CB2R agonists, inhibitors, etc., in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of mice. A PD mouse model was established using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induction. Animal behavioral tests, western blot, immunofluorescence, and other experiments were performed to assess the loss of midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons, activation of astrocytes, and activation of the NLRP3 pathway. Primary astrocytes were cultured in vitro, and NLRP3 inflammasomes were activated using 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP\nAstrocytic CB2R knockdown impaired the motor abilities of MPTP-induced mice, exacerbated the loss of TH neurons, and induced activation of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/interleukin 1 (IL-1\u03b2) pathway. Activation of CB2R significantly alleviated motor impairments in mice while reducing NLRP3 deposition on astrocytes. In vitro cell experiments showed that CB2R activation attenuated the activation of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1\u03b2 pathway induced by LPS\u2009+\u2009ATP or MPP\nActivation of CB2R on astrocytes effectively mitigates NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation and ameliorates the disease characteristics of PD in mice. CB2R represents a potential therapeutic target for treating PD.",

    "abstract": "Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is a key pigmentation gene, and loss-of-function of MC1R variants that produce red hair may be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). We previously reported compromised dopaminergic neuron survival in Mc1r mutant mice and dopaminergic neuroprotective effects of local injection of a MC1R agonist to the brain or a systemically administered MC1R agonist with appreciable central nervous system (CNS) permeability. Beyond melanocytes and dopaminergic neurons, MC1R is expressed in other peripheral tissues and cell types, including immune cells. The present study investigates the impact of NDP-MSH, a synthetic melanocortin receptor (MCR) agonist that does not cross BBB, on the immune system and the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in mouse model of PD.\nC57BL/6 mice were treated systemically with MPTP.HCl (20\u00a0mg/kg) and LPS (1\u00a0mg/kg) from day 1 to day 4 and NDP-MSH (400\u00a0\u00b5g/kg) or vehicle from day 1 to day 12 following which the mice were sacrificed. Peripheral and CNS immune cells were phenotyped and inflammatory markers were measured. The nigrostriatal dopaminergic system was assessed behaviorally, chemically, immunologically, and pathologically. To understand the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in this model, CD25 monoclonal antibody was used to deplete CD25\u2009+\u2009Tregs.\nSystemic NDP-MSH administration significantly attenuated striatal dopamine depletion and nigral dopaminergic neuron loss induced by MPTP\u2009+\u2009LPS. It improved the behavioral outcomes in the pole test. Mc1r mutant mice injected with NDP-MSH in the MPTP and LPS paradigm showed no changes in striatal dopamine levels suggesting that the NDP-MSH acts through the MC1R pathway. Although no NDP-MSH was detected in the brain, peripheral, NDP-MSH attenuated neuroinflammation as observed by diminished microglial activation in the nigral region, along with reduced TNF-\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 levels in the ventral midbrain. Depletion of Tregs was associated with diminished neuroprotective effects of NDP-MSH.\nOur study demonstrates that peripherally acting NDP-MSH confers protection on dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons and reduces hyperactivated microglia. NDP-MSH modulates peripheral immune responses, and Tregs may be involved in the neuroprotective effect of NDP-MSH.",

    "abstract": "Visuoperceptual dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and is also reported in its prodromal phase, isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). We aimed to investigate color discrimination ability and complex visual illusions known as pareidolias in patients with iRBD and PD compared to healthy controls, and their associating clinical factors. 46 iRBD, 43 PD, and 64 healthy controls performed the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test and noise pareidolia tests. Any relationship between those two visual functions and associations with prodromal motor and non-motor manifestations were evaluated, including MDS-UPDRS part I to III, Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test, sleep questionnaires, and comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. iRBD and PD patients both performed worse on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test and had greater number of pareidolias compared to healthy controls. No correlations were found between the extent of impaired color discrimination and pareidolia scores in either group. In iRBD patients, pareidolias were associated with frontal executive dysfunction, while impaired color discrimination was associated with visuospatial dysfunction, hyposmia, and higher MDS-UPDRS-III scores. Pareidolias in PD patients correlated with worse global cognition, whereas color discrimination deficits were associated with frontal executive dysfunction. Color discrimination deficits and pareidolias are frequent but does not correlate with each other from prodromal to clinically established stage of PD. The different pattern of clinical associates with the two visual symptoms suggests that evaluation of both color and pareidolias may aid in revealing the course of neurodegeneration in iRBD and PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). While animal studies have supported the benefits of incretin-based therapies, including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, in PD, clinical research has yielded controversial results. This cohort study aimed to assess the relationship between PD incidence and the utilization of DPP4 inhibitor in diabetic patients. Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database from 2009 to 2018, diabetic patients receiving metformin plus at least one second-line oral antidiabetic (OAD) were enrolled. The patients were categorized as DPP4 inhibitor users and non-users. Propensity score matching was employed to establish a 1:1 ratio between DPP4 inhibitor users and non-users. Among the 205,910 patients enrolled, 149 were diagnosed with PD during follow-up. The incidence rate was 0.29 per 1000 person-years for DPP4 inhibitor users and 0.55 per 1000 person-years for the non-users. DPP4 inhibitor users exhibited a significantly lower risk of PD (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI 0.39-0.68). Among DPP4 inhibitor users, vildagliptin showed the strongest correlation with a reduction in the risk of PD. This study demonstrates that the use of DPP4 inhibitors along with metformin in diabetic patients is associated with a lower risk of PD compared to those using other OADs.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology are only partially understood despite intensive research conducted in the field. Recent evidence suggests that early neurodevelopmental defects might play a role in cellular susceptibility to neurodegeneration. To study the early developmental contribution of GBA mutations in PD we used patient-derived iPSCs carrying a heterozygous N370S mutation in the GBA gene. Patient-specific midbrain organoids displayed GBA-PD relevant phenotypes such as reduction of GCase activity, autophagy impairment, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Genome-scale metabolic (GEM) modeling predicted changes in lipid metabolism which were validated with lipidomics analysis, showing significant differences in the lipidome of GBA-PD. In addition, patient-specific midbrain organoids exhibited a decrease in the number and complexity of dopaminergic neurons. This was accompanied by an increase in the neural progenitor population showing signs of oxidative stress-induced damage and premature cellular senescence. These results provide insights into how GBA mutations may lead to neurodevelopmental defects thereby predisposing to PD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, second only to Alzheimer's disease. Drugs and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are the main treatments for PD. However, the long-term side effects of drugs and the risks of surgery cannot be ignored. It is therefore important to research safe and effective complementary and alternative therapies for PD. Yoga, an ancient mind-body exercise, has been widely used in health promotion. Although, yoga can address a range of health problems, little is known about its role in people with PD. This article reviews the evidence that yoga improves PD symptoms, including movement disorders, balance function and emotional disturbance. The authors analyze the role and shortcomings of the yoga intervention process, with the aim of providing a scientific basis for the application of yoga training to people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability (PI) is a common disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), but little is known on its pathophysiological basis.\nIn this study, we aimed to identify the brain structures associated with PI in PD patients, using different MRI approaches.\nWe consecutively enrolled 142 PD patients and 45 control subjects. PI was assessed using the MDS-UPDRS-III pull-test item (PT). A whole-brain regression analysis identified brain areas where grey matter (GM) volume correlated with the PT score in PD patients. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) were also used to compare unsteady (PT\u2009\u2265\u20091) and steady (PT\u2009=\u20090) PD patients. Associations between GM volume in regions of interest (ROI) and several clinical features were then investigated using LASSO regression analysis.\nPI was present in 44.4% of PD patients. The whole-brain approach identified the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) as the only regions associated with the presence of postural instability. VBM analysis\u00a0showed reduced GM volume in fronto-temporal areas (superior, middle, medial and inferior frontal gyrus, and STG) in unsteady compared with steady PD patients, and the\u00a0GM volume of these regions was selectively associated with the PT score and not with any other motor or non-motor symptom.\nThis study demonstrates a significant atrophy of fronto-temporal regions in unsteady PD patients, suggesting that these brain areas may play a role in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying postural instability in PD. This result paves the way for further studies on postural instability in Parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "A history of falls is the most established predictor of future falls in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, predicting a first fall remains challenging.\nTo assess whether experiencing difficulties putting on pants while standing is a viable predictor of future falling, and specifically a first fall, in persons with PD. We define this 'Pants-sign' as people who resort to putting on their pants only while seated.\n264 persons with PD were included. Information on the Pants-sign, history of falls, disease severity (MDS-UPDRS part III), freezing of gait (N-FOGQ\u200a>\u200a0), cognitive function (MoCA), self-reported disability (Schwab & England scale), health-related quality of life (SF-12), Timed-Up-and-Go, and one-legged stance were determined at baseline and after one-year follow-up. The association between the Pants-sign and future falling was examined by univariate logistic regression analysis. A multivariate step-wise logistic regression with forward selection was employed to identify the strongest associations in the entire cohort and a sub-cohort of people without falls in the year prior to baseline.\nThe Pants-sign was univariably associated with a future fall (OR\u200a=\u200a2.406, 95% CI [1.313-4.409], p\u200a=\u200a0.004]), but was not an independent predictor in the multivariate logistic regression; predictors were higher MDS-UPDRS part III scores (OR\u200a=\u200a1.088, 95% CI [1.056-1.121], p\u200a<\u200a0.001] and history of falls (OR\u200a=\u200a5.696, 95% CI [2.650-12.243], p\u22640.001]. For the sub-cohort of people without falls in the previous year (n\u200a=\u200a189), the Pants-sign was not associated with future falls.\nThe Pants-sign is simple to assess and is associated with future falling in PD but is not an independent predictor.",

    "abstract": "Motor complications (MCs) compromise therapy in many patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease. By achieving more physiologic stimulation of dopamine-receptors, the continuous dopamine stimulation hypothesis suggests that longer-acting levodopa formulations may improve outcome. The aim of this study was to compare the duration until onset of MCs and motor disease progression in patients during their treatment initiation with either an immediate (IR) or a combined rapid- and sustained-release (i.e. dual-release; DR) levodopa formulation.\nUsing a sample of 69 patients, we applied time-varying survival regression analyses and linear mixed effect models to analyze the data. The latter involved preprocessing of the data to temporally align the response and predictors, including analyzing the extent of visit irregularity and potential predictors of visit intensity.\nThis retrospective study suggests that levodopa-benserazide DR is not superior to levodopa-benserazide IR in affecting duration until MCs and disease progression. Conversely, using DR levodopa-benserazide, similar disease progression was achieved with lower and more constant doses.\nThe effects of DR levodopa-benserazide might not be strong enough to delay onset of MCs. The development of more powerful levodopa formulations remains a pressing clinical need.",

    "abstract": "The neural correlates that help us understand the challenges that Parkinson's patients face when negotiating their environment remain under-researched. This deficit in knowledge reflects the methodological constraints of traditional neuroimaging techniques, which include the need to remain still. As a result, much of our understanding of motor disorders is still based on animal models. Daily life challenges such as tripping and falling over obstacles represent one of the main causes of hospitalization for individuals with Parkinson's disease. Here, we report the neural correlates of naturalistic ambulatory obstacle avoidance in Parkinson's disease patients using mobile EEG. We examined 14 medicated patients with Parkinson's disease and 17 neurotypical control participants. Brain activity was recorded while participants walked freely, and while they walked and adjusted their gait to step over expected obstacles (preset adjustment) or unexpected obstacles (online adjustment) displayed on the floor. EEG analysis revealed attenuated cortical activity in Parkinson's patients compared to neurotypical participants in theta (4-7\u2005Hz) and beta (13-35\u2005Hz) frequency bands. The theta power increase when planning an online adjustment to step over unexpected obstacles was reduced in Parkinson's patients compared to neurotypical participants, indicating impaired proactive cognitive control of walking that updates the online action plan when unexpected changes occur in the environment. Impaired action planning processes were further evident in Parkinson's disease patients' diminished beta power suppression when preparing motor adaptation to step over obstacles, regardless of the expectation manipulation, compared to when walking freely. In addition, deficits in reactive control mechanisms in Parkinson's disease compared to neurotypical participants were evident from an attenuated beta rebound signal after crossing an obstacle. Reduced modulation in the theta frequency band in the resetting phase across conditions also suggests a deficit in the evaluation of action outcomes in Parkinson's disease. Taken together, the neural markers of cognitive control of walking observed in Parkinson's disease reveal a pervasive deficit of motor-cognitive control, involving impairments in the proactive and reactive strategies used to avoid obstacles while walking. As such, this study identified neural markers of the motor deficits in Parkinson's disease and revealed patients' difficulties in adapting movements both before and after avoiding obstacles in their path.",

    "abstract": "Subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs), defined as cognitive decline reported by subjects or their informants, are common in the early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have shown a significant association between SCCs and non-motor features as well as objective cognitive decline in PD patients. However, the discrepancy in SCC prevalence and SCC-related factors between patients with early PD and those with advanced PD remains poorly understood. We recruited a total of 114 and 69 early PD patients and advanced PD patients, respectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for early PD and advanced PD patients. The prevalence of SCCs in the early PD and advanced PD groups was 60.5 and 68.1%, respectively. In the early PD group, the presence of SCCs in early PD participants was significantly associated with a higher nonmotor symptoms questionnaire (NMSQ) score (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.00-1.10, ",

The study aimed determine whether the iron deposition in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is correlated with freezing of gait (FOG).\nWe retrospectively collected the data of 24 patients with PD from the Movement Disorders Program and 36 healthy controls (HCs) from January 2021 to December 2021. Clinical assessments included mental intelligence scales, Parkinson rating scales, motor-related scales, and clinical gait assessments. All exercise scales and gait assessments were performed in the \"ON\" and \"OFF\" states. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected using 3-dimensional fast low-angle shot sequences. We chose the bilateral red nucleus, substantia nigra, thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidus as regions of interest for QSM analysis.\nThe iron deposition in the substantia nigra of the PD group was significantly higher than that of the HC group (P<0.01). In the PD group, the iron deposition in the substantia nigra of patients with FOG was significantly higher than that in patients without FOG (P=0.04). The iron deposition in the substantia nigra was positively correlated with the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (P=0.03). The scores for depression and anxiety of the PD group were significantly higher than those of the HC group, while the Berg balance scale score was significantly lower (P<0.01).\nThe iron deposition in the substantia nigra of patients with PD is increased compared with that of controls and is associated with FOG. QSM can be used to detect brain iron deposition in patients with PD, which would help to explore the mechanism of abnormal neurobiological activity in FOG.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder with prodromal and highly prevalent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, especially constipation. Although PD models suggest gut-brain axis dysfunction, the mechanistic underpinnings and their correlation with GI symptoms are poorly understood.\nTo examine the bidirectional gut-brain axis function in PD and correlate it with constipation severity, PD duration, and severity.\nRectal sensory thresholds and afferent cortical evoked potentials (CEP) were assessed using a 4-ring EMG electrode probe. Efferent anal and rectal motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were obtained following transcranial and lumbosacral magnetic stimulation. Bowel symptoms were assessed by prospective stool diary. The CEP and MEP latencies, rectal sensory thresholds, and anorectal sensorimotor data were compared between PD subjects and age-adjusted healthy subjects.\nTwenty-five PD subjects with constipation (F/M\u2009=\u20096/19) and 20 healthy subjects (F/M\u2009=\u200914/6) were enrolled. The first and pain sensation thresholds were higher in PD subjects than healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.002) but lost significance after adjustment for age. Age-adjusted rectal CEP and right-sided cortico-anal MEP latencies were prolonged in PD subjects compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.04). Also, half (4 of 8) age-adjusted spino-anal and rectal MEP latencies in PD subjects were significantly longer. In multivariate linear analysis, first rectal sensation and right-sided MEP latencies showed moderate correlation with constipation severity.\nParkinson's disease is associated with significant bidirectional gut-brain axis dysfunction as evidenced by prolonged afferent and efferent neuronal signaling. Constipation severity in PD is correlated to abnormal rectal sensation and lateralized disturbance of efferent brain-gut signaling.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the complex neurodegenerative disorders, primarily characterized by motor deficits, including bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. The underlying pathophysiology involves the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia circuitry. While motor symptoms are hallmark features of PD, emerging research highlights a wide range of non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairments, mood disturbances, and autonomic dysfunctions. Inflammasome activation is pivotal in inducing neuroinflammation and promoting disease onset, progression, and severity of PD. Several studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) modulate inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulation of lncRNAs is linked to aberrant gene expression and cellular processes in neurodegeneration, causing the activation of inflammasomes that contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Inflammasomes are cytosolic proteins that form complexes upon activation, inducing inflammation and neuronal cell death. This review explores the significance of lncRNAs in regulating inflammasomes in PD, primarily focusing on specific lncRNAs such as nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEATNEAT1), X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5), and HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), which have been shown to activate or inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome and induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, some lncRNAs mediate inflammasome activation through miRNA interactions. Understanding the roles of lncRNAs in inflammasome regulation provides new therapeutic targets for controlling neuroinflammation and reducing the progression of neurodegeneration. Identifying lncRNA-mediated regulatory pathways paves the way for novel therapies in the battle against these devastating neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and appearance of protein aggregates (Lewy bodies) consisting predominantly of \u03b1-synuclein in neurons. PD is currently recognized as a multisystem disorder characterized by severe motor impairments and various non-motor symptoms. Cognitive decline is one of the most common and worrisome non-motor symptoms. Moderate cognitive impairments (CI) are diagnosed already at the early stages of PD, usually transform into dementia. The main types of CI in PD include executive dysfunction, attention and memory decline, visuospatial impairments, and verbal deficits. According to the published data, the following mechanisms play an essential role demonstrates a crucial importance in the decline of the motor and cognitive functions in PD: (1) changes in the conformational structure of transsynaptic proteins and protein aggregation in presynapses; (2) synaptic transmission impairment; (3) neuroinflammation (pathological activation of the neuroglia); (4) mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress; (5) metabolic disorders (hypometabolism of glucose, dysfunction of glycolipid metabolism; and (6) functional rearrangement of neuronal networks. These changes can lead to the death of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra and affect the functioning of other neurotransmitter systems, thus disturbing neuronal networks involved in the transmission of information related to the regulation of motor activity and cognitive functions. Identification of factors causing detrimental changes in PD and methods for their elimination will help in the development of new approaches to the therapy of PD. The goal of this review was to analyze pathological processes that take place in the brain and underlie the onset of cognitive disorders in PD, as well as to describe the impairments of cognitive functions in this disease.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a serious nonmotor symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Currently, there are few studies investigating the relationship of serum markers and retinal structural changes with cognitive function in PD.\nTo investigate the relationship between retinal structural changes, serum high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) levels and cognitive function and motor symptoms in PD patients.\nEighty-nine participants, including 47 PD patients and 42 healthy subjects, were enrolled. PD patients were divided into Parkinson's disease with normal cognitive (PD-NC), Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) groups. The motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD patients were evaluated with clinical scale. Serum HMGB1 levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer complex (GCIPL) thickness changes in the macula were quantitatively analyzed by swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) in all patients.\nCompared with the control group, the macular GCIPL (t\u00a0=\u00a0-2.308, P\u00a0=\u00a00.023) was thinner and serum HMGB1 (z\u00a0=\u00a0-2.285, P\u00a0=\u00a00.022) was increased in PD patients. Macular GCIPL thickness in patients with PD-MCI and PDD were significantly lower than that in PD-NC patients, but there were no significant difference between the PD-MCI and PDD groups. Serum HMGB1 levels in patients with PD-MCI and PDD were significantly higher than those in PD-NC patients, and serum HMGB1 levels in PDD patients were higher than those in PD-MCI patients. Correlation analysis showed that serum HMGB1 levels in PD patients were positively correlated with disease duration, HY stage, UPDRS-I score, UPDRS-III score, and UPDRS total score and negatively correlated with MOCA score. Macular GCIPL thickness was negatively correlated with HY stage and positively correlated with MOCA score, and macular GCIPL thickness was negatively correlated with serum HMGB1 level. Logistic regression analysis showed that elevated serum HMGB1 level, thinner macular GCIPL thickness, and higher HY stage were independent risk factors for Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment (PD-CI). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the serum HMGB1 level and macular GCIPL thickness-based diagnosis of PD-MCI, PDD and PD-CI based on in patients with PD were 0.786 and 0.825, 0.915 and 0.856, 0.852 and 0.841, respectively. The AUC for the diagnosis of PD-MCI, PDD and PD-CI with serum HMGB1 level and GCIPL thickness combined were 0.869, 0.967 and 0.916, respectively.\nThe macular GCIPL thickness and serum HMGB1 level are potential markers of cognitive impairment in PD patients, and their combination can significantly improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of cognitive impairment in PD.",

    "abstract": "Early-onset Parkinson's Disease (EOPD) demands tailored treatments. The younger age of patients might account for a higher sensitivity to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) based non-invasive neuromodulation, which may raise as an integrative therapy in the field. Accordingly, here we\u00a0assessed the safety and efficacy of the primary left motor cortex (M1) anodal tDCS in EOPD. Ten idiopathic EOPD patients received tDCS at 2.0\u00a0mA per 20\u00a0min for 10\u00a0days within a crossover, double-blind, sham-controlled pilot study. The outcome was evaluated by measuring changes in MDS-UPDRS part III, Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), PD-cognitive rating scale, and PD Quality of Life Questionnaire-39 scores. We showed that\u00a0anodal but not sham tDCS significantly reduced the NMSS total and \"item 2\" (sleep/fatigue) scores. Other parameters were not modified. No adverse events occurred. M1 anodal tDCS might thus\u00a0evoke plasticity changes in cortical-subcortical circuits involved in non-motor functions, supporting the value as a therapeutic option in EOPD.",

    "abstract": "Dyskinesias are non preventable abnormal involuntary movements that represent the main challenge of the long term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with the gold standard dopamine precursor levodopa. Applying machine learning techniques on the data extracted from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI, Michael J. Fox Foundation), this study was aimed to identify PD patients who are at high risk of developing dyskinesias. Data regarding clinical, behavioral and neurological features from 697 PD patients were included in our study. Our results show that the Random Forest was the classifier with the best and most consistent performance, reaching an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of up to 91.8% with only seven features. Information regarding the severity of the symptoms, the semantic verbal fluency, and the levodopa treatment were the most important for the prediction, and were further used to create a Decision Tree, whose rules may guide the pharmacological management of PD symptoms. Our results contribute to the identification of PD patients who are prone to develop dyskinesia, and may be considered in future clinical trials aiming at developing new therapeutic approaches for PD.",

    "abstract": "Pain is often neglected in Parkinson's disease (PD), although it impacts most PD patients. While the mechanism of pain in PD is still being studied, various pharmacological, interventional, and alternative treatment options have been offered for pain relief. Safinamide, a recently approved drug for PD, has shown promising results in improving pain in patients with PD. Several clinical studies report changes in pain scores in PD patients treated with safinamide, but these have not been systematically summarized. Therefore, our main goal was to perform a systematic review and statistical analysis of relevant studies.\nA systematic search of studies was conducted using four databases: Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The nine included randomized controlled trials did not provide sufficient data for a meta-analysis; therefore, we conducted a qualitative systematic review.\nOur results suggest that safinamide at a daily dose of 100mg is more effective for treating PD pain than that of 50mg. Moreover, the reduction in fluctuation-related pain and pain from edema was more consistent when treated with safinamide compared to other PD pain types. We also attempted to suggest a mechanism of action for safinamide on pain processing in the brain, which should be explored in more detail in future studies.\nClinical evidence suggests that safinamide may be particularly beneficial for PD patients experiencing fluctuation-related pain and pain from edema, as these subtypes of pain showed greater improvement compared to other types of pain. Based on the findings of the included studies, safinamide appears to relieve the overall pain burden. However, the lack of sufficient data for conducting a meta-analysis highlights the need for future studies to report mean pain scores and their standard deviations.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the presence of Lewy bodies (LBs) or Lewy neurites (LNs) which consist of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) and a complex mix of other biomolecules. Mitochondrial dysfunction is widely believed to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of PD and other related neurodegenerative diseases. But mitochondrial dysfunction is subject to complex genetic regulation. There is increasing evidence that PD-related genes directly or indirectly affect mitochondrial integrity. Therefore, targeted regulation of mitochondrial function has great clinical application prospects in the treatment of PD. However, lots of PD drugs targeting mitochondria have been developed but their clinical therapeutic effects are not ideal. This review aims to reveal the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases based on the mitochondrial structure and function, which may highlight potential interventions and therapeutic targets for the development of PD drugs to recover mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we explored the regulatory role of microRNA miR-101-3p on the zinc finger protein 746 (ZNF746), also known as PARIS, which is implicated in both sporadic and familial forms of Parkinson's disease. In a Parkinson's disease cell model, utilizing SH-SY5Y cells treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+), we observed that miR-101-3p was downregulated, while ZNF746 was upregulated. To investigate the direct impact of miR-101-3p on ZNF746, our team conducted overexpression experiments, successfully reversing ZNF746's expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, as confirmed through quantitative PCR and western blotting. We also performed luciferase assays, providing compelling evidence that ZNF746 is a direct target of miR-101-3p. Additionally, we noted that miR-101-3p overexpression resulted in increased expression of PGC1\u03b1, a gene targeted by ZNF746. Functionally, we assessed the implications of miR-101-3p overexpression through MTS assays and flow cytometry, revealing significant promotion of cell viability, inhibition of ROS production, and reduced apoptosis in the Parkinson's disease cell model. In conclusion, this study highlights the role of miR-101-3p in regulating ZNF746 expression and suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease. These findings provide valuable molecular insights that could pave the way for innovative treatment strategies in combating this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.",

Prohibitin-2 (PHB2) is a newly discovered autophagy receptor in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and its role in Parkinson's disease remains unclear. Protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is a factor that regulates cell fate during endoplasmic reticulum stress. Parkin is regulated by PERK and is a target of the unfolded protein response. It is unclear whether PERK regulates PHB2-mediated mitophagy through Parkin. In this study, we established a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We used adeno-associated virus to knockdown PHB2 expression. Our results showed that loss of dopaminergic neurons and motor deficits were aggravated in the MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Overexpression of PHB2 inhibited these abnormalities. We also established a 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+)-induced SH-SY5Y cell model of Parkinson's disease. We found that overexpression of Parkin increased co-localization of PHB2 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, and promoted mitophagy. In addition, MPP+ regulated Parkin involvement in PHB2-mediated mitophagy through phosphorylation of PERK. These findings suggest that PHB2 participates in the development of Parkinson's disease by interacting with endoplasmic reticulum stress and Parkin.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease can affect not only motor functions but also cognitive abilities, leading to cognitive impairment. One common issue in Parkinson's disease with cognitive dysfunction is the difficulty in executive functioning. Executive functions help us plan, organize, and control our actions based on our goals. The brain area responsible for executive functions is called the prefrontal cortex. It acts as the command center for the brain, especially when it comes to regulating executive functions. The role of the prefrontal cortex in cognitive processes is influenced by a chemical messenger called dopamine. However, little is known about how dopamine affects the cognitive functions of patients with Parkinson's disease. In this article, the authors review the latest research on this topic. They start by looking at how the dopaminergic system, is altered in Parkinson's disease with executive dysfunction. Then, they explore how these changes in dopamine impact the synaptic structure, electrical activity, and connection components of the prefrontal cortex. The authors also summarize the relationship between Parkinson's disease and dopamine-related cognitive issues. This information may offer valuable insights and directions for further research and improvement in the clinical treatment of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The motor impairments brought on by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra are the most well-known symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is believed that dopaminergic neurons are especially vulnerable to mitochondrial malfunction. For the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, selective autophagic removal of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy primarily regulated by PINK1/Parkin pathway is essential. Moreover, newer studies also implicate the role of phospholipid metabolism, such as that of Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) as a contributor to PD. S1P receptors have been reported to influence mitochondrial function in neurodegenerative diseases. Fingolimod (FTY720), an S1P receptor-1 modulator has been proven effective in PD but its regulation of mitophagy in PD is still elusive. In this study, the neuroprotective effect of FTY720 by modulating mitophagy, has been explored against rotenone (ROT) induced neurotoxicity in in-vivo. The animals were randomly divided into 5 groups namely, Normal Control (NC); Disease control (DC): ROT (1.5\u00a0mg/kg); Low dose (LD): ROT\u00a0+\u00a0FTY720 (0.5\u00a0mg/kg); High dose (HD): ROT\u00a0+\u00a0FTY720 (1\u00a0mg/kg) and Vehicle control (VC): 1\u00a0% DMSO. ROT was administered through i.p. and FTY720 through p.o. for 21\u00a0days. At the end of the study, various neurobehavioral studies (rotarod test and actimeter), western blot techniques, and immunofluorescence studies were performed. FTY720 restored the neurobehavioural functions and protein expression of PINK1, Parkin and BNIP3 in ROT-induced PD mice. The results obtained in our study suggest that FTY720 has a neuroprotective effect in ROT-induced mice model of PD via PINK1-Parkin mediated mitophagy.",

    "abstract": "Fyn kinase is an Src family kinase (SFK) widely expressed in many tissues, including the CNS. Recently, Fyn kinase activation has been associated with pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases and, as such, the role of Fyn dysfunction is under investigation. In particular, Fyn is implicated as a major upstream regulator of neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Chronic neuroinflammation has been observed not just in the substantia nigra (SN), but also in several key regions of the brain, with disruption associated with symptoms presentation in PD. This study aimed to characterise the anatomical distribution of Fyn in key brain regions affected in PD, namely the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and SN.\nFresh and fixed post-mortem PD brain samples (n\u00a0=\u00a010) were collected and compared with neurologically healthy age-matched controls (n\u00a0=\u00a07) to assess markers of Fyn activity and neuroinflammation.\nIncreased Fyn phosphorylation was observed in SN and striatum of post-mortem samples from PD patients compared with controls. No such increase was observed in the prefrontal cortex or hippocampus. In contrast with previous findings, no increase in microglial activation or astrocyte reactivity was observed in PD brains across regions.\nTaken together, these results indicate that Fyn dysfunction may be involved in the pathological processes observed in PD; however, this appears to be independent of inflammatory mechanisms. Further investigations are required to elucidate if increased Fyn activity is a potential cause or consequence of pathological processing in PD.",

Participants had the following assessments at baseline and after completion of the programme: Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III, timed up-and-go (TUG), 10-m walk test (10mWT), 6-min walking test (6MWT), balance tests, fine motor skills, 7-day Parkinson KinetiGraph (PKG) and PDQ-39 QoL scale.\nSeventeen individuals completed the programme. Significant improvements were observed in MDS-UPDRS motor score (P =\u20090.019, d =\u20090.68, MCID 7); 6MWT distance (P <\u20090.001, d =\u20091.16); walking time during motor or cognitive dual tasking (P =\u20090.006, d =\u20090.77; P =\u20090.005, d =\u20090.79, respectively); and the PDQ-39 emotional well-being subdomain (P =\u20090.009; MCID 4.2); as well as improvements trending to significance in bradykinesia (P =\u20090.025, d =\u20090.73), 10mWT walking time (P =\u20090.023, d\u2009=\u20090.61) and borderline improvement in balance (P =\u20090.056, d =\u20090.50).\nThe outcomes of this study support the efficacy of the PDW programme in individuals with early PD and provide justification for future trials and investigation of its effects.",

    "abstract": "To examine the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the pull test in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using the extracted pull force.\nIn this inter- and intra-rater reliability study, two raters performed a pull test on 30 patients with PD. The pull force was quantified using inertial sensors attached to the rater's right hand and the patient's lower trunk. In this study, the pull force was calculated as an extracted three-dimensional vector quantity, the resultant acceleration, and was expressed in m/s2. Inter- and intra-rater reliabilities were analyzed using the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the pull force and Cohen's weighted kappa (\u03baw) for the pull test score. Furthermore, Bland-Altman analysis was used to investigate systematic errors.\nThe inter- and intra-rater reliability of the pull force was very poor (ICC = 0.033-0.214). Bland-Altman analysis revealed no systematic errors in the pull forces between the two test points. Conversely, \u03baw for the pull test scores ranged from 0.763 to 0.920, indicating substantial to almost perfect agreement.\nThe pull test score was reliable despite variations in the quantified pull force for inter- and intra-rater reliability. Our findings suggest that the pull test is a robust tool for evaluating postural instability in patients with PD and that the pull force probably does not affect scoring performance.",

    "results": "The inter- and intra-rater reliability of the pull force was very poor (ICC = 0.033-0.214). Bland-Altman analysis revealed no systematic errors in the pull forces between the two test points. Conversely, \u03baw for the pull test scores ranged from 0.763 to 0.920, indicating substantial to almost perfect agreement.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. The typical symptomatology of PD includes motor symptoms; however, a range of nonmotor symptoms, such as intestinal issues, usually occur before the motor symptoms. Various microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract can profoundly influence the physiopathology of the central nervous system through neurological, endocrine, and immune system pathways involved in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In addition, extensive evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is strongly associated with PD. This review summarizes the latest findings on microbial changes in PD and their clinical relevance, describes the underlying mechanisms through which intestinal bacteria may mediate PD, and discusses the correlations between gut microbes and anti-PD drugs. In addition, this review outlines the status of research on microbial therapies for PD and the future directions of PD-gut microbiota research.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbial proteolytic metabolism has been reportedly altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the circulating aromatic amino acids (AAA) described in PD are inconsistent. Here we aimed to investigate plasma AAA profiles in a large cohort of PD patients, and examine their correlations with clinical severity and gut microbiota changes. We enrolled 500 participants including 250 PD patients and 250 neurologically normal controls. Plasma metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Faecal samples were newly collected from 154 PD patients for microbiota shotgun metagenomic sequencing combined with data derived from 96 PD patients reported before. Data were collected regarding diet, medications, and motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Compared to controls, PD patients had higher plasma AAA levels, including phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), p-cresol sulfate (Pcs), p-cresol glucuronide (Pcg), and indoxyl sulfate (IS). Multivariable linear regression analyses, with adjustment for age, sex, and medications, revealed that the plasma levels of PAGln (coefficient 4.49, 95% CI 0.40-8.58, P\u2009=\u20090.032) and Pcg (coefficient 1.79, 95% CI 0.07-3.52, P\u2009=\u20090.042) positively correlated with motor symptom severity but not cognitive function. After correcting for abovementioned potential confounders, these AAA metabolites were also associated with the occurrence of constipation in PD patients (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, plasma levels of AAA metabolites were correlated with the abundance of specific gut microbiota species, including Bacteroides sp. CF01-10NS, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Clostridium sp. AF50-3. In conclusion, elevated plasma AAA metabolite levels correlated with disease characteristics in PD, suggesting that upregulated proteolytic metabolism may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonists (AARAs) are used in the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy. Some AARAs, such as terazosin, stimulate glycolysis and increase cellular adenosine triphosphate levels through activation of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), which has been suggested to be of therapeutic benefit in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nThis study aimed to determine whether exposure to PGK1-activating AARAs was associated with slower PD progression.\nNational Veterans Affairs administrative data were used to identify patients who initiated PD-related pharmacotherapy during 2000 to 2019 and were concurrently prescribed an AARA. Using a retrospective cohort design, the count of incident PD-related outcome events within 1 year of follow-up was contrasted between patients prescribed a PGK1-activating AARA versus tamsulosin (an AARA without PKG1 stimulation), using multivariable negative binomial regression. PD-related outcome events were identified using ICD codes indicating motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms, and other potential complications as clinical markers for the progression of PD.\nA total of 127,142 patients initiated drug therapy for PD during the observation period, of whom 24,539 concurrently received an AARA. Incident PD-related events were observed significantly less often in patients receiving a PGK1 AARA (n\u00a0= 14,571) than tamsulosin (n\u00a0= 9968) (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.80 [95% CI 0.77-0.83]). These results remained significant after adjustment for confounding factors (IRR 0.85 [95% CI 0.81-0.88]) and in sensitivity analyses.\nPatients prescribed a PGK1-activating AARA experienced fewer PD-related outcome events than patients prescribed tamsulosin. These results may indicate a role for terazosin and other PGK1 activators in slowing disease progression of PD; however, randomized controlled trials are needed.",

    "abstract": "Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is a potential risk factor for neurodegenerative disease development; however, its role in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between PPI use and PD risk. A total of 31,326 patients with newly diagnosed PD were matches by age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, and hypertension with 125,304 controls at a ratio of 1:4. The data were collected from the Korean National Health Insurance Services Database from January 2010 to December 2019. Cumulative defined daily doses of PPIs were extracted from treatment claims. We examined the association between PPI use and PD risk using conditional logistic regression. To prevent protopathic bias, we excluded patients diagnosed with PD within a 1-year lag period after PPI exposure. We applied 2- and 3-year lag periods for sensitivity analysis. PPI use was associated with an increased risk of PD when a 1-year lag period was applied between PPI exposure and PD development (adjusted odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.13). A significant positive dose-response relationship existed between the cumulative defined daily doses of PPIs and PD development (P<0.001). Similar results were obtained for the 2- or 3-year lag periods. The association did not vary based on gender. Older age, a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score, no alcohol consumption, and a non-smoking status were associated with a significantly increased PD risk with PPI use. We observed an association between PPI use and PD risk, although long-term follow-up studies are necessary to verify this association.",

    "abstract": "A number of peptide incretin receptor agonists (IRAs) show promise as therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is one way for IRAs to act directly within the brain. To determine which IRAs are high priority candidates for treating these disorders, we have studied their brain uptake pharmacokinetics.\nWe quantitatively measure the ability of four IRAs to cross the BBB. We injected adult male CD-1 mice intravenously with \nAlbiglutide and dulaglutide had the fastest brain uptake rates within 1 hour. DA5-CH appears to enter the brain rapidly, reaching equilibrium quickly. Tirzepatide does not appear to cross the BBB within 1\u2009h after iv injection but like albumin, did so slowly over 6\u2009h, presumably via the extracellular pathways.\nWe find that IRAs can cross the BBB by two separate processes; one that is fast and one that is slow. Three of the four IRAs investigated here have fast rates of transport and should be taken into consideration for testing as AD and PD therapeutics as they would have the ability to act quickly and directly on the brain as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the most widely used device-assisted therapy in patients with moderately advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) experiencing motor complications. Only a minority of eligible patients get the opportunity to undergo DBS in the developing world.\nTo examine the proportion and characteristics of patients with motor complications of PD who are willing for DBS and who undergo surgery.\nPatients with motor complications of PD eligible for DBS over a five-year study period (2016-2020) were included. The demographic, clinical and socio-economic characteristics and information on their status in 2021 were collected and analyzed.\nAmong 1017 patients, 223 had motor symptoms qualifying for DBS and follow-up information available. Only 78 (35%) opted for surgery. The willing patients had higher socioeconomic status, were older and had longer duration of PD and motor complications, more freezing of gait, cognitive symptoms, and neuropsychiatric disturbances. 37 of them were found unfit during pre-operative work-up; only 41 (18%) with motor complications were finally taken up for DBS. Age, duration or severity of motor symptoms did not differ between patients who were finally selected for surgery and those who were not.\nLess than one-fifth of our patients with motor complications of PD finally underwent DBS. The patients appeared to wait till the late stages of PD, before making a decision on availing surgical treatment. The delay resulted in nearly half of them being found unfit in pre-operative work-up. Our findings may enable clinicians to counsel eligible patients more efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Decrements in verbal fluency following deep brain stimulation (DBS) in people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) are common. As such, verbal fluency tasks are used in assessing DBS candidacy and target selection. However, the correspondence between testing performance and the patient's perception of communication abilities is not well-established.\nThe Communication Participation Item Bank (CPIB) was administered to 85 PwP during pre-DBS neuropsychological evaluations. Central tendencies for CPIB responses and correlations between CPIB total scores, clinical and demographic factors, and language-based tasks were examined.\nMost PwP indicated some degree of communication interference on the CPIB. Worse scores on semantic fluency and greater motor impairment were associated with more communication interference.\nOur findings suggest an incomplete correspondence between commonly used language-based tests and patient-reported outcomes of communication abilities. The need for a functional communication instrument that reflects the different aspects of communication abilities in functional contexts is emphasized.",

    "abstract": "Co-occurrence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been observed. However, there is limited knowledge on how family history of AD is associated with PD.\nTo prospectively examine the associations of family history of AD/dementia and polygenic risk score for AD (AD-PRS) with PD risk.\nThe study included 477,190 participants from UK Biobank who were free of PD at baseline (2006-2010) and had complete data on the studied exposure variables, family history of AD and AD-PRS. Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of family history of AD/dementia and AD-PRS for PD risk. We also conducted mediation analysis to examine the proportion of the association between family history of AD/dementia and PD risk that could be mediated by AD-PRS.\nDuring a median follow-up of 12.5\u2009years, we identified 2550 incidences of PD. Family history of AD/dementia (adjusted HR\u2009=\u20091.21; 95% CI 1.09-1.35) and AD-PRS (adjusted HR\u2009=\u20091.10 per 1 unit increment; 95% CI 1.05-1.14) were associated with PD risk, after adjustment for age, sex, lifestyle factors, and other potential confounders. The association between family history of AD/dementia and PD risk was mediated by 13.1% by the AD-PRS. As expected, we observed significant associations of family history of AD/dementia and AD-PRS with risks of dementia and AD (\nFamily history of AD/dementia appeared to be associated with PD risk, and this association could be mediated partially by AD-related genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is proposed as an early diagnostic marker in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the frequency of RBD during the progression of PD in the advanced stages and identified potential risk factors for developing RBD earlier or later.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis and determined the frequency of RBD in all PD in-patients (Hoehn and Yahr stages \u22653) with motor fluctuations who had undergone video-polysomnography (vPSG) for a sleep complaint or daytime sleepiness. To correct for selection bias, we analyzed the prevalence of RBD in PD patients from the DeNoPa cohort. PD patients with RBD were compared with PD without RBD. To identify potential risk factors, we performed multiple regression modeling.\nA total of 504 PD patients had vPSG. 37 were excluded due to missing REM or artifacts during REM. RBD was present in 406/467 (86.9%) PD patients. PD\u2009+\u2009RBD patients were older than PDnonRBD (69\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7 vs. 64\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2\u2009years, \nThe prevalence of RBD in patients with advanced PD is high and increases with disease severity, motor deficits, postural instability, orthostatic symptoms, and age. This suggests RBD is a progression marker of PD in patients with sleep complaints.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disease with limited treatment options. Animal models and a proof-of-concept case series have suggested that photobiomodulation may be an effective adjunct treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The aim was to determine the safety and feasibility of transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) to reduce the motor signs of Parkinson's disease.\nIn this double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled feasibility trial, patients (aged 59-85 years) with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were treated with a tPBM helmet for 12 weeks (72 treatments with either active or sham therapy; stage 1). Treatment was delivered in the participants' homes, monitored by internet video conferencing (Zoom). Stage 1 was followed by 12 weeks of no treatment for those on active therapy (active-to-no-treatment group), and 12 weeks of active treatment for those on sham (sham-to-active group), for participants who chose to continue (stage 2). The active helmet device delivered red and infrared light to the head for 24\u00a0min, 6 days per week. The primary endpoints were safety and motor signs, as assessed by a modified Movement Disorders Society revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (MDS-UPDRS-III)-motor scale. This trial is registered with ANZCTR, ACTRN\u00a012621001722886.\nBetween Dec 6, 2021, and Aug 12, 2022, 20 participants were randomly allocated to each of the two groups (10 females plus 10 males per group). All participants in the active group and 18 in the sham group completed 12 weeks of treatment. 14 participants in the sham group chose to continue to active treatment and 12 completed the full 12 weeks of active treatment. Treatment was well tolerated and feasible to deliver, with only minor, temporary adverse events. Of the nine suspected adverse events that were identified, two minor reactions may have been attributable to the device in the sham-to-active group during the active treatment weeks of the trial. One participant experienced temporary leg weakness. A second participant reported decreased fine motor function in the right hand. Both participants continued the trial. The mean modified MDS-UPDRS-III scores for the sham-to-active group at baseline, after 12 weeks of sham treatment, and after 12 weeks of active treatment were 26.8 (sd 14.6), 20.4 (sd 12.8), and 12.2 (sd 8.9), respectively, and for the active-to-no-treatment group these values were 21.3 (sd 9.4), 16.5 (sd 9.4), and 15.3 (sd 10.8), respectively. There was no significant difference between groups at any assessment point. The mean difference between groups at baseline was 5.5 (95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0-2.4 to 13.4), after stage 1 was 3.9 (95% CI\u00a0-3.5 to 11.3 and after stage 2 was\u00a0-3.1 (95% CI 2.7 to\u00a0-10.6).\nOur findings add to the evidence base to suggest that tPBM is a safe, tolerable, and feasible non-pharmaceutical adjunct therapy for Parkinson's disease. While future work is needed our results lay the foundations for an adequately powered randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial.\nSYMBYX Pty Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Over the past three decades, deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) has been applied in a continuous open loop fashion, unresponsive to changes in a given patient's state or symptoms over the course of a day. Advances in recent neurostimulator technology enable the possibility for closed loop adaptive DBS (aDBS) for PD as a treatment option in the near future in which stimulation adjusts in a demand-based manner. Although aDBS offers great clinical potential for treatment of motor symptoms, it also brings with it the need for better understanding how to implement it in order to maximize its benefits. In this perspective, we outline considerations for programing several key parameters for aDBS based on our experience across several aDBS-capable research neurostimulators. At its core, aDBS hinges on successful identification of relevant biomarkers that can be measured reliably in real-time working in cohesion with a control policy that governs stimulation adaption. However, auxiliary parameters such as the window in which stimulation is allowed to adapt, as well as the rate it changes, can be just as impactful on performance and vary depending on the control policy and patient. A standardize protocol for programming aDBS will be crucial to ensuring its effective application in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The cardinal clinical features of Parkinson's disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disease, include the irreversible impairment of movement coordination, such as tremors, gait rigidity, bradykinesia, and hypokinesia. Although various factors are associated with the pathological changes in PD, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation, the availability of treatments to retard PD progression is limited. Therefore, novel biomarkers for PD diagnosis and therapeutic targets are urgently needed. The diagnosis of PD mainly depends on its clinical manifestations and has an error rate of approximately 20%.

    "abstract": "LRRK2-G2019S is one of the most common Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated mutations and has been shown to alter microglial functionality. However, the impact of LRRK2-G2019S on transcriptional profile of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia-like cells (iMGLs) and how it corresponds to microglia in idiopathic PD brain is not known. Here we demonstrate that LRRK2-G2019S carrying iMGL recapitulate aspects of the transcriptional signature of human idiopathic PD midbrain microglia. LRRK2-G2019S induced subtle and donor-dependent alterations in iMGL mitochondrial respiration, phagocytosis and cytokine secretion. Investigation of microglial transcriptional state in the midbrains of PD patients revealed a subset of microglia with a transcriptional overlap between the in vitro PD-iMGL and human midbrain PD microglia. We conclude that LRRK2-G2019S iMGL serve as a model to study PD-related effects in human microglia.",

    "abstract": "Retinal thickness is related to Parkinson's disease (PD), but its association with the severity of PD is still unclear. We conducted a Mendelian randomized (MR) study to explore the association between retinal thickness and PD. For the two-sample MR analysis, the summary statistics obtained from genome-wide association studies on the thickness of Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) were employed as exposure, while the summary statistics associated with PD were used as the outcome. The primary approach utilized was inverse variance weighted. To correct for multiple testing, the false discovery rate (FDR) was employed. For sensitivity analysis, an array of robust MR methods was utilized. We found genetically predicted significant association between reduced RNFL thickness and a reduced risk of constipation in PD (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20090.854, 95% confidence interval [CI] (0.782, 0.933), P\u2009<\u20090.001, FDR-corrected P\u2009=\u20090.018). Genetically predicted reduced RNFL thickness was associated with a reduced Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale total score (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.042, 95% CI (-0.079, 0.005), P\u2009=\u20090.025), and reduced GCIPL thickness was associated with a lower risk of constipation (OR\u2009=\u20090.901, 95% CI (0.821, 0.988), P\u2009=\u20090.027) but a higher risk of depression (OR\u2009=\u20091.103, 95% CI (1.016, 1.198), P\u2009=\u20090.020), insomnia (OR\u2009=\u20091.090, 95% CI (1.013, 1.172), P\u2009=\u20090.021), and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) (OR\u2009=\u20091.198, 95% CI (1.061, 1.352), P\u2009=\u20090.003). In conclusion, we identify an association between retinal thickness and non-motor symptoms (constipation, depression, insomnia and RBD) in PD, highlighting the potential of retinal thickness as a biomarker for PD nonmotor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregation and immune activation represent hallmark pathological events in Parkinson's disease (PD). The PD-associated immune response encompasses both brain and peripheral immune cells, although little is known about the immune proteins relevant for such a response. We propose that the upregulation of CD163 observed in blood monocytes and in the responsive microglia in PD patients is a protective mechanism in the disease. To investigate this, we used the PD model based on intrastriatal injections of murine \u03b1-syn pre-formed fibrils in CD163 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type littermates. CD163KO females revealed an impaired and differential early immune response to \u03b1-syn pathology as revealed by immunohistochemical and transcriptomic analysis. After 6 months, CD163KO females showed an exacerbated immune response and \u03b1-syn pathology, which ultimately led to dopaminergic neurodegeneration of greater magnitude. These findings support a sex-dimorphic neuroprotective role for CD163 during \u03b1-syn-induced neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a new type of cell death accompanied by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, is implicated in the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that primarily occurred in the elderly population. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the major polyphenol in green tea with known neuroprotective effects in PD patients. But whether EGCG-mediated neuroprotection against PD involves regulation of ferroptosis has not been elucidated. In this study, we established a PD model using PINK1 mutant Drosophila. Iron accumulation, lipid peroxidation and decreased activity of GPX, were detected in the brains of PD flies. Additionally, phenotypes of PD, including behavioral defects and dopaminergic neurons loss, were ameliorated by ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Notably, the increased iron level, lipid peroxidation and decreased GPX activity in the brains of PD flies were relieved by EGCG. We found that EGCG exerted neuroprotection mainly by restoring iron homeostasis in the PD flies. EGCG inhibited iron influx by suppressing Malvolio (Mvl) expression and simultaneously promoted the upregulation of ferritin, the intracellular iron storage protein, leading to a reduction in free iron ions. Additionally, EGCG downregulated the expression of Duox and Nox, two NADPH oxidases that produce reactive\u00a0oxygen\u00a0species (ROS) and increased SOD enzyme activity. Finally, modulation of intracellular iron levels or regulation of oxidative stress by genetic means exerted great influence on PD phenotypes. As such, the results demonstrated that ferroptosis has a role in the established PD model. Altogether, EGCG has therapeutic potentials for treating PD by targeting the ferroptosis pathway, providing new strategies for the prevention and treatment of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common trait of Parkinson's disease (PD), often associated with early motor deficits, eventually evolving to PD with dementia in later disease stages. The neuropathological substrate of MCI is poorly understood, which weakens the development and administration of proper therapies. In an \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn)-based model of PD featuring early motor and cognitive impairments, we investigated the transcriptome profile of brain regions involved in PD with cognitive deficits, via a transcriptomic analysis based on RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. Rats infused in the substantia nigra with human \u03b1-synuclein oligomers (H-SynOs) developed mild cognitive deficits after three months, as measured by the two-trial recognition test in a Y-maze and the novel object recognition test. RNA-seq analysis showed that 17,436 genes were expressed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and 17,216 genes in the hippocampus (HC). In the ACC, 51 genes were differentially expressed between vehicle and H-\u03b1SynOs treated samples, which showed N=\u00a021 upregulated and N\u00a0=\u00a030 downregulated genes. In the HC, 104 genes were differentially expressed, the majority of them not overlapping with DEGs in the ACC, with N\u00a0=\u00a041 upregulated and N\u00a0=\u00a063 downregulated in H-\u03b1SynOs-treated samples. The Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, followed by the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network inspection of DEGs, revealed that in the ACC most enriched terms were related with immune functions, specifically with antigen processing/presentation via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and phagocytosis via CD68, supporting a role for dysregulated immune responses in early PD cognitive dysfunction. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the decreased expression of CD68 within microglial cells. In contrast, the most significantly enriched terms in the HC were mainly involved in mitochondrial homeostasis, potassium voltage-gated channel, cytoskeleton and fiber organisation, suggesting that the gene expression in the neuronal population was mostly affected in this region in early disease stages. Altogether results show that H-\u03b1SynOs trigger a region-specific dysregulation of gene expression in ACC and HC, providing a pathological substrate for MCI associated with early PD.",

    "abstract": "Neural activity is finely tuned to produce normal behaviors, and disruptions in activity likely occur early in the course of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, how neural activity is altered, and how these changes influence neurodegeneration is poorly understood. Here, we focus on evidence that the activity of dopamine neurons is altered in Parkinson's disease (PD), either as a compensatory response to degeneration or as a result of circuit dynamics or pathologic proteins, based on available human data and studies in animal models of PD. We then discuss how this abnormal activity may augment other neurotoxic phenomena in PD, including mitochondrial deficits, protein aggregation and spread, dopamine toxicity, and excitotoxicity. A more complete picture of how activity is altered and the resulting effects on dopaminergic neuron health and function may inform future therapeutic interventions to target and protect dopamine neurons from degeneration.",

    "abstract": "While communication changes associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been documented, research on the impact of these changes on family members is just beginning to emerge. With this new focus on family, questions arise as to how well speech-language pathology services address their needs communicating with their loved one with PD. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of family members of people with PD (PwPD) and their recommendations for speech-language pathology services that incorporated their needs.\nSeventeen spouses/partners of PwPD participated in focus groups that were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analyses.\nThree themes emerged, all focusing around the central tenet that the experiences of family members, and hence their need for speech-language pathology support, transitioned through the stages of PD progression. Theme 1 summarized increasing burdens on family to manage communication as PD progressed beyond a brief period of independent strategy use by PwPD. Theme 2 highlighted multifactorial contributors to communication burdens on families, with cognitive impairments being the most underrecognized. Theme 3 illustrated how families wanted more intervention options from speech-language pathologists (SLPs) that included them, but with a tailored approach for PD stages and personal preferences.\nWhen SLPs provide families with either generic communication strategies or strategies that do not fit the individualized needs of PwPD and their families, we may inadvertently be increasing the burden on families. There is a need for systematic, evidence-based, family-centered interventions that include, but go beyond, current speech-focused interventions to meet the shared communication needs of PwPD and their families.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that the Parkinson's VPS35[D620N] mutation alters the expression of ~220 lysosomal proteins and stimulates recruitment and phosphorylation of Rab proteins at the lysosome. This recruits the phospho-Rab effector protein RILPL1 to the lysosome where it binds to the lysosomal integral membrane protein TMEM55B. We identify highly conserved regions of RILPL1 and TMEM55B that interact and design mutations that block binding. In mouse fibroblasts, brain, and lung, we demonstrate that the VPS35[D620N] mutation reduces RILPL1 levels, in a manner reversed by LRRK2 inhibition and proteasome inhibitors. Knockout of RILPL1 enhances phosphorylation of Rab substrates, and knockout of TMEM55B increases RILPL1 levels. The lysosomotropic agent LLOMe also induced LRRK2 kinase-mediated association of RILPL1 to the lysosome, but to a lower extent than the D620N mutation. Our study uncovers a pathway through which dysfunctional lysosomes resulting from the VPS35[D620N] mutation recruit and activate LRRK2 on the lysosomal surface, driving assembly of the RILPL1-TMEM55B complex.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are defined as the slow loss of a group of neurons that are particularly sensitive. Due to the intricate pathophysiological processes underlying neurodegeneration, no cure exists for these conditions despite the extensive research and advances in our knowledge of the onset and course of NDs. Hence, there is a medical need for the creation of a novel therapeutic approach for NDs. By focusing on numerous signaling pathways, some natural substances derived from medicinal herbs and foods have demonstrated potent activity in treating various NDs. In this context, flavonoids have recently attracted increased popularity and research attention because of their alleged beneficial effects on health. By acting as antioxidant substances, nutritional supplements made up of flavonoids have been found to lessen the extent of NDs like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Luteolin is a flavone that possesses potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As a consequence, luteolin has emerged as an option for treatment with therapeutic effects on many brain disorders. More research has focused on luteolin's diverse biological targets as well as diverse signaling pathways, implying its potential medicinal properties in several NDs. This review emphasizes the possible use of luteolin as a drug of choice for the treatment as well as the management of AD and PD. In addition, this review recommends that further research should be carried out on luteolin as a potential treatment for AD and PD alongside a focus on mechanisms and clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Opicapone (OPC) is a third-generation, selective peripheral COMT inhibitor that improves peripheral L-DOPA bioavailability and reduces OFF time and end-of-dose motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.\nIn this study, we objectively assessed the effects of adding OPC to L-DOPA on bradykinesia in PD through kinematic analysis of finger movements.\nWe enrolled 20 treated patients with PD and motor fluctuations. Patients underwent two experimental sessions (L-DOPA, L-DOPA\u2009+\u2009OPC), separated by at least 1\u00a0week. In each session, patients were clinically evaluated and underwent kinematic movement analysis of repetitive finger movements at four time points: (i) before their usual morning dose of L-DOPA (T0), (ii) 30\u00a0min (T1), (iii) 1\u00a0h and 30\u00a0min (T2), and (iv) 3\u00a0h and 30\u00a0min after the L-DOPA intake (T3).\nMovement velocity and amplitude of finger movements were higher in PD patients during the session with OPC compared to the session without OPC at all the time points tested. Importantly, the variability of finger movement velocity and amplitude across T0-T3 was significantly lower in the L-DOPA\u2009+\u2009OPC than L-DOPA session.\nThis study is the first objective assessment of the effects of adding OPC to L-DOPA on bradykinesia in patients with PD and motor fluctuations. OPC, in addition to the standard dopaminergic therapy, leads to significant improvements in bradykinesia during clinically relevant periods associated with peripheral L-DOPA dynamics, i.e., the OFF state in the morning, delayed-ON, and wearing-OFF periods.",

In a large case-control PD cohort, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative iron-neuromelanin MRI parameters from the substantia nigra (SN), their radiological utility, and clinical association.\nPD patients and age-matched controls were prospectively recruited for motor assessment and midbrain neuromelanin- and iron-sensitive [quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and susceptibility map-weighted imaging (SMWI)] MRI. Quantitative neuromelanin-iron parameters from the SN were assessed for their discriminatory performance in PD classification using ROC analysis compared to those of qualitative visual classification by radiological readers of differential experience and used to predict motor severity.\nIn total, 191 subjects (80 PD, mean age 65.0 years; 111 controls, 65.6) were included.

    "abstract": "With advancements in imaging and microelectrode recording techniques, general anesthesia (GA) has emerged as an alternative option for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients undergoing subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). In this study, we compared the advantages and disadvantages of using GA and local anesthesia for STN-DBS in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS).\nSurgical outcomes of STN-DBS were evaluated using the unified PD rating scales (UPDRS). CT and magnetic resonance imaging scans are used to evaluate intracranial conditions. State-trait anxiety inventory and hospital anxiety and depression scale are used to evaluate patients' perioperative psychology.\nAnesthesia method does not significantly impact the accuracy of microelectrode placement or the improvement of postoperative symptoms. However, the local anesthesia group had a higher incidence of intracranial air, as well as higher rates of postoperative complications such as headache, dizziness, vomiting, and delirium. GA effectively alleviated preoperative anxiety and resulted in lower levels of perioperative anxiety and psychological stress compared to local anesthesia. Additionally, the GA group had shorter surgery duration, earlier ambulation, and a shorter average hospital stay.\nDBS under GA is safe and effective. Due to shorter surgical duration, reduced occurrence of perioperative complications, effective reduction of preoperative anxiety, and faster postoperative recovery, DBS under GA is better aligned with the concept of ERAS.",

    "abstract": "The origins of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) involve genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, neurotoxin exposure\u00a0and gut microbiota dysregulation. The gut microbiota's dynamic composition and its metabolites influence intestinal and blood-brain barrier integrity, contributing to AD and PD development. This review explores protein misfolding, aggregation\u00a0and epigenetic links in AD and PD pathogenesis. It also highlights the role of a leaky gut and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in promoting these diseases through inflammation-induced epigenetic alterations. In addition, we investigate the potential of diet, probiotics\u00a0and microbiota transplantation for preventing and treating AD and PD via\u00a0epigenetic modifications, along with a discussion related to current challenges and future considerations. These approaches offer promise for translating research findings into practical clinical applications.\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are\u00a0the two most common age-related brain diseases. The incidence of AD is almost 20% in individuals over the age of 80\u00a0years, and the incidence of PD is 1\u20134% in individuals over the age of 60\u00a0years. Research scientists are studying various links among key factors\u00a0involved in AD and PD pathogenesis, including diet, gut microbiota (communal bacteria living in our gut), neuroinflammation, epigenetic modifications (regulation of\u00a0gene\u00a0expression that is affected by environmental factors) and genetic changes to obtain greater insights into the mechanisms of disease development to design better therapeutics for these disabling diseases. The discovery of these relationships will provide opportunities to maintain favorable health via\u00a0diet\u2013microbiota\u2013epigenetic modifications, since diet and surrounding environments play crucial roles in gut microbial alterations. Here, we discuss the interactions between destructive protein misfolding/aggregation in AD and PD, with neuroinflammation and epigenetic alterations that\u00a0all are affected by nutrition, microbiota dysbiosis (imbalance), leaky gut (gut\u2013blood barrier disruption) and internal or environmental toxins. We also present thought-provoking discussions and ideas about recent preventive/therapeutic approaches like special diets, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation and even specific antibiotics for preventing or improving neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD and PD.",

    "abstract": "Impaired brain energy metabolism has been observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). In both diseases, mitochondrial dysfunction and energetic impairment can lead to neuronal dysfunction and death. CNM-Au8\u00ae is a suspension of faceted, clean-surfaced gold nanocrystals that catalytically improves energetic metabolism in CNS cells, supporting neuroprotection and remyelination as demonstrated in multiple independent preclinical models. The objective of the Phase 2 REPAIR-MS and REPAIR-PD clinical trials was to investigate the effects of CNM-Au8, administered orally once daily for twelve or more weeks, on brain phosphorous-containing energy metabolite levels in participants with diagnoses of relapsing MS or idiopathic PD, respectively.\nBrain metabolites were measured using 7-Tesla \nOur results demonstrate brain target engagement of CNM-Au8 as a direct modulator of brain energy metabolism, and support the further investigation of CNM-Au8 as a potential disease modifying drug for PD and MS.",

    "abstract": "Human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) cell transplantation is a promising therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we present the derivation of high-purity mDA progenitors from clinical-grade hESCs on a large scale under rigorous good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions. We also assessed the toxicity, biodistribution, and tumorigenicity of these cells in immunodeficient rats in good laboratory practice (GLP)-compliant facilities. Various doses of mDA progenitors were transplanted into hemi-parkinsonian rats, and a significant dose-dependent behavioral improvement was observed with a minimal effective dose range of 5,000-10,000 mDA progenitor cells. These results provided insights into determining a low cell dosage (3.15 million cells) for human clinical trials. Based on these results, approval for a phase 1/2a clinical trial for PD cell therapy was obtained from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in Korea, and a clinical trial for treating patients with PD has commenced.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) transcription factor activates cytoprotective and metabolic gene expression in response to various electrophilic stressors. Constitutive NRF2 activity promotes cancer progression, whereas decreased NRF2 function contributes to neurodegenerative diseases. We used proximity proteomic analysis to define protein networks for NRF2 and its family members NRF1, NRF3, and the NRF2 heterodimer MAFG. A functional screen of co-complexed proteins revealed previously uncharacterized regulators of NRF2 transcriptional activity. We found that ZNF746 (also known as PARIS), a zinc finger transcription factor implicated in Parkinson's disease, physically associated with NRF2 and MAFG, resulting in suppression of NRF2-driven transcription. ZNF746 overexpression increased oxidative stress and apoptosis in a neuronal cell model of Parkinson's disease, phenotypes that were reversed by chemical and genetic hyperactivation of NRF2. This study presents a functionally annotated proximity network for NRF2 and suggests a link between ZNF746 overexpression in Parkinson's disease and inhibition of NRF2-driven neuroprotection.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by exaggerated beta activity (13-35\u00a0Hz) in cortico-basal ganglia motor loops. Beta activity includes both periodic fluctuations (i.e. oscillatory activity) and aperiodic fluctuations reflecting spiking activity and excitation/inhibition balance (i.e. non-oscillatory activity). However, the relative contribution, dopamine dependency and clinical correlations of oscillatory vs. non-oscillatory beta activity remain unclear. We recorded, modelled and analysed subthalamic local field potentials in parkinsonian patients at rest while off or on medication. Autoregressive modelling with additive 1/f noise clarified the relationships between measures of beta activity in the time domain (i.e. amplitude and duration of beta bursts) or in the frequency domain (i.e. power and sharpness of the spectral peak) and oscillatory vs. non-oscillatory activity: burst duration and spectral sharpness are specifically sensitive to oscillatory activity, whereas burst amplitude and spectral power are ambiguously sensitive to both oscillatory and non-oscillatory activity. Our experimental data confirmed the model predictions and assumptions. We subsequently analysed the effect of levodopa, obtaining strong-to-extreme Bayesian evidence that oscillatory beta activity is reduced in patients on vs. off medication, with moderate evidence for absence of modulation of the non-oscillatory component. Finally, specifically the oscillatory component of beta activity correlated with the rate of motor progression of the disease. Methodologically, these results provide an integrative understanding of beta-based biomarkers relevant for adaptive deep brain stimulation. Biologically, they suggest that primarily the oscillatory component of subthalamic beta activity is dopamine dependent and may play a role not only in the pathophysiology but also in the progression of Parkinson's disease. KEY POINTS: Beta\u00a0activity in Parkinson's disease includes both true periodic fluctuations (i.e. oscillatory activity) and aperiodic fluctuations\u00a0reflecting spiking activity and synaptic balance (i.e. non-oscillatory activity). The\u00a0relative contribution, dopamine dependency and clinical correlations of oscillatory vs.\u00a0non-oscillatory beta activity remain unclear. Burst\u00a0duration and spectral sharpness are specifically sensitive to oscillatory\u00a0activity, while burst amplitude and spectral power are ambiguously sensitive to\u00a0both oscillatory and non-oscillatory activity. Only the\u00a0oscillatory component of subthalamic beta activity is dopamine-dependent. Stronger beta oscillatory activity correlates with faster motor progression of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disease identified by multiple symptoms, and levodopa is one of the most effective medications for treating the disease. To determine the dosage of levodopa, it is necessary to meet on a regular basis and observe motor function. The early detection and progression of the disease have been proposed using hypokinetic dysarthria. However, previous studies have not examined the effects of levodopa on speech rigorously and have provided inconsistent results. In this study, three sustained phonemes of PD patients were investigated for the effect of medication. A set of features characterizing vocal fold dynamics as well as the vocal tract coordinators were extracted from the sustained phonemes /of 28 PD patients during levodopa medication off and on states. All the features were statistically investigated and classified using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. LDA classifier identified medication on from medication off based on the combined features from phoneme /a/, /o/ and /m/ with the accuracy=82.75% and F1-score=82.18%. Voice recording of PD patients during sustained phonemes /a/, /o/ and /m/ has the potential for identifying whether the patients are in On state or Off state of medication.Clinical Relevance- The outcomes of this study have the potential to monitor the effect and progress of levodopa on PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Physical therapy is strongly recommended for patients with neurological disorders. Tai Chi-based treatments seem to improve physical functions like gait speed and balance. However, assessments after treatment rely on semi-quantitative clinical scales affected by subjectivity with controversial results. This study aims at investigating whether Tai Chi could be a valid alternative to traditional physiotherapy rehabilitation. We propose a wearable system composed of two inertial devices able to objectively measure the effect of the rehabilitation treatment on the range of movement of the trunk. Seventeen patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) were recruited and assessed. They have been randomly divided into two groups: group 1 followed a Tai Chi-based treatment, while group 2 underwent a traditional physiotherapy rehabilitation. The two groups have been assessed before (t0) and after the treatment (t1). No statistical differences have been found in the relative range of motion between the upper and lower sensors between the two groups at the baseline. Both treatments resulted in a significant improvement in the trunk range of movement (on the right side). Notably, the improvement in the effect size of the treatment was greater in group 1 than in group 2. In fact, even if both the groups benefited from their treatment group 1 gained larger mobility of the trunk if compared to group 2. Interestingly, no differences have been accounted adopting the traditional UPDRS III for motor symptoms of PD, strengthening the idea that objective measurement coming from wearable biomedical sensors could detect information otherwise neglected by traditional clinical tools.Clinical Relevance- This study preliminary confirms that beneficial motor effects after a Tai Chi rehabilitation program are comparable and quite better than after traditional physiotherapy, promoting Tai Chi as a valid alternative treatment for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state EEG (rs-EEG) has been demonstrated to aid in Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis. In particular, the power spectral density (PSD) of low-frequency bands (\u03b4 and \u03b8) and high-frequency bands (\u03b1 and \u03b2) has been shown to be significantly different in patients with PD as compared to subjects without PD (non-PD). However, rs-EEG feature extraction and the interpretation thereof can be time-intensive and prone to examiner variability. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to automatize the analysis of rs-EEG recordings and provides a supportive tool for clinicians to ease their workload. In this work, we use rs-EEG recordings of 84 PD and 85 non-PD subjects pooled from four datasets obtained at different centers. We propose an end-to-end pipeline consisting of preprocessing, extraction of PSD features from clinically-validated frequency bands, and feature selection. Following, we assess the classification ability of the features via ML algorithms to stratify between PD and non-PD subjects. Further, we evaluate the effect of feature harmonization, given the multi-center nature of the datasets. Our validation results show, on average, an improvement in PD detection ability (69.6% vs. 75.5% accuracy) by logistic regression when harmonizing the features and performing univariate feature selection (k = 202 features). Our final results show an average global accuracy of 72.2% with balanced accuracy results for all the centers included in the study: 60.6%, 68.7%, 77.7%, and 82.2%, respectively.Clinical relevance- We present an end-to-end pipeline to extract clinically relevant features from rs-EEG recordings that can facilitate the analysis and detection of PD. Further, we provide an ML system that shows a good performance in detecting PD, even in the presence of centers with different acquisition protocols. Our results show the relevance of harmonizing features and provide a good starting point for future studies focusing on rs-EEG analysis and multi-center data.",

    "abstract": "Elevated \u03b2 oscillations (13-35 Hz) are characteristic pathophysiology in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Cortical thinning has also been reported in the disease, however the relationship between these biomarkers of PD has not been established. By comparing electrophysiological measurements with cortical thickness, this study aims to reveal the pathoetiology of disease and symptoms in PD. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intraoperative local field potentials (LFPs) were collected from 34 subjects diagnosed with PD. Cortical surfaces were reconstructed from the images, and cortical thickness was extracted from the subregions where the recording electrode was placed in M1. LFPs were preprocessed and cleaned using a semiautomatic artifact detection algorithm, then power spectral densities (PSD) were computed and periodic and aperiodic frequency components were calculated. Nonparametric Spearman rank correlations assessed the relationship between electrophysiological components (i.e. center frequency (CF), power, bandwidth, 1/f exponent, knee), with cortical thickness. According to the CF of each subject's PSD, the cohort was split into two sub-groups: low-\u03b2 peak (13-20 Hz) and high-\u03b2 peak (20-35 Hz) groups. There was a significant negative correlation between power and cortical thickness only in the high-\u03b2 subgroup (r=-0.48, p(corrected)=0.049). This relationship remained significant when correcting for age (r=-0.52,p=0.015), indicating that the effect of age on cortical thinning was not the determining factor. We did not find significant differences between UPDRS-III motor symptom scores for the low-and high-\u03b2 subgroups. Of note is the dominance of high-\u03b2 oscillatory power and its relationship with cortical thickness. As suggested by the literature, increased high-\u03b2 activity during movement may be exaggerated in PD. These findings suggest that the characteristic cortical thinning in PD causes variation in electrical activity, leading to elevated high-\u03b2 activity.Clinical relevance- This multimodal study provides additional insights on the pathophysiology and its relevance with morphology of Parkinson's Disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects over 10 million people worldwide. Brain atrophy and microstructural abnormalities tend to be more subtle in PD than in other age-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, so there is interest in how well machine learning methods can detect PD in radiological scans. Deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can automatically distil diagnostically useful features from raw MRI scans, but most CNN-based deep learning models have only been tested on T1-weighted brain MRI. Here we examine the added value of diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) - a variant of MRI, sensitive to microstructural tissue properties - as an additional input in CNN-based models for PD classification. Our evaluations used data from 3 separate cohorts - from Chang Gung University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the PPMI dataset. We trained CNNs on various combinations of these cohorts to find the best predictive model. Although tests on more diverse data are warranted, deep-learned models from dMRI show promise for PD classification.Clinical Relevance- This study supports the use of diffusion-weighted images as an alternative to anatomical images for AI-based detection of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Objective and quantitative monitoring of movement impairments is crucial for detecting progression in neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). This study examined the ability of deep learning approaches to grade motor impairment severity in a modified version of the Movement Disorders Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) using low-cost wearable sensors. A convolutional neural network architecture, XceptionTime, was used to classify lower and higher levels of motor impairment in persons with PD, across five distinct rhythmic tasks: finger tapping, hand movements, pronation-supination movements of the hands, toe tapping, and leg agility. In addition, an aggregate model was trained on data from all tasks together for evaluating bradykinesia symptom severity in PD. The model performance was highest in the hand movement tasks with an accuracy of 82.6% in the hold-out test dataset; the accuracy for the aggregate model was 79.7%, however, it demonstrated the lowest variability. Overall, these findings suggest the feasibility of integrating low-cost wearable technology and deep learning approaches to automatically and objectively quantify motor impairment in persons with PD. This approach may provide a viable solution for a widely deployable telemedicine solution.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders worldwide. Current identification and monitoring of its motor symptoms depends on the clinical expertise. Repetitive finger tapping is one of the most common clinical maneuvers to assess for bradykinesia. Despite the increasing use of technology aids to quantitatively characterize the motor symptoms of PD, there is still a relative lack of clinical evidence to support their widespread use, particularly in low-resource settings. In this pilot study, we used a low-cost design prototype coupled with an inertial sensor is coupled to quantify the frequency of the finger tapping movements in four participants with PD. Repetitive finger tapping was performed using both hands before and after taking levodopa as part of their clinical treatment. The proposed 3D design allowed repetitive movements to be performed without issues. The maximum frequency of finger tapping was in the range of 0.1 to 4.3 Hz. Levodopa was associated with variable changes in the maximum frequency of finger tapping. This pilot study shows the feasibility for low-cost technology to quantitatively characterize repetitive movements in people living with PD.Clinical relevance- In this pilot study, a low-cost inertial sensor coupled to a design prototype was feasible to characterize the frequency of repetitive finger tapping movements in four participants with PD. This method could be used to quantitatively identify and monitor bradykinesia in people living with PD.",

    "abstract": "Divergent clinical symptoms and pathological progression suggest multiple subtypes of Parkinson disease (PD). Here, we proposed a reliable PD subtyping approach that quantifies the disturbance of an individual patient to the reference structural covariance networks derived from healthy controls. We revealed two subtypes of de novo PD patients by using longitudinal data from the PPMI dataset. Compared to the conventional clinical TD/PIGD phenotypes, our subtyping was highly stable in 5 years' visits. The two subtypes of PD showed significant differences in motor symptoms, medication effects, CSF biomarkers, and longitudinal progression. Moreover, patients of subtype 2 showed widespread lower cortical-to-dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) connections and higher medication effects on motor symptoms which was regulated by 5-HT neurons in DRN. Our results suggest distinct neuropathological pathways underlying the two subtypes, such that, in contrast to the typical PD subtype, patients of subtype 2 may be affected by serotonergic modulation on dopaminergic neurons in striatum. Our study opens new avenue to precision medicine and personalized treatments in PD and may be applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Medication optimization is a common component of the treatment strategy in patients with Parkinson's disease. As the disease progresses, it is essential to compensate for the movement deterioration in patients. Conventionally, examining motor deterioration and prescribing medication requires the patient's onsite presence in hospitals or practices. Home-monitoring technologies can remotely deliver essential information to physicians and help them devise a treatment decision according to the patient's need. Additionally, they help to observe the patient's response to these changes. In this regard, we conducted a longitudinal study to collect gait data of patients with Parkinson's disease while they received medication changes. Using logistic regression classifier, we could detect the annotated motor deterioration during medication optimization with an accuracy of 92%. Moreover, an in-depth examination of the best features illustrated a decline in gait speed and swing phase duration in the deterioration phases due to suboptimal medication.Clinical relevance- Our proposed gait analysis method in this study provides objective, detailed, and punctual information to physicians. Revealing clinically relevant time points related to the patient's need for medical adaption alleviates therapy optimization for physicians and reduces the duration of suboptimal treatment for patients. As the home-monitoring system acts remotely, embedding it in the medical care pathways could improve patients' quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. It affects the nervous system, causing motor and non-motor symptomatology. However, its clinical diagnosis remains dependent on the expertise of clinicians, as perceptual clinical scales are often used. Gait stability is one of the most relevant motor signs in PD. Nonetheless, it is usually not reported or quantified, possibly due to its unclear meaning and the high variability of metrics used in the literature. This work aims to identify a reliable and objective indicator that clinicians can use to assess patients in realistic contexts. We focused on the Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE), being the most common metric used in previous research works to quantify gait stability. The short and long-term LLEs were calculated in a group of 34 healthy and 42 participants diagnosed with PD. The long-term LLE extracted from the chest, right arm and right foot sensors showed statistical differences between subjects with PD and healthy control (HC) subjects, showing that the HC subjects are more stable than PD patients, whereas the short-term LLE showed the opposite results. Further investigation is required to clarify the reliability of this metric to detect and rate gait stability in people affected with PD.Clinical Relevance- This study is the first step towards the identification of an objective methodology to assess gait stability in clinical settings. Achieving this goal will contribute to improve the understanding and support the diagnosis of gait disorders that cause gait stability problems.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience gait impairment that can lead to falls and poor quality of life. Here we investigate the feasibility of using smart socks to stimulate the lower limbs of people with PD to reduce excessive step time variability during walking. We hypothesised that rythmic excitation of lower limb afferents, matched to a participant's comfortable pace, would entrain deficient neuro-muscular signals resulting in improved gait. Five people with mild to moderate PD symptoms (70 \u00b1 9 years) were tested on medication before and after a 30-minute familierization session. Paired t-tests and Cohen's d were used to assess gait changes and report effect sizes. Participant experiences were recorded through structured interviews. Lower limb stimulation resulted in an acute 15% increase in gait speed (p=0.006, d=0.62), an 11% increase in step length (p=0.04, d=0.35), a 44% reduction in step time variability (p=0.03, d=0.91), a 22% increase in perceived gait quality (p=0.04, d=1.17), a 24% reduction in mental effort to walk (p=0.02, d=0.79) and no statistical difference for cadence (p=0.16). Participants commented positively on the benefit of stimulation during training but found that stimulation could be distracting when not walking and the socks hard to put on. While the large effects for step time variability and percieved gait quality (Cohen's d > 0.8) are promising, limitations regarding sample size, potential placebo effects and translation to the home environment should be addressed by future studies.Clinical Relevance- This study demonstrates the feasibility of using smart stimulating socks to reduce excessive step time variability in people with PD. As step time variability is a risk factor for falls, the use of smart textiles to augment future rehabilitation programs warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Following the aging of the population, Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a severe challenge to public health. For the diagnosis of PD and the prediction of its progression, numerous computer-aided diagnosis procedures have been developed. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are widely applied in deep learning to effectively integrate multi-modal features and model subject correlation. However, many GCNs which are used for node classification build large-scale fixed graph topologies using the entire dataset, which could make them impossible to verify independently. Furthermore, past GCN algorithms would need more interpretability, limiting their real-world applications. In this paper, an Interpretable Graph-Learning Convolutional Network (iGLCN) is proposed to enhance the performance of personalized diagnosis for PD while simultaneously producing interpretable results. The proposed method can dynamically adjust the graph structure for GCN to better diagnose outcomes by learning the optimal underlying latent graph. Through interpretable feature learning, the proposed network can interpret diagnosis outcomes. The experiments showed that the proposed method increased flexibility while maintaining a high level of classification performance and could be interpretable for PD diagnosis.Clinical Relevance- The proposed method is expected to have good performance in its strong practicability, feasibility, and interpretability for Parkinson's disease diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's Disease (PwP) experience a significant deterioration of their daily life quality due to non-motor symptoms, with gastrointestinal dysfunctions manifesting as a vanguard of the latter. Electrogastrography (EGG) is a noninvasive diagnostic tool that can potentially provide biomarkers for the monitoring of dynamic gastric alterations that are related to daily lifestyle and treatment regimens. In this work, a robust analysis of EGG dynamics is introduced to evaluate the effect of probiotic treatment on PwP. The proposed framework, namely biSEGG, introduces a Swarm Decomposition-based enhancement of the EGG, combined with Bispectral feature engineering to model the underlying Quadratic Phase Coupling interactions between the gastric activity oscillatory components of EGG. The biSEGG features are benchmarked against the conventional Power Spectrum-based ones and evaluated through machine learning classifiers. The experimental results, when biSEGG was applied on data epochs from 11 PwP (probiotic vs placebo, AUROC: 0.67, Sensitivity/Specificity: 75/58%), indicate the superiority of biSEGG over Power Spectrum-based approaches and justify the efficiency of biSEGG in capturing and explaining intervention- and meal consumption-related alterations of the gastric activity in PwP.Clinical relevance- biSEGG holds potential for dynamic monitoring of gastrointestinal dysfunction and health status of PwP across diverse daily life scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This is the largest study on Radiomics analysis looking into the impact of Deep Brain Stimulation on Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease. Preoperative brain white matter radiomics of 120 patients integrated with clinical variables were used to predict the DBS effect on NMS after 1 year from the surgery. Patients were classified \"suboptimal\" vs \"good\" based on a 10% or more improvement in NMS score. The combined Radiomics-Clinical Random Forrest (RF) model achieved an AUC of 0.96, Accuracy of 0.91, Sensitivity of 0.94 and Specificity of 0.88. The Youden's index showed optimal threshold for the RF of 0.535. The confusion matrix of the RF classifier gave a TPR of 0.92 and a FPR of 0.03. This corresponds to a PPV of 0.93 and a NPV of 0.93. The predictive models can be easily interpreted and after careful large-scale validation be integrated in assisting clinicians and patients to make informed decisions.Clinical Relevance- This paper shows the lesser studied positive impact of Deep Brain Stimulation on Non motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease while allows clinicians to predict non responders to the therapy.",

    "abstract": "Gait disorder is a core problem in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), including bradykinesia, shuffling steps, festinating gait, and freeze of gait (FOG). Laser-light visual cueing has been demonstrated to be efficient in the mediation of gaits and the reduction in number of FOG episodes. However, previous approaches commonly adopted independent controls of visual cueing on left and right sides which was prone to produce two cues while individual was not in normal walking. In this study, we developed laser-light visual shoes which produced interlaced visual cues for left and right feet in a manner of one-side cueing at a time, solving the aforementioned problem. With parallel measurement of foot inertial data and foot pressures in each shoe, our results showed that the proposed visual cueing made PD individuals in the on-medication condition walk with a longer stance and swing times, that is, they walked more carefully and stable. The proposed approach can also be used to study kinematic and kinetic characteristics of gaits in the off-medication condition to clarify the mediation of visual cueing on motor control of PD individuals.Clinical Relevance- This demonstrates the effect of laser-light visual cueing on gaits in individuals with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is considered to be the second most common neurodegenerative disease which affects the patients' life throughout the years. As a consequence, its early diagnosis is of major importance for the improvement of life quality, implying that the severe symptoms can be delayed through appropriate clinical intervention and treatment. Among the most important premature symptoms of PD are the voice impairments of articulation, phonation and prosody. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the voice's dynamic behavior can be used as possible indicator for PD. Thus in this work, we employ the recurrence plots (RPs) which derive from the analysis of the three modulated vowels /a/, /e/ and /o/, which belong to the PC-GITA dataset, and are fed as input images to a 3-channel Convolutional Neural Network-based (CNN) architecture, which, finally, differentiates the 50 PD patients from 50 healthy subjects. The experimental results obtained provide evidence that the RP-based approach is a promising tool for the recognition of PD patients through the analysis of voice recordings, with a classification accuracy achieved equal to 87%.",

    "abstract": "Collecting resting-state electroencephalography (RSEEG) data is time-consuming and data sets are therefore often small. Because many machine learning (ML) algorithms work better with ample data, researchers looking to use RSEEG and ML to develop diagnostic models have used oversampling methods that may seem to contradict averaging methods used in conventional electroencephalography (EEG) research to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Using eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) recordings from 3 different research groups, we investigated the effect of different averaging and oversampling methods on classification metrics when classifying people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and controls. Both EC and EO recordings were used due to differences found between these methods. Our results indicated that grouping 58 electrodes into regions-of-interest (ROI) based on anatomical location is preferable to using single electrodes. Furthermore, although recording EO data led to slightly better classification, the number of data points for each participant was reduced and recordings for three participants entirely lost during pre-processing due to a higher level of artefacts than in the EC data.Clinical relevance- RSEEG is a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognostication of PD, but for RSEEG to have clinical relevance, it is necessary to establish which averaging and oversampling of data most reliably segregates the classes for people with PD and controls. We found that using of ROIs and EC data performed the best, as EO data was often contaminated with artefacts.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence shows that high-intensity exercises reduce tremors and stiffness in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is insufficient evidence on the types of exercises; in effect, high-intensity may be a personalized measure. Recent progress in automated Human Activity Recognition using machine learning (ML) models shows potential for better monitoring of PD patients. However, ML models must be calibrated to ignore tremors and accurately identify activity and its intensity. We report findings from a study where we trained ML models using data from medically validated triple synchronous sensors connected to 8 non-PD subjects performing 32 exercises. We then tested the models to identify exercises performed by 8 PD patients at different stages of the disease. Our analysis shows that better data preprocessing before modeling can provide some model generalizability. However, it is extremely challenging, as the models work with high accuracy on one group (Healthy or PD patients) (F1=0.88-0.94) but not on both groups.Clinical relevance-Patients with Parkinson's and other motor-generative diseases can now accurately measure physical activity with machine learning approaches. Clinicians, caregivers, and apps can make accurate, personalized exercise recommendations to augment medications that reduce tremors and stiffness.",

    "abstract": "Although Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most frustrating phenomena for people with Parkinson's Disease (PD), especially in their advanced stage, it is one of the least explained syndromes. The current studies only showed beta oscillations existed in frontal cortex-basal ganglia networks. Further studies need to be carried out. However, simultaneously recording neuro-electrophysiologic signals during walking is always a challenge, especially for Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Local Field Potential (LFP). This paper demonstrated a Virtual Reality (VR) based system which can trigger FOG and record biological signals at the same time. Moreover, the utilisation of VR will significantly decrease space requirements. It will provide a safer and more convenient evaluation environment for future participants. One participant with PD helped to validate the feasibility of the system. The result showed that both EEG and LFP could be recorded at the same time with trigger markers. This system design can be used to trigger freezing episodes in the controlled environment, differentiate subtypes of gait difficulties, and identify neural signatures associated with freezing episodes.Clinical relevance - This paper proposed a VR-based comprehensive FOG neuro-electrophysiologic evaluation system for people with PD. It had the advantages of minimum space requirement and wireless LFP data collection without externalised leads. This paper was to indicate a larger study which would formally recruit larger populations with PD and FOG. Future studies would explore FOG-related brain network coherence.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is a leading cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence as global life expectancy increases. The most common neurodegenerative disorders are Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). With this study, we took an in-depth look at the proteome of the (non-purified) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the CSF-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) of AD, PD, PD-MCI (Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment), PDD and DLB patients analysed by label-free mass spectrometry. This has led to the discovery of differentially expressed proteins that may be helpful for differential diagnosis. We observed a greater number of differentially expressed proteins in CSF-derived EV samples (N\u00a0=\u00a0276) compared to non-purified CSF (N\u00a0=\u00a0169), with minimal overlap between both datasets. This finding suggests that CSF-derived EV samples may be more suitable for the discovery phase of a biomarker study, due to the removal of more abundant proteins, resulting in a narrower dynamic range. As disease-specific markers, we selected a total of 39 biomarker candidates identified in non-purified CSF, and 37 biomarker candidates across the different diseases under investigation in the CSF-derived EV data. After further exploration and validation of these proteins, they can be used to further differentiate between the included dementias and may offer new avenues for research into more disease-specific pharmacological therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Gait impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) are treated with dopaminergic medication or deep-brain stimulation (DBS), although the magnitude of the response is variable between individuals. Computer vision-based approaches have previously been evaluated for measuring the severity of parkinsonian gait in videos, but have not been evaluated for their ability to identify changes within individuals in response to treatment. This pilot study examines whether a vision-based model, trained on videos of parkinsonism, is able to detect improvement in parkinsonian gait in people with PD in response to medication and DBS use.\nA spatial-temporal graph convolutional model was trained to predict MDS-UPDRS-gait scores in 362 videos from 14 older adults with drug-induced parkinsonism. This model was then used to predict MDS-UPDRS-gait scores on a different dataset of 42 paired videos from 13 individuals with PD, recorded while ON and OFF medication and DBS treatment during the same clinical visit. Statistical methods were used to assess whether the model was responsive to changes in gait in the ON and OFF states.\nThe MDS-UPDRS-gait scores predicted by the model were lower on average (representing improved gait; p\u2009=\u20090.017, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.495) during the ON medication and DBS treatment conditions. The magnitude of the differences between ON and OFF state was significantly correlated between model predictions and clinician annotations (p\u2009=\u20090.004). The predicted scores were significantly correlated with the clinician scores (Kendall's tau-b\u2009=\u20090.301, p\u2009=\u20090.010), but were distributed in a smaller range as compared to the clinician scores.\nA vision-based model trained on parkinsonian gait did not accurately predict MDS-UPDRS-gait scores in a different PD cohort, but detected weak, but statistically significant proportional changes in response to medication and DBS use. Large, clinically validated datasets of videos captured in many different settings and treatment conditions are required to develop accurate vision-based models of parkinsonian gait.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative condition with its prevalence projected to 8.9 million individuals globally in the year 2019. Parkinson's disease affects both motor and certain non-motor functions of an individual. Numerous research has focused on the neuroprotective effect of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in Parkinson's disease. Discovered in 1993, GDNF is a neurotrophic factor identified from the glial cells which was found to have selective effects on promoting survival and regeneration of certain populations of neurons including the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway. Given this property, recent studies have focused on the exogenous administration of GDNF for relieving Parkinson's disease-related symptoms both at a pre-clinical and a clinical level. This review will focus on enumerating the molecular connection between Parkinson's disease and GDNF and shed light on all the available drug delivery approaches to facilitate the selective delivery of GDNF into the brain paving the way as a potential therapeutic candidate for Parkinson's disease in the future.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurological disorder characterized by the impairment of the motor system, resulting in symptoms such as resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, difficulty with gait, and postural instability. The occurrence of striatal dopamine insufficiency can be attributed to a notable decline in dopaminergic neurons inside the substantia nigra pars compacta. Additionally, the development of Lewy bodies serves as a pathological hallmark of PD. While current therapy approaches for PD aim to preserve dopaminergic neurons or replenish dopamine levels in the brain, it is important to acknowledge that achieving complete remission of the condition remains elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miR) are a class of small, non-coding ribonucleic acids involved in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The miRNAs play a crucial part in the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of several neurodegenerative illnesses, including PD. The aim of this review is to explore the role of miRNAs in regulating genes associated with the onset and progression of PD, investigate the potential of miRNAs as a diagnostic tool, assess the effectiveness of targeting specific miRNAs as an alternative therapeutic strategy to impede disease advancement, and discuss the utilization of newly developed nanoparticles for delivering miRNAs as neurodegenerative therapies.",

    "abstract": "This analysis is the first systematic review and meta-analysis assessing occurrences of ICD in PD patients treated with oral DAs: ropinirole (ROP) and pramipexole (PRX). This study compares the two oral DAs to a transdermal patch, rotigotine (RTG).\nWe performed an extensive systematic search for eligible studies from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. The data was analyzed by various software, including EndNote, Rayyan, PRISM, and RevMan. Two studies incorporating 658 patients collectively were assessed.\nThis meta-analysis shows a significant correlation between the usage of PRX (25.3%) or ROP (21.8%) and the development of ICD in PD patients. Compared to the transdermal patch, RTG, PRX was found to have a significant relative risk (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) of 3.46 (95% CI 2.07-5.76), and ROP was found to have a significant relative risk (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) of 2.98 (95% CI 1.77-5.02). The data collected shows RTG is approximately three times less likely to cause ICDs than oral PRX and ROP.\nThe present investigation provides insight into ICD occurrences with PRX, ROP, and RTG to allow physicians to make more informed decisions on risk versus reward when deciding how to treat a PD patient with these drugs. However, related to various disclosed limitations, our conclusion cannot provide definitive practice protocols.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological condition that manifests motor and non-motor symptoms. Early in the course of the disease, PD patients frequently experience vocal difficulties. In the beginning, preprocessing procedures were used with multi-focus image fusion to enhance the quality of input images. It is essential to diagnose and treat PD early to ensure that patients live healthy and productive lives.\nTremors, rigidity in the muscles, slow movement, difficulty balance, and other psychological symptoms are some of the disease's symptoms. One of the critical mechanisms supporting PD identification and assessment is the dynamics of handwritten records. Several machine-learning techniques have been researched for the early detection of this disease. Yet the main problem with most of these manual feature extraction methods is their poor performance and accuracy.\nThis cannot be acceptable when discovering such a chronic condition. For this purpose, a powerful deep learning model is suggested to help with the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Therefore, we proposed MobileNetV3-based classification. To enhance the classification performances even more, the MobileNetV3-based approach was optimized by the Improved Dwarf Mongoose Optimization algorithm (IDMO).\nThe Pyramid channel-based feature attention network (PCFAN) chooses the critical features. The efficiency of the approaches is tested using the PPMI and NTUA datasets.

    "abstract": "The neurological ailment known as Parkinson's disease (PD) affects people throughout the globe. The neurodegenerative PD-related disorder primarily affects people in middle to late life. Motor symptoms such as tremors, muscle rigidity, and sluggish, clumsy movement are common in patients with this disorder. Genetic and environmental variables play significant roles in the development of PD. Despite much investigation, the root cause of this neurodegenerative disease is still unidentified. Clinical diagnostics rely heavily on promptly detecting such irregularities to slow or stop the progression of illnesses successfully. Because of its direct correlation with brain activity, electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential PD diagnostic technique. Electroencephalography, or EEG, data are biomarkers of brain activity changes. However, these signals are non-linear, non-stationary, and complicated, making analysis difficult. One must often resort to a lengthy human labor process to accomplish results using traditional machine-learning approaches. The breakdown, feature extraction, and classification processes are typical examples of these stages. To overcome these obstacles, we present a novel deep-learning model for the automated identification of Parkinson's disease (PD). The Gabor transform, a standard method in EEG signal processing, was used to turn the raw data from the EEG recordings into spectrograms. In this research, we propose densely linked bidirectional long short-term memory (DLBLSTM), which first represents each layer as the sum of its hidden state plus the hidden states of all layers above it, then recursively transmits that representation to all layers below it. This study's suggested deep learning model was trained using these spectrograms as input data. Using a robust sixfold cross-validation method, the proposed model showed excellent accuracy with a classification accuracy of 99.6%. The results indicate that the suggested algorithm can automatically identify PD.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorder (ICD) is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its risk factors are still controversial. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of ICD in northern China and analyze the risk factors associated with ICD, multiple ICDs, and four subtypes.\nA total of 285 PD patients were enrolled in this study. Each patient was screened using the Questionnaire for Impulse and Compulsive Control Disorders (QUIP). Stepwise regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors, and a prediction model was developed.\nThe prevalence of ICD in the study population was 11.6%. Stepwise regression analysis showed that ICD was associated with disease duration, motor symptoms, dyskinesia, depression, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and cognitive decline; multiple ICDs were related to coffee history, motor symptoms, dyskinesia, depression, apathy and RBD. The prediction model demonstrated good performance with AUC values of 0.93, 0.88, and 0.66 on the balanced train set, balanced test set, and the original imbalanced data set, respectively.\nThe risk factors for PD-ICD are complex and influenced by regional economic and cultural backgrounds. Clarifying these factors and developing predictive models can help to delay or even prevent the development of ICD through early screening and intervention.",

    "abstract": "Impaired bed mobility (IBM) is a symptom characteristic of patients having difficulty intentionally moving their bodies during nighttime sleep. IBM is one of the most common nocturnal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and may lead to extreme pain and even death; it also increases the burden on the patients' caregivers. In this systematic review, we included 19 studies involving a total of 1,407 patients with PD to observe the causes, assessment methods, and treatment options for IBM. We conclude that the extent of IBM is positively correlated with the severity of symptoms such as disease duration, dyskinesia and decreased sleep quality in patients with PD, and the evidence implies that IBM may be able to serve as a prodromal feature in the development of PD. IBM probably results from low nocturnal dopamine concentrations, reduced function of the spinal tract, torque problems in the muscles, and aging. Therefore, treatment is mostly based on continuously increasing the patient's nocturnal dopamine concentration, while deep brain stimulation (DBS) also has a mitigating effect on IBM. Both scales and sensors are commonly used to measure the severity of IBM, the wearable device monitoring and scales being updated makes measurements easier and more accurate. The future of the advancement in this field lies in the use of more family-oriented devices (such as smart phones or watches and bracelets, etc.) to monitor IBM's symptoms and select the appropriate therapeutic treatment according to the severity of the symptoms to relieve patients' suffering.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), also affecting gait. Detection of fatigue-associated changes of gait using mobile health technologies (MHT) could become increasingly effective.\nCognitively unimpaired PD patients without fluctuations (UPDRS IV < 1) underwent a standard neurological assessment including the PD-Fatigue scale (PFS-16). PD patients with (PD-F) and without fatigue (PD-N) were matched for age, sex, cognitive function and disease severity. Each participant underwent MHT gait assessment under supervised condition (SC) and unsupervised condition (UC).\nGait parameters of 21 PD-F and 21 PD-N did not significantly differ under SC. Under UC, PD-F showed higher step time, step time variability and asymmetry index compared to PD-N and the PFS-16 correlated with step time.\nThis is the first MHT-based study with PD patients showing a correlation between fatigue and gait parameters. In addition, the data collected suggest that UC is clearly superior to SC in addressing this question.",

    "abstract": "Huntington's and Parkinson's disease are two movement disorders representing mainly opposite states of the basal ganglia inhibitory function. Despite being an integral part of the cortico-subcortico-cortical circuitry, the subthalamic nucleus function has been studied at the level of detail required to isolate its signal only through invasive studies in Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. Here, we tested whether the subthalamic nucleus exhibited opposite functional signatures in early Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. We included both movement disorders in the same whole-brain imaging study, and leveraged ultra-high-field 7T MRI to achieve the very fine resolution needed to investigate the smallest of the basal ganglia nuclei. Eleven of the 12 Huntington's disease carriers were recruited at a premanifest stage, while 16 of the 18 Parkinson's disease patients only exhibited unilateral motor symptoms (15 were at Stage I of Hoehn and Yahr off medication). Our group comparison interaction analyses, including 24 healthy controls, revealed a differential effect of Huntington's and Parkinson's disease on the functional connectivity at rest of the subthalamic nucleus within the sensorimotor network, i.e. an opposite effect compared with their respective age-matched healthy control groups. This differential impact in the subthalamic nucleus included an area precisely corresponding to the deep brain stimulation 'sweet spot'-the area with maximum overall efficacy-in Parkinson's disease. Importantly, the severity of deviation away from controls' resting-state values in the subthalamic nucleus was associated with the severity of motor and cognitive symptoms in both diseases, despite functional connectivity going in ",

    "abstract": "Gut dysbiosis and psychiatric symptoms are common early manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). These diseases, characterised by progressive neuron loss and pathological protein accumulation, impose debilitating effects on patients. Recently, these pathological proteins have been linked with gut dysbiosis and psychiatric disorders. The gut-brain axis links the enteric and central nervous systems, acting as a bidirectional communication pathway to influence brain function and behavior. The relationship triad between gut dysbiosis, psychiatric disorders, and neurodegeneration has been investigated in pairs; however, evidence suggests that they are all interrelated and a deeper understanding is required to unravel the nuances of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this review aims to summarise the current literature on the roles of gut dysbiosis and psychiatric disorders in pathological protein-related neurodegenerative diseases. We discussed how changes in the gut environment can influence the development of psychiatric symptoms and the progression of neurodegeneration and how these features overlap in AD and PD. Moreover, research on the interplay between gut dysbiosis, psychiatric disorders, and neurodegeneration remains in its early phase. In this review, we highlighted potential therapeutic approaches aimed at mitigating gastrointestinal problems and psychiatric disorders to alter the rate of neurodegeneration. Further research to assess the molecular mechanisms underlying AD and PD pathogenesis remains crucial for developing more effective treatments and achieving earlier diagnoses. Moreover, exploring non-invasive, early preventive measures and interventions is a relatively unexplored but important avenue of research in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The existent pre-clinical models of Parkinson's disease do not simultaneously recapitulate severe degeneration of dopamine neurons and the occurrence of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation in one study system. In this study, we injected aSyn pre-formed fibrils (PFF) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilaterally into the striatum of C57BL/6 wild-type male mice at an interval of 2\u2009weeks to induce aggregation of aSyn protein and trigger the loss of dopamine neurons simultaneously in one model and studied the behavioural effects of the combination in these mice. 6-OHDA was tested at three different doses, and 2\u00a0\u03bcg of 6-OHDA combined with PFF-induced aSyn aggregation was found to produce the most optimal disease phenotype. At 14\u2009weeks timepoint, mice injected with a combination of PFF and 6-OHDA sustained significant damage to the nigrostriatal pathway and exhibited aSyn-positive aggregation. Our data suggest that the neurons that formed large aSyn aggregates were particularly vulnerable to 6-OHDA-induced degeneration. We also demonstrate the manifestation of a relatively aggressive pathology in 2- to 4-month-old mice, as compared to younger 7- to 9-week-old ones. Furthermore, cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) administered intrastriatally rescued dopamine neurons and motor behaviour of the animals to some extent from 6-OHDA toxicity. However, no such effect could be seen in the novel 6-OHDA + PFFs combination model. For the first time, we demonstrate the combined effect of PFF and 6-OHDA simultaneously in one model. We further discuss the scope for further optimizing this combination model to develop it as a promising pre-clinical platform for drug screening and development.",

    "abstract": "Substantial heterogeneity between individual patients in the clinical presentation of Parkinson's disease (PD) has led to the classification of distinct PD subtypes. However, genetic susceptibility factors for specific PD subtypes are not well understood. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the genetics of PD heterogeneity by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PD subtypes.\nA total of 799 PD patients were included and classified into tremor-dominant (TD) (N\u00a0=\u00a0345), akinetic-rigid (AR) (N\u00a0=\u00a0227), gait-difficulty (GD) (N\u00a0=\u00a082), and mixed (MX) (N\u00a0=\u00a0145) phenotypic subtypes. After array genotyping and subsequent imputation, a total of 7,918,344 variants were assessed for association with each PD subtype using logistic regression models that were adjusted for age, sex, and the top five principal components of GWAS data.\nWe identified one genome-wide significant association (P\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\nOur findings indicate that genetic variation may account for part of the clinical heterogeneity of PD. In particular, we found a novel genome-wide significant association between MIR3976HG variation and the AR PD subtype. Replication of these findings will be important in order to better define the genetic architecture of clinical variability in PD disease presentation.",

    "abstract": "Cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases are common among persons with Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is unknown how the prevalence of cardiovascular drug and oral anticoagulant use changes in relation to PD diagnosis.\nWe investigated the prevalence of cardiovascular drug and oral anticoagulant use among persons with and without PD among 17,541 persons who received incident PD diagnosis in 2001-2015 in Finland and their 116,829 matched comparison persons. Prevalence was calculated in 6-month time windows from 5 years before to 5 years after PD diagnosis (index date) and compared to a matched cohort without PD using generalized estimating equations.\nPersons with PD had higher prevalence of any cardiovascular drugs (unadjusted OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.11-1.18) and oral anticoagulants (unadjusted OR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.11-1.22) before index date than those without PD. After index date, persons with PD had lower prevalence of cardiovascular drugs (0.94; 95% CI: 0.91-0.96), and no difference was observed for oral anticoagulants. Prevalence of any cardiovascular drugs on the index date was 66 and 61% for persons with and without PD, respectively. \u03b2-blockers were the most common cardiovascular drugs in both cohorts. Warfarin was the most common oral anticoagulant, but the use of direct oral anticoagulants increased during the last years of follow-up.\nOrthostatic hypotension and weight loss likely explain the decreased cardiovascular drug use after PD diagnosis. Results with oral anticoagulants may reflect clinical assessment of benefits being larger than risks, despite the risks associated with their use in persons with PD.",

After index date, persons with PD had lower prevalence of cardiovascular drugs (0.94; 95% CI: 0.91-0.96), and no difference was observed for oral anticoagulants. Prevalence of any cardiovascular drugs on the index date was 66 and 61% for persons with and without PD, respectively. \u03b2-blockers were the most common cardiovascular drugs in both cohorts. Warfarin was the most common oral anticoagulant, but the use of direct oral anticoagulants increased during the last years of follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) often experience initial hesitation, slowness of movements, decreased balance and impaired standing ability, which can significantly impact their independence. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are two widely used and promising non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) modalities for treating PD. The supplementary motor area (SMA), associated with motor behaviour and processing, has received increasing attention as a potential stimulation target to alleviate PD-related symptoms. However, the data on NIBS over SMA in PD individuals are inconsistent and has not been synthesised. In this article, we will review the evidence for NIBS over SMA in PD individuals and evaluate its efficacy in improving PD function.\nRandomised controlled clinical trials comparing the effects of NIBS and sham stimulation on motor function, activities of daily living and participation for people with PD will be included. A detailed computer-aided search of the literature will be performed from inception to February 2023 in the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Web of Science (WOS) and The Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Two independent reviewers will screen articles for relevance and methodological validity. The PEDro scale will be used to evaluate the risk of bias of selected studies. Data from included studies will be extracted by two independent reviewers through a customised, preset data extraction sheet.\nEthical approval is not required for this systematic review. The study's findings will be presented at scientific meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals.\nCRD42023399945.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurological disorder for which the identification of disease-modifying interventions represents a major unmet need. Diverse trial designs have attempted to mitigate challenges of population heterogeneity, efficacious symptomatic therapy and lack of outcome measures that are objective and sensitive to change in a disease modification setting. It is not clear whether consensus is emerging regarding trial design choices. Here, we report the protocol of a scoping review that will provide a contemporary update on trial design variability for disease-modifying interventions in PD.\nThe Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome and Study design (PICOS) framework will be used to structure the review, inform study selection and analysis. The databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane and the trial registry ClinicalTrials.gov will be systematically searched to identify published studies and registry entries in English. Two independent reviewers will screen study titles, abstracts and full text for eligibility, with disagreements being resolved through discussion or by a third reviewer where necessary. Data on general study information, eligibility criteria, outcome measures, trial design, retention and statistically significant findings will be extracted into a standardised form. Extracted data will be presented in a descriptive analysis. We will report our findings using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Scoping Review extension.\nThis work will provide an overview of variation and emerging trends in trial design choices for disease-modifying trials of PD. Due to the nature of this study, there are no ethical or safety considerations. We plan to publish our findings in a peer-reviewed journal.",

    "abstract": "The effect of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) on gait in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is poorly understood. Kinematic studies utilizing quantitative gait outcomes such as speed, cadence, and stride length have shown mixed results and were done mostly before and after acute DBS discontinuation.\nTo examine longitudinal changes in kinematic gait outcomes before and after DBS surgery.\nWe retrospectively assessed changes in quantitative gait outcomes via motion capture in 22 PD patients before and after subthalamic (STN) or globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS, in on medication state. Associations between gait outcomes and clinical variables were also assessed.\nGait speed reduced from 110.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.3\u00a0cm/s before surgery to 93.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.9 after surgery (7.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9 months post-surgery, duration between assessments was 15.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8 months). Cadence, step length, stride length, and single support time reduced, while total support time, and initial double support time increased. Despite this, there was overall improvement in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-Part III score \"on medication/on stimulation\" score (from 19.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.7-13.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.6). Change of gait speed was not related to changes in levodopa dosage, disease duration, unilateral vs bilateral stimulation, or target nucleus.\nQuantitative gait outcomes in on medication state worsened after chronic DBS therapy despite improvement in other clinical outcomes. Whether these changes reflect the effects of DBS as opposed to ongoing disease progression is unknown.",

    "abstract": "Functional mobility, an indicator of the quality of life (QoL), requires fast and flexible changes during motion, which are limited in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent body-worn sensors have emerged in the last decades as potential solutions to produce digital biomarkers able to quantify mobility outside routine consultations and during real-life scenarios for multiple days at a time. The proposed research aims to study the ability of a wearable motion analysis lab, developed by our team, to produce digital biomarkers of mobility and QoL levels in patients with PD.\nA cross-sectional study was followed, including 40 patients stratified into three subgroups according to a clinic motor examination and a QoL questionnaire.\nThe achieved outcomes demonstrate the ability of the proposed high-tech solution to measure prototypical gait impairments and discriminate motor condition (AUC=0,890) and patients' QoL levels (AUC=0,950). Also, from the measured multiple gait-associated parameters, we identified the variables with the most potential to be applied as digital biomarkers of mobility (67\u00a0% of the metrics) and QoL (72\u00a0% of the metrics) in PD.\nOverall, we confirmed our hypothesis of using our body-worn sensor-based solution for passive or active monitoring of mobility and QoL in PD to produce objective, feasible, and continuous digital biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa, a common drug that improves symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), can induce a reduction in blood pressure (BP); however, the effect of levodopa on cerebral blood flow (CBF) remains unclear.\nTo observe the changes in BP and CBF during active standing before and after the acute levodopa challenge test (ALCT) and analyse the influencing factors of CBF in patients with PD.\nBP and CBF velocity were simultaneously recorded by continuous beat-to-beat non-invasive BP monitoring and transcranial Doppler at supine and orthostatic positions twice, before and after ALCT.

    "abstract": "Ethnicity differences are an important determinant in the clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD), but they are not yet widely recognized, particularly regarding the response to dopaminergic medications. The aim of this paper is to analyze the efficacy and safety of safinamide in Chinese patients with PD in the pivotal studies SETTLE and XINDI compared to the non-Chinese population of the SETTLE trial.\nSETTLE (NCT00627640) and XINDI (NCT03881371) were phase\u00a0III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials. Patients received safinamide or placebo as add-on to levodopa. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the mean total daily OFF time. Secondary efficacy endpoints included total daily ON time, ON time with no/non-troublesome dyskinesia, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 items. Safety was evaluated through the frequency of adverse events. Data from 440 non-Chinese and 109 Chinese patients in the SETTLE study, and 305 Chinese patients in the XINDI trial were considered for this post\u00a0hoc analysis.\nSignificant positive results were seen in favor of safinamide in all populations for the primary and secondary endpoints, with no differences in terms of magnitude. No \"treatment by ethnicity\" interaction was detected for any parameters, confirming the homogeneity of treatment effects between different populations. The safety and tolerability of safinamide in Chinese patients were similar to those in the other ethnic groups, without unexpected adverse reactions.\nSafinamide was shown to improve PD symptoms and quality of life in different ethnic populations, without any treatment by race interaction. Further studies are warranted to investigate potential differences in a real-life situation.\nSETTLE (NCT00627640) and XINDI (NCT03881371).",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness and choroidal thickness (CT) in Parkinson disease (PD) patients. A comparative cross-sectional, hospital-based study. 39 PD and 39 controls were recruited, who were gender and age matched. Subjects that fulfilled the inclusion criteria underwent optical coherence tomography for evaluation of RNFL thickness and choroidal thickness (CT). There was significant reduction of RNFL thickness in average (adjusted mean 88.87 \u00b5m vs. 94.82 \u00b5m, P=0.001), superior (adjusted mean 110.08 \u00b5m vs. 119.10 \u00b5m, P=0.002) and temporal (adjusted mean 63.77 \u00b5m vs. 70.36 \u00b5m, P=0.004) in PD compared to controls. The central subfoveal CT was significantly thinner in PD compared to controls (adjusted mean 271.13 \u00b5m vs. 285.10 \u00b5m, P=0.003). In PD group, there was significant weak negative correlation between the duration of PD with average RNFL thickness (r=-0.354, P=0.027), moderate negative correlation between the duration of PD with central subfoveal CT (r=-0.493, P=0.001), and weak negative correlation between the stage of PD with central subfoveal CT (r=-0.380, P=0.017). PD group had significant thinner average, superior and temporal RNFL thickness and CT compared to controls.",

    "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that --Parkinson's disease (PD) may be initiated in the gastrointestinal tract, before manifesting in the central nervous system. In this respect, it was demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria, accelerates the in vitro formation of \u03b1-synuclein (aSyn) fibrils, whose intracellular deposits is a histological hallmark of the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD. Herein, N-terminal acetylation and missense mutations of aSyn (A30P, A53T, E46K, H50Q and G51D) linked to rare, early-onset forms of familial PD were investigated regarding their effect on aSyn aggregation stimulated by either LPS or small unilamellar lipid vesicles (SUVs). Our findings indicated that LPS as well as SUVs induce the fibrillation of N-terminally acetylated wild-type aSyn (Ac-aSyn-WT) more remarkably than the non-acetylated protein, while the LPS-free protein alone did not undergo fibrillation under our assay conditions. In addition, with the exception of A30P, PD mutations increased the fibrillation of Ac-aSyn in the presence of LPS compared with Ac-aSyn-WT. The most pronounced effect of LPS was noticed for A53T, as observed when either Thioflavin-T or JC-1 were used as fluorescent probes for fibrils. Overall, our results suggest for the first time the existence of a synergy between LPS and PD mutations/N-terminal acetylation toward aSyn fibrillation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a rapidly growing neurodegenerative disorder, but up-to-date epidemiological data are lacking in Latin America. We sought to estimate the prevalence and incidence of PD and parkinsonism in Latin America.\nWe searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Scientific Electronic Library Online, and Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ci\u00eancias da Sa\u00fade or the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature databases for epidemiological studies reporting the prevalence or incidence of PD or parkinsonism in Latin America from their inception to 2022. Quality of studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist. Data were pooled via random-effects meta-analysis and analyzed by data source (cohort studies or administrative databases), sex, and age group. Significant differences between groups were determined by meta-regression.\nEighteen studies from 13 Latin American countries were included in the review. Meta-analyses of 17 studies (nearly 4\u2009million participants) found a prevalence of 472 (95% CI, 271-820) per 100,000 and three studies an incidence of 31 (95% CI, 23-40) per 100,000 person-years for PD; and seven studies found a prevalence of 4300 (95% CI, 1863-9613) per 100,000 for parkinsonism. The prevalence of PD differed by data source (cohort studies, 733 [95% CI, 427-1255] vs. administrative databases. 114 [95% CI, 63-209] per 100,000, P\u2009<\u20090.01), age group (P\u2009<\u20090.01), but not sex (P\u2009=\u20090.73). PD prevalence in \u226560\u2009years also differed significantly by data source (cohort studies. 1229 [95% CI, 741-2032] vs. administrative databases, 593 [95% CI, 480-733] per 100,000, P\u2009<\u20090.01). Similar patterns were observed for parkinsonism.\nThe overall prevalence and incidence of PD in Latin America were estimated.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by motor dysfunction resulting from the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the midbrain. This dopamine deficiency gives rise to a spectrum of movement-related symptoms, including tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. While the precise etiology of Parkinson's disease remains elusive, genetic mutations, protein aggregation, inflammatory processes, and oxidative stress are believed to contribute to its development. In this context, fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) in the central nervous system, FABP3, FABP5, and FABP7, impact \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, neurotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. These FABPs accumulate in mitochondria during neurodegeneration, disrupting their membrane potential and homeostasis. In particular, FABP3, abundant in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, is responsible for \u03b1-synuclein propagation into neurons and intracellular accumulation, affecting the loss of mesencephalic tyrosine hydroxylase protein, a rate-limiting enzyme of dopamine biosynthesis. This review summarizes the characteristics of FABP family proteins and delves into the pathogenic significance of FABPs in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, it examines potential novel therapeutic targets and early diagnostic biomarkers for Parkinson's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Deep-brain subthalamic nucleus stimulation (DBS-STN) has become a well-established therapeutic option for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). While the motor benefits of DBS-STN are widely acknowledged, the neuropsychiatric effects are still being investigated. Beyond its immediate effects on neuronal circuits, emerging research suggests that DBS-STN might also modulate the peripheral inflammation and neuroinflammation. In this work, we assessed the effects of DBS-STN on food-related motivation, food intake pattern, and the level of anxiety and compared them with markers of cellular and immune activation in nigrostriatal and mesolimbic areas in rats with the 6-OHDA model of early PD. To evaluate the potential mechanism of observed effects, we also measured corticosterone concentration in plasma and leukocyte distribution in peripheral blood. We found that DBS-STN applied during neurodegeneration has beneficial effects on food intake pattern and motivation and reduces anxiety. These behavioral effects occur with reduced percentages of IL-6-labeled cells in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta in the stimulated brain hemisphere. At the same brain structures, the cFos cell activations were confirmed. Simultaneously, the corticosterone plasma concentration was elevated, and the peripheral blood lymphocytes were reduced after DBS-STN. We believe that comprehending the relationship between the effects of DBS-STN on inflammation and its therapeutic results is essential for optimizing DBS therapy in PD.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has unveiled intriguing insights suggesting that the body's immune system may be implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) development. Studies have observed disparities in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers between PD patients and healthy individuals. This finding underscores the potential influence of immune system dysfunction in the genesis of this condition. A dysfunctional immune system can serve as a primary catalyst for systemic inflammation in the body, which may contribute to the emergence of various brain disorders. The identification of several genes associated with PD, as well as their connection to neuroinflammation, raises the likelihood of disease susceptibility. Moreover, advancing age and mitochondrial dysfunction can weaken the immune system, potentially implicating them in the onset of the disease, particularly among older individuals. Compromised integrity of the blood-brain barrier could facilitate the immune system's access to brain tissue. This exposure may lead to encounters with native antigens or infections, potentially triggering an autoimmune response. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence supporting the notion that gut dysbiosis might represent an initial trigger for brain inflammation, ultimately promoting neurodegeneration. In this comprehensive review, we will delve into the numerous hypotheses surrounding the role of both innate and adaptive immunity in PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the risk factors, prodromal symptoms, non-motor symptoms (NMS), and motor symptoms (MS) in different Parkinson's disease (PD) non-motor subtypes, classified using newly established criteria and a data-driven approach.\nA total of 168 patients with idiopathic PD underwent comprehensive NMS and MS examinations. NMS were assessed by the Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Motor subtypes were classified based on Stebbins' method. Patients were classified into groups of three NMS subtypes (cortical, limbic, and brainstem) based on the newly designed inclusion criteria. Further, data-driven clustering was performed as an alternative, statistical learning-based classification approach. The two classification approaches were compared for consistency.\nWe identified 38 (22.6%) patients with the cortical subtype, 48 (28.6%) with the limbic, and 82 (48.8%) patients with the brainstem NMS PD subtype. Using a data-driven approach, we identified five different clusters. Three corresponded to the cortical, limbic, and brainstem subtypes, while the two additional clusters may have represented patients with early and advanced PD. Pearson chi-square test of independence revealed that a priori classification and cluster membership were significantly related to one another with a large effect size (\u03c7\nUsing the actuarial and clustering approach, marked differences between individual NMS subtypes were found. The newly established criteria have potential as a simplified tool for future clinical research of NMS subtypes of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders, such as REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and excessive daytime sleepiness, are among the most common non-motor symptoms in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). Sleep disorders have a major negative impact on the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. In addition, REM sleep behavior disorder is an important risk factor for cognitive impairment in PD. This systematic review was conducted on studies investigating the influence of RBD on cognitive performance in PD subjects. We searched the PubMed and Scopus databases, screened the references of the studies included, and reviewed articles for additional citations. From the first 244 publications, we included only 11 studies that met the search criteria. The results showed that sleep disorders in PD were associated with impaired executive functions, visual-constructive abilities, reduced attention, and episodic verbal memory, and could predict the possible risk of developing dementia.",

    "abstract": "Subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD) display different motor and non-motor symptoms. Different therapies have been shown to be effective, such as plantar foot stimulation, which has proved to be effective for motor symptoms. Different stimulation methods were proposed and tested through specific devices, or insoles. Our aim was to assess the effect of a newly designed custom-made insole called PRO-STEP compared with a flat sham insole on subjects with PD. Subjects were randomized 1:1 into two arms and were asked to wear PRO-STEP or sham insoles for at least 6 h per day for 10 weeks. Participants were evaluated at four timepoints. Forty-two subjects were randomly assigned to the PRO-STEP (EG) or sham group (SG). The comparison of the EG and SG without and with insoles (T0-T1) did not show significant differences in the TUG time and in the 10MWT gait parameters. At T1, T2, and T3 TUG time, BBS, SF12-MC, and SF12-PC did not show significant differences. The satisfaction level with the PRO-STEP or sham insoles was high in both groups. PD patients were satisfied with PRO-STEP insoles; however, plantar foot stimulation is not effective from a functional perspective. Future studies should consider possible modifications to the proposed stimulation to improve its effectiveness in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "A common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and melanoma is their starting points being based on cells capable of converting tyrosine into melanin. Melanocytes produce two types of melanin: eumelanin and pheomelanin. These dyes are designed to protect epidermal cells from the harmful effects of UV radiation. Neurones of the substantia nigra, which degenerate during PD, produce neuromelanin, the physiological role of which is not fully explained. This article discusses the potential role of melanins in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Melanins, due to their ability to accumulate toxic substances, may become their sources over time. The use of glutathione for the synthesis of pheomelanins and neuromelanins may reduce the antioxidant capacity of cells, leading to an excessive synthesis of free radicals. This study also tested the hypothesis that certain drugs used in the treatment of PD (L-DOPA, MAO-B and COMT inhibitors, and amantadine), aimed at increasing dopamine concentration, could potentially contribute to the development of melanoma. The role and properties of melanins should continue to be researched. Whether excessive melanin synthesis or its accumulation in the extracellular space may be factors initiating the development of diseases remains an open question.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the potential of radiomics with multiple parameters from conventional T1 weighted imaging (T1WI) and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) in distinguishing between idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA).\nA total of 201 participants, including 57 patients with PD, 74 with MSA, and 70 healthy control (HCs) individuals, underwent T1WI and SWI scans. From the 12 subcortical nuclei (e.g. red nucleus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, and caudate nucleus), 2640 radiomic features were extracted from both T1WI and SWI scans. Three classification models - logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) - were used to distinguish between MSA and PD, as well as among MSA, PD, and HC. These classifications were based on features extracted from T1WI, SWI, and a combination of T1WI and SWI. Five-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the models with metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). During each fold, the ANOVA and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods were used to identify the most relevant subset of features for the model training process.\nThe LGBM model trained by the features combination of T1WI and SWI exhibited the most outstanding differential performance in both the three-class classification task of MSA vs. PD vs. HC and the binary classification task of MSA vs. PD, with an accuracy of 0.814 and 0.854, and an AUC of 0.904 and 0.881, respectively. The texture-based differences (GLCM) of the SN and the shape-based differences of the GP were highly effective in discriminating between the three classes and two classes, respectively.\nRadiomic features combining T1WI and SWI can achieve a satisfactory differential diagnosis for PD, MSA, and HC groups, as well as for PD and MSA groups, thus providing a useful tool for clinical decision-making based on routine MRI sequences.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid aging trend of China's population, the issue of drug rational use in older adults has become more and more prominent. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Pharmaceutical treatment plays a cardinal role in alleviating motor and non-motor symptoms to improve the quality of life of patients with PD. Patients with PD have complex medical needs yet little is known about the use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) among them in China. We quantify the prevalence of PIM use and identify its predictors among older persons with PD in China.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis using a national representative database of all medical insurance beneficiaries across China, extracting records of ambulatory visits of older adults with PD between 2015 and 2017. Beneficiaries aged 65 and above were eligible for inclusion. The prevalence of patients exposed to overall PIMs and PIMs related to motor and cognitive impairment was calculated based on Beers Criteria 2015 version. Potential predictors of PIM concerning patients' characteristics were estimated using multivariate logistic regression.\nA total of 14,452 older adults with PD were included. In total, 8,356 (57.8%) patients received at least one PIM; 2,464 (17.1%) patients received at least one motor-impairing PIM and 6,201 (42.9%) patients received at least one cognition-impairing PIM. The prevalence of overall PIM use was higher in patients of older age group (54.7% [65-74] vs. 59.5% [75-84; OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.31] vs.65.5% [\u2265\u200985; OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.38-1.80) and females (61.4% [female] vs. 55.0% [males; OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.72-0.82).\nPrescribing PIMs for older adults with PD was common in China, especially for females and older age groups, yet younger patients were more inclined to be prescribed with motor or cognition-impaired PIMs. Our findings represent a clear target awaiting multidimensional efforts to promote the rational prescribing of medications for this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "Nanomedicine-based anti-neuroinflammation strategy has become a promising dawn of Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment. However, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of antioxidant nanomedicines concerning the pathways traversing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and subsequent inflammation mitigation. Here, we report nanozyme-integrated metal-organic frameworks with excellent antioxidant activity and chiral-dependent BBB transendocytosis as anti-neuroinflammatory agents for the treatment of PD. These chiral nanozymes are synthesized by embedding ultra-small platinum nanozymes (Ptzymes) into L-chiral and D-chiral imidazolate zeolite frameworks (Ptzyme@L-ZIF and Ptzyme@D-ZIF). Compared to Ptzyme@L-ZIF, Ptzyme@D-ZIF shows higher accumulation in the brains of male PD mouse models due to longer plasma residence time and more pathways to traverse BBB, including clathrin-mediated and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. These factors contribute to the superior therapeutic efficacy of Ptzyme@D-ZIF in reducing behavioral disorders and pathological changes. Bioinformatics and biochemical analyses suggest that Ptzyme@D-ZIF inhibits neuroinflammation-induced apoptosis and ferroptosis in damaged neurons. The research uncovers the biodistribution, metabolic variances, and therapeutic outcomes of nanozymes-integrated chiral ZIF platforms, providing possibilities for devising anti-PD drugs.",

    "abstract": "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is common in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Few studies have compared the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in patients with and without MCI due to PD (PD-MCI), and its correlation to patients' subjective cognitive and communicative difficulties has not been explored.\nWe aimed to compare HRQoL in PD-MCI and PD without MCI (PD-nMCI), and explore its possible relationship to subjective cognitive and communicative complaints.\nWe included 29 PD-nMCI and 11 PD-MCI patients. The HRQoL was assessed with the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39): its Cognition dimension was used as a measure of subjective cognitive complaints, its Communication dimension for subjective communicative complaints, and the summary index (PDQ-39 SI) as an indicator of HRQoL. Non-parametric partial correlations between the Cognition and Communication dimensions, and the adjusted PDQ-39 SI were conducted.\nPD-MCI patients had greater subjective cognitive and communicative complaints and worse HRQoL than PD-nMCI patients. In the PD-MCI group, both subjective cognitive and communicative complaints exhibited significant direct correlations with the adjusted HRQoL scores.\nHRQoL seems to be affected in PD-MCI, and it might be influenced by greater subjective cognitive and communicative complaints. Including patient-reported outcome measures of HRQoL, and providing cognitive and speech rehabilitation, as well as psychotherapeutic strategies to face these deficits can enhance the patient-centred approach in PD.",

    "abstract": "Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) and Source-Based Morphometry (SBM) are widely used techniques for analyzing structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. VBM compares differences in gray and white matter volume, density, or concentration voxel-wise, while SBM identifies patterns of structural variation using independent component analysis. This study aims to compare the performance of VBM and SBM in detecting differences in brain structure across Parkinson's patients and healthy controls, grouped based on their chronotype.\nThirty-three subjects were divided into three groups: a Parkinson's Group (PG), an Early Chronotype Group (EG), and a Late Chronotype Group (LG). Circadian preference, daytime sleepiness, and sleep quality were assessed, and MRI data were acquired using a 3\u2009T scanner. SBM and VBM were used to test differences and similarities in MRI scans and chronotypes.\nResults from SBM revealed significant clusters surviving the analysis, with the 1st component for the PG-EG and the 4th component for the PG-LG analysis showing the lowest p-value (< 0.05). Denser gray matter volume (GMV) or white matter volume (WMV) was observed in the Middle Frontal Gyrus and the Lentiform Nucleus through Talairach Coordinates analysis.\nThis study emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate methods for analyzing structural MRI data. VBM is effective in identifying local differences in brain structure, while SBM provides a more comprehensive view of structural variation, detecting patterns not captured by VBM. Future studies should consider utilizing both VBM and SBM to fully characterize brain structural differences in diverse clinical and cognitive populations. Further studies, with larger sample sizes and more balanced genders, genomic analysis, disease severity and duration, as well as medications' effect, are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease inflict economic and health burdens on societies. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is accompanied by progressive degradation of memory, decision-making, and judgment. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and loss of balance. Extensive research has pinpointed inflammation as a cause of the onset and progression of both diseases. However, it has not been confirmed which one is more formidable in terms of inflammation.\nTo assess the extent of inflammation that is implicated in AD and PD and answer the question of which one is more inflammatory, serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers, including cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandin E2 (PEG2), were measured in AD and PD patients as well as a healthy group.\nOur results showed a significant increase in IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IP-10, MCP-1, PEG2, and TNF-\u03b1 in AD and PD patients compared with the control. Interestingly, IFN-\u03b3 did not manifest any significant difference in AD or PD patients compared with the control.\nAs a hallmark of our results, it could be inferred that inflammation, as the underlying etiological cause, plays a more crucial role in PD compared with AD. Based on our results, it is proposed that anti-inflammatory remedies would be putatively more effective in PD rather than AD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by cardinal motor signs: 4-6\u00a0Hz resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. In addition, 3-18% of PD patients have camptocormia, an abnormal forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine, which may have a negative impact on patients' quality of life. Different possible treatments have been suggested for such a condition, but no one is resolutive. This study aims to define the possible impact of DBS, with selective targeting on the dorsal-lateral region of the STN, on the sagittal balance of patients affected by PD. Among all patients that have undergone DBS procedures in our institution, we selected eight subjects, four females and four males, with selective targeting on the dorsal-lateral region of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) because of camptocormia and other severe postural changes. Radiological assessments of spinal balance parameters before surgery and at 6 and 12\u00a0months postoperatively were carried out. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative spine X-ray data showed a statistically significant improvement in dorsal kyphosis angle (D-Cobb) 12\u00a0months after the operation. Deep brain stimulation with selective targeting of the dorsal lateral part of the STN may induce changes of the posture in patients with Parkinson's disease 12\u00a0months after the operation, which appears to improve in this small sample size, but larger observational and controlled trials would be required to confirm this observation.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to examine the longitudinal change of plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL) level and explore its diagnostic and prognostic implications in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA total of 184 patients with early PD who completed 5-year annually repeated clinical assessments were included. Plasma NFL at baseline, 1\u00a0year, and 2\u00a0year were examined, which were quantified using the ultrasensitive Simoa technology. At baseline, blood from 86 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HC) were obtained for comparison.\nPlasma NFL in PD patients at baseline was significantly higher than those in HC (P\u2009=\u20090.046), and significantly increased after 2\u00a0years (P\u2009=\u20090.046). Receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that a plasma NFL cut-off value of 10.79\u00a0pg/mL resulted in 39.7% sensitivity and 84.0% specificity, with an area under the curve of 0.635, to distinguish PD from HC (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Linear mixed-effect models indicated that baseline plasma NFL (>\u20099.24\u00a0pg/mL) correlated with a greater increase in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (estimate\u2009=\u20090.651, P\u2009=\u20090.001) and Hoehn & Yahr stage (estimate\u2009=\u20090.072, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and also correlated with a greater decrease in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (estimate\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.387, P\u2009<\u20090.001) during follow-up visits.\nPlasma NFL exhibits a tendency to increase with disease progression, and elevated baseline plasma NFL can serve as a predictor for accelerated motor deterioration and cognitive decline in PD. However, plasma NFL does not have high accuracy to distinguish individuals with early-stage PD from HC.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects millions of people throughout the world. Cuproptosis is a newly discovered form of programmed cell death linked to several neurological disorders. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms of Cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in PD remain unknown. This study investigated immune infiltration and CRG expression profiling in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. Subsequently, we construct a predictive model based on 5 significant CRGs. The performance of the predictive model was validated by nomograms and external datasets. Additionally,\u00a0we classified PD patients into two clusters based on CRGs and three gene clusters based on differentially expressed genes (DEG) of CRGs clusters. We further evaluated immunological characterization between the different clusters and created the CRGs scores to quantify CRGs patterns. Finally, we investigate the prediction of CRGs drugs and the ceRNA network, providing new insights into the pathogenesis and management of PD.",

    "abstract": "As a chronic degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that affects both motor and non-motor systems, Parkinson's disease (PD) is very complex, and explanations and models are needed to better understand how dopaminergic neurons are affected and microglia are activated.\nA theoretical protein-RNA recognition code that assumes that the second letter in codons is compatible with specific amino acids involved in protein-RNA recognition was used to search for compatibility of human \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) with mRNAs in the human transcriptome (1-L transcription).\nThe 1-L transcription revealed compatible amino acid sequences with the ATTTA ARE (class I), PAS and polyA in \u03b1-syn, supporting a protein-RNA regulatory model. In PD, inflammatory microglia reactions, cognitive decline and motor circuit disturbances are observed. The model theoretically explains why \u03b1-syn producing neurons are less protected from inflammation and why microglia are activated. Consistent with knowledge of PD, the identified genes showed how the PI3K-AKT pathway is downregulated, how reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and sensitivity are increased, how mitochondria are destabilized, why autophagy is impaired, and why neuronal depigmentation is observed.\n1-L transcription of \u03b1-syn leads to genes/proteins relevant to PD. When \u03b1-syn is accepted as a small RNA recognition protein involved in the post-transcriptional regulations, some identified genes indicate that its function is an important regulatory factor associated with intracellular and extracellular transport of RNA vesicles. These vesicles are extremely important in cellular communication. In addition, the spectrum of identified genes strongly indicates that \u03b1-syn produced by neuronal cells is required for proper regulation of inflammatory and immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Impaired movement vigor (bradykinesia) is a cardinal feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and hypothesized to result from abnormal motivational processes-impaired motivation-vigor coupling. Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) improves bradykinesia, but the response to DRT is multifaceted, comprising a short-duration response (SDR) and a long-duration response (LDR) only manifesting with chronic treatment. Prior experiments assessing motivation-vigor coupling in PD used chronically treated subjects, obscuring the roles of the SDR and LDR.\nTo disambiguate the SDR and LDR, 11 de novo PD subjects (6 male\u2009[M]:5 female [F]; mean age, 67) were studied before treatment, after an acute levodopa (l-dopa) dose, and in both the practical \"off\" (LDR) and \"on\" (LDR\u2009+\u2009SDR) states after chronic stable treatment. At each visit, subjects were characterized with a standard battery including the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and an incentivized joystick task to assess motor performance in response to varying rewards.\nl-Dopa induced a robust SDR and LDR, with further improvement in the combined SDR\u2009+\u2009LDR state. At baseline, after acute treatment (SDR), and after LDR induction, subjects did not exhibit the normal increase in movement speed with increasing reward. Only in the combined SDR\u2009+\u2009LDR state was there restoration of motivation-vigor coupling.\nAlthough consistent with prior results in chronically treated PD subjects, the significant improvement in motor performance observed with the SDR and LDR suggests that bradykinesia is not solely secondary to deficient modulation of motivational processes. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic degeneration is a central feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), but glial dysfunction may accelerate or trigger neuronal death. In fact, astrocytes play a key role in the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier and detoxification. 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) is used to induce PD in rodent models due to its specific toxicity to dopaminergic neurons, but its effect on astrocytes has been poorly investigated. Here, we show that 6OHDA dose-dependently impairs autophagy in human U373 cells and primary murine astrocytes in the absence of cell death. LC3II downregulation was observed 6 to 48\u00a0h after treatment. Interestingly, 6OHDA enhanced NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2) expression and activity in U373 cells, even if 6OHDA turned out not to be its substrate. Autophagic flux was restored by inhibition of NQO2 with S29434, which correlated with a partial reduction in oxidative stress in response to 6OHDA in human and murine astrocytes. NQO2 inhibition also increased the neuroprotective capability of U373 cells, since S29434 protected dopaminergic SHSY5Y cells from 6OHDA-induced cell death when cocultured with astrocytes. The toxic effects of 6OHDA on autophagy were attenuated by silencing NQO2 in human cells and primary astrocytes from NQO2-/- mice. Finally, the analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus datasets showed elevated NQO2 gene expression in the blood cells of early-stage PD patients. These data support a toxifying function of NQO2 in dopaminergic degeneration via negative regulation of autophagy and neuroprotection in astrocytes, suggesting a potential pharmacological target in PD.",

Screening LRRK2 and GBA variants in 32 New Yorkers of Puerto Rican ethnicity with PD and in 119 non-Hispanic-non-Jewish European PD cases revealed that Puerto Rican participants were more likely to harbor the LRRK2-p.G2019S variant (15.6% vs. 4.2%, respectively). Additionally, whole exome sequencing of twelve Puerto Rican and Dominican PD participants was performed as an exploratory study.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder predominantly affecting elderly, is marked by the gradual degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, culminating in neuronal loss within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and dopamine depletion. At the molecular level, neuronal loss in the SNpc has been attributed to factors including neuroinflammation, impaired protein homeostasis, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting oxidative stress. This review focuses on the interplay between neuroinflammatory pathways and Parkinson's disease, drawing insights from current literature.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation are two intertwined mechanisms contributing to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Whether circulating biomarkers reflecting those two processes differ according to disease duration remains to be established. The present study was conducted to characterize the biomarkers individuals with PD with short (\u22645\u00a0years) or long disease duration (>5\u00a0years).\nWe consecutively enrolled 104 patients with Parkinson's disease and evaluated them using validated clinical scales (MDS-UPDRS, Hoehn and Yahr staging, MMSE). Serum samples were assayed for the following biomarkers: neurofilament light chain (NfL), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin (IL-) 1\u03b2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 17, interferon-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1.\nMean age of participants was 66.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6\u00a0years and 45 (34%) were women. The average disease duration was 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0years (range 1 to 19\u00a0years). Patients with short disease duration (\u2264 5\u00a0years) showed a pro-inflammatory profile, with significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory IL-1\u03b2 and lower concentrations of IL-5, IL-10 and IL-17 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). NfL serum levels showed a positive correlation with disease duration and age (respectively rho\u00a0=\u00a00.248, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014 and rho\u00a0=\u00a00.559, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) while an opposite pattern was detected for BDNF (respectively rho -0,187, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034 and rho\u00a0=\u00a0-0.245, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014).\nOur findings suggest that a pro-inflammatory status may be observed in PD patients in the early phases of the disease, independently from age.",

    "abstract": "Early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients at high risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can help with timely intervention. White matter structural connectivity is considered an early and sensitive indicator of neurodegenerative disease.\nTo investigate whether baseline white matter structural connectivity features from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of de novo PD patients can help predict PD-MCI conversion at an individual level using machine learning methods.\nWe included 90 de novo PD patients who underwent DTI and 3D T1-weighted imaging. Elastic net-based feature consensus ranking (ENFCR) was used with 1000 random training sets to select clinical and structural connectivity features. Linear discrimination analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and na\u00efve Bayes (NB) classifiers were trained based on features selected more than 500 times. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) were used to evaluate model performance.\nA total of 57 PD patients were classified as PD-MCI nonconverters, and 33 PD patients were classified as PD-MCI converters. The models trained with clinical data showed moderate performance (AUC range: 0.62-0.68; ACC range: 0.63-0.77; SEN range: 0.45-0.66; SPE range: 0.64-0.84). Models trained with structural connectivity (AUC range, 0.81-0.84; ACC range, 0.75-0.86; SEN range, 0.77-0.91; SPE range, 0.71-0.88) performed similar to models that were trained with both clinical and structural connectivity data (AUC range, 0.81-0.85; ACC range, 0.74-0.85; SEN range, 0.79-0.91; SPE range, 0.70-0.89).\nBaseline white matter structural connectivity from DTI is helpful in predicting future MCI conversion in de novo PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Mid- to late-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) is often linked with worsened and significant impairment of motor activities, but existing prognostic markers do not adequately capture the risk of loss of balance in PD patients. This study aims to develop a risk prognostic model for mid- to late-stage PD and identify prognostic factors that are indicative of impending loss of balance and falls.\nThe study included 307 participants of which 75 were diagnosed with idiopathic PD and 232 were neurological or non-neurological controls. Among the PD group, 46 were early-stage (Hoehn and Yahr [H&Y] = 1,2) with no significant loss of balance while 29 were mid- to late-stage (H&Y = 3,4,5) which is characterized by loss of balance and falls. Multivariable logistic regression (MLR) was used to develop a prognostic model for mid- to late-stage PD. Model discrimination was assessed by ROC curves. The model was internally validated through bootstrapping and calibration plots.\nThe relevant factors identified and included in the final MLR model were shortness of breath, age, swollen joints, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein, and total salivary protein. The model had an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI = 0.71-0.92) and was well calibrated (calibration slope = 0.77, intercept = 0.03). The likelihood of shortness of breath (OR = 7.91, 95% CI = 1.63-45.12) was significantly higher among mid- to late-stage PD than early-stage. Age and total salivary protein were also significantly higher among mid- to late-stage PD.\nThe MLR prognostic model for mid- to late-stage PD may assist physicians in identifying patients at high risk for loss of balance and falls.",

However, the correct diagnosis of PD and atypical parkinsonism may be difficult with high clinical uncertainty. There is an urgent need to identify reliable biomarkers using high-throughput, molecular-specific methods to improve current diagnostics. Here, we present a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging method that requires minimal sample preparation and only 1 \u03bcL of crude cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The method enables analysis of hundreds of samples in a single experiment while simultaneously detecting numerous metabolites with subppm mass accuracy.

    "abstract": "The contribution of the immune system to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative Parkinson's disease (PD) is increasingly being recognised, with alterations in the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system underlying central and peripheral inflammation in PD. As chief modulators of the immune response, cytokines have been intensely studied in the field of PD both in terms of trying to understand their contribution to disease pathogenesis, and if they may comprise much needed therapeutic targets for a disease with no current modifying therapy. This review summarises current knowledge on key cytokines implicated in PD (TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-1RA) that can modulate both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Cytokine activity in PD is clearly a complicated process mediated by substantial cross-talk of signalling pathways and the need to balance pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. However, understanding cytokine activity may hold promise for unlocking new insight into PD and how it may be halted.",

Nearly every patient with PD will require therapy with dopamine in the form of levodopa as the disease progresses. In more advanced stages of the disease, patients will experience motor fluctuations and require adjustment to their medication regimens to maintain good control of their symptoms. During the last 10 years, several new therapeutic treatment options have come to the market to treat motor fluctuations and improve patient quality of life. Some of these agents represent additional options to previously available drug classes, such as the catechol-",

    "abstract": "The occurrence and development of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been demonstrated to be related to gut dysbiosis, however, the impact of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on microbiota engraftment in PD patients is uncertain. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial at the Department of Neurology, Army Medical University Southwest Hospital in China (ChiCTR1900021405) from February 2019 to December 2019. Fifty-six participants with mild to moderate PD (Hoehn-Yahr stage 1-3) were randomly assigned to the FMT and placebo group, 27 patients in the FMT group and 27 in the placebo group completed the whole trial. During the follow-up, no severe adverse effect was observed, and patients with FMT treatment showed significant improvement in PD-related autonomic symptoms compared with the placebo group at the end of this trial (MDS-UPDRS total score, group\u00d7time effect, B\u2009=\u2009-6.56 [-12.98, -0.13], ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characteristized by the presence of dyskinesia and the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. Although certain drugs can mitigate the symptoms of PD, they are unable to delay the disease progression, and their prolonged use may result in complications. Therefore, there exists an urgent necessity to identify potential agents that can effectively delay PD progression with fewer side effects. Recent research has unveiled that several traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) exhibit neuroprotective properties in various models pertinent to PD. Forsythoside A (FSA), the primary bioactive compound derived from TCM Lianqiao, has undergone extensive research in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia. However, the investigation into the impact of FSA on PD is limited in existing research. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of FSA on MPTP-induced PD mouse model. FSA demonstrated significant improvements in the behavioral and neuropathological changes triggered by MPTP in mice. Furthermore, it exerted a suppressive effect on the activations of astrocyte and microglia. Meanwhile, Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics of striatal tissue and bioinformatics analysis were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of FSA on PD mouse model. Proteomics demonstrated a total of 68 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified between HFSA and MPTP groups including 26 upregulated and 42 downregulated. Systematic bioinformatics analysis of the 68 DEPs illustrated that they were predominantly related to estrogen signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway. The related DEPs (PLC\u03b24, Grm2, HPAC and Cox4i1) expression levels were verified by Western blot. FSA effectively restored the altered expression of the four DEPs induced by MPTP. Summarily, FSA exerted remarkable neuroprotective effects in MPTP-induced mice. Further, our research may provide proteomics insights that contribute to the further exploration of FSA as a potential treatment for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) aggregates. However, there are currently no effective therapies for PD. Brazilin, an inhibitor of \u03b1-Syn aggregation, is unstable and toxic. Therefore, we have developed and synthesized derivatives of brazilin. One of these derivatives, called brazilin-7-acetate (B-7-A), has shown reduced toxicity and a stronger effect on inhibiting \u03b1-Syn aggregation. It showed that B-7-A prevented the formation of \u03b1-Syn fibers and disrupted existing fibers in a dosage-dependent manner. Additionally, B-7-A significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of \u03b1-Syn aggregates and alleviated oxidative stress in PC12\u00a0cells. The beneficial effects of B-7-A were also confirmed using the Caenorhabditis elegans model. These effects included preventing the accumulation of \u03b1-Syn clumps, improving behavior disorder, increasing lifespan, reducing oxidative stress, and protecting against lipid oxidation and loss. Finally, B-7-A showed good ADMET properties in silico. Based on these findings, B-7-A exhibits potential as a prospective treatment for PD.",

    "abstract": "Artemisinin is an antimalarial drug that has been used for almost half a century. However, the anti-Parkinson's disease (PD) effects of artemisinin with respect to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced oxidative stress have not yet been investigated while focusing on NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling. Thus, we sought to assess the behavioral and oxidative mechanistic effects of artemisinin on MPTP-induced toxicity via the Nrf2 signaling pathway. We explored this through immunohistochemical assays, ELISA, in differentiated PC12 cells treated with siRNA, and with a PD mouse model. Artemisinin increased Nrf2 DNA-binding activity and HO-1 and NQO1 expression. Artemisinin treatment protected cells against MPP+\u00a0-induced neuronal death signaling, including NADH dehydrogenase activity, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, it protected cells against MPTP-induced behavioral impairments and significantly reduced dopaminergic neuronal loss. Additionally, Nrf2 pre-inhibition using ML385 neutralized the inhibitory effects of artemisinin on dopaminergic neuronal damage and behavioral impairments induced by MPTP. Our results suggest that artemisinin inhibits MPTP-induced behavioral and neurotoxic effects in mice. This provides a foundation for further research to evaluate artemisinin as a potential therapeutic agent for PD.",

This study aimed to thoroughly investigate swallowing dysfunction in patients with PD using videofluoroscopy (VF) and the Movement Disorder Society (MDS)-Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) sub-scores.\nThis study was part of an intervention project to evaluate the effectiveness of cervical percutaneous interferential current stimulation in patients with Hoehn and Yahr stages 2-4 PD. Baseline data, including swallowing-related indicators such as VF, were obtained and compared to the MDS-UPDRS sub-scores including rigidity, tremor, postural instability/gait difficulty, and limb scores.\nTwenty-seven patients were included in this study. In the VF analysis, laryngeal penetration/aspiration, oral cavity residue, epiglottic vallecular residue, and pharyngeal residue were observed with remarkable frequency. The multivariate analysis revealed that the mean rigidity score of UPDRS was an independent and significantly correlated factor with laryngeal penetration/aspiration during the ingestion of 10\u00a0mL of water (odds ratio 1.294, 95% confidence interval 1.035-1.617; p\u2009=\u20090.024).\nThis study revealed a correlation between muscle rigidity and laryngeal penetration or aspiration risk.

    "abstract": "Higuchi's fractal dimension (FD) captures brain dynamics complexity and may be a promising method to analyze resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and detect the neuronal interaction complexity underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) cognitive decline.\nThe aim was to compare FD with a more established index of spontaneous neural activity, the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), and identify through machine learning (ML) models which method could best distinguish across PD-cognitive states, ranging from normal cognition (PD-NC), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) to dementia (PDD). Finally, the aim was to explore correlations between fALFF and FD with clinical and cognitive PD features.\nAmong 118 PD patients age-, sex-, and education matched with 35 healthy controls, 52 were classified with PD-NC, 46 with PD-MCI, and 20 with PDD based on an extensive cognitive and clinical evaluation. fALFF and FD metrics were computed on rs-fMRI data and used to train ML models.\nFD outperformed fALFF metrics in differentiating between PD-cognitive states, reaching an overall accuracy of 78% (vs. 62%). PD showed increased neuronal dynamics complexity within the sensorimotor network, central executive network (CEN), and default mode network (DMN), paralleled by a reduction in spontaneous neuronal activity within the CEN and DMN, whose increased complexity was strongly linked to the presence of dementia. Further, we found that some DMN critical hubs correlated with worse cognitive performance and disease severity.\nOur study indicates that PD-cognitive decline is characterized by an altered spontaneous neuronal activity and increased temporal complexity, involving the CEN and DMN, possibly reflecting an increased segregation of these networks. Therefore, we propose FD as a prognostic biomarker of PD-cognitive decline. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

An additional search was conducted in December 2022. The search was limited to articles that included empirical studies of approaches to enabling palliative care.\nA total of 62 studies met inclusion criteria. There is evidence that education about palliative care and movement disorders is essential. palliative care should be multi-disciplinary, individualised and coordinated. Proactive involvement and support of caregivers throughout the illness is recommended. Limited data provide referral indicators for palliative care integration. Discussions about advance care planning should be held early.\nConsideration of palliative care integration based on symptom burden and personal preferences, coordination and continuity of care are needed to maintain the quality of life of people with Parkinson's disease and their caregivers.",

Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome is an uncommon complication of the treatment of Parkinson's disease, characterized by an addictive use of dopamine far more than the dosage required for treatment of objective motor impairment, leading to severe dyskinesia, euphoria, aggressivity, or psychosis. We present a paradigmatic case of Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome, Mania, and Compulsive Buying in a 55-year-old male with Parkinson's Disease. We also reviewed the risk factors and the therapeutic management of Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome in Parkinson's Disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease associated with cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been used as a recommended global cognition scale for patients with PD, but there are some concerns about its application, partially due to the floor and ceiling effects.\nTo explore the floor and ceiling effects on the MoCA in patients with PD in Brazil.\nCross-sectional study with data from patients with PD from five Brazilian Movement Disorders Clinics, excluding individuals with a possible diagnosis of dementia. We analyzed the total score of the MoCA, as well as its seven cognitive domains. The floor and ceiling effects were evaluated for the total MoCA score and domains. Multivariate analyses were performed to detect factors associated with floor and ceiling effects.\nWe evaluated data from 366 patients with PD and approximately 19% of individuals had less than five years of education. For the total MoCA score, there was no floor or ceiling effect. There was a floor effect in the abstraction and delayed memory recall domains in 20% of our sample. The ceiling effect was demonstrated in all domains (80.8% more common in naming and 89% orientation), except delayed recall. Education was the main factor associated with the floor and ceiling effects, independent of region, sex, age at evaluation, and disease duration.\nThe floor and ceiling effects are present in specific domains of the MoCA in Brazil, with a strong impact on education. Further adaptations of the MoCA structure for underrepresented populations may reduce these negative effects.\nA doen\u00e7a de Parkinson (DP) \u00e9 uma doen\u00e7a neurodegenerativa comum associada ao decl\u00ednio cognitivo.

    "abstract": "The Live Well with Parkinson's Self-Management Toolkit is designed for use in the NHS to support people with Parkinson's, their carers and health professionals in managing motor and non-motor symptoms and promoting well-being. The Toolkit was developed based on theory-based behaviour change and self-management techniques in consultation with people living with Parkinson's and health and social care practitioners. There are digital (e-Toolkit) and paper (manual) versions.\nSingle-blind two-arm randomised controlled trial RCT of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Toolkit, facilitated by up to six sessions with a trained non-specialist supporter, in improving quality of life. People with Parkinson's will be assessed at baseline, 6 and 12\u00a0months. Assessors will be blind to the treatment group. The primary outcome measure is the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39, Parkinson's related quality of life) score at 12\u00a0months. Secondary outcome measures include the MDS Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (Part I, II, III, IV), EQ-5D, and a Client Service Receipt Inventory shortened, adapted for Parkinson's. Carer outcomes include the Zarit Carer Burden Inventory and Carer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Parkinsonism. A total of 338 people with Parkinson's, and their carers if appropriate, will be recruited from diverse settings across England. Those with advanced dementia, at end-of-life or with atypical Parkinsonism will be excluded. A parallel mixed methods process evaluation will explore the factors promoting or inhibiting implementation, uptake, use, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Toolkit and sessions.\nIf successful, the Live Well with Parkinson's Toolkit could be used as a model for other complex long-term disorders, including dementia. This would bridge existing gaps in the NHS (as shown by the national Parkinson's audit data), by enabling patients and carers to access personalised information, advice and support on symptom management and 'living well' with Parkinson's.\nISRCTN92831552.\u00a0Registered on 26th Oct 2021.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), two common irreversible neurodegenerative diseases, share similar early stage syndromes, such as olfaction dysfunction. Yet, the potential comorbidity mechanism of AD and PD was not fully elucidated.\nThe gene expression profiles of GSE5281 and GSE8397 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We utilized a series of bioinformatics analyses to screen the overlapped differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The hub genes were further identified by the plugin CytoHubba of Cytoscape and validated in the hippocampus (HIP) samples of APP/PS-1 transgenic mice and the substantial nigra (SN) samples of A53T transgenic mice by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Meanwhile, the expression of the target genes in the olfactory epithelium/bulb was detected by RT-qPCR. Finally, molecular docking was used to screen potential compounds for the target gene.\nOne hundred seventy-four overlapped DEGs were identified in AD and PD. Five of the top ten enrichment pathways mainly focused on the synapse. Five hub genes were identified and further validated. As a common factor in AD and PD, the changes of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) mRNA in olfactory epithelium/bulb were significantly decreased and had a strong association with those in the HIP and SN samples. Pazopanib was the optimal compound targeting SNAP25, with a binding energy of -\u20099.2\u00a0kcal/mol.\nOur results provided a theoretical basis for understanding the comorbidity mechanism of AD and PD and highlighted that SNAP25 in the olfactory epithelium may serve as a potential target for early detection and intervention in both AD and PD.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive disorders are increasingly recognized in Parkinson disease (PD), even in early disease stages, and memory is one of the most affected cognitive domains. Classically, hippocampal cholinergic system dysfunction was associated with memory disorders, whereas nigrostriatal dopaminergic system impairment was considered responsible for executive deficits. Evidence from PD studies now supports involvement of the amygdala, which modulates emotional attribution to experiences. Here, we propose a tripartite model including the hippocampus, striatum and amygdala as key structures for cognitive disorders in PD. First, the anatomo-functional relationships of these structures are explored and experimental evidence supporting their role in cognitive dysfunction in PD is summarized. We then discuss the potential role of \u03b1-synuclein, a pathological hallmark of PD, in the tripartite memory system as a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of memory disorders in the disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and although restoring striatal dopamine levels may improve symptoms, no treatment can cure or reverse the disease itself. Stem cell therapy has a regenerative effect and is being actively studied as a candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Mesenchymal stem cells are considered a promising option due to fewer ethical concerns, a lower risk of immune rejection, and a lower risk of teratogenicity. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells and their derivatives on motor function, memory, and preservation of dopaminergic neurons in a Parkinson's disease animal model. We searched bibliographic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science) to identify articles and included only peer-reviewed in vivo interventional animal studies published in any language through June 28, 2023. The study utilized the random-effect model to estimate the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the standard mean differences (SMD) between the treatment and control groups. We use the systematic review center for laboratory animal experimentation's risk of bias tool and the collaborative approach to meta-analysis and review of animal studies checklist for study quality assessment. A total of 33 studies with data from 840 Parkinson's disease model animals were included in the meta-analysis. Treatment with mesenchymal stem cells significantly improved motor function as assessed by the amphetamine-induced rotational test. Among the stem cell types, the bone marrow MSCs with neurotrophic factor group showed largest effect size (SMD [95% CI] = -6.21 [-9.50 to -2.93], P = 0.0001, I2 = 0.0 %). The stem cell treatment group had significantly more tyrosine hydroxylase positive dopaminergic neurons in the striatum ([95% CI] = 1.04 [0.59 to 1.49], P = 0.0001, I2 = 65.1 %) and substantia nigra (SMD [95% CI] = 1.38 [0.89 to 1.87], P = 0.0001, I2 = 75.3 %), indicating a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons. Subgroup analysis of the amphetamine-induced rotation test showed a significant reduction only in the intracranial-striatum route (SMD [95% CI] = -2.59 [-3.25 to -1.94], P = 0.0001, I2 = 74.4 %). The memory test showed significant improvement only in the intravenous route (SMD [95% CI] = 4.80 [1.84 to 7.76], P = 0.027, I2 = 79.6 %). Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to positively impact motor function and memory function and protect dopaminergic neurons in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease. Further research is required to determine the optimal stem cell types, modifications, transplanted cell numbers, and delivery methods for these protocols.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. However, current diagnostic methods are still limited, and available treatments can only mitigate the symptoms of the disease, not reverse it at the root. The immune function has been identified as playing a role in PD, but the exact mechanism is unknown. This study aimed to search for potential immune-related hub genes in Parkinson's disease, find relevant immune infiltration patterns, and develop a categorical diagnostic model.\nWe downloaded the GSE8397 dataset from the GEO database, which contains gene expression microarray data for 15 healthy human SN samples and 24 PD patient SN samples. Screening for PD-related DEGs using WGCNA and differential expression analysis. These PD-related DEGs were analyzed for GO and KEGG enrichment. Subsequently, hub genes (dld, dlk1, iars and ttd19) were screened by LASSO and mSVM-RFE machine learning algorithms. We used the ssGSEA algorithm to calculate and evaluate the differences in nigrostriatal immune cell types in the GSE8397 dataset. The association between dld, dlk1, iars and ttc19 and 28 immune cells was investigated. Using the GSEA and GSVA algorithms, we analyzed the biological functions associated with immune-related hub genes. Establishment of a ceRNA regulatory network for immune-related hub genes. Finally, a logistic regression model was used to develop a PD classification diagnostic model, and the accuracy of the model was verified in three independent data sets. The three independent datasets are GES49036 (containing 8 healthy human nigrostriatal tissue samples and 15 PD patient nigrostriatal tissue samples), GSE20292 (containing 18 healthy human nigrostriatal tissue samples and 11 PD patient nigrostriatal tissue samples) and GSE7621 (containing 9 healthy human nigrostriatal tissue samples and 16 PD patient nigrostriatal tissue samples).\nUltimately, we screened for four immune-related Parkinson's disease hub genes. Among them, the AUC values of dlk1, dld and ttc19 in GSE8397 and three other independent external datasets were all greater than 0.7, indicating that these three genes have a certain level of accuracy. The iars gene had an AUC value greater than 0.7 in GES8397 and one independent external data while the AUC values in the other two independent external data sets ranged between 0.5 and 0.7. These results suggest that iars also has some research value. We successfully constructed a categorical diagnostic model based on these four immune-related Parkinson's disease hub genes, and the AUC values of the joint diagnostic model were greater than 0.9 in both GSE8397 and three independent external datasets. These results indicate that the categorical diagnostic model has a good ability to distinguish between healthy individuals and Parkinson's disease patients. In addition, ceRNA networks reveal complex regulatory relationships based on immune-related hub genes.\nIn this study, four immune-related PD hub genes (dld, dlk1, iars and ttd19) were obtained. A reliable diagnostic model for PD classification was developed. This study provides algorithmic-level support to explore the immune-related mechanisms of PD and the prediction of immune-related drug targets.",

    "results": "Ultimately, we screened for four immune-related Parkinson's disease hub genes. Among them, the AUC values of dlk1, dld and ttc19 in GSE8397 and three other independent external datasets were all greater than 0.7, indicating that these three genes have a certain level of accuracy. The iars gene had an AUC value greater than 0.7 in GES8397 and one independent external data while the AUC values in the other two independent external data sets ranged between 0.5 and 0.7. These results suggest that iars also has some research value. We successfully constructed a categorical diagnostic model based on these four immune-related Parkinson's disease hub genes, and the AUC values of the joint diagnostic model were greater than 0.9 in both GSE8397 and three independent external datasets. These results indicate that the categorical diagnostic model has a good ability to distinguish between healthy individuals and Parkinson's disease patients. In addition, ceRNA networks reveal complex regulatory relationships based on immune-related hub genes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by extrapyramidal motor disturbances and nonmotor cognitive impairments which impact activities of daily living. Although the etiology of PD is still obscure, autopsy reports suggest that oxidative stress (OS) is one of the important factors in the pathophysiology of PD. In the current study, we have investigated the impact of OS in PD by measuring the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) levels from the substantia nigra (SN), left hippocampus (LH) and neurotransmitter \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA) levels from SN region. Concomitant quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) from SN and LH was also acquired from thirty-eight PD patients and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Glutathione levels in the SN region decreased significantly and susceptibility increased significantly in PD compared to HC. Nonsignificant depletion of GABA was observed in the SN region. GSH levels in the LH region were depleted significantly, but LH susceptibility did not alter in the PD cohort compared to HC. Neuropsychological and physical assessment demonstrated significant impairment of cognitive functioning in PD patients compared to HC. GSH depletion was negatively correlated to motor function performance. Multivariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on the combined effect of GSH, GABA, and susceptibility in the SN region yielded an improved diagnostic accuracy of 86.1% compared to individual diagnostic accuracy based on GSH (65.8%), GABA (57.5%), and susceptibility (69.6%). This is the first comprehensive report in PD demonstrating significant GSH depletion as well as concomitant iron enhancement in the SN region.",

    "abstract": "Background Parkinson's\u00a0disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterised by the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the presence of Lewy bodies. PD medications, notably Levodopa, are critical in controlling patients' symptoms and improving their quality of life. These medications are time-critical, and a delay in administration can have a negative impact on a patient's mobility, quality of life and symptoms. Objective The objective of this quality improvement project (QIP) was to (1) determine the occurrence and underlying factors contributing to delays in PD medication administration at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary and (2) evaluate the impact of subsequent interventions in improving the administration of time-critical PD medications. Methods A total of 20 patients were recruited from Ward 5, a care of the elderly ward, at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary for the entire duration of this QIP; 10 in the pre-intervention phase and 10 for the post-intervention phase one month following the implementation of three interventions: 'Parkinson's Drug Box', ward-based teaching and a hospital-wide screensaver reminder. Data\u00a0was\u00a0collected from the electronic patient record (EPR) to determine and compare the following measures before and after the interventions: the percentage of PD medications administered within the 30-minute\u00a0recommended\u00a0window, the admission-to-medication reconciliation time, scheduled-to-actual dose administration time, and factors causing delays. Results Following the implementation of three interventions, the percentage of patients receiving PD medications within the recommended 30-minute window doubled, increasing from 10% to 20%. Moreover, the average delay in patients receiving their initial PD medication dose decreased from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours. The percentage of patients experiencing medication delays due to stock shortages also dropped from 50% to 10%. Conclusions Earlier medicines reconciliation and the availability of time-critical drugs out of hours are both key factors in helping to ensure PD medication is administered on time in hospitals. Staff education and a 'Parkinson's Drug Box' are two relatively simple measures that have resulted in improved outcomes for Parkinson's inpatients.",

    "abstract": "The lack of accessible and informative biomarkers results in a delayed diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD), whose symptoms appear when a significant number of dopaminergic neurons have already disappeared. The retina, a historically overlooked part of the central nervous system (CNS), has gained recent attention. It has been discovered that the composition of cerebrospinal fluid influences the aqueous humor composition through microfluidic circulation. In addition, alterations found in the brain of patients with PD have a correlate in the retina. This new paradigm highlights the potential of the aqueous humor as a sample for identifying differentially concentrated metabolites that could, eventually, become biomarkers if also found altered in blood or CSF of patients. In this research we aim at analyzing the composition of the aqueous humor from healthy controls and PD patients.\nA targeted metabolomics approach with concentration determination by mass spectrometry was used. Statistical methods including principal component analysis and linear discriminants were used to select differentially concentrated metabolites that allow distinguishing patients from controls.\nIn this first metabolomics study in the aqueous humor of PD patients, elevated levels of 16 compounds were found; molecules differentially concentrated grouped into biogenic amines, amino acids, and acylcarnitines. A biogenic amine, putrescine, alone could be a metabolite capable of differentiating between PD and control samples. The altered levels of the metabolites were correlated, suggesting that the elevations stem from a common mechanism involving arginine metabolism.\nA combination of three metabolites, putrescine, tyrosine, and carnitine was able to correctly classify healthy participants from PD patients. Altered metabolite levels suggest altered arginine metabolism. The pattern of metabolomic disturbances was not due to the levodopa-based dopamine replacement medication because one of the patients was not yet taking levodopa but a dopamine receptor agonist.",

    "abstract": "The Care of Late-Stage Parkinsonism (CLaSP) study is a longitudinal, multicentre, prospective cohort study to assess the needs and provision of care for people with late-stage Parkinson's disease and their caregivers in six European countries. As a cross-sectional study within the CLaSP study, 509 people with Parkinson's disease completed the \"Schedule-for-Meaning-in-Life-Evaluation\" (SMiLE) questionnaire. We compared the results to those of a representative sample of healthy participants (n\u2009=\u2009856). People with late-stage Parkinson's disease reported family, partnership and spirituality as the greatest areas of importance. Overall, they had lower SMiLE indices compared to healthy participants. People with late-stage Parkinson's disease rated the importance of core meaning in life areas (namely family, social relations and health) as significantly lower than the representative cohort and they also rated satisfaction as significantly lower in most areas. In conclusion, people with late-stage Parkinson's disease do have areas where they can find meaning, such as family, partnership and spirituality. However, they indicate a lack of fulfilment of their individual MiL, reflected by low satisfaction rates in the majority of meaning in life categories. The need for spiritual support for people with Parkinson's disease indicates the important role of chaplains to help people with Parkinson's disease maintain meaning in life.",

    "abstract": "Social cognition is impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD). Whether social cognitive impairment (iSC) is a by-product of the underlying cognitive deficits in PD or a process independent of cognitive status is unknown. To this end, the present study was designed to investigate the weight of specific cognitive deficits in social cognition, considering different mild cognitive impairment subtypes of PD (PD-MCI).\nFifty-eight PD patients underwent a neuropsychological battery assessing executive functions, memory, language, and visuospatial domains, together with social cognitive tests focused on theory of mind (ToM). Patients were divided into subgroups according to their clinical cognitive status: amnestic PD-MCI (PD-aMCI, n = 18), non-amnestic PD-MCI (PD-naMCI, n = 16), and cognitively unimpaired (PD-CU, n = 24). Composite scores for cognitive and social domains were computed to perform mediation analyses.\nMemory and language impairments mediated the effect of executive functioning in social cognitive deficits in PD patients. Dividing by MCI subgroups, iSC occurred more frequently in PD-aMCI (77.8%) than in PD-naMCI (18.8%) and PD-CU (8.3%). Moreover, PD-aMCI performed worse than PD-CU in all social cognitive measures, whereas PD-naMCI performed worse than PD-CU in only one subtype of the affective and cognitive ToM tests.\nOur findings suggest that ToM impairment in PD can be explained by memory dysfunction that mediates executive control. ToM downsides in the amnesic forms of PD-MCI may suggest that subtle changes in social cognition could partly explain future transitions into dementia. Hence, the evaluation of social cognition in PD is critical to characterize a possible behavioral marker of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating problem that is common among many, but not all, people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Numerous attempts have been made at treating FOG to reduce its negative impact on fall risk, functional independence, and health-related quality of life. However, optimal treatment remains elusive. Observational studies have recently investigated factors that differ among patients with PD who later develop FOG, compared to those who do not. With prediction and prevention in mind, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of publications through 31.12.2022 to identify risk factors. Studies were included if they used a cohort design, included patients with PD without FOG at baseline, data on possible FOG predictors were measured at baseline, and incident FOG was assessed at follow-up. 1068 original papers were identified, 38 met a-priori criteria, and 35 studies were included in the meta-analysis (n\u2009=\u20098973; mean follow-up: 4.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7 years). Factors significantly associated with a risk of incident FOG included: higher age at onset of PD, greater severity of motor symptoms, depression, anxiety, poorer cognitive status, and use of levodopa and COMT inhibitors. Most results were robust in four subgroup analyses. These findings indicate that changes associated with FOG incidence can be detected in a subset of patients with PD, sometimes as long as 12 years before FOG manifests, supporting the possibility of predicting FOG incidence. Intriguingly, some of these factors may be modifiable, suggesting that steps can be taken to lower the risk and possibly even prevent the future development of FOG.",

    "abstract": "Visual function is critical to support occupational performance for persons with Parkinson's disease (PwP), yet it can be adversely affected by the disease.\nTo evaluate the prevalence and general awareness of visual dysfunction and identify the association between visual dysfunction and occupational performance in PwP.\nSelf-reported cross-sectional electronic survey.\nPwP, identified from a registered database at a neurological institute, were invited to complete the survey through emails and newsletters.\nThe survey contained items of self-reported visual difficulties, diagnosed eye conditions, and about general awareness about disease-related visual dysfunction. Ophthalmological symptoms and occupational performance were measured with the Visual Impairment Parkinson's disease Questionnaire and the Revised Self-Reported Functional Visual Performance Scale, respectively.\nData from PwP (n = 92; Mage = 69 yr) were analyzed. Nearly half were unaware that their disease could affect vision. Awareness was not associated with disease duration. Individuals reporting awareness tended to report difficulties with vision. Functional activities requiring vision were mildly impaired, and the frequency of ophthalmologic symptoms (commonly related to ocular surface disorder) was low. Nevertheless, a higher frequency of ophthalmologic symptoms was positively associated with a higher degree of disability in activities of daily living (Spearman's \u03c1 = .49, p < .01).\nVisual dysfunction related to Parkinson's disease may affect occupational performance. Screening for changes in vision in these individuals may aid occupational therapists in addressing functional independence and activity engagement. What This Article Adds: People with Parkinson's disease may not have a general awareness that the disease can adversely affect visual function. Those individuals with awareness tend to notice changes in vision, and this disease-related visual dysfunction may limit engagement and participation in everyday activities. Active evaluation of visual function in people with Parkinson's disease is recommended. Occupational therapists could play a key role by screening for visual dysfunction and providing patient education in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how outpatient physiotherapy impacts on specific motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) is important for multidisciplinary care, but these points have not been clarified. We investigated the impact of outpatient physiotherapy on individual motor symptoms in PD patients. Fifty-five PD patients participated in the prospective cohort study, which examined the changes in motor symptoms after 90 min of outpatient physiotherapy program (1\u00d7/week for 10 weeks) and at 3 months follow-up. Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor score and tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and axial scores were assessed and compared pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at follow-up. Significant level was set at 0.05. Their MDS-UPDRS motor score and axial score significantly decreased post-intervention and at the follow-up. In the analysis differentiating effects based on the severity of motor symptoms according to the MDS-UPDRS motor score, only the moderate-severe group showed significant decreases in their MDS-UPDRS motor score, bradykinesia, and axial scores post-intervention, as well as in their MDS-UPDRS motor score, rigidity, bradykinesia, and axial scores at the follow-up. These findings suggest the outpatient physiotherapy might provide benefits, particularly in managing axial symptoms and bradykinesia, for community dwelling PD patients with moderate-severe motor symptoms within a multidisciplinary care framework.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) presents with severe motor manifestations and a plethora of non-motor symptoms. Urinary dysfunctions are one of the most common non-motor symptoms of PD patients responsible for reduced quality of life. Urinary extracellular vesicles (EVs) are mostly considered to originate from the cells in the urogenital tract. In this study, we have performed urinary EV analysis in 29 PD cases with varied severity of urinary dysfunction and correlated it with the EV dynamics in 29 age-matched controls. In the studied cases, apart from urinary dysfunction, symptoms of depression, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, sleep, and wakefulness were observed in >75% of the cases. No significant difference in urinary EV size, concentration and urinary EV protein concentration was observed between PD cases with urinary dysfunction and controls. However, a significant positive association was observed between urinary EV concentration and motor scores (",

    "abstract": "Postural instability is a debilitating cardinal symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Its onset marks a pivotal milestone in PD when balance impairment results in disability in many activities of daily living. Early detection of postural instability by non-expensive tools that can be widely used in clinical practice is a key factor in the prevention of falls in widespread population and their negative consequences.\nThis study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a two-dimensional balance assessment to identify the decline in postural control associated with PD progression.\nThis study recruited 55 people with PD, of which 37 were men. Eleven participants were in stage I, twenty-three in stage II, and twenty-one in stage III. According to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) rating scale, three clinical balance tests (Timed Up and Go test, Balance Evaluation Systems Test, and Push and Release test) were carried out in addition to a static stance test recorded by a two-dimensional movement analysis software. Based on kinematic variables generated by the software, a Postural Instability Index (PII) was created, allowing a comparison between its results and those obtained by clinical tests.\nThere were differences between sociodemographic variables directly related to PD evolution. Although all tests were correlated with H&Y stages, only the PII was able to differentiate the first three stages of disease evolution (H&Y I and II: \nBased on the PII index, it was possible to differentiate the postural control decline among the first three stages of PD evolution.

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota and microbial metabolites influence the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system via the microbial-gut-brain axis. Increasing body of evidence suggests that disturbances in the metabolism of peripheral branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases through neuroinflammatory signaling. Preliminary research has shown that longitudinal changes in serum amino acid levels in mouse models of Parkinson's disease (PD) are negatively correlated with disease progression. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the changes in serum levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in a mouse model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD after dietary BCAA supplementation. In our research, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect serum SCFA concentrations. The data were then analyzed with principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. Finally, the correlations of serum SCFA levels with gut and motor function in MPTP-induced PD mice were explored. Propionic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid concentrations were elevated in MPTP + H-BCAA mice compared with MPTP mice. Propionic acid concentration was increased the most, while the isovaleric acid concentration was decreased. Propionic acid concentration was positively correlated with fecal weight and water content and negatively correlated with the pole-climbing duration. In conclusion, these results not only suggest that propionic acid may be a potential biomarker for PD, but also indicate the possibility that PD may be treated by altering circulating levels of SCFA.",

    "abstract": "Internal tremor (IT) occurs in\u00a0>\u00a030\u00a0% of people with Parkinson's Disease (PwPD), but remains largely uninvestigated. Our objective was to describe demographic characteristics and associated symptoms in PwPD who reported IT.\nThis was a matched case-control survey study. Data were from PwPD in the Fox Insight study who answered the Patient Report of Problems (PD-PROP) assessment, a series of open-ended questions that asks people to report in their own words their most bothersome PD-related problems. Cases were those who reported IT\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 times compared with PwPD controls who did not report IT and were matched 1:3 by age and disease duration.\n243 PwPD reported IT as a bothersome problem. Mean (SD) age of cases was 64.9 (9.4) years and disease duration was 3.8 (4.0) years. The proportion of women was greater among cases compared to controls (74\u00a0% vs 47\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). External tremor as a PD-PROP symptom was reported by 98\u00a0% cases and 48\u00a0% controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Several non-motor symptoms were more common among cases than controls, including anxiety (35\u00a0% vs 20\u00a0%), fatigue (41\u00a0% vs 31\u00a0%), and pain (57\u00a0% vs 37\u00a0%). The odds of IT was significantly higher in women when adjusting for anxiety and motor experiences of daily living score (OR 3.07, 95\u00a0%CI 2.14-4.41, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).\nPwPD with IT report a range of associated symptoms, including external tremor, anxiety, and pain. Sex differences in the experience of IT may exist. Studies of IT are needed to understand its etiology and inform clinical care.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to various motor and non-motor symptoms. Several cellular and molecular mechanisms such as alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. They are typically about 21-25 nucleotides in length and are involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. miRNAs like miR-221 play important roles in various biological processes, including development, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. miR-221 promotes neuronal survival against oxidative stress and neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation. Additionally, the role of miR-221 in PD has been investigated in several studies. According to the results of these studies, (1) miR-221 protects PC12 cells against oxidative stress induced by 6-hydroxydopamine; (2) miR-221 prevents Bax/caspase-3 signalling activation by stopping Bim; (3) miR-221 has moderate predictive power for PD; (4) miR-221 directly targets PTEN, and PTEN over-expression eliminates the protective action of miR-221 on p-AKT expression in PC12 cells; and (5) miRNA-221 controls cell viability and apoptosis by manipulating the Akt signalling pathway in PD. This review study suggested that miR-221 has the potential to be used as a clinical biomarker for PD diagnosis and stage assignment.",

    "abstract": "Underserved groups in Parkinson's disease (PD) intervention studies are well recognised. However, it remains unclear whether these exclusions apply to oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) intervention studies in PD. The aim of this scoping review was to identify characteristics of included participants and underserved groups in intervention studies in OD in PD.\nSix electronic databases and one trial registry were searched without language restrictions. Screening of studies and data extraction were independently conducted by four reviewers.\nOf the 26 studies included, none fully reported the participants' ethnicity. Where data was available, 70% of participants were male with a mean age of 68 years, mean PD duration of 7.26 years, median Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2.5, mild OD and mostly recruited from movement disorders clinics. Underserved groups were younger people (< 50 years), older people (\u2265 80 years), women, non-white people, people with severe OD and PD, longer PD duration, other neurological conditions, cognitive impairment/dementia, and depression.\nCareful consideration of all characteristics of individuals with OD in PD is essential for improving the external validity of studies. This will enhance the generalisability of research findings to the broader PD population, ultimately strengthening the evidence base for OD interventions in PD.",

    "abstract": "The study was performed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Benfotiamine (BFT) in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) in rats. The rats were given daily doses of BFT (100\u00a0mg/kg, 200\u00a0mg/kg) through oral administration for 42 days. The rats were given a single bilateral dosage of MPTP (0.1 mg/nostril) intranasally once before the drug treatment to induce PD. On day 42, the animals were subjected to various behavioral paradigms. Post-treatment with BFT for 42 days significantly improved the motor and nonmotor fluctuations of MPTP. The results demonstrated that treatment with BFT ameliorated MPTP-induced disorders in behavior, body balance, and dopamine levels in the mid-brain. Among the post-treated groups, a high dose of BFT was the most effective treatment. Mean values are indicated in \u00b1SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a05***(p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) when compared with the vehicle control, n\u00a0=\u00a05 ### (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) when compared with the disease control; (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) when compared with the BFT per se; (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) when compared with the low dose of BFT; (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) when compared with the high dose of BFT. Our finding suggests that BFT contributed to superior antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory and could be a novel therapeutic method for PD management. In conclusion, BFT could be a potential drug candidate for curbing and preventing PD.",

    "abstract": "The consequences of pain in early onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) remain under appreciated even though pain may exert an increasingly negative impact on patient quality of life as motor and non-motor symptoms worsen. In this prospective study, we investigate the prevalence and severity of pain in 135 Vietnamese patients with EOPD from three medical centers using the King's PD Pain Scale (KPPS), the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Pain was reported by 79.3%. The most common subtype of pain was musculoskeletal (70.1%), followed by nocturnal (43.9%), radicular (43.0%), chronic (42.1%), fluctuation-related (34.6%) and orofacial pain (16.8%). Most patients (74.8%) experienced more than one pain subtype. Fluctuation-related pain and orofacial pain were significantly more prevalent among patients with higher Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stages (3-5) versus lower H&Y stages (1-2). Pain subtype and severity were not significantly related to gender or age of PD onset. Patients with H&Y stages 3-5 had statistically significantly higher KPPS scores for fluctuation-related pain (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018) and radicular pain (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026). Independent associations were found between pain severity and age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028), depression severity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018), perceptual problems/hallucinations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.033) and sexual function (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024). Patients with depression and higher H&Y stages (3-5) had statistically significantly higher mean KPPS scores versus patients without depression and at lower H&Y stages (1-2). Pain may be more common and severe in EOPD patients than previously appreciated. Older age, depression, perceptual problems/hallucinations and sexual dysfunction were independently associated with higher pain severity.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the perceptions and experiences of elderly individuals with Parkinson's disease and formal caregivers regarding spiritual care. A qualitative study was conducted using a descriptive phenomenological design. Fifteen formal caregivers and eight elderly individuals with Parkinson's disease from two nursing homes in T\u00fcrkiye participated in the study. Data were collected through face-to-face individual interviews, and thematic analysis was employed to examine the data. Two themes were obtained from\u00a0the data analysis: (I) spiritual care in nursing homes and (II) living with Parkinson's disease in nursing homes. Findings showed that living in a nursing home with Parkinson's disease affects the spiritual dimensions of elderly individuals and increases their spiritual needs. Additionally, it was found that although formal caregivers implemented a diverse range of practices to address the spiritual care needs of individuals residing in a nursing home, they did not offer any specific spiritual care practices for individuals with Parkinson's disease. Based on our findings, it is considered necessary to have spiritual counselors and formal caregivers with expertise in Parkinson's disease in nursing homes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common late-onset neurodegenerative disease and the predominant cause of movement problems. PD is characterized by motor control impairment by extensive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). This selective dopaminergic neuronal loss is in part triggered by intracellular protein inclusions called Lewy bodies, which are composed mainly of misfolded alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) protein. We previously reported insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) as a key protein downregulated in PD patients. Here we demonstrated that IGF2 treatment or IGF2 overexpression reduced the \u03b1-syn aggregates and their toxicity by IGF2 receptor (IGF2R) activation in cellular PD models. Also, we observed IGF2 and its interaction with IGF2R enhance the \u03b1-syn secretion. To determine the possible IGF2 neuroprotective effect in vivo we used a gene therapy approach in an idiopathic PD model based on \u03b1-syn preformed fibrils intracerebral injection. IGF2 gene therapy revealed a significantly preventing of motor impairment in idiopathic PD model. Moreover, IGF2 expression prevents dopaminergic neuronal loss in the SN together with a decrease in \u03b1-syn accumulation (phospho-\u03b1-syn levels) in the striatum and SN brain region. Furthermore, the IGF2 neuroprotective effect was associated with the prevention of synaptic spines loss in dopaminergic neurons in vivo. The possible mechanism of IGF2 in cell survival effect could be associated with the decrease of the intracellular accumulation of \u03b1-syn and the improvement of dopaminergic synaptic function. Our results identify to IGF2 as a relevant factor for the prevention of \u03b1-syn toxicity in both in vitro and preclinical PD models.",

    "abstract": "Movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) impact oculomotor function - the ability to move the eyes accurately and purposefully to serve a multitude of sensory, cognitive, and secondary motor tasks. Decades of neurophysiological research in monkeys and behavioral studies in humans have characterized the neural basis of healthy oculomotor control. This review links eye movement abnormalities in persons living with PD to the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms and pathways. Building on this foundation, we highlight recent progress in using eye movements to gauge symptom severity, assess treatment effects, and serve as potential precision biomarkers. We conclude that whereas eye movements provide insights into PD mechanisms, based on current evidence they appear to lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to serve as a standalone diagnostic tool. Their full potential may be realized when combined with other disease indicators in big datasets.",

    "abstract": "Pain is a widespread non-motor symptom that presents significant treatment challenges in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Safinamide, a new drug recently introduced for PD treatment, has demonstrated analgesic effects on pain in PD patients, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate the analgesic and anti-PD effect of safinamide, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model was used, and rasagiline as positive control on motor symptoms. Notably, only safinamide alleviated hyperalgesia in MPTP mice. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons revealed hyperexcitability in MPTP mice, which safinamide counteracted in a concentration-dependent manner. The voltage clamp further demonstrated that sodium current in DRG neurons of MPTP mice was enhanced and safinamide reduced sodium current density. RT-qPCR identified upregulated Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 transcripts (Scn9a and Scn10a) in DRG neurons of MPTP mice. Our results suggest that safinamide could relieve hyperalgesia by inhibiting DRG neuron hyperexcitability in MPTP mice.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review investigated the effects of exercise and training on hand dexterity and function outcomes in people with Parkinson disease (PD).\nWe searched 5 databases (MEDLINE Ovid, CINAHL, PEDro, PubMed, Cochrane Database) from inception to October 2022.\nIncluded studies were randomized controlled trials delivering upper limb exercise or training interventions to people with PD and evaluating 1 or more upper limb activity outcomes. Two independent reviewers screened 668 articles for inclusion.\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data relating to study participants, intervention characteristics, and key outcomes. Cochrane Risk of Bias and GRADE tools assessed methodological quality of included studies, and strength of evidence for 3 outcomes: hand dexterity, self-reported hand function, and handwriting performance. Meta-analyses synthesized results for within-hand dexterity and self-reported function.\nEighteen randomized controlled trials (n=704) with low to unclear risk of bias were identified. Experimental interventions varied considerably in their approach and treatment dose, and 3 studies focused on training handwriting. Meta-analysis showed moderate quality evidence of a small positive effect on within-hand dexterity (SMD=0.26; 95% CI 0.07, 0.44). Very low-quality evidence pointed toward a nonsignificant effect on self-reported hand function (SMD=0.67; 95% CI -0.40, 1.75). A narrative review of handwriting interventions showed low quality evidence for improved performance after training.\nThere is moderate certainty of evidence supporting the use of exercise and training to address dexterity problems, but evidence remains unclear for self-reported hand function and handwriting. Our findings suggest that training could employ task-related approaches. Future research should interrogate aspects of clinical practice such as optimal dose and key ingredients for effective interventions.",

    "abstract": "Our study assessed whether banning specific insecticides to reduce the PD burden in three Central California (CA) counties is cost-effective.\nWe applied a cost-effectiveness analysis using a cohort-based Markov model to estimate the impact and costs of banning seven insecticides that were previously associated with PD in these counties as well as mixture exposures to some of these pesticides. We relied for our estimations on the cohort of 65- and 66-year-olds living in these counties who were unaffected by PD at baseline in 2020 and projected their incidence, costs, and reduction in quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY) loss due to developing PD over a 20-year period. We included a shiny app for modeling different scenarios (https://sherlockli.shinyapps.io/pesticide_pd_economics_part_2/).\nAccording to our scenarios, banning insecticides to reduce the occurrence of PD in three Central CA counties was cost-effective relative to not banning insecticides. In the worst-case scenario of exposure to a single pesticide, methomyl, versus none would result in an estimated 205 (95\u00a0% CI: 75, 348) additional PD cases or 12\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 4\u00a0%, 20\u00a0%) increase in PD cases over a 20-year period based on residential proximity to pesticide applications. The increase in PD cases due to methomyl would increase health-related costs by $72.0 million (95\u00a0% CI: $5.5 million, $187.4 million). Each additional PD patient due to methomyl exposure would incur $109,327 (95\u00a0% CI, $5554, $347,757) in costs per QALY loss due to PD. Exposure to methomyl based on workplace proximity to pesticide applications generated similar estimates. The highest PD burden and associated costs would be incurred from exposure to multiple pesticides simultaneously.\nOur study provides an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of banning specific insecticides to reduce PD burden in terms of health-related QALYs and related costs. This information may help policymakers and stakeholders to make decisions concerning the regulation of pesticides.",

    "results": "According to our scenarios, banning insecticides to reduce the occurrence of PD in three Central CA counties was cost-effective relative to not banning insecticides. In the worst-case scenario of exposure to a single pesticide, methomyl, versus none would result in an estimated 205 (95\u00a0% CI: 75, 348) additional PD cases or 12\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 4\u00a0%, 20\u00a0%) increase in PD cases over a 20-year period based on residential proximity to pesticide applications. The increase in PD cases due to methomyl would increase health-related costs by $72.0 million (95\u00a0% CI: $5.5 million, $187.4 million). Each additional PD patient due to methomyl exposure would incur $109,327 (95\u00a0% CI, $5554, $347,757) in costs per QALY loss due to PD. Exposure to methomyl based on workplace proximity to pesticide applications generated similar estimates. The highest PD burden and associated costs would be incurred from exposure to multiple pesticides simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Although the effect of spirituality in chronic disease has been discussed in recent years, little is known about spirituality and spiritual beliefs in Parkinson's disease. In this scoping review, the databases PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched\u00a0and initially identified\u00a0914 studies. A\u00a0total of nine studies\u00a0satisfied the inclusion criteria. It was found age, gender, education level, emotional changes, region of onset of Parkinson's disease, severity of symptoms, quality of life, religion affiliation and acceptance of Parkinson's disease influence spirituality in people with Parkinson's disease. In this context, future studies should focus on the relationship between Parkinson's disease and spirituality.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an extrapyramidal movement disorder associated with a hypokinetic condition generated by impairment in dopaminergic neuronal viability in the nigrostriatal region of the brain. Current medications can only provide symptomatic management; to date, no permanent cure is available. To compensate for this lacuna, researchers are gaining interest in antigen-based therapy, and Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is one of the vaccines\u00a0with a high safety margin that acts by stimulating immunoreactive T-cells in the CNS and reducing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and tumor necrotic factor (TNF-\u03b1) to produce neuroprotection. A previous study reported that BCG exerts a neuroprotective effect against several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.\nThe objective of this study is to explore the neuroprotective effect of the BCG vaccine against the rotenone model of PD.\nRotenone (1.5\u2009mg/kg, s.c) for 28\u2009days, and BCG vaccine (2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nBCG vaccine significantly restored rotenone-induced motor deficits (open field test, narrow beam walk, and rotarod), biochemical levels (GSH, SOD, catalase, MDA, and nitrite), neurotransmitters (dopamine, 5-hydroxy tryptamine, norepinephrine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, hemovanillic acid, and 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid), and levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) in the striatum. It also prevents histopathological changes by reducing eosinophilic lesions in the striatum.\nFrom the results, we conclude that BCG vaccine showed neuroprotection through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect. Thus, in the future, it can be used as a neuroprotective agent for other neurological disorders, including PD.",

    "abstract": "Neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging quantitative analysis methods have provided promising biomarkers that can noninvasively quantify degeneration of the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, there is a need to systematically evaluate the performance of manual and automated quantification approaches. We evaluate whether spatial, signal-intensity, or subject specific abnormality measures using either atlas based or manually traced identification of the substantia nigra better differentiate patients with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls using logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristics. Inference was performed using bootstrap analyses to calculate 95% confidence interval bounds. Pairwise comparisons were performed by generating 10,000 permutations, refitting the models, and calculating a paired difference between metrics. Thirty-one patients with Parkinson's disease and 22 healthy controls were included in the analyses. Signal intensity measures significantly outperformed spatial and subject specific abnormality measures, with the top performers exhibiting excellent ability to differentiate patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls (balanced accuracy\u2009=\u20090.89; area under the curve\u2009=\u20090.81; sensitivity =0.86; and specificity\u2009=\u20090.83). Atlas identified substantia nigra metrics performed significantly better than manual tracing metrics. These results provide clear support for the use of automated signal intensity metrics and additional recommendations. Future work is necessary to evaluate whether the same metrics can best differentiate atypical parkinsonism, perform similarly in de novo and mid-stage cohorts, and serve as longitudinal monitoring biomarkers.",
