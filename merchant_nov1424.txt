    "abstract": "Subterranean mammals representing a single subspecies occurring along an aridity gradient provide an appropriate model for investigating adaptive variation in thermal physiology with varying levels of precipitation and air temperature (Tair). This study examined the thermal physiological adaptations of common mole-rats (Cryptomys hottentotus hottentotus) across five populations along an aridity gradient, challenging the expectation that increased aridity would lead to reduced metabolic rate (MR), lower body temperatures (Tb), and broader thermoneutral zones (TNZ). No significant, consistent differences in MR, Tb, or thermal conductance were observed between populations, suggesting uniform thermoregulatory mechanisms across habitats. Instead, behavioral strategies such as huddling and torpor may play a more prominent role than physiological adaptations in managing temperature regulation and water balance. The study also observed osmoregulatory differences, with populations employing distinct behavioral cooling strategies in response to water availability. These results underscore the need for further research into the responses of subterranean species to climate change, particularly in understanding how increasing global temperatures and aridification might influence species distribution if they lack the physiological capacity to adapt to future climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "We determined the intersubject association between the rhythmic entrainment abilities of human subjects during a synchronization-continuation tapping task (SCT) and the macro- and microstructural properties of their superficial (SWM) and deep (DWM) white matter. Diffusion-weighted images were obtained from 32 subjects who performed the SCT with auditory or visual metronomes and five tempos ranging from 550 to 950 ms. We developed a method to determine the density of short-range fibers that run underneath the cortical mantle, interconnecting nearby cortical regions (U-fibers). Notably, individual differences in the density of U-fibers in the right audiomotor system were correlated with the degree of phase accuracy between the stimuli and taps across subjects. These correlations were specific to the synchronization epoch with auditory metronomes and tempos around 1.5 Hz. In addition, a significant association was found between phase accuracy and the density and bundle diameter of the corpus callosum (CC), forming an interval-selective map where short and long intervals were behaviorally correlated with the anterior and posterior portions of the CC. These findings suggest that the structural properties of the SWM and DWM in the audiomotor system support the tapping synchronization abilities of subjects, as cortical U-fiber density is linked to the preferred tapping tempo and the bundle properties of the CC define an interval-selective topography.",

    "abstract": "The global population is increasingly reliant on vaccines to maintain population health with billions of doses used annually in immunisation programmes. Substandard and falsified vaccines are becoming more prevalent, caused by both the degradation of authentic vaccines but also deliberately falsified vaccine products. These threaten public health, and the increase in vaccine falsification is now a major concern. There is currently no coordinated global infrastructure or screening methods to monitor vaccine supply chains. In this study, we developed and validated a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) workflow that used open-source machine learning and statistical analysis to distinguish authentic and falsified vaccines. We validated the method on two different MALDI-MS instruments used worldwide for clinical applications. Our results show that multivariate data modelling and diagnostic mass spectra can be used to distinguish authentic and falsified vaccines providing proof-of-concept that MALDI-MS can be used as a screening tool to monitor vaccine supply chains.",

    "abstract": "Genetic adaptation is the change of a population toward a phenotype that best fits the present ecological conditions of the environment it inhabits. As environmental conditions change, allele frequencies shift, resulting in different populations of the same species possessing genetic variation and divergent phenotypes. Cooperatively breeding common mole-rats (Cryptomys hottentotus hottentotus) inhabit environments along an aridity gradient in South Africa, which provides an opportunity for local genetic adaptations to occur. Using one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome b) and 3,540 SNP loci across the whole genome, we determined the phylogenetic relationship, population structure and genetic diversity of five populations of C. h. hottentotus located along an aridity gradient. Mitochondrial data identified population-specific clades that were less distinct in the two mesic populations, potentially indicating historical or recent gene flow, or the retention of ancestral haplotypes. Arid and semi-arid populations formed a distinct cluster from the non-arid populations. Genetic diversity and gene flow were higher in arid-dwelling individuals, suggesting greater connectivity and interactions between colonies in arid regions in comparison to mesic ones. Using an Aridity Index, we determined that isolation by environment, rather than isolation by geographical distance, best explains the genetic distance between the populations. Further analyses using target loci may determine if there are differing underlying genetic adaptations among populations of C. h. hottentotus. These analyses could help unravel population differences in response to environmental factors within a subspecies of bathyergid mole-rat and determine the adaptive capacity of this small nonmigratory subterranean rodent species in response to aridification in the face of climate change.",

    "abstract": "The measurement of time in the subsecond scale is critical for many sophisticated behaviors, yet its neural underpinnings are largely unknown. Recent neurophysiological experiments from our laboratory have shown that the neural activity in the medial premotor areas (MPC) of macaques can represent different aspects of temporal processing. During single interval categorization, we found that preSMA encodes a subjective category limit by reaching a peak of activity at a time that divides the set of test intervals into short and long. We also observed neural signals associated with the category selected by the subjects and the reward outcomes of the perceptual decision. On the other hand, we have studied the behavioral and neurophysiological basis of rhythmic timing. First, we have shown in different tapping tasks that macaques are able to produce predictively and accurately intervals that are cued by auditory or visual metronomes or when intervals are produced internally without sensory guidance. In addition, we found that the rhythmic timing mechanism in MPC is governed by different layers of neural clocks. Next, the instantaneous activity of single cells shows ramping activity that encodes the elapsed or remaining time for a tapping movement. In addition, we found MPC neurons that build neural sequences, forming dynamic patterns of activation that flexibly cover all the produced interval depending on the tapping tempo. This rhythmic neural clock resets on every interval providing an internal representation of pulse. Furthermore, the MPC cells show mixed selectivity, encoding not only elapsed time, but also the tempo of the tapping and the serial order element in the rhythmic sequence. Hence, MPC can map different task parameters, including the passage of time, using different cell populations. Finally, the projection of the time varying activity of MPC hundreds of cells into a low dimensional state space showed circular neural trajectories whose geometry represented the internal pulse and the tapping tempo. Overall, these findings support the notion that MPC is part of the core timing mechanism for both single interval and rhythmic timing, using neural clocks with different encoding principles, probably to flexibly encode and mix the timing representation with other task parameters.",

    "abstract": "Time is a critical variable that organisms must be able to measure in order to survive in a constantly changing environment. Initially, this paper describes the myriad of contexts where time is estimated or predicted and suggests that timing is not a single process and probably depends on a set of different neural mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, the explosion of neurophysiological and imaging studies in the last 10\u00a0years suggests that different brain circuits and neural mechanisms are involved in the ability to tell and use time to control behavior across contexts. Then, we develop a conceptual framework that defines time as a family of different phenomena and propose a taxonomy with sensory, perceptual, motor, and sensorimotor timing as the pillars of temporal processing in the range of hundreds of milliseconds.",

    "abstract": "A vast array of challenging environments are inhabited by mammals, such as living in confined spaces where oxygen levels are likely to be low. Species can exhibit adaptations in basal metabolic rate (BMR) to exploit such unique niches. In this study we use 801 species to determine the relationship between BMR and burrow use in mammals. We included pre-existing data for mammalian BMR and 16 life history traits. Overall, mammalian BMR is dictated primarily by environmental ambient temperature. There were no significant differences in BMR of terrestrial, semi-fossorial and fossorial mammals, suggesting that species occupying a subterranean niche do not exhibit baseline metabolic costs on account of their burrowing lifestyle. Fossorial mammals likely show instantaneous metabolic responses to low oxygen in tunnels, rather than exhibit adaptive long-term responses in their BMR.",

    "abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in identifying the biological underpinnings of human time perception, for which purpose research in non-human primates (NHP) is common. Although previous work, based on behaviour, suggests that similar mechanisms support time perception across species, the neural correlates of time estimation in humans and NHP have not been directly compared. In this study, we assess whether brain evoked responses during a time categorization task are similar across species. Specifically, we assess putative differences in post-interval evoked potentials as a function of perceived duration in human EEG (N = 24) and local field potential (LFP) and spike recordings in pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) of one monkey. Event-related potentials (ERPs) differed significantly after the presentation of the temporal interval between \"short\" and \"long\" perceived durations in both species, even when the objective duration of the stimuli was the same. Interestingly, the polarity of the reported ERPs was reversed for incorrect trials (i.e., the ERP of a \"long\" stimulus looked like the ERP of a \"short\" stimulus when a time categorization error was made). Hence, our results show that post-interval potentials reflect the perceived (rather than the objective) duration of the presented time interval in both NHP and humans. In addition, firing rates in monkey's pre-SMA also differed significantly between short and long perceived durations and were reversed in incorrect trials. Together, our results show that common neural mechanisms support time categorization in NHP and humans, thereby suggesting that NHP are a good model for investigating human time perception.",

    "abstract": "There is limited evidence to support definite clinical outcomes of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy in chronic kidney disease (CKD). By identifying the important variables associated with clinical outcomes following DOAC administration in patients in different stages of CKD, this study aims to assess this evidence gap.\nAn anonymised dataset comprising 97,413 patients receiving DOAC therapy in a tertiary health setting was systematically extracted from the multidimensional electronic health records and prepared for analysis. Machine learning classifiers were applied to the prepared dataset to select the important features which informed covariate selection in multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nFor both CKD and non-CKD DOAC users, features such as length of stay, treatment days, and age were ranked highest for relevance to adverse outcomes like death and stroke. Patients with Stage 3a CKD had significantly higher odds of ischaemic stroke (OR 2.45, 95% Cl: 2.10-2.86; p\u2009=\u20090.001) and lower odds of all-cause mortality (OR 0.87, 95% Cl: 0.79-0.95; p\u2009=\u20090.001) on apixaban therapy. In patients with CKD (Stage 5) receiving apixaban, the odds of death were significantly lowered (OR 0.28, 95% Cl: 0.14-0.58; p\u2009=\u20090.001), while the effect on ischaemic stroke was insignificant.\nA positive effect of DOAC therapy was observed in advanced CKD. Key factors influencing clinical outcomes following DOAC administration in patients in different stages of CKD were identified. These are crucial for designing more advanced studies to explore safer and more effective DOAC therapy for the population.",

    "abstract": "Substandard (including degraded) and falsified (SF) vaccines are a relatively neglected issue with serious global implications for public health. This has been highlighted during the rapid and widespread rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. There has been increasing interest in devices to screen for SF non-vaccine medicines including tablets and capsules to empower inspectors and standardise surveillance. However, there has been very limited published research focussed on repurposing or developing new devices for screening for SF vaccines. To our knowledge, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have not been used for this purpose but have important potential for detecting falsified vaccines. We performed a proof-in-principle study to investigate their diagnostic accuracy using a diverse range of RDT-vaccine/falsified vaccine surrogate pairs. In an initial assessment, we demonstrated the utility of four RDTs in detecting seven vaccines. Subsequently, the four RDTs were evaluated by three blinded assessors with seven vaccines and four falsified vaccines surrogates. The results provide preliminary data that RDTs could be used by multiple international organisations, national medicines regulators and vaccine manufacturers/distributors to screen for falsified vaccines in supply chains, aligned with the WHO global 'Prevent, Detect and Respond' strategy.",

    "abstract": "Effective behavior often requires synchronizing our actions with changes in the environment. Rhythmic changes in the environment are easy to predict, and we can readily time our actions to them. Yet, how the brain encodes and maintains rhythms is not known. Here, we trained primates to internally maintain rhythms of different tempos and performed large-scale recordings of neuronal activity across the sensory-motor hierarchy. Results show that maintaining rhythms engages multiple brain areas, including visual, parietal, premotor, prefrontal, and hippocampal regions. Each recorded area displayed oscillations in firing rates and oscillations in broadband local field potential power that reflected the temporal and spatial characteristics of an internal metronome, which flexibly encoded fast, medium, and slow tempos. The presence of widespread metronome-related activity, in the absence of stimuli and motor activity, suggests that internal simulation of stimuli and actions underlies timekeeping and rhythm maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Sustaining a healthy weight is a challenge and obesity, with associated risk of co-morbidities, is a major public health concern. Bariatric surgery has shown a great promise for many where pharmacological and lifestyle interventions failed to work. However, challenges and limitations associated with bariatric surgery has pushed the demand for less invasive, reversible (anatomically) interventions, such as intragastric balloons (IGBs).\nThis review critically appraises IGBs used in the past, present, and those in clinical trials, discussing the device designs, limitations, placement and removal techniques, patient eligibility, efficacy, and safety issues.\nSeveral intragastric balloons were developed over the years that brought excitement to patients and healthcare professionals alike. Albeit good efficacy, there had been several safety issues reported with IGBs such as spontaneous deflation, intestinal occlusion, gut perforation, and mucosal ulcerations. This led to evolution of IGBs design; device material, filling mechanism, fluid type, inflation volume, and further innovations to ease ingestion and removal of device. There are some IGB devices under development aimed to swallow like a conventional pill and excrete naturally through defecation, however, how successful they will be in clinical practice in terms of their efficacy and tolerability remains to be seen in the future.",

    "abstract": "Through predictable pharmacokinetics-including a convenient fixed-dose regimen, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over previous treatments in anticoagulation for various indications. However, the association between higher body weight and the risk of adverse consequences is not well studied among DOAC users. We aim to explore the association of body weight and adverse clinical outcomes in DOAC users.\nA total of 97,413 anonymised DOAC users in a tertiary care setting were identified following structured queries on the electronic health records (EHRs) to extract the feature-rich anonymised dataset. The prepared dataset was analysed, and the features identified with machine learning (ML) informed the adjustments of covariates in the multivariate regression analysis to examine the association. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to evaluate the mortality benefits of DOACs.\nAmong DOAC users, the odds of adverse clinical outcomes, such as clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB), ischaemic stroke, all-cause mortality, and prolonged hospital stay, were lower in patients with overweight, obesity, or morbid obesity than in patients with normal body weight. The odds of ischaemic stroke (OR 0.42, 95% CI: 0.36-0.88, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and all-cause mortality (OR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81-0.95, p\u2009=\u20090.001) were lower in patients with morbid obesity than in patients with normal body weight. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, apixaban was associated with a significantly lower rate of mortality overall and in obesity and overweight subgroups than other DOACs (p\u2009<\u20090.001). However, rivaroxaban performed better than apixaban in the morbid obesity subgroup (p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nThis study shows the positive effects of DOAC therapy on clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with high body weight. However, this still needs validation by further studies particularly among patients with morbid obesity.",

    "abstract": "Preventing, detecting, and responding to substandard and falsified vaccines is of critical importance for ensuring the safety, efficacy, and public trust in vaccines. This is of heightened importance in context of public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in which extreme world-wide shortages of vaccines provided a fertile ground for exploitation by falsifiers. Here, a proof-of-concept study explored the feasibility of using a handheld Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy (SORS) device to authenticate COVID-19 vaccines through rapid analysis of unopened vaccine vials. The results show that SORS can verify the chemical identity of dominant excipients non-invasively through vaccine vial walls. The ability of SORS to identify potentially falsified COVID-19 vaccines was demonstrated by measurement of surrogates for falsified vaccines contained in vaccine vials. In all cases studied, the SORS technique was able to differentiate between surrogate samples from the genuine COVISHIELD\u2122 vaccine. The genuine vaccines tested included samples from six batches across two manufacturing sites to account for any potential variations between batches or manufacturing sites. Batch and manufacturing site variations were insignificant. In conjunction with existing security features, for example on labels and packaging, SORS provided an intrinsic molecular fingerprint of the dominant excipients of the vaccines. The technique could be extended to other COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 vaccines, as well as other liquid medicines. As handheld and portable SORS devices are commercially available and widely used for other purposes, such as airport security, they are rapidly deployable non-invasive screening tools for vaccine authentication.",

    "abstract": "The neural substrate for beat extraction and response entrainment to rhythms is not fully understood. Here we analyze the activity of medial premotor neurons in monkeys performing isochronous tapping guided by brief flashing stimuli or auditory tones. The population dynamics shared the following properties across modalities: the circular dynamics of the neural trajectories form a regenerating loop for every produced interval; the trajectories converge in similar state space at tapping times resetting the clock; and the tempo of the synchronized tapping is encoded in the trajectories by a combination of amplitude modulation and temporal scaling. Notably, the modality induces displacement in the neural trajectories in the auditory and visual subspaces without greatly altering the time-keeping mechanism. These results suggest that the interaction between the medial premotor cortex's amodal internal representation of pulse and a modality-specific external input generates a neural rhythmic clock whose dynamics govern rhythmic tapping execution across senses.",

    "abstract": "Beat induction is the cognitive ability that allows humans to listen to a regular pulse in music and move in synchrony with it. Although auditory rhythmic cues induce more consistent synchronization than flashing visual metronomes, this auditory-visual asymmetry can be canceled by visual moving stimuli. Here, we investigated whether the naturalness of visual motion or its kinematics could provide a synchronization advantage over flashing metronomes. Subjects were asked to tap in sync with visual metronomes defined by vertically accelerating/decelerating motion, either congruent or not with natural gravity; horizontally accelerating/decelerating motion; or flashing stimuli. We found that motion kinematics was the predominant factor determining rhythm synchronization, as accelerating moving metronomes in any cardinal direction produced more precise and predictive tapping than decelerating or flashing conditions. Our results support the notion that accelerating visual metronomes convey a strong sense of beat, as seen in the cueing movements of an orchestra director.",

    "abstract": "The naked mole-rat of the family Bathyergidae has been the showpiece for ageing research as they contradict the traditional understanding of the oxidative stress theory of ageing. Some other bathyergids also possess increased lifespans, but there has been a remarkable lack of comparison between species within the family Bathyergidae. This study set out to investigate how plasma oxidative markers (total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and the oxidative stress index (OSI)) differ between five species and three subspecies of bathyergids, differing in their maximum lifespan potential (MLSP), resting metabolic rate, aridity index (AI), and sociality. We also investigated how oxidative markers may differ between captive and wild-caught mole-rats. Our results reveal that increased TOS, TAC, and OSI are associated with increased MLSP. This pattern is more prevalent in the social-living species than the solitary-living species. We also found that oxidative variables decreased with an increasing AI and that wild-caught individuals typically have higher antioxidants. We speculate that the correlation between higher oxidative markers and MLSP is due to the hypoxia-tolerance of the mole-rats investigated. Hormesis (the biphasic response to oxidative stress promoting protection) is a likely mechanism behind the increased oxidative markers observed and promotes longevity in some members of the Bathyergidae family.",

    "abstract": "Many animal species show comparable abilities to detect basic rhythms and produce rhythmic behavior. Yet, the capacities to process complex rhythms and synchronize rhythmic behavior appear to be species-specific: vocal learning animals can, but some primates might not. This discrepancy is of high interest as there is a putative link between rhythm processing and the development of sophisticated sensorimotor behavior in humans. Do our closest ancestors show comparable endogenous dispositions to sample the acoustic environment in the absence of task instructions and training? We recorded EEG from macaque monkeys and humans while they passively listened to isochronous equitone sequences. Individual- and trial-level analyses showed that macaque monkeys' and humans' delta-band neural oscillations encoded and tracked the timing of auditory events. Further, mu- (8-15\u00a0Hz) and beta-band (12-20\u00a0Hz) oscillations revealed the superimposition of varied accentuation patterns on a subset of trials. These observations suggest convergence in the encoding and dynamic attending of temporal regularities in the acoustic environment, bridging a gap in the phylogenesis of rhythm cognition.",

    "abstract": "As science and technology evolve, there is an increasing need for promotion of international scientific exchange. Collaborations, while offering substantial opportunities for scientists and benefit to society, also present challenges for those working with animal models, such as non-human primates (NHPs). Diversity in regulation of animal research is sometimes mistaken for the absence of common international welfare standards. Here, the ethical and regulatory protocols for 13 countries that have guidelines in place for biomedical research involving NHPs were assessed with a focus on neuroscience. Review of the variability and similarity in trans-national NHP welfare regulations extended to countries in Asia, Europe and North America. A tabulated resource was established to advance solution-oriented discussions and scientific collaborations across borders. Our aim is to better inform the public and other stakeholders. Through cooperative efforts to identify and analyze information with reference to evidence-based discussion, the proposed key ingredients may help to shape and support a more informed, open framework. This framework and resource can be expanded further for biomedical research in other countries.",

    "abstract": "Based on prior findings of content-specific beta synchronization in working memory and decision making, we hypothesized that beta oscillations support the (re-)activation of cortical representations by mediating neural ensemble formation. We found that beta activity in monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) reflects the content of a stimulus in relation to the task context, regardless of its objective properties. In duration- and distance-categorization tasks, we changed the boundary between categories from one block of trials to the next. We found that two distinct beta-band frequencies were consistently associated with the two relative categories, with activity in these bands predicting the animals' responses. We characterized beta at these frequencies as transient bursts, and showed that dlPFC and preSMA are connected via these distinct frequency channels. These results support the role of beta in forming neural ensembles, and further show that such ensembles synchronize at different beta frequencies.",

This study seeks to bridge this evidence gap by identifying the factors associated with clinical outcomes following the dosing of DOACs in morbidly obese patients.\nA data-driven observational study was carried out using supervised machine learning (ML) models with a dataset extracted from electronic health records and preprocessed. Following 70%:30% partitioning of the overall dataset via stratified sampling, the selected ML classifiers (e.g., random forest, decision trees, bootstrap aggregation) were applied to the training dataset (70%). The outcomes of the models were evaluated against the test dataset (30%). Multivariate regression analysis explored the association between DOAC regimens and clinical outcomes.\nA sample of 4,275 morbidly obese patients was extracted and analysed. The decision trees, random forest, and bootstrap aggregation classifiers achieved acceptable (excellent) values of precision, recall, and F1 scores in terms of their contribution to clinical outcomes. The length of stay, treatment days, and age were ranked highest for relevance to mortality and stroke. Among DOAC regimens, apixaban 2.5\u00a0mg twice daily ranked highest for its association with mortality, increasing the mortality risk by 43% (odds ratio [OR] 1.430, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.181-1.732, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). On the other hand, apixaban 5\u00a0mg twice daily reduced the odds of mortality by 25% (OR 0.751, 95% CI 0.632-0.905, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) but increased the odds of stroke events. No clinically relevant non-major bleeding events occurred in this group.\nData-driven approaches can identify key factors associated with clinical outcomes following the dosing of DOACs in morbidly obese patients. This will help design further studies to explore well tolerated and effective DOAC doses for morbidly obese patients.",

    "abstract": "The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) in response to the public outcry on increasing medicines prices in the country issued notifications to direct healthcare professionals to prescribe medicines with their generic names. Like DRAP, many regulators in the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are also inspiring from the west to legally enforce generic prescribing in a bid to reduce the out-of-pocket public expenditures. However, there are pitfalls in the LMICs drug regulatory framework, which if left unaddressed can severely jeopardise the foreseen benefits of medicines prescribing by generic names. This article critically appraises the impact of prescribing by generic names regulations in LMICs and highlights the key considerations that are vital to address before legally enforcing generic prescribing. The ethics, regulatory compliance, and good governance are the key to success; better generics for a better tomorrow.",

    "abstract": "This article aims to highlight the dosing issues of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with renal impairment and/or obesity in an attempt to develop solutions employing advanced data-driven techniques. DOACs have become widely accepted by clinicians worldwide because of their superior clinical profiles, more predictable pharmacokinetics, and hence more convenient dosing relative to other anticoagulants. However, the optimal dosing of DOACs in extreme bodyweight\u00a0 patients and patients with renal impairment is difficult to achieve using the conventional dosing approach. The standard dosing approach (fixed-dose) is based on limited data from clinical studies. The existing formulae (models) for determining the appropriate doses for these patient groups leads to suboptimal dosing. This problem of mis-dosing is worsened by the lack of standardized laboratory parameters for monitoring the exposure to DOACs in renal failure and extreme bodyweight patients. Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) encompasses a range of techniques like machine learning and pharmacometrics modelling, which could uncover key variables and relationships as well as shed more light on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of DOACs in patients with extreme bodyweight or renal impairment. Ultimately, this individualized approach-if implemented in clinical practice-could optimise dosing for the DOACs for better safety and efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Climate change has caused aridification which can alter habitat vegetation, soil and precipitation profiles potentially affecting resident species. Vegetation and soil profiles are important for subterranean mole-rats as increasing aridity causes soils to become harder and geophytes less evenly distributed, and the inter-geophyte distance increases. Mole-rats obtain all water and dietary requirements from geophytes, and thus digging in harder soils may amplify stressors (hyperthermia, dehydration- or exercise-induced damage). This study assessed the oxidative status of the wild common mole-rat along an aridity gradient (arid, semi-arid and mesic). Kidney and liver oxidative markers, including total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), oxidative stress index (OSI), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured. Liver oxidative status did not demonstrate any significance with the degree of the aridity gradient. Aridity affected the TAC and OSI of the kidney, with individuals in the most arid habitats possessing the highest TAC. The evolution of increased group size to promote survival in African mole-rats in arid habitats may have resulted in the additional benefit of reduced oxidative stress in the kidneys. The SOD activity of the kidneys was higher than that of the liver with lower oxidative damage, suggesting this species pre-emptively protects its kidneys as these are important for water balance and retention.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak and ongoing transmission of Zika virus provided an opportunity to strengthen essential newborn care and early childhood development systems through collaboration with the US Agency for International Development Applying Science to Strengthen and Improve Systems (USAID ASSIST). The objective was to create a system of sustainable training dissemination which improves newborn care-related quality indicators in the context of Zika.\nFrom 2018-19, USAID ASSIST supported a series of technical assistance visits by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in four Caribbean countries to strengthen the clinical capacity in care of children potentially affected by Zika through dissemination of Essential Care for Every Baby (ECEB), teaching QI methodology, coaching visits, and development of clinical care guidelines. ECEB was adapted to emphasize physical exam findings related to Zika. The first series of workshops were facilitated by AAP technical advisors and the second series were facilitated by the newly trained local champions. Quality of care was monitored with performance indicators at 134 health facilities.\nA repeated measures (pre-post) ANOVA was conducted, revealing significant pre-post knowledge gains [F(1)\u2009=\u2009197.9, p\u2009<\u20090.001] on knowledge check scores. Certain performance indicators related to ECEB practices demonstrated significant changes and midline shift on the run chart in four countries.\nECEB can be adapted to incorporate important local practices, causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and differing healthcare system structures, which, as one part of a larger technical assistance package, leads to improved performance of health systems.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the vaccination status and factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women in the largest province of Pakistan. A multicentric, prospective, survey-based study using an interviewer-administered tool was conducted among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics between 1 December 2021 through 30 January 2022 across seven hospitals in Pakistan. The healthcare professionals providing care at the participating hospitals administered the survey. Four hundred and five pregnant women fully consented and completed the study. The majority of the study participants (70.6%, n = 286) were aged between 25 and 34 and had a previous successful pregnancy history. More than half of the study participants (56.0%, n = 227) did not receive COVID-19 vaccination at the time of data collection despite their family members (93.9%, n = 372) had already received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Among those who received COVID-19 vaccination (n = 173), vaccine efficacy, protection for the foetus, and risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalisation were the main driving factors for vaccine hesitancy. The majority of the unvaccinated women (77.8%, n = 182) had no intention of receiving the vaccine. However, more than two-thirds (85.7%, n = 342) consulted the doctor about COVID-19 vaccines, and most were recommended to receive COVID-19 vaccines by the doctors (80.7%, n = 280). Women were significantly more likely to be vaccinated if they had employment (odds ratio [OR] 4.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.31-8.64) compared with their counterparts who were homemakers, consulted their doctors (OR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.04-0.35), and if they did not have pregnancy-related issues (OR 6.02, 95% CI: 2.36-15.33). In this study, vaccine hesitancy was prevalent, and vaccine uptake was low among pregnant women. Education and employment did impact COVID vaccination uptake, emphasising the need for more targeted efforts to enhance the trust in vaccines.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism of action of excipients eliciting sex differences in drug bioavailability is poorly understood. In this study, the excipients Cremophor RH 40 (PEG 40 hydrogenated castor oil), Poloxamer 188 (2-methyloxirane) and Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene (80) sorbitan monooleate) were screened at 0.07 - 5% concentrations for their effect on ranitidine bioavailability in male and female Wistar rats. We show that all excipient concentrations significantly increased ranitidine bioavailability in male, but not female, rats. The effect of these excipients on the intestinal efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and multi-drug resistant protein 2 (MRP2) were also monitored. Measured by ELISA assay, in male rats, peak reductions in intestinal P-gp protein expression occurred in the presence of 1% Cremophor RH 40 and Poloxamer 188 and 0.5% Tween 80. In contrast, no distinct changes were observed in female intestinal P-gp expression. Unlike P-gp, all excipients had a positive effect on MRP2 protein expression - albeit only in males - in a concentration-dependent manner. The excipients did not modulate intestinal BCRP protein expression in either sex. Endogenous hormones and a nuclear receptor (testosterone, oestradiol and pregnane X receptor; PXR) that are purported to regulate intestinal efflux membrane transporter expression were also quantified. In the presence of all excipients, testosterone levels significantly elevated in males, although PXR levels reduced at similar rates in both sexes. No significant effects were identified in oestradiol levels in male and female rats. It is clear that excipients are not inert and their pathway for modulating drug response is multi-dimensional and specific between sexes. This study showed that excipients increased drug bioavailability of a P-gp drug substrate due to its reductive effect on intestinal P-gp expression; we propose that this link may be due to the excipients modulating fundamental testosterone levels. Understanding the implication of excipients on intestinal physiology and hormone levels can therefore improve pharmaceutical design, clinical efficacy and instigate next generation personalised, sex-specific formulations.",

The provincial Government in Punjab approved a similar initiative in Punjab, the largest province (by population) of the country, and the program was later rolled out in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad and Jammu Kashmir (AJK), Gilgit Baltistan (GB), Sindh, and Baluchistan provinces leaping into the nation-wide coverage. This article provides a current overview of the UHC initiative in Pakistan, analyses its progress in appraising key milestones, and makes recommendations to achieve a robust universal health coverage across Pakistan.",

The mysterious virus was touted as a new variant of the dengue virus by the local health experts in Pakistan as most patients were tested negative for the dengue virus test despite presenting with dengue-like symptoms. In this letter, we have critically appraised the current situation in Pakistan in an attempt to explain the science and mechanism behind recent dengue-like outbreak, offered suggestions on diagnostic tests and provided recommendations to improve medication safety in Pakistan.",

    "abstract": "The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in UK has recently advised that COVID vaccines in 5-11-year-old children is non-essential. This has created an outrage among some healthcare professionals who believed a mandatory vaccination program for all ages would be more beneficial. The JCVI decision sounds strange to many public health professionals in light of the existing practices with regards to other children's vaccines, for instance flu jabs. The child immunisation should help reduce suffering in children, prevent virus spread in communities, reduce school off days, prevent the loss of quality of life in children and the sufferings from a preventable infection. Therefore, why not support essential COVID vaccines for young children like we do for the flu? This article explains the underlying mechanisms of currently deployed COVID vaccines, the cellular, humoral and mucosal\u00a0immunity. The article explains why we should not rush mass-immunising young children and a delayed immunisation can be beneficial in offering a more suitable vaccine formulation for children, such as the nasal COVID vaccine, that is going to be available soon and will provide the sought-after protection against\u00a0infection and transmission,\u00a0 the public health benefit from the mass immunisation program in children.",

    "abstract": "We describe the first intraprosthetic dislocations of a 22 mm head in a dual mobility hip replacement in the literature. This case emphasises the importance of information gathering and planning when dealing with arthroplasty complications. Furthermore, it highlights the necessity of adequate muscle relaxation and analgesia when dealing with hip dislocations. A 78-year-old patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with a spontaneous dislocation of her left dual-mobility total hip replacement 3 months after first-stage revision surgery for infection. Reduction via manipulation under analgesia was then attempted in the ED but was ultimately unsuccessful; an iatrogenic intraprosthetic dislocation of the polyethylene liner was sustained. Several factors may have contributed to liner dislocation: a failure to appreciate the implant type, multiple manipulations in ED were attempted under analgesia, but no sedation or muscle relaxation was administered to the patient. The patient subsequently underwent revision surgery.",

    "abstract": "The advent of clinically adapted machine learning algorithms can solve numerous problems ranging from disease diagnosis and prognosis to therapy recommendations. This systematic review examines the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms and evaluates the progress made to date towards their implementation in clinical practice.\nSystematic searching of databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and WHO Covid-19 database) to identify original articles published between January 2011 and October 2021. Studies reporting ML techniques in clinical practice involving humans and ML algorithms with a performance metric were considered.\nOf 873 unique articles identified, 36 studies were eligible for inclusion. The XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) algorithm showed the highest potential for clinical applications (n\u00a0=\u00a07 studies); this was followed jointly by random forest algorithm, logistic regression, and the support vector machine, respectively (n\u00a0=\u00a05 studies). Prediction of outcomes (n\u00a0=\u00a033), in particular Inflammatory diseases (n\u00a0=\u00a07) received the most attention followed by cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders (n\u00a0=\u00a05 for each) and Covid-19 (n\u00a0=\u00a04). Thirty-three out of the thirty-six included studies passed more than 50% of the selected quality assessment criteria in the TRIPOD checklist. In contrast, none of the studies could achieve an ideal overall bias rating of 'low' based on the PROBAST checklist. In contrast, only three studies showed evidence of the deployment of ML algorithm(s) in clinical practice.\nML is potentially a reliable tool for clinical decision support. Although advocated widely in clinical practice, work is still in progress to validate clinically adapted ML algorithms. Improving quality standards, transparency, and interpretability of ML models will further lower the barriers to acceptability.",

    "abstract": "One hundred years on from the initial discovery of insulin, we take this opportunity to reflect on the scientific discoveries that have improved so many lives. From its original crude form, insulin therapy has improved significantly over the past century. Despite this, hypoglycaemia remains an ever-present fear for people with Type 1 diabetes. As such, it is essential that research now looks to minimise the frequency and severity of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and its complications, some of which can be life-threatening. Over the last century, one thing that has become apparent is the success and need for translational diabetes research. From its origin in dogs, insulin treatment has revolutionised the lives of those with Type 1 diabetes through the coordinated effort of scientists and clinicians. In this review, we recount the more recent research that uses a mouse-to-man approach, specifically in hypoglycaemia research.",

    "abstract": "Lactoferrin (Lf) is one of the key immunomodulatory substances found naturally in various body fluids, such as saliva, tears, and breast milk, and forms a vital part of the innate defense against invading pathogens. Various studies have demonstrated antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties of Lf and its protective role against respiratory tract infections (RTIs). The present meta-analysis aims to elucidate the association of Lf administration in reducing the risk of RTIs by systematically reviewing the data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\nWe systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline & CINAHL, Turning Research into Practice (TRIP), ProQuest Theses & Dissertations Databases, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) from inception till March 15, 2021. The primary outcome measure was a reduction in respiratory illness; decrease in frequency, symptoms, and duration. Random-effects model was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We used Cochrane's RoB-2 to appraise the risk of bias of included RCTs.\nA total of nine RCTs were eligible for this review, of which six were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, two studies demonstrated a high risk of bias. The meta-analysis revealed a significantly reduced odds of developing respiratory infections with the use of Lf relative to the control (pooled odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.57; 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 0.74, n\u00a0=\u00a01,194), with sufficient evidence against the hypothesis of 'no significant difference' at the current sample size.\nThe administration of Lf shows promising efficacy in reducing the risk of RTIs. Current evidence also favours Lf fortification of infant formula. Lf may also have a beneficial role in managing symptoms and recovery of patients suffering from RTIs and may have potential for use as an adjunct in COVID-19, however this warrants further evidence from a large well-designed RCT.",

    "abstract": "Humans perceive and spontaneously move to one or several levels of periodic pulses (a meter, for short) when listening to musical rhythm, even when the sensory input does not provide prominent periodic cues to their temporal location. Here, we review a multi-levelled framework to understanding how external rhythmic inputs are mapped onto internally represented metric pulses. This mapping is studied using an approach to quantify and directly compare representations of metric pulses in signals corresponding to sensory inputs, neural activity and behaviour (typically body movement). Based on this approach, recent empirical evidence can be drawn together into a conceptual framework that unpacks the phenomenon of meter into four levels. Each level highlights specific functional processes that critically enable and shape the mapping from sensory input to internal meter. We discuss the nature, constraints and neural substrates of these processes, starting with fundamental mechanisms investigated in macaque monkeys that enable basic forms of mapping between simple rhythmic stimuli and internally represented metric pulse. We propose that human evolution has gradually built a robust and flexible system upon these fundamental processes, allowing more complex levels of mapping to emerge in musical behaviours. This approach opens promising avenues to understand the many facets of rhythmic behaviours across individuals and species. This article is part of the theme issue 'Synchrony and rhythm interaction: from the brain to behavioural ecology'.",

    "abstract": "Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady said, 'Why can't a woman be more like a man?' Perhaps unintended, such narration extends to the reality of current drug development. A clear sex-gap exists in pharmaceutical research spanning from preclinical studies, clinical trials to post-marketing surveillance with a bias towards males. Consequently, women experience adverse drug reactions from approved drug products more often than men. Distinct differences in pharmaceutical response across drug classes and the lack of understanding of disease pathophysiology also exists between the sexes, often leading to suboptimal drug therapy in women. This review explores the influence of sex as a biological variable in drug delivery, pharmacokinetic response and overall efficacy in the context of pharmaceutical research and practice in the clinic. Prospective recommendations are provided to guide researchers towards the consideration of sex differences in methodologies and analyses. The promotion of disaggregating data according to sex to strengthen scientific rigour, encouraging innovation through the personalisation of medicines and adopting machine learning algorithms is vital for optimised drug development in the sexes and population health equity.",

    "abstract": "The effect of ivermectin on mortality in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been investigated in many studies. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate the overall effect of ivermectin on the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19.\nWe systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, and preprint repository databases (up to February 28, 2021). Random-effects and inverse variance heterogeneity meta-analysis were used to pool the odds ratio of individual trials. The risk of bias was appraised using Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials.\nSix randomized controlled trials were included in this analysis with a total of 658 patients who were randomized to receive ivermectin and 597 patients randomized in the control group who did not receive ivermectin. Of six trials, four had an overall high risk of bias. The estimated effect of ivermectin indicated mortality benefits (pooled odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.21; 95% confidence interval 0.11-0.42, n\u2009=\u20091255), with some evidence against the hypothesis of 'no significant difference' at the current sample size.\nWe observed a preliminary beneficial effect on mortality associated with ivermectin use in patients with COVID-19 that warrants further clinical evidence in appropriately designed large-scale randomized controlled trials.",

    "abstract": "The social restrictions amid coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have posed a serious threat to mental health and have implications in the use of medications for mental health including antidepressants (ADs). This study investigated the trends in prescriptions and costs of various ADs in England during COVID-19 pandemic. National prescribing rates and net ingredient costs (NIC) of all ADs prescriptions during 2016 to 2020 were analyed. The total number of ADs prescriptions\u00a0dispensed during COVID-19 pandemic (January to December 2020) were 78 million, 4 million more than in 2019 that costed NHS England \u00a3 139\u00a0million more than in 2019. Sertraline, an SSRI antidepressant drug,\u00a0alone accounted for an extra \u00a3113 million during 2020 than in 2019.\u00a0The peak dispensing for ADs was observed in March 2020 while the total costs for AD drugs peaked in April 2020. The rising prescription costs\u00a0for ADs during COVID-19 pandemic is a potential cause of concern, in\u00a0particular the increasing\u00a0use\u00a0in adolescents and younger adults\u00a0needs attention, who are at a higher risk of life-threatening adverse drug reactions.",

    "abstract": "Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are replacing conventional VKA (vitamin K antagonist, i.e., warfarin) for various indications where a therapeutic anticoagulant effect is desired. We evaluated the prescribing patterns of the DOACs and warfarin, cost implications of the increasing DOACs prescribing, and deduce the reporting of serious and fatal events, during 2009-2019 in primary care England. Prescriptions and fatal or serious adverse events reporting data, between 2009 and 2019 were analysed, using linear regression to examine the trends in prescriptions, costs, and serious and fatal events reporting. We also compared the prescribing trends of four direct-acting oral anticoagulants and warfarin, normalised to per 1000 clinical commissioning group (CCG) patient\u00a0population for the year 2019 to better understand the regional differences in DOACs prescribing. The overall use of any DOACs (as a proportion of total anticoagulants) increased from 16% in 2015 to 62% in 2019 with an average increase of 87% (95% CI 83.1, 90.5) per year. The reporting of serious and fatal events associated with DOACs decreased by 6% (95% CI 12.5, - 0.1) per year. Apixaban is by far the most prescribed with an average drug\u00a0cost increasing to\u00a0156% (95% CI 140, 172) per year. In England, the lowest anticoagulant prescribing region was Greater London whereas the highest prescribing regions were Yorkshire and Humber for DOACs and the\u00a0East Midlands for warfarin. Interestingly, Lancashire, Merseyside, and Cheshire showed a higher usage for warfarin over DOACs. The differing prescription patterns could be a result of changes in national guidelines and increasing population. Nevertheless, DOACs appear to make an increasing contribution to total anticoagulant prescription items and costs.",

    "abstract": "The ability to perceive and produce movements in the real world with precise timing is critical for survival in animals, including humans. However, research on sensorimotor timing has rarely considered the tight interrelation between perception, action, and cognition. In this review, we present new evidence from behavioral, computational, and neural studies in humans and nonhuman primates, suggesting a pivotal link between sensorimotor control and temporal processing, as well as describing new theoretical frameworks regarding timing in perception and action. We first discuss the link between movement coordination and interval-based timing by addressing how motor training develops accurate spatiotemporal patterns in behavior and influences the perception of temporal intervals. We then discuss how motor expertise results from establishing task-relevant neural manifolds in sensorimotor cortical areas and how the geometry and dynamics of these manifolds help reduce timing variability. We also highlight how neural dynamics in sensorimotor areas are involved in beat-based timing. These lines of research aim to extend our understanding of how timing arises from and contributes to perceptual-motor behaviors in complex environments to seamlessly interact with other cognitive processes.",

    "abstract": "Accurate extraction of the cortical brain surface is critical for cortical thickness estimation and a key element to perform multimodal imaging analysis, where different metrics are integrated and compared in a common space. While brain surface extraction has become widespread practice in human studies, several challenges unique to neuroimaging of non-human primates (NHP) have hindered its adoption for the study of macaques. Although, some of these difficulties can be addressed at the acquisition stage, several common artifacts can be minimized through image preprocessing. Likewise, there are several image analysis pipelines for human MRIs, but very few automated methods for extraction of cortical surfaces have been reported for NHPs and none have been tested on data from diverse sources. We present PREEMACS, a pipeline that standardizes the preprocessing of structural MRI images (T1- and T2-weighted) and carries out an automatic surface extraction of the macaque brain. Building upon and extending pre-existing tools, the first module performs volume orientation, image cropping, intensity non-uniformity correction, and volume averaging, before skull-stripping through a convolutional neural network. The second module performs quality control using an adaptation of MRIqc method to extract objective quality metrics that are then used to determine the likelihood of accurate brain surface estimation. The third and final module estimates the white matter (wm) and pial surfaces from the T1-weighted volume (T1w) using an NHP customized version of FreeSurfer aided by the T2-weighted volumes (T2w). To evaluate the generalizability of PREEMACS, we tested the pipeline using 57 T1w/T2w NHP volumes acquired at 11 different sites from the PRIME-DE public dataset. Results showed an accurate and robust automatic brain surface extraction from images that passed the quality control segment of our pipeline. This work offers a robust, efficient and generalizable pipeline for the automatic standardization of MRI surface analysis on NHP.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging non-human primates (NHPs) is a growing, yet highly specialized field of neuroscience. Resources that were primarily developed for human neuroimaging often need to be significantly adapted for use with NHPs or other animals, which has led to an abundance of custom, in-house solutions. In recent years, the global NHP neuroimaging community has made significant efforts to transform the field towards more open and collaborative practices. Here we present the PRIMatE Resource Exchange (PRIME-RE), a new collaborative online platform for NHP neuroimaging. PRIME-RE is a dynamic community-driven hub for the exchange of practical knowledge, specialized analytical tools, and open data repositories, specifically related to NHP neuroimaging. PRIME-RE caters to both researchers and developers who are either new to the field, looking to stay abreast of the latest developments, or seeking to collaboratively advance the field .",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent comorbidities identified in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This article aims to discuss the pharmacotherapeutic considerations for the management of diabetes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.\nWe discussed various aspects of pharmacotherapeutic management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: (i) susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 among individuals with diabetes, (ii) glycemic goals for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes, (iii) pharmacological treatment considerations for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes.\nThe glycemic goals in patients with COVID-19 and concurrent type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are to avoid disruption of stable metabolic state, maintain optimal glycemic control, and prevent adverse glycemic events. Patients with T1DM require insulin therapy at all times to prevent ketosis. The management strategies for patients with T2DM include temporary discontinuation of certain oral antidiabetic agents and consideration for insulin therapy. Patients with T2DM who are relatively stable and able to eat regularly may continue with oral antidiabetic agents if glycemic control is satisfactory. Hyperglycemia may develop in patients with systemic corticosteroid treatment and should be managed upon accordingly.",

    "abstract": "We critically evaluated the quality of evidence and quality of harm reporting in clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine (CQ) for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nScientific databases were systematically searched to identify relevant trials of HCQ/CQ for the treatment of COVID-19 published up to 10 September 2020. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tools for randomized trials and non-randomized trials of interventions were used to assess risk of bias in the included studies. A 10-item Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) harm extension was used to assess quality of harm reporting in the included trials.\nSixteen trials, including fourteen randomized trials and two non-randomized trials, met the inclusion criteria. The results from the included trials were conflicting and lacked effect estimates adjusted for baseline disease severity or comorbidities in many cases, and most of the trials recruited a fairly small cohort of patients. None of the clinical trials met the CONSORT criteria in full for reporting harm data in clinical trials. None of the 16 trials had an overall 'low' risk of bias, while four of the trials had a 'high', 'critical', or 'serious' risk of bias. Biases observed in these trials arise from the randomization process, potential deviation from intended interventions, outcome measurements, selective reporting, confounding, participant selection, and/or classification of interventions.\nIn general, the quality of currently available evidence for the effectiveness of CQ/HCQ in patients with COVID-19 is suboptimal. The importance of a properly designed and reported clinical trial cannot be overemphasized amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and its dismissal could lead to poorer clinical and policy decisions, resulting in wastage of already stretched invaluable health care resources.",

The results from the included trials were conflicting and lacked effect estimates adjusted for baseline disease severity or comorbidities in many cases, and most of the trials recruited a fairly small cohort of patients. None of the clinical trials met the CONSORT criteria in full for reporting harm data in clinical trials. None of the 16 trials had an overall 'low' risk of bias, while four of the trials had a 'high', 'critical', or 'serious' risk of bias. Biases observed in these trials arise from the randomization process, potential deviation from intended interventions, outcome measurements, selective reporting, confounding, participant selection, and/or classification of interventions.",

    "abstract": "The use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), was alleged to cause a more severe course of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nWe systematically reviewed the published studies to assess the association of RAS inhibitors with mortality as well as disease severity in COVID-19 patients. A systematic literature search was performed to retrieve relevant original studies investigating mortality and severity (severe/critical disease) in COVID-19 patients with and without exposure to RAS inhibitors.\nA total of 59 original studies were included for qualitative synthesis. Twenty-four studies that reported adjusted effect sizes (24 studies reported mortality outcomes and 16 studies reported disease severity outcomes), conducted in RAS inhibitor-exposed and unexposed groups, were pooled in random-effects models to estimate overall risk. Quality assessment of studies revealed that most of the studies included were of fair quality. The use of an ACEI/ARB in COVID-19 patients was significantly associated with lower odds (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20090.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.95; n\u2009=\u200918,749) or hazard (hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.95; n\u2009=\u200926,598) of mortality compared with non-use of ACEI/ARB. However, the use of an ACEI/ARB was non-significantly associated with lower odds (OR\u2009=\u20090.91, 95% CI 0.75-1.10; n\u2009=\u20097446) or hazard (HR\u2009=\u20090.73, 95% CI 0.33-1.66; n\u2009=\u20096325) of developing severe/critical disease compared with non-use of an ACEI/ARB.\nSince there was no increased risk of harm, the use of RAS inhibitors for hypertension and other established clinical indications can be maintained in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "The potential detrimental effects of steroids on the immune system to fight viral infections had always been a concern for patients on long term steroids in chronic conditions. A recent warning from WHO on systemic corticosteroid use amid COVID-19 raised suspicion among public and healthcare professionals regarding the safety of steroid use during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The corticosteroids (inhaled and oral) are commonly prescribed in the management of asthma and COPD patients and any unsolicited changes in medications use may lead to potentially severe exacerbations and may risk patient lives. This article provides a critical review of clinical evidence and offers a detailed discussion on the safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in asthma and COPD patients, both with and without COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to viral pneumonitis is one of the main causes of high mortality in patients with COVID-19 (novel coronavirus disease 2019). We systematically reviewed mortality in COVID-19 patients with ARDS and the potential role of systemic corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients.\nElectronic databases and country-specific healthcare databases were searched to identify relevant studies/reports. The quality assessment of individual studies was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Country-specific proportion\u00a0of individuals with COVID-19 who developed ARDS and reported death were combined in a random-effect meta-analysis to give a\u00a0pooled\u00a0mortality estimate of ARDS.\nThe overall pooled mortality estimate among 10,815 ARDS cases in COVID-19 patients was 39% (95% CI: 23-56%). The pooled mortality estimate for China was 69% (95% CI: 67-72%). In Europe, the highest mortality estimate among COVID-19 patients with ARDS was reported in Poland (73%; 95% CI: 58-86%) while Germany had the lowest mortality estimate (13%; 95% CI: 2-29%) among COVID-19 patients with ARDS. The median crude mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with reported corticosteroid use was 28.0% (lower quartile: 13.9%; upper quartile: 53.6%).\nThe high mortality in COVID-19 associated ARDS necessitates a prompt and aggressive treatment strategy which includes corticosteroids. Most of the studies included no information on the dosing regimen of corticosteroid therapy, however, low-dose corticosteroid therapy or pulse corticosteroid therapy appears to have a beneficial role in the management of severely ill COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Whilst discharge summaries are important for ensuring patient continuity of care, they often lack important information. Medical students and newly qualified doctors have attributed this to insufficient teaching, thereby indicating a need to improve discharge summary education within the undergraduate medical curriculum. The aim was to review educational approaches used to prepare undergraduate medical students for discharge summary writing, and their effectiveness Medline and Scopus were systematically searched using keywords, for studies published between 2009 and 2019. Narrative synthesis was used to integrate the findings of the included studies. Study quality was appraised using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument. Six studies were included in this review. Allowing students to write a discharge summary following a real patient encounter and receive written feedback was the most common educational approach used (n\u2009=\u20094). Three of these studies improved student attitudes towards discharge summary writing. One study described the use of a mobile application, which improved discharge summary quality. Another study utilized interprofessional learning but the effect was statistically insignificant. Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument scores were satisfactory (mean\u2009=\u200912, range\u2009=\u20098.4-15). The literature concerning this topic is limited. The results indicate that providing written feedback to students can positively influence attitudes towards discharge summary writing. Optimisation of the quality of discharge summaries written by medical students using feedback and checklists requires further investigation, as does the use of interprofessional learning. Future studies would additionally benefit from including participant baseline data and control groups, being multicentred and measuring behavioural or patient/healthcare outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The world is facing a medical crisis amid the CoViD-19 pandemic and the role of adequate hygiene and hand sanitisers is inevitable in controlling the spread of infection in public places and healthcare institutions. There has been a great surge in demand for hand sanitisation products leading to shortages in their supply. A consequent increase of substandard products in the market has raised safety concerns. This article, therefore, presents a critical review of hand sanitation approaches and products available on the market in light of the scientific evidence available to date. This review also provides a range of hand sanitisation product formulations, and manufacturing instructions to allow for extemporaneous preparations at the community and hospital pharmacies during this urgent crisis. In addition, this emergent situation is expected to continue, hence hand sanitisers will be in demand for an extended time, and the availability and purchase of substandard products on the market create an ongoing safety concern. Therefore, this article shall also provide various commercial organisations, interested in stepping forward the production and marketing of hand sanitisers, with a guide on the development of products of standardised ingredients and formulations.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a case of an isolated pituitary fossa metastasis on a background of a previously treated tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma.\nA 64-year-old male, diagnosed with a primary p16-negative squamous cell carcinoma in the right tonsil, was treated with a course of chemoradiotherapy with curative intent. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography, performed at six months post-treatment, revealed a good local response and no distant metastases. The patient was placed on routine follow up at two-monthly intervals. Two months into follow up, he presented with a right-sided oculomotor nerve palsy and partial Horner's syndrome. Imaging and biopsy revealed a pituitary fossa metastasis (p16-negative squamous cell carcinoma), and a further positron emission tomography/computed tomography visualised this lesion. He was deemed unsuitable for further intervention and underwent palliative radiotherapy for symptom control.\nThis case represents the first reported isolated pituitary fossa metastasis from a tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. A high degree of clinical suspicion is recommended, along with a low threshold for biopsy and a cautioned use of positron emission tomography/computed tomography, when investigating such patients.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to explore a new source of montmorillonite and to develop an extraction and purification protocol for its isolation from raw clay samples acquired from the Koh-e-Suleiman mountain range in Pakistan. The process involved the collection of raw clay from the source, identification and quantification of montmorillonite. Granulometric extraction and purification protocols increased the montmorillonite content from 21.8-25.1% in the raw clay to 90.1-93.9% after small-scale extraction and 85.33-89.33% on a larger scale. A techno-economic analysis highlighted the practicality and economic benefits of large-scale extraction for industrial applications. This study highlights the existence of a substantial new source of this valuable clay which is currently used across multiple industries including construction, pottery making, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and engineering. It is intuitively expected that the large-scale extraction of the material will improve the economic condition of the region by providing employment opportunities to locals and may be a valuable resource for export.",

    "abstract": "Capsules are a widely used oral dosage form due to their simplicity and ease of manufacture. They are equally popular for both pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products and since they do not need extensive formulation development, it is a dosage form of choice for new drugs undergoing animal or clinical trials. In addition to the standard hard-gelatin or cellulose-based vegetarian capsules, functional capsules such as those with built-in gastroresistance would be of great value. In this work, commonly used enteric polymers were investigated for the production of hard-capsules. The polymers used in this study included cellulose derivatives (HPMC AS-LF and HP-55) and acrylic/methacrylic acid derivatives (EUDRAGIT L100 and S100). A range of concentrations of polymers and plasticisers were tested to optimise the formulation for the production of capsule shells with desirable physicochemical and gastroresistance characteristics. Drug release from optimised capsules produced from HPMC AS-LF, HP-55, EUDRAGIT L100 and S100 was shown to be comparable to drug release from corresponding polymer-coated tablets in both compendial and physiological bicarbonate buffer. In summary, herein we report a simple method for producing enteric capsule shells which do not need an additional coating step which, if validated at large scale, can significantly reduce the cost of manufacturing of conventional enteric coated dosage forms. These capsules are also likely to improve the inter-tablet variability in post-gastric drug release inherent in conventional dosage forms due to coating variability.",

    "abstract": "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a chronic, stigmatizing side effect of typical and atypical antipsychotics that is often debilitating for the patient and resistant to treatment. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) may arise at any stage of schizophrenia ranging from prodrome to posttreatment and carry a poor prognosis. Management of both the conditions is a challenging and often fatiguing task for the treating physician. We report a case of schizo-obsessive disorder in an Indian quadragenarian who had developed TD with olanzapine and had failed to show improvement with clozapine and quetiapine. The patient improved dramatically with risperidone. Our findings corroborate with previous literature which has shown risperidone to be effective in treatment of TD and obsessive symptoms, possibly due to its action on the serotonergic system. The authors conclude that risperidone is an effective choice to treat TD and comorbid OCS in patients with schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Our motor commands can be exquisitely timed according to the demands of the environment, and the ability to generate rhythms of different tempos is a hallmark of musical cognition. Yet, the neuronal underpinnings behind rhythmic tapping remain elusive. Here, we found that the activity of hundreds of primate medial premotor cortices (MPCs; pre-supplementary motor area [preSMA] and supplementary motor area [SMA]) neurons show a strong periodic pattern that becomes evident when their responses are projected into a state space using dimensionality reduction analysis. We show that different tapping tempos are encoded by circular trajectories that travelled at a constant speed but with different radii, and that this neuronal code is highly resilient to the number of participating neurons. Crucially, the changes in the amplitude of the oscillatory dynamics in neuronal state space are a signature of duration encoding during rhythmic timing, regardless of whether it is guided by an external metronome or is internally controlled and is not the result of repetitive motor commands. This dynamic state signal predicted the duration of the rhythmically produced intervals on a trial-by-trial basis. Furthermore, the increase in variability of the neural trajectories accounted for the scalar property, a hallmark feature of temporal processing across tasks and species. Finally, we found that the interval-dependent increments in the radius of periodic neural trajectories are the result of a larger number of neurons engaged in the production of longer intervals. Our results support the notion that rhythmic timing during tapping behaviors is encoded in the radial curvature of periodic MPC neural population trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine, and specifically the D2 system, has been implicated in timing tasks where the absolute duration of individual time intervals is encoded discretely, yet the role of D2 during beat perception and entrainment remains largely unknown. In this type of timing, a beat is perceived as the pulse that marks equally spaced points in time and, once extracted, produces the tendency in humans to entrain or synchronize their movements to it. Hence, beat-based timing is crucial for musical execution. In this study we investigated the effects of systemic injections of quinpirole (0.005-0.05 mg/kg), a D2-like agonist, on the isochronous rhythmic tapping of rhesus monkeys, a classical task for the study of beat entrainment. We compared the rhythmic timing accuracy, precision, and the asynchronies of the monkeys with or without the effects of quinpirole, as well as their reaction times in a control serial reaction time task (SRTT). The results showed a dose-dependent disruption in the scalar property of rhythmic timing due to quinpirole administration. Specifically, we found similar temporal variabilities as a function of the metronome tempo at the largest dose, instead of the increase in variability across durations that is characteristic of the timing Weber law. Notably, these effects were not due to alterations in the basic sensorimotor mechanism for tapping to a sequence of flashing stimuli, because quinpirole did not change the reaction time of the monkeys during SRTT. These findings support the notion of a key role of the D2 system in the rhythmic timing mechanism, especially in the control of temporal precision. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Perceiving and moving to the beat of music is a fundamental trait of musical cognition. We measured the effect of quinpirole, a D2-like agonist, on the precision and accuracy of rhythmic tapping to a metronome in two rhesus monkeys. Quinpirole produced a flattening of the temporal variability as a function of tempo duration, instead of the increase in variability across durations that is characteristic of the scalar property, a hallmark property of timing.",

    "abstract": "To prepare timely motor actions, we constantly predict future events. Regularly repeating events are often perceived as a rhythm to which we can readily synchronize our movements, just as in dancing to music. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the capacity to encode and maintain rhythms are not understood. We trained nonhuman primates to maintain the rhythm of a visual metronome of diverse tempos and recorded neural activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA). SMA exhibited rhythmic bursts of gamma band (30-40 Hz) reflecting an internal tempo that matched the extinguished visual metronome. Moreover, gamma amplitude increased throughout the trial, providing an estimate of total elapsed time. Notably, the timing of gamma bursts and firing rate modulations allowed predicting whether monkeys were ahead or behind the correct tempo. Our results indicate that SMA uses dynamic motor plans to encode a metronome for rhythms and a stopwatch for total elapsed time.",

    "abstract": "Charles Darwin suggested the perception of rhythm to be common to all animals. While only recently experimental research is finding some support for this claim, there are also aspects of rhythm cognition that appear to be species-specific, such as the capability to perceive a regular pulse (or beat) in a varying rhythm. In the current study, using EEG, we adapted an auditory oddball paradigm that allows for disentangling the contributions of beat perception and isochrony to the temporal predictability of the stimulus.

    "abstract": "Beat entrainment is the ability to entrain one's movements to a perceived periodic stimulus, such as a metronome or a pulse in music. Humans have a capacity to predictively respond to a periodic pulse and to dynamically adjust their movement timing to match the varying music tempos. Previous studies have shown that monkeys share some of the human capabilities for rhythmic entrainment, such as tapping regularly at the period of isochronous stimuli. However, it is still unknown whether monkeys can predictively entrain to dynamic tempo changes like humans. To address this question, we trained monkeys in three tapping tasks and compared their rhythmic entrainment abilities with those of humans. We found that, when immediate feedback about the timing of each movement is provided, monkeys can predictively entrain to an isochronous beat, generating tapping movements in anticipation of the metronome pulse. This ability also generalized to a novel untrained tempo. Notably, macaques can modify their tapping tempo by predicting the beat changes of accelerating and decelerating visual metronomes in a manner similar to humans. Our findings support the notion that nonhuman primates share with humans the ability of temporal anticipation during tapping to isochronous and smoothly changing sequences of stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Extensive research has described two key features of interval timing. The bias property is associated with accuracy and implies that time is overestimated for short intervals and underestimated for long intervals. The scalar property is linked to precision and states that the variability of interval estimates increases as a function of interval duration. The neural mechanisms behind these properties are not well understood. Here we implemented a recurrent neural network that mimics a cortical ensemble and includes cells that show paired-pulse facilitation and slow inhibitory synaptic currents. The network produces interval selective responses and reproduces both bias and scalar properties when a Bayesian decoder reads its activity. Notably, the interval-selectivity, timing accuracy, and precision of the network showed complex changes as a function of the decay time constants of the modeled synaptic properties and the level of background activity of the cells. These findings suggest that physiological values of the time constants for paired-pulse facilitation and GABAb, as well as the internal state of the network, determine the bias and scalar properties of interval timing.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual categorization depends on the assignment of different stimuli to specific groups based, in principle, on the notion of flexible categorical boundaries. To determine the neural basis of categorical boundaries, we record the activity of pre-SMA neurons of monkeys executing an interval categorization task in which the limit between short and long categories changes between blocks of trials within a session. A large population of cells encodes this boundary by reaching a constant peak of activity close to the corresponding subjective limit. Notably, the time at which this peak is reached changes according to the categorical boundary of the current block, predicting the monkeys' categorical decision on a trial-by-trial basis. In addition, pre-SMA cells also represent the category selected by the monkeys and the outcome of the decision. These results suggest that the pre-SMA adaptively encodes subjective duration boundaries between short and long durations and contains crucial neural information to categorize intervals and evaluate the outcome of such perceptual decisions.",

    "abstract": "The extraction and encoding of acoustical temporal regularities are fundamental for human cognitive auditory abilities such as speech or beat entrainment. Because the comparison of the neural sensitivity to temporal regularities between human and animals is fundamental to relate non-invasive measures of auditory processing to their neuronal basis, here we compared the neural representation of auditory periodicities between human and non-human primates by measuring scalp-recorded frequency-following response (FFR). We found that rhesus monkeys can resolve the spectrotemporal structure of periodic stimuli to a similar extent as humans by exhibiting a homologous FFR potential to the speech syllable /da/. The FFR in both species is robust and phase-locked to the fundamental frequency of the sound, reflecting an effective neural processing of the fast-periodic information of subsyllabic cues. Our results thus reveal a conserved neural ability to track acoustical regularities within the primate order. These findings open the possibility to study the neurophysiology of complex sound temporal processing in the macaque subcortical and cortical areas, as well as the associated experience-dependent plasticity across the auditory pathway in behaving monkeys.",

    "abstract": "Subjects diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or hepatic steatosis are usually obese or overweight. NAFLD has also been reported in many non-obese healthy subjects as an incidental finding during imaging. Subjects with early-stage NAFLD who are otherwise healthy are often left unmanaged in current clinical practice; it is not clear if an early intervention in those individuals would be of any benefit in preventing NAFLD progression to more serious conditions. Since many of these subjects are non-alcoholic and have a normal body mass index (BMI), an intensive lifestyle change program is not usually recommended. This report presents an otherwise healthy non-alcoholic subject with incidental NAFLD having a normal BMI and a waist circumference below 90 cm who successfully reversed his condition by undertaking a lifestyle intervention. The case report is expected to encourage large cohort studies to substantiate the benefits of dietary interventions in alleviating hepatic steatosis among non-obese individuals.",

    "abstract": "Time perception in the millisecond and second ranges is thought to be processed by different neural mechanisms. However, whether there is a sharp boundary between these ranges and whether they are implemented in the same, overlapped or separate brain areas is still not certain. To probe the role of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the right supplementary motor area (SMA), and the cerebellum on time perception, we temporarily altered their activity on healthy volunteers on separate sessions using transcranial magnetic stimulation with the continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS) protocol. A control session was reserved for the stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Before and after stimulation, participants were tested on a temporal categorization task using intervals in the hundreds and thousands of milliseconds ranges, as well as on a pitch categorization task which was used as a further control. We then looked for changes in the Relative Threshold and the Constant Error, which, respectively, reflect participants' sensitivity to interval duration and their accuracy at setting an interval that acts as a boundary between categories. We found that after cTBS in all of the studied regions, the Relative Threshold, but not the Constant Error, was affected and only when hundreds of milliseconds intervals were being categorized.

These results suggest that the fronto-cerebellar circuit is particularly involved in the estimation of intervals in the hundreds of milliseconds range.",

    "abstract": "The study of non-human primates in complex behaviors such as rhythm perception and entrainment is critical to understand the neurophysiological basis of human cognition. Next to reviewing the role of beta oscillations in human beat perception, here we discuss the role of primate putaminal oscillatory activity in the control of rhythmic movements that are guided by a sensory metronome or internally gated. The analysis of the local field potentials of the behaving macaques showed that gamma-oscillations reflect local computations associated with stimulus processing of the metronome, whereas beta-activity involves the entrainment of large putaminal circuits, probably in conjunction with other elements of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit, during internally driven rhythmic tapping. Thus, this review emphasizes the need of parametric neurophysiological observations in non-human primates that display a well-controlled behavior during high-level cognitive processes.",

    "abstract": "The neural underpinnings of rhythmic behavior, including music and dance, have been studied using the synchronization-continuation task (SCT), where subjects initially tap in synchrony with an isochronous metronome and then keep tapping at a similar rate via an internal beat mechanism. Here, we provide behavioral and neural evidence that supports a resetting drift-diffusion model (DDM) during SCT. Behaviorally, we show the model replicates the linear relation between the mean and standard-deviation of the intervals produced by monkeys in SCT. We then show that neural populations in the medial premotor cortex (MPC) contain an accurate trial-by-trial representation of elapsed-time between taps. Interestingly, the autocorrelation structure of the elapsed-time representation is consistent with a DDM. These results indicate that MPC has an orderly representation of time with features characteristic of concatenated DDMs and that this population signal can be used to orchestrate the rhythmic structure of the internally timed elements of SCT.",

    "abstract": "Timing is a fundamental variable for behavior. However, the mechanisms allowing human and non-human primates to synchronize their actions with periodic events are not yet completely understood. Here we characterize the ability of rhesus monkeys and humans to perceive and maintain rhythms of different paces in the absence of sensory cues or motor actions. In our rhythm task subjects had to observe and then internally follow a visual stimulus that periodically changed its location along a circular perimeter. Crucially, they had to maintain this visuospatial tempo in the absence of movements. Our results show that the probability of remaining in synchrony with the rhythm decreased, and the variability in the timing estimates increased, as a function of elapsed time, and these trends were well described by the generalized law of Weber. Additionally, the pattern of errors shows that human subjects tended to lag behind fast rhythms and to get ahead of slow ones, suggesting that a mean tempo might be incorporated as prior information. Overall, our results demonstrate that rhythm perception and maintenance are cognitive abilities that we share with rhesus monkeys, and these abilities do not depend on overt motor commands.",

    "abstract": "In 2010, Uganda began developing its first multisectoral nutrition plan, the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP), to reduce malnutrition. While the UNAP signals high-level commitment to addressing nutrition, knowledge gaps remain about how to successfully implement such a plan.\nWe tracked the UNAP's influence on the process of priority setting and funding for nutrition from 2013 to 2015.\nThis study used a longitudinal mixed methods design to track qualitative and budgetary changes related to UNAP processes nationally as well as in 2 study districts. Qualitative changes were assessed through interviews, news content, and meeting notes. Changes in allocations and expenditures were calculated based on budget documents, work plans, and validation interviews.\nImportant enabling factors named by stakeholders included identity, human resources, sustainable structures, coordination, advocacy, and adaptation of the UNAP to local needs. Evidence suggests that the UNAP facilitated improvements in the last 3 factors. We found no systematic increases in planned nutrition activities, nor did we find increases in allocations or expenditures for nutrition between fiscal years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. Expenditure data were not always available for all funding mechanisms. In the 2 study districts, there was little flexibility within financing structures to allow for additional nutrition activities.\nResults suggest the UNAP has played an important role in strengthening the enabling environment for nutrition action. The next UNAP will need to translate these improvements into a greater number of nutrition activities and higher levels of funding at the national and subnational levels.",

    "abstract": "We describe a technique to semichronically record the cortical extracellular neural activity in the behaving monkey employing commercial high-density electrodes. After the design and construction of low cost microdrives that allow varying the depth of the recording locations after the implantation surgery, we recorded the extracellular unit activity from pools of neurons at different depths in the presupplementary motor cortex (pre-SMA) of a rhesus monkey trained in a tapping task. The collected data were processed to classify cells as putative pyramidal cells or interneurons on the basis of their waveform features. We also demonstrate that short time cross-correlogram occasionally yields unit pairs with high short latency (<5 ms), narrow bin (<3 ms) peaks, indicative of monosynaptic spike transmission from pre- to postsynaptic neurons. These methods have been verified extensively in rodents. Finally, we observed that the pattern of population activity was repetitive over distinct trials of the tapping task. These results show that the semichronic technique is a viable option for the large-scale parallel recording of local circuit activity at different depths in the cortex of the macaque monkey and other large species.",

    "abstract": "Physiological functions of the two extreme ends of the age spectrum, children (<18 y old) and older adults (aged 65 y and over), differ from healthy young adults. This consequently affects the pharmacokinetic profiles of administered drugs, which, in turn, impacts upon clinical practice and drug therapy. The gastrointestinal milieu acts as a distinct and vital organ regulating the dissolution, absorption and metabolism of orally ingested drugs. Age-mediated alteration in the physiology and function of the gut can reshape the pharmacokinetics of certain drugs. However, our understanding of this topic is limited. This article references the gut physiology of healthy adults to capture the available evidence in the literature on the extent and nature of the changes in childhood and older age. The gut, as an organ, is examined with regards to the effect of age on luminal fluid, microbiota, transit and motility, and the intestinal mucosa. Whilst drastic developmental changes were observed in certain aspects of the gastrointestinal environment, the examination reveals significant gaps in our knowledge in the physiology and function of the developing or ageing gut. The revelation of the unknown paves the way towards a better characterization of the human gastrointestinal tract for optimized drug therapy in children and older adults.",

    "abstract": "Gonadal sex determination (GSD) in humans is a complex biological process that takes place in early stages of embryonic development when the bipotential gonadal primordium (BGP) differentiates towards testes or ovaries. This decision is directed by one of two distinct pathways embedded in a GSD network activated in a population of coelomic epithelial cells, the Sertoli progenitor cells (SPC) and the granulosa progenitor cells (GPC). In males, the pathway is activated when the Sex-Determining Region Y (SRY) gene starts to be expressed, whereas in females the WNT4/ \u03b2-catenin pathway promotes the differentiation of the GPCs towards ovaries. The interactions and dynamics of the elements that constitute the GSD network are poorly understood, thus our group is interested in inferring the general architecture of this network as well as modeling the dynamic behavior of a set of genes associated to this process under wild-type and mutant conditions.\nWe reconstructed the regulatory network of GSD with a set of genes directly associated with the process of differentiation from SPC and GPC towards Sertoli and granulosa cells, respectively. These genes are experimentally well-characterized and the effects of their deficiency have been clinically reported. We modeled this GSD network as a synchronous Boolean network model (BNM) and characterized its attractors under wild-type and mutant conditions.\nThree attractors with a clear biological meaning were found; one of them corresponding to the currently known gene expression pattern of Sertoli cells, the second correlating to the granulosa cells and, the third resembling a disgenetic gonad.\nThe BNM of GSD that we present summarizes the experimental data on the pathways for Sertoli and granulosa establishment and sheds light on the overall behavior of a population of cells that differentiate within the developing gonad. With this model we propose a set of regulatory interactions needed to activate either the SRY or the WNT4/ \u03b2-catenin pathway as well as their downstream targets, which are critical for further sex differentiation. In addition, we observed a pattern of altered regulatory interactions and their dynamics that lead to some disorders of sex development (DSD).",

    "abstract": "\u03b2 oscillations in the basal ganglia have been associated with interval timing. We recorded the putaminal local field potentials (LFPs) from monkeys performing a synchronization-continuation task (SCT) and a serial reaction-time task (RTT), where the animals produced regularly and irregularly paced tapping sequences, respectively. We compared the activation profile of \u03b2 oscillations between tasks and found transient bursts of \u03b2 activity in both the RTT and SCT. During the RTT, \u03b2 power was higher at the beginning of the task, especially when LFPs were aligned to the stimuli. During the SCT, \u03b2 was higher during the internally driven continuation phase, especially for tap-aligned LFPs. Interestingly, a set of LFPs showed an initial burst of \u03b2 at the beginning of the SCT, similar to the RTT, followed by a decrease in \u03b2 oscillations during the synchronization phase, to finally rebound during the continuation phase. The rebound during the continuation phase of the SCT suggests that the corticostriatal circuit is involved in the control of internally driven motor sequences. In turn, the transient bursts of \u03b2 activity at the beginning of both tasks suggest that the basal ganglia produce a general initiation signal that engages the motor system in different sequential behaviors.",

    "abstract": "We determined the response properties of neurons in the primate medial premotor cortex that were classified as sensory or motor during isochronous tapping to a visual or auditory metronome, using different target intervals and three sequential elements in the task. The cell classification was based on a warping transformation, which determined whether the cell activity was statistically aligned to sensory or motor events, finding a large proportion of cells classified as sensory or motor. Two distinctive clusters of sensory cells were observed, i.e. one cell population with short response-onset latencies to the previous stimulus, and another that was probably predicting the occurrence of the next stimuli. These cells were called sensory-driven and stimulus-predicting neurons, respectively. Sensory-driven neurons showed a clear bias towards the visual modality and were more responsive to the first stimulus, with a decrease in activity for the following sequential elements of the metronome. In contrast, stimulus-predicting neurons were bimodal and showed similar response profiles across serial-order elements. Motor cells showed a consecutive activity onset across discrete neural ensembles, generating a rapid succession of activation patterns between the two taps defining a produced interval. The cyclical configuration in activation profiles engaged more motor cells as the serial-order elements progressed across the task, and the rate of cell recruitment over time decreased as a function of the target interval. Our findings support the idea that motor cells were responsible for the rhythmic progression of taps in the task, gaining more importance as the trial advanced, while, simultaneously, the sensory-driven cells lost their functional impact.",

    "abstract": "The aminosalicylate mesalazine (mesalamine) forms the mainstay of treatment in ulcerative colitis (UC), a disease for which many commercial modified-release products have been developed with the aim of providing targeted gastrointestinal release. The release profiles of five of these commercial formulations were evaluated in bicarbonate buffer using a novel dissolution model that mimics the dynamic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Monolithic and multi-particulate mesalazine formulations with pH-dependent and/or independent release mechanisms were evaluated (Asacol(\u00ae) 800, Octasa(\u00ae), Mezavant(\u00ae) XL, Salofalk(\u00ae), Pentasa(\u00ae)), and each of the products displayed a distinctive dissolution profile. The dissolution results for Mezavant(\u00ae) XL (Lialda(\u00ae)) (lag time 290 min) demonstrated good correlation with previously reported in vivo disintegration times assessed by gamma-scintigraphy in humans. Octasa(\u00ae) showed a similar lag time to Mezavant(\u00ae) XL. Drug release from Asacol(\u00ae) 800 (Asacol(\u00ae) HD) showed a wide standard deviation, reflecting the great variability in vivo. Salofalk(\u00ae) displayed both delayed release and extended release characteristics. Pentasa(\u00ae) released more than 50% of its drug load in the stomach compartment of the model, which is attributed to the absence of a gastro-resistant coating in this product. The new dissolution method provided a realistic and discriminative in vitro assessment of mesalazine release from different formulations. These results demonstrate that this strategy can be used to predict intestinal release behaviour, and potentially aid the rational design of products developed to target different sites of the gut.",

    "abstract": "\"All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others\" was the illustrious quote derived from British writer George Orwell's famed work, Animal Farm. Extending beyond the remit of political allegory, however, this statement would appear to hold true for the selection of appropriate animal models to simulate human physiology in preclinical studies. There remain definite gaps in our current knowledge with respect to animal physiology, notably those of intra- and inter-species differences in gastrointestinal (GI) function, which may affect oral drug delivery and absorption. Factors such as cost and availability have often influenced the choice of animal species without clear justification for their similarity to humans, and lack of standardization in techniques employed in past studies using various animals may also have contributed to the generation of contradictory results. As it stands, attempts to identify a single animal species as appropriately representative of human physiology and which may able to adequately simulate human in vivo conditions are limited. In this review, we have compiled and critically reviewed data from numerous studies of GI anatomy and physiology of various animal species commonly used in drug delivery modeling, commenting on the appropriateness of these animals for in vivo comparison and extrapolation to humans.",

    "abstract": "In the introduction to this theme issue, Honing et al. suggest that the origins of musicality--the capacity that makes it possible for us to perceive, appreciate and produce music--can be pursued productively by searching for components of musicality in other species. Recent studies have highlighted that the behavioural relevance of stimuli to animals and the relation of experimental procedures to their natural behaviour can have a large impact on the type of results that can be obtained for a given species. Through reviewing laboratory findings on animal auditory perception and behaviour, as well as relevant findings on natural behaviour, we provide evidence that both traditional laboratory studies and studies relating to natural behaviour are needed to answer the problem of musicality. Traditional laboratory studies use synthetic stimuli that provide more control than more naturalistic studies, and are in many ways suitable to test the perceptual abilities of animals. However, naturalistic studies are essential to inform us as to what might constitute relevant stimuli and parameters to test with laboratory studies, or why we may or may not expect certain stimulus manipulations to be relevant. These two approaches are both vital in the comparative study of musicality.",

    "abstract": "Humans possess an ability to perceive and synchronize movements to the beat in music ('beat perception and synchronization'), and recent neuroscientific data have offered new insights into this beat-finding capacity at multiple neural levels. Here, we review and compare behavioural and neural data on temporal and sequential processing during beat perception and entrainment tasks in macaques (including direct neural recording and local field potential (LFP)) and humans (including fMRI, EEG and MEG). These abilities rest upon a distributed set of circuits that include the motor cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical (mCBGT) circuit, where the supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the putamen are critical cortical and subcortical nodes, respectively. In addition, a cortical loop between motor and auditory areas, connected through delta and beta oscillatory activity, is deeply involved in these behaviours, with motor regions providing the predictive timing needed for the perception of, and entrainment to, musical rhythms. The neural discharge rate and the LFP oscillatory activity in the gamma- and beta-bands in the putamen and SMA of monkeys are tuned to the duration of intervals produced during a beat synchronization-continuation task (SCT). Hence, the tempo during beat synchronization is represented by different interval-tuned cells that are activated depending on the produced interval. In addition, cells in these areas are tuned to the serial-order elements of the SCT. Thus, the underpinnings of beat synchronization are intrinsically linked to the dynamics of cell populations tuned for duration and serial order throughout the mCBGT. We suggest that a cross-species comparison of behaviours and the neural circuits supporting them sets the stage for a new generation of neurally grounded computational models for beat perception and synchronization.",

    "abstract": "To characterise the gastrointestinal (GI) environment in rat, rabbit and pig for the purpose of determining their utility as animal models for drug delivery in humans.\nGI fluid samples were characterised for osmolality, surface tension, pH and buffer capacity. The solubility of two model drugs, mesalazine (ionisable) and prednisolone (unionisable), were also measured and the results were correlated to the physicochemical fluid data.\nThe solubility of the ionisable drug mesalazine was positively correlated to the GI pH in all three species and was significantly influenced by the pH difference. In contrast, the solubility of the unionisable compound prednisolone was not correlated significantly to the changes in pH, buffer capacity, osmolality or surface tension. In general, the solubility of prednisolone was constant irrespective of the location of the sample in the gut from rabbit and pig; however, an unusual trend was observed for the solubility of prednisolone in rats.\nThe results suggest that solubility of ionisable drugs or pH-responsive formulations is significantly influenced by the differences in pH along the GI tract and inter-species differences. It was also found that the data on the GI solubility of prednisolone (a neutral compound) in rats might overestimate its true value in humans.",

    "abstract": "The precise quantification of time in the subsecond scale is critical for many complex behaviors including music and dance appreciation/execution, speech comprehension/articulation, and the performance of many sports. Nevertheless, its neural underpinnings are largely unknown. Recent neurophysiological experiments from our laboratory have shown that the cell activity in the medial premotor areas (MPC) of macaques can represent different aspects of temporal processing during a synchronization-continuation tapping task (SCT). In this task the rhythmic behavior of monkeys was synchronized to a metronome of isochronous stimuli in the hundreds of milliseconds range (synchronization phase), followed by a period where animals internally temporalized their movements (continuation phase). Overall, we found that the time-keeping mechanism in MPC is governed by different layers of neural clocks. Close to the temporal control of movements are two separate populations of ramping cells that code for elapsed or remaining time for a tapping movement during the SCT. Thus, the sensorimotor loops engaged during the task may depend on the cyclic interplay between two neuronal chronometers that quantify in their instantaneous discharge rate the time passed and the remaining time for an action. In addition, we found MPC neurons that are tuned to the duration of produced intervals during the rhythmic task, showing an orderly variation in the average discharge rate as a function of duration. All the tested durations in the subsecond scale were represented in the preferred intervals of the cell population. Most of the interval-tuned cells were also tuned to the ordinal structure of the six intervals produced sequentially in the SCT. Hence, this next level of temporal processing may work as the notes of a musical score, providing information to the timing network about what duration and ordinal element of the sequence are being executed. Finally, we describe how the timing circuit can use a dynamic neural representation of the passage of time and the context in which the intervals are executed by integrating the time-varying activity of populations of cells. These neural population clocks can be defined as distinct trajectories in the multidimensional cell response-space. We provide a hypothesis of how these different levels of neural clocks can interact to constitute a coherent timing machine that controls the rhythmic behavior during the SCT.",

    "abstract": "Time is a fundamental variable that organisms must quantify in order to survive. In humans, for example, the gradual development of the sense of duration and rhythm is an essential skill in many facets of social behavior such as speaking, dancing to-, listening to- or playing music, performing a wide variety of sports, and driving a car (Merchant H, Harrington DL, Meck WH. Annu Rev Neurosci. 36:313-36, 2013). During the last 10 years there has been a rapid growth of research on the neural underpinnings of timing in the subsecond and suprasecond scales, using a variety of methodological approaches in the human being, as well as in varied animal and theoretical models. In this introductory chapter we attempt to give a conceptual framework that defines time processing as a family of different phenomena. The brain circuits and neural underpinnings of temporal quantification seem to largely depend on its time scale and the sensorimotor nature of specific behaviors. Therefore, we describe the main time scales and their associated behaviors and show how the perception and execution of timing events in the subsecond and second scales may depend on similar or different neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In human and nonhuman primates, the cortical motor system comprises a collection of brain areas primarily related to motor control. Existing evidence suggests that no other mammalian group has the number, extension, and complexity of motor-related areas observed in the frontal lobe of primates. Such diversity is probably related to the wide behavioral flexibility that primates display. Indeed, recent comparative anatomical, psychophysical, and neurophysiological studies suggest that the evolution of the motor cortical areas closely correlates with the emergence of high cognitive abilities. Advances in understanding the cortical motor system have shown that these areas are also related to functions previously linked to higher-order associative areas. In addition, experimental observations have shown that the classical distinction between perceptual and motor functions is not strictly followed across cortical areas. In this paper, we review evidence suggesting that evolution of the motor system had a role in the shaping of different cognitive functions in primates. We argue that the increase in the complexity of the motor system has contributed to the emergence of new abilities observed in human and nonhuman primates, including the recognition and imitation of the actions of others, speech perception and production, and the execution and appreciation of the rhythmic structure of music.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of physiologically relevant in vitro-in vivo correlations (IV-IVCs) is key for any biorelevant dissolution test. Historically, bicarbonate buffers have produced better correlations than compendial phosphate buffered media, though such tests are usually performed at a constant pH experiment, overlooking the notion that the pH of the luminal fluids is variable and fluctuating. In this work, we have devised a dynamic dissolution test method employing a physiological bicarbonate buffer under pH conditions of the proximal gut in order to assess the dissolution behaviour of various enteric polymer-coated (gastro-resistant) prednisolone tablets. The pH of the media is modulated and controlled by an Auto pH System\u2122 which exploits the physiological equilibria between [H2CO3] and [HCO3(-)], to match it to the aboral change in pH with transit of the dosage form through the proximal small intestine (from pH 5.6 up to 6.8). The lag time values for an accelerated release and standard EUDRAGIT(\u00ae) L30D-55 coated formulation (25 min and 60 min, respectively) were close to the previously reported initial tablet disintegration time data obtained in-vivo by \u03b3-scintigraphy (28 min and 66 min, respectively). Dissolution of alternative delayed release coated products was also better discriminated in the dynamic buffer system. These data confirm the dynamic dissolution system provides a robust and reliable platform to predict the in vivo fate of oral products in a laboratory setting.",

    "abstract": "We determined the encoding properties of single cells and the decoding accuracy of cell populations in the medial premotor cortex (MPC) of Rhesus monkeys to represent in a time-varying fashion the duration and serial order of six intervals produced rhythmically during a synchronization-continuation tapping task. We found that MPC represented the temporal and sequential structure of rhythmic movements by activating small ensembles of neurons that encoded the duration or the serial order in rapid succession, so that the pattern of active neurons changed dramatically within each interval. Interestingly, the width of the encoding or decoding function for serial order increased as a function of duration. Finally, we found that the strength of correlation in spontaneous activity of the individual cells varied as a function of the timing of their recruitment. These results demonstrate the existence of dynamic representations in MPC for the duration and serial order of intervals produced rhythmically and suggest that this dynamic code depends on ensembles of interconnected neurons that provide a strong synaptic drive to the next ensemble in a consecutive chain of neural events.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, the neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive processing have been investigated at the single cell level. Here we show that the dynamic, millisecond-by-millisecond, interactions between neuronal events measured by local field potentials are modulated in an orderly fashion by key task variables of a space categorization task performed by monkeys. These interactions were stronger during periods of higher cognitive load and varied in sign (positive, negative). They were observed both within area 7a of the posterior parietal cortex and between symmetric 7a areas of the two hemispheres. Time lags for maximum interactions were longer for opposite- vs. same-hemisphere recordings, and lags for negative interactions were longer than for positive interactions in both recording sites. These findings underscore the involvement of dynamic neuronal interactions in cognitive processing within and across hemispheres. They also provide accurate estimates of lags in callosal interactions, very comparable to similar estimates of callosal conduction delays derived from neuroanatomical measurements (Caminiti et al., 2013).",

    "abstract": "It has been argued that perception, decision making, and movement planning are in reality tightly interwoven brain processes. However, how they are implemented in neural circuits is still a matter of debate. We tested human subjects in a temporal categorization task in which intervals had to be categorized as short or long. Subjects communicated their decision by moving a cursor into one of two possible targets, which appeared separated by different angles from trial to trial. Even though there was a 1 second-long delay between interval presentation and decision communication, categorization difficulty affected subjects' performance, reaction (RT) and movement time (MT). In addition, reaction and movement times were also influenced by the distance between the targets. This implies that not only perceptual, but also movement-related considerations were incorporated into the decision process. Therefore, we searched for a model that could use categorization difficulty and target separation to describe subjects' performance, RT, and MT. We developed a network consisting of two mutually inhibiting neural populations, each tuned to one of the possible categories and composed of an accumulation and a memory node. This network sequentially acquired interval information, maintained it in working memory and was then attracted to one of two possible states, corresponding to a categorical decision. It faithfully replicated subjects' RT and MT as a function of categorization difficulty and target distance; it also replicated performance as a function of categorization difficulty. Furthermore, this model was used to make new predictions about the effect of untested durations, target distances and delay durations. To our knowledge, this is the first biologically plausible model that has been proposed to account for decision making and communication by integrating both sensory and motor planning information.",

    "abstract": "Age-mediated changes in gut physiology are considerations central to the elucidation of drug performance from oral formulations. Using rats of different age groups we measured the pH, buffer capacity, fluid volume, osmolality, and surface tension of gastrointestinal (GI) fluids, and therein explored the impact of these variables on prednisolone and mesalazine solubility in luminal fluids. We also studied the distribution of gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and mucus layer thickness across the GI tract in rats of different age groups. At a mucosal level, there was an increase in GALT from young to adult rat. Gastrointestinal pH and buffer capacity remained mostly unchanged with age, except some pH differences in stomach and distal small intestine and a higher buffer capacity in the large intestinal fluids of young rats. Osmolality and surface tension also remained unaffected with the exception of a lower osmolality in elderly stomach and a lower surface tension in the small intestine of young rats. The difference in luminal environment on ageing influenced the solubility of studied drugs, for instance prednisolone solubility was shown to be higher in adult rats (mid small intestine and caecum) and solubility of mesalazine was significantly higher in the elderly distal small intestine.",

    "abstract": "Despite rapid dissolution in compendial phosphate buffers, gastro resistant (enteric coated) products can take up to 2 h to disintegrate in the human small intestine, which clearly highlights the inadequacy of the in vitro test method to predict in vivo behaviour of these formulations. The aim of this study was to establish the utility of a novel pH 5.6 bicarbonate buffer, stabilized by an Auto pH\u2122 System, as a better surrogate of the conditions of the proximal small intestine to investigate the dissolution behaviour of standard and accelerated release enteric double coating formulations. Prednisolone tablets were coated with 3 or 5 mg/cm(2) of partially neutralized EUDRAGIT(\u00ae) L 30 D-55, HP-55 or HPMC adjusted to pH 6 or 8. An outer layer of EUDRAGIT(\u00ae) L 30 D-55 was applied at 5mg/cm(2). For comparison purposes, a standard single layer of EUDRAGIT(\u00ae) L 30 D-55 was applied to the tablets. Dissolution was carried out using USP II apparatus in 0.1 M HCl for 2 h, followed by pH 5.6 bicarbonate buffer. EUDRAGIT(\u00ae) L 30 D-55 single-coated tablets showed a slow drug release with a lag time of 75 min in buffer, whereas release from the EUDRAGIT(\u00ae) L 30 D-55 double-coated tablets was accelerated. These in vitro lag times closely match the in vivo disintegration times for these coated tablets reported previously. Drug release was further accelerated from modified double coatings, particularly in the case of coatings with a thinner inner layer of HP-55 or HPMC (pH 8 and KH2PO4). This study confirms that the pH 5.6 bicarbonate buffer system offers significant advantages during the development of dosage forms designed to release the drug in the upper small intestine.",

    "abstract": "Novel and highly tuneable pulsatile drug delivery systems have been prepared through the electrospinning of a blend of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), sodium alginate (SA), and sodium ibuprofen (SI). The resultant fibres contain crystallites of SI embedded in a PEO-SA matrix, and rather than being obtained as flat mats on the collector plate form novel three dimensional structures extending upwards the needle. Fibres were prepared with a range of loadings of SI and SA. It was found that at pH 6.8 (reminiscent of the intestinal tract) the fibres dissolve very rapidly, freeing all the embedded drug within ca. 20 minutes. However, at pH 3 (representative of the stomach pH in the fed state or in older patients) an unusual two stage release mechanism is seen. This comprises a rapid burst release, followed by a period where no further drug is released for ca. 120-150 minutes, and then a final stage of release freeing the remainder of the drug into solution. The amount of release in the initial stage, and the length of time between the first and final drug release stages, can be controlled by adjusting the SI and SA contents of the fibres respectively. This results in highly tunable pulsatile release materials.",

    "abstract": "Gamma (\u03b3) and beta (\u03b2) oscillations seem to play complementary functions in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit (CBGT) during motor behavior. We investigated the time-varying changes of the putaminal spiking activity and the spectral power of local field potentials (LFPs) during a task where the rhythmic tapping of monkeys was guided by isochronous stimuli separated by a fixed duration (synchronization phase), followed by a period of internally timed movements (continuation phase). We found that the power of both bands and the discharge rate of cells showed an orderly change in magnitude as a function of the duration and/or the serial order of the intervals executed rhythmically. More LFPs were tuned to duration and/or serial order in the \u03b2- than the \u03b3-band, although different values of preferred features were represented by single cells and by both bands. Importantly, in the LFPs tuned to serial order, there was a strong bias toward the continuation phase for the \u03b2-band when aligned to movements, and a bias toward the synchronization phase for the \u03b3-band when aligned to the stimuli. Our results suggest that \u03b3-oscillations reflect local computations associated with stimulus processing, whereas \u03b2-activity involves the entrainment of large putaminal circuits, probably in conjunction with other elements of CBGT, during internally driven rhythmic tapping.",

    "abstract": "A critical question in tapping behavior is to understand whether the temporal control is exerted on the duration and trajectory of the downward-upward hand movement or on the pause between hand movements. In the present study, we determined the duration of both the movement execution and pauses of monkeys performing a synchronization-continuation task (SCT), using the speed profile of their tapping behavior. We found a linear increase in the variance of pause-duration as a function of interval, while the variance of the motor implementation was relatively constant across intervals. In fact, 96% of the variability of the duration of a complete tapping cycle (pause + movement) was due to the variability of the pause duration. In addition, we performed a Bayesian model selection to determine the effect of interval duration (450-1,000 ms), serial-order (1-6 produced intervals), task phase (sensory cued or internally driven), and marker modality (auditory or visual) on the duration of the movement-pause and tapping movement. The results showed that the most important parameter used to successfully perform the SCT was the control of the pause duration. We also found that the kinematics of the tapping movements was concordant with a stereotyped ballistic control of the hand pressing the push-button. The present findings support the idea that monkeys used an explicit timing strategy to perform the SCT, where a dedicated timing mechanism controlled the duration of the pauses of movement, while also triggered the execution of fixed movements across each interval of the rhythmic sequence.",

    "abstract": "We propose a decomposition of the neurocognitive mechanisms that might underlie interval-based timing and rhythmic entrainment. Next to reviewing the concepts central to the definition of rhythmic entrainment, we discuss recent studies that suggest rhythmic entrainment to be specific to humans and a selected group of bird species, but, surprisingly, is not obvious in non-human primates. On the basis of these studies we propose the gradual audiomotor evolution hypothesis that suggests that humans fully share interval-based timing with other primates, but only partially share the ability of rhythmic entrainment (or beat-based timing). This hypothesis accommodates the fact that non-human primates (i.e., macaques) performance is comparable to humans in single interval tasks (such as interval reproduction, categorization, and interception), but show differences in multiple interval tasks (such as rhythmic entrainment, synchronization, and continuation). Furthermore, it is in line with the observation that macaques can, apparently, synchronize in the visual domain, but show less sensitivity in the auditory domain. And finally, while macaques are sensitive to interval-based timing and rhythmic grouping, the absence of a strong coupling between the auditory and motor system of non-human primates might be the reason why macaques cannot rhythmically entrain in the way humans do.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to quantify the content of lipid droplets in bovine oocytes and embryos from Bos indicus (Bi), Bos taurus (Bt) and Bos indicus \u00d7 Bos taurus (Bi \u00d7 Bt). Oocytes were aspirated post-mortem and subjected to in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro development; the medium employed at each stage (TCM-199, TALP, SOF) was supplemented with (i) serum replacement (SR), (ii) foetal calf serum (FCS) or (iii) oestrous cow serum (ECS). The structure and distribution of the lipid droplets were established using electron microscopy, but were quantified using an optical microscope on semi-fine toluidine blue-stained sections. The highest percentage of embryos corresponded to those produced with FCS and ECS, which differed from embryos generated with SR (p < 0.05). The highest percentage of morulae and the lowest percentage of blastocysts were obtained with the SR supplement (p < 0.05). The oocytes cultured in FCS demonstrated a higher number of lipid droplets compared to those cultured in SR and ECS (p < 0.05). Less accumulation of lipids was observed in embryos supplemented with SR. The lowest and highest numbers of lipid droplets in oocytes corresponded to the Bi and Bt strain, respectively. The lowest amount of lipid droplets in embryos was observed in Bi (p < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementation of the in vitro development culture medium (synthetic oviduct fluid) with a synthetic substitute serum produced similar results in terms of embryo development compared to those obtained with FCS, but a decreased degree of lipid droplet accumulation was observed in the in vitro-cultured embryos.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the stability of four corticosteroids in the presence of human colonic bacteria to understand better their luminal behaviour when delivered orally in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The stability of prednisolone, budesonide, beclometasone (17, 21) dipropionate (BDP) and its active metabolite, beclometasone-17-monopropionate (17-BMP), were investigated at three different concentrations following incubation in a mixed faecal inoculum (simulated human colonic fluid) under anaerobic conditions. Prednisolone, at all three concentrations, was completely degraded within 3 h. The degradation of budesonide progressed at a slower rate, with complete degradation occurring within 7h; the degradation of the S epimer of budesonide was faster than the R epimer. BDP degraded completely within 2 h while its active metabolite 17-BMP was comparatively stable. In contrast to the results in the faecal inoculum, all molecules were stable in the simulated colonic fluid in the absence of human faeces (control). This study demonstrates that prednisolone, BDP and budesonide are completely metabolized in simulated human colonic fluid and confirms the role of colonic bacteria in the metabolism of corticosteroids.",

    "abstract": "Putative colonic release formulations of calcium (Ca)-alginate coated with chitosan containing two different actives, prednisolone and inulin, were prepared in three different sizes, beads (D50 = 2104 \u03bcm) and microparticles (D50 = 354 and 136\u2009\u03bcm). The formulations were tested in standard phosphate buffer and biorelevant Krebs bicarbonate buffer at pH 7.4, and were further evaluated in the presence of the bacterium E. coli. Product yield and encapsulation were higher with prednisolone than with inulin. In Krebs bicarbonate buffer, a clear relationship between particle size and prednisolone release was observed. In contrast, release of inulin was independent of the particle size. In phosphate buffer, the particles eroded quickly, whereas in Krebs buffer, the particles swelled slowly. The difference in behavior can be attributed to the formation of calcium phosphate in the phosphate buffer medium, which in turn weakens the Ca-alginate matrix core. In the presence of E. coli, the formulations were fermented and the release of prednisolone was accelerated. In conclusion, the buffer media affects formulation behavior and drug release, with the bicarbonate media providing a better simulation of in vivo behavior. Moreover, the susceptibility of the formulations to bacterial action indicates their suitability as carriers for colonic drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how sensory and motor processes are temporally integrated to control behavior in the hundredths of milliseconds-to-minutes range is a fascinating problem given that the basic electrophysiological properties of neurons operate on a millisecond timescale. Single-unit recording studies in monkeys have identified localized timing circuits, whereas neuropsychological studies of humans who have damage to the basal ganglia have indicated that core structures, such as the cortico-thalamic-basal ganglia circuit, play an important role in timing and time perception. Taken together, these data suggest that a core timing mechanism interacts with context-dependent areas. This idea of a temporal hub with a distributed network is used to investigate the abstract properties of interval tuning as well as temporal illusions and intersensory timing. We conclude by proposing that the interconnections built into this core timing mechanism are designed to provide a form of degeneracy as protection against injury, disease, or age-related decline.",

    "abstract": "The precise quantification of time during motor performance is critical for many complex behaviors, including musical execution, speech articulation, and sports; however, its neural mechanisms are primarily unknown. We found that neurons in the medial premotor cortex (MPC) of behaving monkeys are tuned to the duration of produced intervals during rhythmic tapping tasks. Interval-tuned neurons showed similar preferred intervals across tapping behaviors that varied in the number of produced intervals and the modality used to drive temporal processing. In addition, we found that the same population of neurons is able to multiplex the ordinal structure of a sequence of rhythmic movements and a wide range of durations in the range of hundreds of milliseconds. Our results also revealed a possible gain mechanism for encoding the total number of intervals in a sequence of temporalized movements, where interval-tuned cells show a multiplicative effect of their activity for longer sequences of intervals. These data suggest that MPC is part of a core timing network that uses interval tuning as a signal to represent temporal processing in a variety of behavioral contexts where time is explicitly quantified.",

    "abstract": "It was recently shown that rhythmic entrainment, long considered a human-specific mechanism, can be demonstrated in a selected group of bird species, and, somewhat surprisingly, not in more closely related species such as nonhuman primates. This observation supports the vocal learning hypothesis that suggests rhythmic entrainment to be a by-product of the vocal learning mechanisms that are shared by several bird and mammal species, including humans, but that are only weakly developed, or missing entirely, in nonhuman primates. To test this hypothesis we measured auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), probing a well-documented component in humans, the mismatch negativity (MMN) to study rhythmic expectation. We demonstrate for the first time in rhesus monkeys that, in response to infrequent deviants in pitch that were presented in a continuous sound stream using an oddball paradigm, a comparable ERP component can be detected with negative deflections in early latencies (Experiment 1). Subsequently we tested whether rhesus monkeys can detect gaps (omissions at random positions in the sound stream; Experiment 2) and, using more complex stimuli, also the beat (omissions at the first position of a musical unit, i.e. the 'downbeat'; Experiment 3). In contrast to what has been shown in human adults and newborns (using identical stimuli and experimental paradigm), the results suggest that rhesus monkeys are not able to detect the beat in music. These findings are in support of the hypothesis that beat induction (the cognitive mechanism that supports the perception of a regular pulse from a varying rhythm) is species-specific and absent in nonhuman primates. In addition, the findings support the auditory timing dissociation hypothesis, with rhesus monkeys being sensitive to rhythmic grouping (detecting the start of a rhythmic group), but not to the induced beat (detecting a regularity from a varying rhythm).",

    "abstract": "In tasks where different sensory, cognitive, and motor events are mixed in a sequence it is difficult to determine whether neural activity is related to any behavioral parameter. Here, we consider the case in which two alternative trial-alignment schemes correspond to two different neural representations, one stimulus-related and the other movement-related, using both simulations of neural activity and real recordings in the medial premotor areas during a multiple-interval tapping task called synchronization-continuation task (SCT). To discover whether neural responses are better aligned to sensory or motor events we introduce a family of trial-alignment time-warping functions indexed by a single parameter such that when the parameter takes the value 0 the trials are aligned to the stimulus and when the parameter takes the value 1 they are aligned to the movement. We then characterize neurons by the best-fitting alignment scheme (in the sense of maximum likelihood) under the assumption that the correct alignment would produce homogeneous trials without excess trial-to-trial variation. We use Bayes factors to determine the evidence in favor of sensory or motor neural alignments. The simulations revealed that the variability in neural responses and sequential motor outputs are key parameters to obtain appropriate warping results. In addition, the analysis on the activity of 500 neurons in the medial premotor areas of monkeys executing the SCT showed that most of the neural responses (54.2%) were aligned to the tapping movements instead of the stimuli used to drive the temporal behavior.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews recent progress in understanding the functional roles of inhibitory interneurons in behaving animals and how they affect information processing in cortical microcircuits. Multiple studies have shown that the morphological subtypes of inhibitory cells show distinct electrophysiological properties, as well as different molecular and neurochemical identities, providing a large mosaic of inhibitory mechanisms for the dynamic processing of information in the cortex. However, it is only recently that some specific functions of different interneuronal subtypes have been described in behaving animals. In this regard, influential results have been obtained using the known differences of interneurons and pyramidal cells recorded extracellularly to dissociate the functional roles that these two classes of neurons may play in the cortical microcircuits during various behaviors. Neurons can be segregated into fast-spiking (FS) cells that show short action potentials, high discharge rates, and correspond to putative interneurons; and regular-spiking (RS) cells that show larger action potentials and correspond to pyramidal neurons. Using this classification strategy, it has been found that cortical inhibition is involved in sculpting the tuning to different stimulus or behavioral features across a wide variety of sensory, association, and motor areas. Recent studies have suggested that the increase in high-frequency synchronization during information processing and spatial attention may be mediated by FS activation. Finally, FS are active during motor planning and movement execution in different motor areas, supporting the notion that inhibitory interneurons are involved in shaping the motor command but not in gating the cortical output.",

    "abstract": "Temporal information processing is critical for many complex behaviors including speech and music cognition, yet its neural substrate remains elusive. We examined the neurophysiological properties of medial premotor cortex (MPC) of two Rhesus monkeys during the execution of a synchronization-continuation tapping task that includes the basic sensorimotor components of a variety of rhythmic behaviors. We show that time-keeping in the MPC is governed by separate cell populations. One group encoded the time remaining for an action, showing activity whose duration changed as a function of interval duration, reaching a peak at similar magnitudes and times with respect to the movement. The other cell group showed a response that increased in duration or magnitude as a function of the elapsed time from the last movement. Hence, the sensorimotor loops engaged during the task may depend on the cyclic interplay between different neuronal chronometers that quantify the time passed and the remaining time for an action.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that a functional overlap exists in the brain for temporal and spatial information processing. To test this, we designed two relative categorization tasks in which human subjects and a Rhesus monkey had to assign time intervals or distances to a \"short\" or \"long\" category according to varying prototypes. The performance of both species was analyzed using psychometric techniques that showed that they may have similar perceptual, memory, and/or decision mechanisms, specially for the estimation of time intervals. We also did a correlation analysis with human subjects' psychometric thresholds and the results imply that indeed, temporal and spatial information categorization share neural substrates. However, not all of the tested distances and intervals correlated with each other, suggesting the existence of sub-circuits that process restricted ranges of distances and intervals. A different analysis was done on the monkey data, in which the influence of the previous categorical prototypes was measured on the task currently being performed. Again, we found a significant interaction between previous and current interval and distance categorization. Overall, the present paper points toward common or at least partially overlapped neural circuits for temporal and spatial categorization in primates.",

    "abstract": "In the present study we characterized the strength and time course of category-selective responses in prefrontal cortex and area 7a of the posterior parietal cortex during a match-to-sample spatial categorization task. A monkey was trained to categorize whether the height of a horizontal sample bar, presented in rectangular frame at one of three vertical locations, was \"high\" or \"low,\" depending on whether its position was above or below the frame's midline. After the display of this sample bar, and after a delay, choice bars were sequentially flashed in two locations: at the top and at the bottom of the frame (\"choice\" epoch). If the monkey timed its response to the display of the choice bar that matched the sample bar, he was rewarded. We found that cells in prefrontal cortex discriminated category early after the initial sample bar was shown, and continued to differentiate \"up\" from \"down\" trials throughout the delay and choice periods. In contrast, parietal cells did not differentiate category until the choice period. Therefore, our results support the notion of a top-down categorical signal that originates in prefrontal cortex and that is only represented in parietal cortex when it is necessary to express the categorical decision through a movement.",

    "abstract": "We all respond differently to drugs. Personalised medicine aims to improve efficacy and reduce side effects, and efforts are being made to understand the physiological differences that underlie responses to drugs. Genetics, diet and disease state can be key; however, gender also plays an important role in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and drug toxicity. Differences in metabolism and clearance of drugs as a consequence of distinct hepatic and renal processes in males and females are now much better understood but little is known about gender differences in the gastrointestinal tract. As the recipient of all orally administered medications, differences at this level can have a major impact on drug delivery and bioavailability; yet these continue to be ignored and insufficiently studied in the context of drug disposition. The aim of this review is to highlight the known gender differences in gut physiology. Clinical case studies are presented, where possible, to illustrate the influence of these differences on drug disposition and gaps in current knowledge are highlighted to encourage further research in this area.",

    "abstract": "The use of compendial pH 6.8 phosphate buffer to assess dissolution of enteric coated products gives rise to poor in vitro-in vivo correlations because of the inadequacy of the buffer to resemble small intestinal fluids. A more representative and physiological medium, pH 6.8 bicarbonate buffer, was developed to evaluate the dissolution behaviour of enteric coatings. The bicarbonate system was evolved from pH7.4 Hanks balanced salt solution to produce a pH 6.8 bicarbonate buffer (modified Hanks buffer, mHanks), which resembles the ionic composition and buffer capacity of intestinal milieu. Prednisolone tablets were coated with a range of enteric polymers: hypromellose phthalate (HP-50 and HP-55), cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS-LF and HPMCAS-MF), methacrylic acid copolymers (EUDRAGIT\u00ae L100-55, EUDRAGIT\u00ae L30D-55 and EUDRAGIT\u00ae L100) and polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP). Dissolution of coated tablets was carried out using USP-II apparatus in 0.1M HCl for 2h followed by pH 6.8 phosphate buffer or pH 6.8 mHanks bicarbonate buffer. In pH 6.8 phosphate buffer, the various enteric polymer coated products displayed rapid and comparable dissolution profiles. In pH 6.8 mHanks buffer, drug release was delayed and marked differences were observed between the various coated tablets, which is comparable to the delayed disintegration times reported in the literature for enteric coated products in the human small intestine. In summary, the use of pH 6.8 physiological bicarbonate buffer (mHanks) provides more realistic and discriminative in vitro release assessment of enteric coated formulations compared to compendial phosphate buffer.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory animals are often used in drug delivery and research. However, basic information about their gastrointestinal pH, fluid volume, and lymphoid tissue is not completely known. We have investigated these post-mortem in healthy guinea pigs, rabbits and pigs, to assess their suitability for pre-clinical studies by comparing the results with reported human literature. The mean gastric pH (fed ad libitum) was 2.9 and 4.4 in guinea pig and pig, respectively. In contrast, a very low pH (1.6) was recorded in the rabbits. The small intestinal pH was found in the range of 6.4-7.4 in the guinea pigs and rabbits, whereas lower pH (6.1-6.7) was recorded in the pig, which may have consequences for ionisable or pH responsive systems when tested in pig. A relatively lower pH than in the small intestine was found in the caecum (6.0-6.4) and colon (6.1-6.6) of the guinea pig, rabbit and the pig. The water content in the gastrointestinal tract of guinea pig, rabbit and pig was 51g, 153g and 1546g, respectively. When normalized to the body weight, the guinea pig, had larger amounts of water compared to the rabbit and the pig (guinea pig>rabbit>pig); in contrast, a reverse order was found when normalized to per unit length of the gut (guinea pig<rabbit<pig). The lymphoid tissue distribution (lymphoid follicles, Peyer's patches and long strips) along the length of the gut in these animals is presented; in particular, an abundance of lymphoid tissue was found in pig's stomach, small intestine and caecum, and rabbit's appendix. Their ample presence indicated the potential utility of these animal species in oral and colonic vaccination. These differences in the gastrointestinal parameters of the guinea pig, rabbit and pig reiterates the crucial importance of correctly selecting animal models for pre-clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Oral modified-release dosage forms can be designed with the aim of achieving specific pharmacokinetic profiles, delivering to specific gut localities or reducing the number of drug administrations. Multiple-unit systems, such as pellets, beads or granules, often claim superiority to single-unit modified-release formulations in terms of predictability and reproducibility of behaviour in the gastrointestinal tract. This is an oversimplification and in this review we discuss the effect of the highly variable gastrointestinal transit on the bioperformance of multiple-unit dosage forms, relative to their single-unit counterparts. We examine the sometimes contradictory literature in this area and highlight specific case studies which demonstrate the effect of intestinal transit on dosage form performance and drug absorption.",

    "abstract": "This study describes the psychometric similarities and differences in motor timing performance between 20 human subjects and three rhesus monkeys during two timing production tasks. These tasks involved tapping on a push-button to produce the same set of intervals (range of 450 to 1,000 ms), but they differed in the number of intervals produced (single vs. multiple) and the modality of the stimuli (auditory vs. visual) used to define the time intervals. The data showed that for both primate species, variability increased as a function of the length of the produced target interval across tasks, a result in accordance with the scalar property. Interestingly, the temporal performance of rhesus monkeys was equivalent to that of human subjects during both the production of single intervals and the tapping synchronization to a metronome. Overall, however, human subjects were more accurate than monkeys and showed less timing variability. This was especially true during the self-pacing phase of the multiple interval production task, a behavior that may be related to complex temporal cognition, such as speech and music execution. In addition, the well-known human bias toward auditory as opposed to visual cues for the accurate execution of time intervals was not evident in rhesus monkeys. These findings validate the rhesus monkey as an appropriate model for the study of the neural basis of time production, but also suggest that the exquisite temporal abilities of humans, which peak in speech and music performance, are not all shared with macaques.",

    "abstract": "Bicarbonate media are reflective of the ionic composition and buffer capacity of small intestinal luminal fluids. Here we investigate methods to stabilise bicarbonate buffers which can be readily applied to USP-II dissolution apparatus. The in vitro drug release behaviour of three enteric coated mesalazine (mesalamine) products is investigated. Asacol 400 mg and Asacol 800 mg (Asacol HD) and the new generation, high dose (1200 mg) delayed and sustained release formulation, Mezavant (Lialda), are compared in pH 7.4 Krebs bicarbonate and phosphate buffers. Bicarbonate stabilisation was achieved by: continuous sparging of the medium with 5% CO(2)(g), application of a layer of liquid paraffin above the medium, or a specially designed in-house seal device that prevents CO(2)(g) loss. Each of the products displayed a delayed onset of drug release in physiological bicarbonate media compared to phosphate buffer. Moreover, Mezavant displayed a zero-order, sustained release profile in phosphate buffer; in bicarbonate media, however, this slow drug release was no longer apparent and a profile similar to that of Asacol 400 mg was observed. These similar release patterns of Asacol 400 mg and Mezavant displayed in bicarbonate media are in agreement with their pharmacokinetic profiles in humans. Bicarbonate media provide a better prediction of the in vivo behaviour of the mesalazine preparations investigated.",

    "abstract": "This article investigated both the ability of naive human subjects to learn interval production, as well as the properties of learning generalization across modalities and interval durations that varied systematically from the over-trained interval. Human subjects trained on a 450-, 650-, or 850-ms single-interval production task, using auditory stimuli to define the intervals, showed a significant decrease in performance variability with intensive training. This learning generalized to the visual modality and to non-trained durations following a Gaussian transfer pattern. However, the learning carryover followed different rules, depending on the duration of the trained interval as follows: (1) the dispersion of the generalization curve increased as a function of the trained interval, (2) the generalization pattern was tilted to the right in the visual condition, and (3) the transfer magnitude for 650 ms was less prominent than for the other two intervals. These findings suggest the existence of neural circuits that are tuned to specific time lengths and that show different temporal processing properties depending on their preferred interval duration.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we investigated how directional tuning of putative pyramidal cells is sharpened by inhibition from neighboring interneurons. First, different functional and electrophysiological criteria were used to identify putative pyramidal and interneuronal subtypes in a large database of motor cortical cells recorded during performance of the three-dimensional center-out task. Then we analyzed the relationship between the magnitude of inhibition and the tuning width, and a significant decrease of the latter as a function of the former was found in a population of putative pyramidal cells. In fact, the coupling of inhibition with narrow tuning was observed before and during movement execution on a cell-by-cell basis, indicating an important dynamic role of inhibition during movement control. Overall, these results suggest that local inhibition is involved in sculpting the directional specificity of a group of putative pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "In the present study we determined the performance interrelations of ten different tasks that involved the processing of temporal intervals in the subsecond range, using multidimensional analyses. Twenty human subjects executed the following explicit timing tasks: interval categorization and discrimination (perceptual tasks), and single and multiple interval tapping (production tasks). In addition, the subjects performed a continuous circle-drawing task that has been considered an implicit timing paradigm, since time is an emergent property of the produced spatial trajectory. All tasks could be also classified as single or multiple interval paradigms. Auditory or visual markers were used to define the intervals. Performance variability, a measure that reflects the temporal and non-temporal processes for each task, was used to construct a dissimilarity matrix that quantifies the distances between pairs of tasks. Hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling were carried out on the dissimilarity matrix, and the results showed a prominent segregation of explicit and implicit timing tasks, and a clear grouping between single and multiple interval paradigms. In contrast, other variables such as the marker modality were not as crucial to explain the performance between tasks. Thus, using this methodology we revealed a probable functional arrangement of neural systems engaged during different timing behaviors.",

    "abstract": "In the present study we examined the performance variability of a group of 13 subjects in eight different tasks that involved the processing of temporal intervals in the subsecond range. These tasks differed in their sensorimotor processing (S; perception vs. production), the modality of the stimuli used to define the intervals (M; auditory vs. visual), and the number of intervals (N; one or four). Different analytical techniques were used to determine the existence of a central or distributed timing mechanism across tasks. The results showed a linear increase in performance variability as a function of the interval duration in all tasks. However, this compliance of the scalar property of interval timing was accompanied by a strong effect of S, N, and M and the interaction between these variables on the subjects' temporal accuracy. Thus the performance variability was larger not only in perceptual tasks than that in motor-timing tasks, but also using visual rather than auditory stimuli, and decreased as a function of the number of intervals. These results suggest the existence of a partially overlapping distributed mechanism underlying the ability to quantify time in different contexts.",

    "abstract": "Interval timing deficiencies in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have been a matter of debate. Here we test the possibility of PD heterogeneity as a source for this discrepancy. Temporal performance of PD patients and control subjects was assessed during two interval tapping tasks and during a categorization task of time intervals. These tasks involved temporal processing of intervals in the hundreds of milliseconds range; however, they also covered a wide range of behavioral contexts, differing in their perceptual, decision-making, memory, and execution requirements. The results showed the following significant findings. First, there were two clearly segregated subgroups of PD patients: one with high temporal variability in the three timing tasks, and another with a temporal variability that did not differ substantially from control subjects. In contrast, PD patients with high and low temporal variability showed similar perceptual, decision-making, memory, and execution performance in a set of control tasks. Second, a slope analysis, designed to dissociate time-dependent from time-independent sources of variation, revealed that the increase in variability in this group of PD patients was mainly due to an increment in the variability associated with the timing mechanism. Third, while the control subjects showed significant correlations in performance variability across tasks, PD patients, and particularly those with high temporal variability, did not show such task correlations. Finally, the results showed that dopaminergic treatment restored the correlation effect in PD patients, producing a highly significant correlation between the inter-task variability. Altogether, these results indicate that a subpopulation of PD patients shows a strong disruption in temporal processing in the hundreds of milliseconds range. These findings are discussed in terms of the role of dopamine as a tuning element for the synchronization of temporal processing across different behavioral contexts in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Directional tuning is a basic functional property of cell activity in the motor cortex. Previous work has indicated that cells with similar preferred directions are organized in columns perpendicular to the cortical surface. Here we show that these columns are organized in an orderly fashion in the tangential dimension on the cortical surface. Based on a large number of microelectrode penetrations and systematic exploration of the proximal arm area of the motor cortex while monkeys made free reaching 3D movements, it was estimated that (i) directional minicolumns are approximately 30 mum in width, (ii) minicolumns with similar preferred directions tend to occur in doublets or triplets, and (iii) such minicolumns tend to repeat every approximately 240 mum (estimated width of a column), with intermediate preferred directions represented in a gradient. These findings provide evidence for an orderly mapping of the preferred direction in the motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) is known to result in peripheral neuropathy. To better understand the functional and morphological consequences of iAs exposure, we examined the electrophysiological and histological characteristics of the sensory sural nerves in adult Male Wistar rats following 30 days of sodium arsenite administration by gavage (10 mg/kg body weight/day). Arsenic (As) levels in the peripheral nerves of exposed animals were about 150 times greater than those in controls. Lipid peroxidation was also increased in iAs-exposed animals. Compound action potentials (CAPs) evoked in iAs-exposed nerves were characterized by a slower conduction velocity ( approximately 26%). iAs-exposed nerves also showed a trend towards a decreased CAP area ( approximately 35%). These electrophysiological changes were consistent with histological alterations such as a approximately 56% decrease in myelin thickness. In addition, the perimeter and transverse area of axons were reduced to 29% and 45% of control, respectively. Our results suggest that accumulation of As produced by iAs exposure induces oxidative damage, severe demyelination, and other morphological alterations in axons of peripheral nerves. These changes may, in turn, induce changes in the generation and propagation of action potentials in peripheral nerves, leading to decreased transmission of information from peripheral sensory organs to the central nervous system.",

The formulation showed acceptable pharmacotechnical properties and assay requirements. In vitro dissolution studies indicated a sustained-release pattern throughout 24 hours of the study that was comparable to the theoretical release profile.

    "abstract": "The spatial arrangement of preferred directions (PDs) in the primary motor cortex has revealed evidence for columnar organization and short-range order. We investigated the large-scale properties of this arrangement. We recorded neural activity at sites on a grid covering a large region of the arm area of the motor cortex while monkeys performed a 3D reaching task. Sites were projected to the cortical surface along anatomically defined cortical columns and a PD was extracted from each site with directionally tuned activity. We analyzed the resulting 2D surface map of PDs. Consistent with previous studies, we found that any particular reaching direction was re-represented at many points across the recorded area. In particular, we determined that the median radius of a cortical region required to represent the full complement of reaching directions is at most 1 mm. We also found that for the majority of regions of this size, the distribution of PDs within them exhibits an enrichment for the representation of forward and backward reaching directions (see companion paper). Finally, we found that the error of a population vector estimate of reaching direction constructed from neural activity within these regions is small on average, but varies significantly across different sections of the motor cortex, with the highest levels of error sustained near the fundus of the central sulcus and lowest levels achieved near the crown. We interpret these findings in the context of two well-known features of motor cortex, that is, its highly distributed anatomical organization and its behaviorally dependent plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Decreasing the dose frequency of cefpodoxime proxetil increases patient compliance; patients prefer to take the drug once daily. It also improves the rate of bacterial killing and hastens the cure from the indications, and therefore increases compliance. The hydrophilic matrix of HPMC controlled the cefpodoxime proxetil release effectively for 24 hours; hence, the formulation can be considered as a once-daily sustained-release tablet of cefpodoxime proxetil. The formulation showed acceptable pharmacotechnical properties and assay requirements. In vitro dissolution studies indicated a sustained-release pattern throughout 24 hours of the study that was comparable to the theoretical release profile. Drug release kinetics indicated that drug release was best explained by Higuchi's equation, as these plots showed the highest linearity (r ",

    "abstract": "The interception of moving targets is a complex activity that involves a dynamic interplay of several perceptual and motor processes and therefore involves a rich interaction among several brain areas. Although the behavioral aspects of interception have been studied for the past three decades, it is only during the past decade that neural studies have been focused on this problem. In addition to the interception itself, several neural studies have explored, within that context, the underlying mechanisms concerning perceptual aspects of moving stimuli, such as optic flow and apparent motion. In this review, we discuss the wealth of knowledge that has accumulated on this topic with an emphasis on the results of neural studies in behaving monkeys.",

    "abstract": "In order to optimize the production of embryos under tropical conditions and to test a possible seasonal effect on embryo quality, 40 Zebu cows were superovulated during the dry season (April to May) and during the rainy season (July to August). A total of 116 (average 2.7/cow) and 83 embryos (3.5 average/cow) were obtained during the respective seasons. After classification as good, fair or poor quality, embryos were tested based on their ultrastructural differences (n = 53 dry season 16 good, 20 fair and 17 poor and n = 61 rainy season 21 good, 20 fair and 20 poor) and their degree of apoptosis using the TUNEL technique (n = 30 during the dry season and n = 55 in the rainy season). Structural characteristics determining embryo quality varied between good and fair quality embryos. No difference, however, was observed between good, fair and poor quality embryos from the two seasons. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was different among embryos (p < 0.001), being lower in labelled cells of good quality embryos regardless of the season. Fewer apoptotic cells were observed in embryos assigned in all three quality levels during the rainy season (p < 0.001). Ultrastructural evaluations confirmed the results obtained by TUNEL. Cryopreserved embryos of good (n = 25 in each season) and fair quality (n = 11 dry season; n = 17 rainy season) showed a significant decrease of TUNEL-positive cells during the rainy season (p < 0.05). Results suggest that embryos collected in the dry season have more cellular damage in contrast; embryos cryopreserved in the rainy season appeared morphologically better equipped to result in a pregnancy following transfer.",

    "abstract": "We studied the functional properties of neurons of two elements of the parieto-frontal system: area 7a of the PPC and the motor cortex (M1), during an interception task of stimuli moving in real (RM) and apparent motion (AM). The stimulus moved along a circular path with one of 5 speeds, and was intercepted at 6 o'clock by exerting a force pulse on a joystick. A smooth stimulus motion was produced in RM, whereas in AM 5 stimuli were flashed successively at the vertices of a pentagon. The results showed, that a group of neurons in both areas above responded not only during the interception but also during a NOGO task in which the same stimuli were presented in the absence of a motor response. Most of these neurons were tuned to the stimulus angular position. In addition, we found that the time-varying neuronal activity in both areas was related to various aspects of stimulus motion and hand force, with stimulus-related activity prevailing in area 7a and hand-related activity prevailing in M1. Interestingly, the neural activity was selectively associated with the stimulus angle during RM, whereas it was tightly correlated to the time-to-contact during AM. Thus, the results suggest that area 7a was processing high level features of the circularly moving stimuli and was involved in the production of an early command signal for stimulus interception, whereas M1 was still processing some aspect of the visual stimulus that were used to trigger the interception movement using a predictive mechanism.",

    "abstract": "We compared quantitatively the psychometric capacity of human subjects to detect path-guided apparent motion (PAM) and the accuracy of cell ensembles in area 7a to code the same type of stimuli. Nine human subjects performed a detection task of PAM. They were instructed to indicate with a key-press whether they perceived a circularly moving object when five stimuli were flashed successively at the vertices of a regular pentagon. The stimuli were presented along a low contrast circular path with one of 33 speeds (150-600 degrees /s). The average psychometric curve revealed that the threshold for PAM detection was 314 degrees /s. The minimum and maximum thresholds for individual subjects were 277 degrees and 378 degrees /s, respectively. In addition, the activity of cells in area 7a that were modulated by the stimulus position in real or apparent motion was used in a multivariate linear regression analysis to recover the stimulus position over time. Real stimulus motion was decoded successfully from neural ensemble activity at all speeds. In contrast, the decoding of PAM was poor at low stimulus speeds but improved markedly above 300 degrees /s: in fact, this was very close to the threshold above for human subjects to perceive continuous stimulus motion in this condition. These results suggest that the posterior parietal cortex is part of a high-level system that is directly involved in the dynamic representation of complex motion.",

The method relies on visualization of tracks made by electrodes coated in a fluorescent dye. These tracks are used to estimate the parameters of a simple geometrical model that generates coordinates for each recording site. We describe several ways to measure the error of this procedure and present experimental results from recordings in the motor cortex of macaque monkeys that suggest that errors are of the order of 230 microm. We also introduce a coordinate transformation that takes into account the convoluted structure of the cortex near sulci to conveniently visualize recording site locations in a rectilinear representation. This method greatly extends the capabilities of microelectrodes for studying the three-dimensional structure of topographic maps in the cortex.",

    "abstract": "Adult human subjects can classify the height of an object as belonging to either of the \"high\" or \"low\" categories by utilizing an abstract concept of midline that divides the vertical dimension into two halves. Children lack this abstract concept of midline, do not have a sense that these categories are directional opposites, and their categorical and comparative usages of high(er) or low(er) are restricted to the corresponding poles. We investigated the abilities of a rhesus monkey to perform categorical judgments in space. We were also interested in the presence of the congruity effect (a decrease in response time when the objects compared are closer to the category pole) in the monkey. The presence of this phenomenon in the monkey would allow us to relate the behavior of the animal to the two major competing hypotheses that have been suggested to explain the congruity effect in humans: the analog and semantic models. The monkey was trained in delayed match-to-sample tasks in which it had to categorize objects as belonging to either a high or low category. The monkey was able to generate an abstract notion of midline in a fashion similar to that of adult human subjects. The congruity effect was also present in the monkey. These findings, taken together with the notion that monkeys are not considered to think in propositional terms, may favor an analog comparison model in the monkey.",

    "abstract": "We recorded the neuronal activity in the arm area of the motor cortex and parietal area 7a of two monkeys during interception of stimuli moving in real and apparent motion. The stimulus moved along a circular path with one of five speeds (180-540 degrees/s), and was intercepted at 6 o'clock by exerting a force pulse on a semi-isometric joystick which controlled a cursor on the screen. The real stimuli were shown in adjacent positions every 16 ms, whereas in the apparent motion situation five stimuli were flashed successively at the vertices of a regular pentagon. The results showed, first, that a group of neurons in both areas above responded not only during the interception but also during a NOGO task in which the same stimuli were presented in the absence of a motor response. This finding suggests these areas are involved in both the processing of the stimulus as well as in the preparation and production of the interception movement. In addition, a group of motor cortical cells responded during the interception task but not during a center --> out task, in which the monkeys produced similar force pulses towards eight stationary targets. This group of cells may be engaged in sensorimotor transformations more specific to the interception of real and apparent moving stimuli. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that the time-varying neuronal activity in area 7a and motor cortex was related to various aspects of stimulus motion and hand force in both the real and apparent motion conditions, with stimulus-related activity prevailing in area 7a and hand-related activity prevailing in motor cortex. In addition, the neural activity was selectively associated with the stimulus angle during real motion, whereas it was tightly correlated to the time-to-contact in the apparent motion condition, particularly in the motor cortex. Overall, these observations indicate that neurons in motor cortex and area 7a are processing different parameters of the stimulus depending on the kind of stimulus motion, and that this information is used in a predictive fashion in motor cortex to trigger the interception movement.",

Nerves from undernourished animals showed maximal CAP responses of smaller amplitude and area, larger trial-to-trial variability in area, and a significant reduction in axonal myelin sheath thickness than nerves from control animals. It is suggested that perinatal undernourishment produces changes in axonal myelin sheath structure, resulting in severe alterations in the generation and propagation of action potentials (block and/or intermittent conduction) in sensory afferent fibers in the rat.",

    "abstract": "Human subjects represent the location of a point in 2D space using two independent dimensions (x-y in Euclidean or radius-angle in polar space), and encode location in memory along these dimensions using two levels of representation: a fine-grain value and a category. Here we determined whether monkeys possessed the ability to represent location with these two levels of coding. A rhesus monkey was trained to reproduce the location of a dot in a circle by pointing, after a delay period, on the location where a dot was presented. Five different delay periods (0.5-5 s) were used. The results showed that the monkey used a polar coordinate system to represent the fine-grain spatial coding, where the radius and angle of the dots were encoded independently. The variability of the spatial response and reaction time increased with longer delays. Furthermore, the animal was able to form a categorical representation of space that was delay-dependent. The responses avoided the circumference and the center of the circle, defining a categorical radial prototype around one third of the total radial length. This radial category was observed only at delay durations of 3-5 s. Finally, the monkey also formed angular categories with prototypes at the obliques of the quadrants of the circle, avoiding the horizontal and vertical axes. However, these prototypes were only observed at the 5-s delay and on dots lying on the circumference. These results indicate that monkeys may possess spatial cognitive abilities similar to humans.",

    "abstract": "The neural activity in area 7a and the arm area of motor cortex was recorded while real or path-guided apparent motion stimuli were presented to behaving monkeys in the absence of a motor response. A smooth stimulus motion was produced in the real motion condition, whereas in the apparent motion condition five stimuli were flashed successively at the vertices of a regular pentagon. The stimuli moved along a low contrast circular path with one of five speeds (180-540 deg/s). We found strong neural responses to real and apparent motion in area 7a and motor cortex. In the motor cortex, a substantial population of neurons showed a selective response to real moving stimuli in the absence of a motor response. This activity was modulated in some cases by the stimulus speed, and some of the neurons showed a response during a particular part of the circular trajectory of the stimulus; the preferred stimulus angular locations were evenly distributed across this neuronal ensemble. It is likely that these neural signals are continuously available to the motor cortex in order to generate responses that demand immediate action. In area 7a, two overlapping populations of neurons were observed. The first comprised cells the activity of which was tuned to the angular location of a circularly moving stimulus in the real motion condition. These cells also responded to apparent motion at high stimulus speeds. A visual receptive field analysis showed that the angular tuning in most of the area 7a neurons did not depend on the spatial location of the stimulus in relation to their receptive field. The second population was selective to apparent moving stimuli and showed a periodic entrainment of activation with the period of the inter-stimulus interval of the flashing dots. Both the angular location and the inter-stimulus interval neural signals can be used to generate precise behavioral responses towards real or apparent moving stimuli.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed the dissimilarity matrix of neuronal responses to moving visual stimuli using tree clustering and multidimensional scaling (MDS). Single-cell activity was recorded in area 7a while random dots moving coherently in eight different kinds of motion (right-, left-, up-, and downward, clockwise, counterclockwise, expansion, contraction) were presented to behaving monkeys with eyes fixated. Tree clustering analyses showed that the [rightward, leftward], [upward, downward], and [clockwise, counterclockwise]] motions were clustered in three separate branches (i.e., horizontal, vertical, and rotatory motion, respectively). In contrast, expansion was in a lone branch, whereas contraction was also separate but within a larger cluster. The distances among these clusters were then subjected to an MDS analysis to identify the dimensions underlying the tree clustering observed. This analysis revealed two major factors in operation. The first factor separated expansion from all other stimulus motions, which seems to reflect the prominence of expansion during the common activity of locomotion. In contrast, the second factor separated planar motions from motion in depth, which suggests that the latter may hold a special place in visual motion processing.",

    "abstract": "Human subjects and monkeys intercepted real (RM) and apparent (AM) moving targets that traveled through a low contrast circular path. The subjects intercepted the targets at 6 o'clock by applying a net force pulse on a semi-isometric joystick which controlled a cursor on the screen. Eight target speeds (180-560 degrees/s) were used. The starting points of the moving target were systematically placed around the circle in order to determine the effect of the target travel time and velocity on the decision to initiate the interception movement and on the interception accuracy. It was found that the probability of interception in the first revolution varied as a function of the target travel time, which followed an S-shaped psychometric curve. The minimum processing time (MPT) was defined as the target travel that corresponded to a 75% probability of interception in the first revolution on the psychometric curve. The MPT decreased slightly as a function of target speed and was larger in AM than RM. In addition, the interception accuracy increased when the target travel time was above the MPT, and the angular error was smaller in RM than in AM. Finally, the interception movement was initiated at different target locations and time-to-contacts, depending on the target speed and the motion condition. Interestingly, similar findings were observed in human subjects and monkeys. These results suggest that the neural mechanisms engaged in extracting the visual motion information and in the implementation of the response are more efficient during RM than AM, and that such mechanisms need less processing time when the target is moving faster.",

    "abstract": "The most important point in embryo transfer success is the evaluation of the stage of development and quality of embryos. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the morphological evaluation of embryos using stereoscopy, light microscopy and electron microscopy in order to establish the accuracy of former method compared with more invasive and accurate procedures. For this purpose, 23 Brahman x Swiss cows were used and synchronized with Norgestomet 6 mg plus, 5 mg Estradiol valerate (Syncromate B(R), Rhone Merieux, Mexico, Mexico City) and superovulated with Folltropin-V 240 mg (Vetrepharm, Mexico, Mexico City). Non-surgical embryo collection was performed 7.5 days after insemination. Descriptive statistics analysis was used to assess the data. Seventy-eight embryos were collected and classified by stereoscopic microscopy, finding 51.2% (40) of good quality, 25.6% (20) fair and 24.3% (19) poor. Later, under light microscopy observation, evaluation of the same embryos resulted in 25.6% (20) good, 32.0% (25) fair and 42.3% poor quality. Finally, in the evaluation of embryos under electron microscopy 24.3% (19) were found to be of good quality, 29.3% (23) fair and 46.1% (36) poor. Evaluation of embryos with stereoscopic microscopy was found to be very subjective, as nearly 50% of embryos classified by this method as good quality, showed features of degenerative stages under light and electron microscopy. Embryos with these features are generally frozen and transferred, which could be one of the reasons for having low fertility rate in embryo transfer programmes.",

    "abstract": "Gonadotropins are synthesized and released in different molecular forms. In this article, we present evidence that the glycosylation variants of human pituitary FSH exhibit differential and divergent effects at the target cell level and that less sialylated, short-lived variants may exert significant effects in in vivo conditions. Less acidic/sialylated glycoforms (elution pH value 6.60-4.60 as disclosed by high resolution chromatofocusing of anterior glycoprotein extracts), induced higher cAMP release, estrogen production and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) enzyme activity as well as cytochrome P450 aromatase and tPA mRNA expression in cultured rat granulosa cells than the more acidic analogs (pH<4.76). By contrast, the more acidic/sialylated glycoforms induced higher alpha-inhibin subunit mRNA expression than their less acidic counterparts. In cumulus enclosed oocytes isolated from mice ovaries, addition of less acidic isoforms induced resumption of meiosis more efficiently than the more acidic analogs. Interestingly, the least acidic isoform (pH>7.10) behave as a strong antagonist of several FSH-mediated effects. Assessment of the in vivo effects of the isoforms on granulosa cell proliferation in follicles from immature rats, revealed that short-lived isoforms were equally or even more efficient than their more acidic counterparts in maintaining granulosa cell proliferation when administered immediately after hypophysectomy. These results show that the naturally occurring human FSH isoforms may exhibit differential or even unique effects at the target cell level and that factors other than the metabolic clearance rate of the molecule (including receptor-binding affinity and capability of the ligand to activate its receptor and trigger intracellular signaling) also play an important role in determining the net in vivo effects of a particular FSH variant.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to analyze the possible alterations produced by inadequate perinatal food intake, in quantity (undernutrition) or quality (malnutrition), on the generation and propagation of the compound action potential (CAP) evoked in sensory sural nerves, during the postnatal development of the rat. Low intensity stimulation (2-3 times the threshold of the most excitable nerve fibers; xT) of the sural nerve evoked an early potential (CAP-A component) which is due to activation of low-threshold, fast-conducting myelinated group A afferent fibers. Meanwhile, at higher stimulus intensity (20-30T) it produced a second, long-lasting potential (CAP-C component) probably due to activation of high-threshold, slow-conducting group Adelta or C afferent fibers. Compared to control nerves, the CAP-A component, but not the CAP-C component of undernourished and malnourished nerves showed significant changes in amplitude, area, electrical threshold and conduction velocity (except absolute refractory period) at several postnatal ages. Our results may suggest that a relative large number of myelinated group A afferent fibers in the sural nerve of undernourished and malnourished animals suffer severe alterations on their electrophysiological properties of generation and propagation of the action potential during the postnatal development of the rat.",

    "abstract": "Moving visual stimuli were presented to behaving monkeys who fixated their eyes and did not move their arm. The stimuli consisted of random dots moving coherently in eight different kinds of motion (right, left, up, downward, expansion, contraction, clockwise, and counterclockwise) and were presented in 25 square patches on a liquid crystal display projection screen. Neuronal activity in the arm area of the motor cortex and area 7a was significantly influenced by the visual stimulation, as assessed using an ANOVA. The percentage of cells with a statistically significant effect of visual stimulation was 3 times greater in area 7a (370/587, 63%) than in motor cortex (148/693, 21.4%). With respect to stimulus properties, its location and kind of motion had differential effects on cell activity in the two areas. Specifically, the percentage of cells with a significant stimulus location effect was approximately 2.5 times higher in area 7a (311/370, 84%) than in motor cortex (48/148, 32.4%), whereas the percentage of cells with a significant stimulus motion effect was approximately 2 times higher in the motor cortex (79/148, 53.4%) than in area 7a (102/370, 27.6%). We also assessed the selectivity of responses to particular stimulus motions using a Poisson train analysis and determined the percentage of cells that showed activation in only one stimulus condition. This percentage was 2 times higher in the motor cortex (73.7%) than in area 7a (37.7%). Of all kinds of stimulus motion tested, responses to expanding optic flow were the strongest in both cortical areas. Finally, we compared the activation of motor cortical cells during visual stimulation to that observed during force exertion in a center --> out task. Of 514 cells analyzed for both the motor and visual tasks, 388 (75.5%) showed a significant relation to either or both tasks, as follows: 284/388 (73.2%) cells showed a significant relation only to the motor task, 27/388 (7%) cells showed a significant relation only to the visual task, whereas the remaining 77/388 (19.8%) cells showed significant relations to both tasks. Therefore a total of 361/514 (70.2%) cells were related to the motor task and 104/514 (20.2%) were related to the visual task. Finally, with respect to receptive fields (RFs), there was no clear visual receptive field structure in the motor cortical neuronal responses, in contrast to area 7a where RFs were present and could be modulated by the type of optic flow stimulus.",

    "abstract": "Physiological cell death (PCD) in Sf9 insect cell batch cultures was comprehensively characterized using simultaneous determinations of qualitative and quantitative assays, including agarose gel electrophoresis, confocal, epifluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy, and DNA content by flow cytometry. Results were compared to hybridoma cultures where abundant information of apoptosis exists. Both cultures shared some typical apoptosis features, including cell shrinkage, loss of sphericity, swollen endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, chromatin condensation, and specific DNA degradation. However, distinctive morphological and kinetic differences between both cultures revealed that Sf9 cells died by an atypical PCD process characterized by absence of nuclear fragmentation, scarce association of condensed chromatin to the nuclear envelope, swollen mitochondria, and high nonspecific DNA degradation. These features, distinctive of necrosis, were not observed in the normal apoptotic process of hybridomas. Glucose depletion marked the appearance of apoptotic Sf9 cells, which there up on increased gradually, whereas apoptotic hybridomas rapidly increased upon glutamine depletion. Furthermore, active phagocytosis was found in Sf9 viable cells, a characteristic phenomenon during in vivo apoptosis but uncommon for in vitro cultures. Sf9 cells contained unusually high numbers of phagosomes, particularly after glucose depletion. Additionally, few apoptotic bodies accumulated in culture, suggesting their elimination by phagocytosis. Other distinctive characteristics of Sf9 cells were the presence of a polynucleated hypertrophic population fraction, polyploidy, cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, and more necrosis compared to hybridomas. Such phenomena prevented a reliable quantification of apoptosis from determination of the sub-G1 peak. Nonetheless, emergence of a bimodal Sf9 cell size distribution coincided with the increase in the sub-G1 population and onset of death. The fraction of particles in the smaller peak (6-11 microm diameter) closely correlated with the fractions of apoptotic bodies, late apoptotic, and secondary necrotic cells. Accordingly, Sf9 cell size was shown to be an effective, rapid, and simple parameter for quantifying death. Altogether, the results of this study provide new insights into PCD and other phenomena in insect cell culture important for biotechnological applications of Sf9 cells.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus infection is associated with cervical cancer. The E6 and E7 papillomavirus proteins are normally required for the maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Expression of these proteins in infected cells is negatively regulated by the binding of the papilloma E2 protein to the long terminal control region of the papilloma virus genome. The E2 protein can also promote cell arrest and apoptosis in HeLa cells. Therefore, it is clear that this protein has the potential of inhibiting the malignant phenotype. Because, anticancer vaccines based in vaccinia viruses have recently been shown to be an effective way to treat and to eradicate tumors, a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the E2 gene of bovine papilloma virus (Modified Vaccinia Ankara, MVA E2) was created, to explore further the antitumor potential of the E2 protein. A series of rabbits, containing the VX2 transplantable papilloma carcinoma, were treated with MVA E2. An impressive tumor regression, up to a complete disappearance of tumor, was observed in most animals (80%). In contrast, very little or no regression was detected if the normal vaccinia virus was used. Lymphocytes isolated from MVA E2-treated rabbits did not show cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. However, in these animals a humoral immune response against tumor cells was observed. These antitumor antibodies were capable of activating macrophages to destroy tumor cells efficiently. These data indicate that injecting the MVA E2 recombinant vaccinia virus directly into the tumor results in a robust and long-lasting tumor regression. Data also suggest that antitumor antibodies are responsible, at least in part, for eliminating tumors by activating macrophage antibody-dependent cytotoxicity.",

Therefore, a new, highly attenuated vaccinia virus known as modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which carries the papillomavirus E2 gene, was used for the treatment of tumors associated with human papillomavirus.\nAnalysis of expression of the E2 gene from the recombinant vaccinia virus was performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of RNA isolated from infected cells. Detection of the E2 protein was done by immunoprecipitation from proteins labeled with [(35)S]-methionine, isolated from infected cells. The therapeutic effect of the MVA E2 recombinant virus over human tumors was tested in nude mice bearing tumors generated by inoculation of HeLa cells. Series of 10 nude mice with tumors of different sizes were injected with MVA, MVA E2, or phosphate-buffered saline. Tumor size was monitored every week to assess growth.\nThe MVA E2 recombinant virus efficiently expressed the E2 protein in BS-C-1 cells. This protein was able to repress, in vivo, the papillomavirus P105 promoter, which controls the expression of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins. In nude mice the MVA E2 virus reduced tumor growth very efficiently. In contrast, tumors continued to grow in mice treated with MVA or PBS. The life expectancy of MVA E2-treated mice was also increased three- to fourfold compared with that of animals that received MVA or PBS.\nThe growth of human tumors was efficiently inhibited by the MVA E2 recombinant vaccinia virus. The absence of side effects in treated animals suggested that the MVA E2 virus is a safe biologic agent that could in the future be used in humans for the treatment of cervical carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "We lesioned the right primary somatic sensory (S1) cortex in two monkeys trained to categorize the speed of moving tactile stimuli. Animals performed the task by pressing with the right hand one of two target switches to indicate whether the speed of a probe moving across the glabrous skin of the left hand was low or high. Sensory performance was evaluated with psychometric techniques and motor behavior was monitored by measuring the reaction (RT) and movement (MT) times before the experiment and throughout the 60 days after the ablation of SI cortex. After the lesion, there was a slight increase in the RTs but no change in the MTs, indicating that removal of SI cortex did not affect the animals' capacity to detect the stimuli. However, monkeys lost their ability to categorize the stimulus speeds. This effect was observed from the 1st day after the lesion until the end of the study. We conclude that somatosensory areas outside SI can by themselves process tactile information in a limited way and that the extraction of higher-order features that takes place during the categorization task requires the intervention of SI cortex.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we describe a type of neuron of the medial premotor cortex (MPC) that discharged differentially during a categorization task and reflected in their activity whether the speed of a tactile stimulus was low or high. The activity of these neurons was recorded in the MPC contralateral (right MPC, n = 88) and ipsilateral (left MPC, n = 103) to the stimulated hand of four monkeys performing this somesthetic task. Animals performed the task by pressing with the right hand one of two target switches to indicate whether the speed of probe movement across the skin of the left hand was low or high. Differential responses of MPC neurons occurred during the stimulus and reaction time period. We used an analysis based on signal detection theory to determine whether these differential responses were associated with the animal's decision. According to this analysis, 104 of the 191 neurons (right MPC, n = 48; left MPC, n = 56) coded the categorization of the stimulus speeds (categorical neurons). In a light instruction task, we tested the possibility that the categorical neurons (n = 71) were associated with the intention to press, or with the trajectory of the hand to one of the two target switches used to indicate categorization. In this situation, each trial began as in the somesthetic categorization task, but one of the two target switches was illuminated beginning with the skin indentation, continued during the delay period and turned off when the probe was lifted off from the skin. This condition instructed the animal which target switch was required to be pressed for reward. Very few neurons (14 of 71) maintained their differential responses observed in the categorization task. Some categorical neurons (n = 5) were also studied; the animal categorized the tactile stimulus speeds, but knew in advance whether the stimulus speed was low or high (categorization + light instruction). This was made by illuminating one of the two target switches which was associated with the stimulus speed. The categorical response was considerably attenuated in this condition. Interestingly, during the delay period, these neurons reflected in their activity whether the stimulus was low or high. A number of the categorical MPC neurons (n = 30) were studied when the same set of stimuli, used in the categorization, were delivered passively. None of these neurons responded in this condition. These results suggest that the MPC, apart from its well-known role in motor behavior, is also involved in the animal's decision during the execution of this learned somesthetic task.",

No false-positive or false-negative cases were encountered. Ascariasis of the biliary tract was seen on ultrasound as echogenic, non-shadowing images, either as single or multiple strips, with visualization of the digestive tract of the worm as an anechoic inner tube, or as amorphous fragments. Follow-up sonograms helped in detection of worm expulsion following medical therapy in five patients, while endoscopic extraction of the worm was performed in four patients. In three patients, disappearance of the worm from the biliary tract was noted following a therapeutic sphincterotomy, and two patients detected to have a worm within the gall-bladder were operated on. In all patients, serial sonograms revealed disappearance of the worm, and the regression of biliary tract dilatation.",

    "abstract": "We used psychometric techniques and neurophysiological recordings to study the role of the putamen in somesthetic perception. Four monkeys were trained to categorize the speed of moving tactile stimuli. Animals performed a task in which one of two target switches had to be pressed with the right hand to indicate whether the speed of probe movement across the glabrous skin of the left, restrained hand was low or high. During the task we recorded the activity of neurons in the putamen contralateral (right) and ipsilateral (left) to the stimulated hand. We found different types of neuronal responses, all present in the right and left putamen. Some neurons responded during the stimulus period, others responded during the hand-arm movement used to indicate categorization, and others responded during both of these periods. The responses of many neurons did not vary either with the speed of the stimuli or in relation to the categorization process. In contrast, neurons of a particular type responded differentially: their activity reflected whether stimulus speed was low or high. These differential responses occurred during the stimulus and hand-arm motion periods. A number of the nondifferential and differential neurons were studied when the same stimuli used in the categorization task were delivered passively. Few neurons with nondifferential discharges, and none of the differential neurons, responded in this condition. In a visually cued control task we studied the possibility that the differential responses were associated with the intention to press or with the trajectory of the hand to one of the target switches. In this condition, a light turned on instructed the animal which target switch to press for a reward. Very few neurons in both hemispheres maintained the differential responses observed during the categorization task. Those neurons that discharged selectively for low or high speeds were analyzed quantitatively to produce a measure comparable with the psychometric function. The thresholds of the resulting neurometric curves for the neuronal populations were very similar to the psychometric thresholds. The activity of a large fraction of these neurons could be used to accurately predict whether the stimulus speed was low or high. The results indicate that the putamen, both contralateral and ipsilateral to the stimulated hand, contains neurons that discharge in response to the somesthetic stimuli during the categorization task. Those neurons that respond irrespective of the stimulus speed appear to be involved in the general sensorimotor behavior of the animal during the execution of the task. The results suggest that the putamen may play a role in bimanual tasks. The recording of neurons in the right and left putamen whose activities correlate with the speed categories suggests that this region of the basal ganglia, in addition to its role in motor functions, is also involved in the animal's decision process.",

    "abstract": "We used psychometric techniques to study the sensorimotor performance of four monkeys trained to classify the speed of moving tactile stimuli. Animals performed the task by pressing one of two target switches to indicate whether the speed of probe movement across the glabrous skin of the hand was low or high. Psychometric curves indicated that animals classified the stimulus speeds irrespective of which finger was stimulated, traverse distance and direction. The mean values of the reaction (RT) and movement (MT) times during the correct categorization of low and high stimulus speeds were similar. However, a slight increase was detected in the mean values of the RT during the incorrect categorization but not in the MT. During the task, activity of single neurones (n = 45) was recorded in primary somatic sensory (SI) cortex. The results indicate that a class of neurones (n = 12) of SI cortex increased their impulse rates as a function of the stimulus speeds. However, the magnitude of their responses was similar during the correct and incorrect categorizations of stimuli. The same neurones also responded when the same set of stimuli used in the categorization task were delivered passively. Neurones of SI cortex responded with a latency of 25.8 +/- 0.6 ms (+/- s.e.m.) relative to the beginning of the moving tactile stimuli during the categorization task. The same neurones (n = 17) also responded with a similar latency (24.6 +/- 4.0 ms) when the stimuli were delivered passively. These results may suggest that, although this evoked neuronal activity may be important for the perception of the moving tactile stimuli, more central structures associated with SI cortex may determine the performance of this learned somaesthetic task.",

    "abstract": "We have studied neuronal activity in the putamen of two monkeys trained to discriminate the speed of moving tactile stimuli. Animals pressed one of two target switches to indicate whether the speed of the probe across the skin was low or high. The activity of single neurones was recorded in the putamen ipsilateral to the glabrous skin of the stimulated hand and contralateral to the responding arm. During the task, we recorded neurones in the putamen that showed responses confined exclusively to the stimulus period of all speeds. A second class of putamen neurones responded during the stimulus period but continued discharging during the reaction and movement time period. None of these two classes of putamen neurones discharged when the same set of stimuli were delivered passively. A third class of putamen neurones responded differentially in the discrimination task and predicted whether the speed of the stimulus was low or high. A number of these neurones, which responded differentially during the categorization task, were tested in a light instruction task. This tested the possibility that these differential responses were associated with the intention to move the arm to one of the two target switches. Few neurones responded in this situation. These results indicate that the putamen, in addition to its role in motor regulation, is also involved in higher order aspects of sensory-motor behaviour and in the sensory decision process in this learned somaesthetic task.",

    "abstract": "The reproductive hormonal profile was evaluated in female rats with experimental nephrotic syndrome induced with a single subcutaneous dose of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN). Serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone (P4), testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) were determined sequentially in control and experimental groups on days 1, 3, 7 and 10 after PAN administration. Prolactin levels were also assessed on day 10. In both groups, vaginal smears were taken daily throughout the study to evaluate cyclic histological changes. At the end of the experiment the histological appearance of the ovaries was evaluated by light microscopy. Nephrotic rats had a rapid loss of the estrous cycle starting on day 4, which set them at diestrus. At the same time the hormonal evaluation indicated a gradual decrease in E2, LH and P4 concentrations, starting from days 3, 7 and 10, respectively. No significant changes were noted in FSH or testosterone values. Besides, on day 10, prolactin concentrations remained unmodified. Even though most hormonal levels were found low on day 10, all values except E2 (undetectable) corresponded to the interval reported for the diestrus phase. Likewise, histological examination of ovarian tissue from nephrotic rats showed a considerable increase in the number of atretic follicles. These findings indicate that female rats with nephrotic syndrome develop an important endocrine dysfunction that probably involves steroidogenic tissues (ovary and/or adrenal gland), and suggest the existence of a hypothalamic-hypophyseal impairment.",

    "abstract": "1. We have studied the neuronal activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA) of two monkeys who categorized the speed of moving tactile stimuli delivered to the glabrous skin of the hand ipsilateral to the site of cortical recording and contralateral to the responding arm. 2. A large number of SMA neurons responded to the stimuli of all speeds (176 of 522) but only when those stimuli controlled behavior. 3. A second class of SMA neurons responded differentially in the categorization task (35 during the stimuli and 51 during the reaction time period) and predicted its outcome. 4. To dissociate the interrupt target switches presses from the tactile categorization responses, sixteen neurons, which responded to the stimuli in all speeds, and 11 neurons, which discharged differentially, were tested in a visual control task. None of these two classes of neurons responded in this situation. 5. It is concluded that the SMA ipsilateral to sensory input and contralateral to the responding arm is involved in the sensory decision process in this somesthetic categorization task.",

    "abstract": "Aqueous crude extracts of some Crassulaceae have been applied as vaginal contraceptives by the population. This investigation was conducted to evaluate the in vitro effects of Sedum oxipetalum ethanolic extracts and related filtration substances on the motility, viability, and ultrastructural parameters of human/murine spermatozoa. The extracts were obtained with ethanol (80%) from stembark and the medulla of the plant, yielding 6.5% and 5.2%, respectively. By chromatography on Sephadex G-15 volume, 3 main filtration products were separated. The filtration profile was established as carbohydrate fractions. In only 1 of the filtration products (peak 1) was activity detected. Aliquotes equivalent to 230 +or- 4.2 and 213 +or- 2.06 mcg of carbohydrates from both stembark and medulla, respectively, produced 100% immobilization-agglutination, which affected 2 x 107 human/murine spermatozoa. The same effects were produced with 25.5 +or- 1.29 mcg of stembark or 6.27 +or- 0.22 mcg of medulla obtained by filtration of product 1 (peak 1). The sperm viability after 5 hours postcontact with the extracts was 85% and for the control 80%. Extracts from the plant produced important destabilization of sperm membranes and loss of acrosomal matrix in both human/murine spermatozoa. Sedum oxipetalum contained at least 1 active, easily separable product that could block the fertilizing capacity of human spermatozoa.",

    "abstract": "The effect of specific glycosaminoglycan-hydrolyzing enzymes on the ruthenium red staining of pig spermatozoa was studied. Washed spermatozoa were incubated at 35 degrees C in buffer or with neuraminidase 0.5 units/ml, heparinase 0.2 mg/ml, or chondroitinase ABC 2.0 units/ml. After incubation sperm cells were washed, stained with ruthenium red and studied under the electron microscope. Anionic sites in the surface of untreated spermatozoa follow regularly the plasma membrane, but present are numerous processes constituting what has been defined as the glycocalyx. Neuraminidase did not affect the distribution of ruthenium red on the surface of the spermatozoa, but eliminated almost completely the processes of the glycocalyx. Heparinase caused loss of the ruthenium red-stained sites on the membrane surface of pig spermatozoa with less influence on the dense processes of the glycocalyx. A similar loss of ruthenium red-stained sites was observed with nitrous acid treatment. A striking effect of treatment with chondroitinase ABC was the production of a typical acrosome reaction.",

This increase was significantly reduced when the time of hydrolysis was either shorter (10 min) or longer (60 min). Partial hydrolysis of spermatozoa GAGs by direct incubation of sperm cells with chondroitinase ABC was also capable of inducing the acrosome reaction.",

    "abstract": "Magnesium, calcium, and zinc at the concentration of 10 microM are capable of inducing a \"true\" acrosome reaction in the pig spermatozoa judged by the criteria of the fusion of the acrosome and the plasmatic membrane at the anterior region or the sperm nucleus. The optimal percent of acrosome reaction reached by any of the ions tested as a whole was 50%. When glycosamineglycan sulfate (GAGs) plus 10 microM of Mg++, Ca++, or Zn++ was added, they reach to 70-80% of acrosome reaction. At the electrom microscope, thin sections taken from pig spermatozoa treated with ions, GAGs, or ion + GAGs under optimal experimental conditions revealed the same pattern of acrosomal reaction. Results suggest the important role that divalent cations play in general in the induction of the acrosome reaction and question the so-called essential role of calcium ions.",

Sperm penetration was observed 2, 4, and 8 h after insemination. Sperm penetration was successful in 40%, 60%, and 69% of the oocytes treated for 10 min with heparin. Feminine and masculine pronuclei were clearly identifiable. In these samples, 80% of the sperm was alive and there was approximately 68% progress motility. Live sperm were observed for up to 24 h. Since glycosamineglycan sulfates are normally present in the ooplasm, zona pellucida, follicular and uterine fluids, this might suggest a direct participation of heparin in human sperm capacitation.",

Spermatozoa depleted of zinc were assayed for (3H-methyl), thymidine incorporation was observed (27,500 +/- 1,248 dpm of 3H methyl-thymidine). Sperm cells incubated in the presence of 10 mg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor shows no effect in sperm nuclear swelling or in the release of DNA template restrictions. This process runs in a parallel fashion to the nuclear swelling induced by heparin, suggesting that swollen nuclei might be the source of DNA template. This was confirmed by autoradiographic studies, since all the sperm cells whose nuclei were judged swollen by morphological criteria also appeared labeled. The fact that there was no need for ATP generating system or of exogenous DNA polymerase emphasized the control role that zinc plays in the physiology of the human spermatozoa.",

    "abstract": "Follicular fluid from different mammalian species possesses two factors responsible for the induction of capacitation: a sperm-stimulating factor and an acrosomal reaction-inducing factor. The glycosamineglycan-sulfate (GAGs) extracted from pig follicular fluid induce acrosome reaction in pig spermatozoa which exhibit no morphological difference between the GAGs-induced reaction and the natural one. Acrosomal reaction commenced 30 min after the addition of GAGs and depended on GAGs concentration reaching 80% of acrosomal reacted spermatozoa after 6 hr of incubation with 7 mg of GAGs/ml. Chemical composition differs with the chemical data that characterize them as proteoglycans since those we obtained were practically protein free (2%). Another difference resides in the uronic acid content, which is almost twofold higher (59%). Electron microscope observations of the acrosomal reacted spermatozoa revealed that the addition of 10 mg/ml of trypsin soybean inhibitor did not interfere with any of the acrosomal reaction steps. The active capacitating factors may also originate from the follicular fluid released into the genital tract during ovulation.",

This process occurred in the absence of any disulfide bond cleaving reactant. Swelling of caput epididymal spermatozoa nuclei commenced about 30 min after the addition of heparin, reaching 88% in rat, 33% in rabbit, 26% in pig, and 62% in bull of swelled nuclei after 6 hr of incubation at 37 degrees C with 5000 USP of heparin per ml. Corpus epididymal spermatozoa nuclei of rat and rabbit underwent decondensation at 50 degrees C reaching 24% and 22% of swelled nuclei, respectively, after 6 hr of incubation. The nuclei of the sperm cells of pig and bull from this epididymal region remained highly condensed as well as the nuclei of the cauda epididymal spermatozoa of all the species assayed. Electron microscope observations of the caput epididymal spermatozoa nuclei treated with heparin revealed that the chromatin is organized into nuclear bodies joined by a network of cross-linked and branched chromatin fibers in the species studied.",

    "abstract": "The existence in the human spermatozoa membrane of receptorlike functional group for heparin was studied. Incubation of whole spermatozoa with tritiated heparin induced the specific binding of 745 +/- 112 pmol of heparin per 5 x 10(7) sperm cells with an intrinsic association constant KD = 3.6 x 10(-6) M. The specificity of binding was shown by the lack of competence in the binding process of some other glycosaminoglycans used at concentrations 20 x higher than heparin. However, dextran sulfate was a very efficient competitive agent. Autoradiography experiments showed that labeling was almost completely restricted to sperm cells in the process of nuclear decondensation. This technique showed the presence of a high amount of radioactive heparin in the isolated sperm membranes even after several washings. Heparin may participate both in the final part of the capacitation process (acrosome reaction) and in the decondensation of sperm nuclei.",

Whole spermatozoa bound 6.8 +/- 0.8 pmol of cyclic-AMP per 10(7) cells. Binding of cyclic-AMP was selectively located in the midpiece-tail region of the spermatozoa. Thus only 18% of the binding in the whole sperm could be accounted for by the binding on the sperm heads. This distribution is similar to that previously described for the protein kinase of bovine sperm. Blocking membrane sulfhydryl groups with pCMBS induced a drastic inhibition (65%) of the cyclic-AMP binding to the sperm heads, while only moderately reducing (30%) the binding in the sperm tails",

    "abstract": "Use of zinc sulfate in promotion of wound healing and in maintenance of epithelial integrity suggested its possible use in the treatment or prevention of recurrent oral ulcers. In a series of 32 patients with recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU), serum zinc levels were observed. Seventeen patients, eight with initial serum zinc levels above 110microng/dl and nine with serum zinc levels below 110microng/dl, were provided zinc sulfate supplementation up to a total of 660 mg/day. All patients with initial serum zinc levels less than or equal to 110 microng/dl showed improvement; three of the eight patients with initial serum zinc levels above 110 microng/dl improved, five did not. Improvement consisted of 50% to 100% reduction in frequency of episodes. This suggests a combination of causes of RAU, one of which may be a local or general deficiency of zinc or a defect in metabolism, perhaps at the cellular level, related to zinc.",

    "abstract": "A study of patients in whom soft-palate pigmentation appeared to be associated with pulmonary disease has been reported. A significant number of these patients had diagnosed or suspected bronchogenic carcinoma. The possibility that this oral finding may be predictive of the presence of lung cancer, or of a high degree of probability of future development of lung cancer, indicates a need for additional investigation. At this point the evidence strongly suggests that when soft-palate pigmentation is seen in a patient with lung disease, cancer should be suspected until it is definitely ruled out. The paucity of patients in whom this sign is seen suggests the need for study by other investigators. ACTH levels should be evaluated, as should plasma zinc values, which have been demonstrated to decrease in lung cancer as well as other diseases. Following the patients prospectively certainly is indicated. In conjunction with the Department of Laboratory Medicine, limited initial additional investigations have been made of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels on three of the outpatients reported. These assays used the hemagglutination-inhibition technique and are limited to investigational use by the Food and Drug Administration. In this laboratory the normal CEA level is 5.2 +/- 1.6 ng./ml. Results in two patients with known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were 5.5 and 5.6 ng./ml. The third patient with soft-palate pigmentation and an undiagnosed pulmonary problem had a CEA level of 10.2 ng./ml. She also had clubbing of the fingers. The senior author would be particularly interested in establishing a registry of similar cases observed by others.",

    "abstract": "Infrared spectra in the amide I and amide II regions of acrosomal membranes isolated from ejaculated human spermatozoa indicate the presence of a high proportion of the constitutive proteins in the most stable protein configuration, the antiparallel beta-conformation. Since the infrared spectra obtained with the membranes suspended in D2O or after extraction of the lipid components do not show any significant change, it can be postulated that the antiparallel pleated sheet conformation of human spermatozoal membrane proteins is independent of the hydrated state and of the lipid constitution of the membrane.",
