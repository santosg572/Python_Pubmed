    "abstract": "Developing a digital twin (DT) involves establishing (1) a predictive capability (a model) relevant to the application, (2) means to collect data from the physical counterpart, and (3) means to apply the collected data to the model. Ideally, with these three goals achieved, long periods of steady-state use of the DT might be interrupted only by failure of the sensors used to collect data from the physical counterpart. In reality, however, it can be difficult to confirm that the DT system occupies this comfortable steady-state position. Assessing uncertainty in the predictive model, and ensuring the relevance of data collected from the physical counterpart are design-time activities with unclear termination points. Distinguishing sensed change in the physical counterpart from sensor failure is a persistent challenge. In this short paper we describe early work towards a human-centered framework to establish, refine, and update digital twins. Condition-based maintenance and gear backlash in production equipment are used as examples.",

    "abstract": "Migraine affects more than 1 billion people globally, with distinct genetic variations influencing susceptibility. Thereby, genetic variations play a key role in the probability of developing migraine. However, personalized genetic analysis-based treatment options in migraine treatments are limited. Notably, surgical deactivation of extracranial trigger has shown efficacy in the treatment of migraine patients with identifiable trigger points in specific anatomical locations in the head and neck region. We present the first case of monozygotic twin sisters, both experiencing occipital and temporal-triggered migraine headaches with identical history and characteristics and without response to conservative migraine treatments. After surgical intervention, targeting the greater and lesser occipital nerves as well as auriculotemporal nerves, both twin sisters exhibited an over 99% reduction in symptoms without postoperative complications. This case suggests a potential correlation between genetic background, irrespective of environmental factors, and the effectiveness of surgical deactivation of trigger points in migraine management.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal genital prolapse is a rare situation. This report presents a unique case involving a pair of premature female twins who both developed vaginal wall prolapse without any neurological deficits. Multiple factors such as selective intrauterine growth restriction, feeding intolerance, extrauterine growth retardation, and elevated intra-abdominal pressure after birth may have contributed to the development of this phenomenon. Notably, the severity of prolapse was more pronounced in the twin with lower birth weight and smaller for gestational age. After a five-month follow-up period, the twins' prolapsed vaginal wall fully retracted due to a combination of conservative treatment and enhanced nutritional support.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins are virtual models of physical artefacts that may or may not be synchronously connected, and that can be used to simulate their behavior. They are widely used in several domains such as manufacturing and automotive to enable achieving specific quality goals. In the health domain, so-called digital patient twins have been understood as virtual models of patients generated from population data and/or patient data, including, for example, real-time feedback from wearables. Along with the growing impact of data science technologies like artificial intelligence, novel health data ecosystems centered around digital patient twins could be developed. This paves the way for improved health monitoring and facilitation of personalized therapeutics based on management, analysis, and interpretation of medical data via digital patient twins. The utility and feasibility of digital patient twins in routine medical processes are still limited, despite practical endeavors to create digital twins of physiological functions, single organs, or holistic models. Moreover, reliable simulations for the prediction of individual drug responses are still missing. However, these simulations would be one important milestone for truly personalized therapeutics. Another prerequisite for this would be individualized pharmaceutical manufacturing with subsequent obstacles, such as low automation, scalability, and therefore high costs. Additionally, regulatory challenges must be met thus calling for more digitalization in this area. Therefore, this narrative mini-review provides a discussion on the potentials and limitations of digital patient twins, focusing on their potential bridging function for personalized therapeutics and an individualized pharmaceutical manufacturing while also looking at the regulatory impacts.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare phenomenon estimated to occur in a range between 1 in 49,000 births and 1 in 189,000 births. As a product of monochorionic-monoamniotic pregnancies, they are currently believed to result from late, incomplete fission of the bilaminar embryonic disk at 13-15 days gestation. Conjoined twins are typically classified by the point at which their bodies are joined, with 15 recognized types, five of which account for more than 70% of cases. Fusion of the thorax and upper abdomen (thoraco-omphalopagus) accounts for 28% of all cases. Mortality and morbidity rates remain high irrespective of the point of fusion, with 40-60% of cases being lost to miscarriage and stillbirth, and only about 18% of live births surviving more than 24 hours. Given this prognosis, knowledge of underlying anatomy and clinical imaging is paramount to antenatal diagnosis, assessment of viability, and subsequent management of conjoined twins. A case of thoraco-omphalopagus twins with a single heart and single liver discovered on routine ultrasound at 12 weeks gestation is described.",

    "abstract": "A conjoined twin is an uncommon congenital condition that has a very high morbidity and mortality prevalence. Identical twins united in utero are known as conjoined twins. It's an uncommon occurrence that poses a special difficulty for paediatric surgeons and obstetricians. Conjoined twins are a complicated by-product of monozygotic twinning, which raises the risk of death in the womb. One of the more prevalent varieties of conjoined twins is the thoraco-omphalopagus type, in which the heart is involved in an anterior, chest-based fusion. This case involves a 26-year-old woman who was diagnosed at 19 weeks with conjoined thoraco-omphalopagus twins using ultrasonography.",

The theoretical framework from complexity science takes into account both the short-term and the long-term dynamics of cities and their interactions.

    "abstract": "Whether differences in lifestyle between co-twins are reflected in differences in their internal or external exposome profiles remains largely underexplored. We therefore investigated whether within-pair differences in lifestyle were associated with within-pair differences in exposome profiles across four domains: the external exposome, proteome, metabolome and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA). For each domain, we assessed the similarity of co-twin profiles using Gaussian similarities in up to 257 young adult same-sex twin pairs (54% monozygotic). We additionally tested whether similarity in one domain translated into greater similarity in another. Results suggest that a lower degree of similarity in co-twins' exposome profiles was associated with greater differences in their behavior and substance use. The strongest association was identified between excessive drinking behavior and the external exposome. Overall, our study demonstrates how social behavior and especially substance use are connected to the internal and external exposomes, while controlling for familial confounders.",

    "abstract": "Human same-sex sexual attraction has been recorded from the beginning of written history. It remains a controversial topic, but recent theories favor prenatal influences. A paradox is the occurrence of same-sex orientation in twins in that there is a higher level of concordance in monozygous twins compared to that in dizygous twins or non-twin siblings. If sexual orientation was entirely genetically determined monozygous twins would be expected to have identical sexual inclinations. Monozygous twins have twice the incidence of sexual concordance in comparison to dizygous twins but a third of these pairs have different sexual identities.\u00a0An explanation for this disparity may lie in the time an embryo splits to form two separate fetuses. If splitting occurs early in twin development each twin may develop his or her own sexual identity; splitting occurring later results in twins that have the same sexual dispositions. A possible process for such determination may be in the mitochondria, with universal maternal inheritance of a proportion of normal functioning but alternate mitochondria. Variation in the distribution of these mitochondria in neural precursor cells becomes a mechanism for the development of intrinsic sexual orientation and for the spectrum of human sexual inclinations. The timing of embryonic splitting may be determined from the examination of fetal membranes, and the concept of early fetal sexual orientation is open to support or disproval.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the clinical outcome of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR).\nInternational Peace Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Shanghai ultrasound database was investigated to identify all MCDA delivered from January 2013 to December 2017. After identifying 43 pairs of MCDA twins with sIUGR and 282 pairs of normal MCDA twins, we compared clinical outcomes between the two groups.\nCompared with normal twins, sIUGR fetuses had significantly shorter gestational age at delivery, smaller average birth weight of both twins, more significant intertwin difference in birth weight, lower Apgar scores, and higher intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) rate, and smaller placental weight. The rate of abnormal umbilical cord insertions and abnormal blood flow in the ductus venosus (DV) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) is significantly higher in the sIUGR group. In addition, the subtype analysis of sIUGR groups indicated the poorest outcomes in type II with no significant difference between type I and III.\nMCDA twins with sIUGR generally exhibited limited clinical outcomes than normal MCDA twins. These limitations are mainly associated with abnormal umbilical cord insertions and blood flow in the DV and MCA. Clinical outcomes differed among the three types of sIUGR, with type II having the worst prognosis and the highest IUFD rate.\n\u00b7 sIUGR generally exhibited limited clinical outcomes than normal MCDA twins.. \u00b7 These limitations are mainly associated with blood flow of the DV and MCA.. \u00b7 sIUGR with type II has the worst prognosis and the highest IUFD rate..",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins (MZTs) possess identical genomic DNA sequences and are usually indistinguishable through routine forensic DNA typing methods, which can be relevant in criminal and paternity cases. Recently, novel epigenetic methods involving DNA methylation and microRNA analysis have been introduced to differentiate MZTs. In this study, we explore the potential of using epigenetic markers, specifically circular RNAs (circRNAs), a type of non-coding RNA (ncRNA), to identify MZTs, and investigate the unique expression patterns of circRNAs within pairs of MZTs, enabling effective differentiation. Epigenetics regulates gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and plays a crucial role in cell growth and aging. CircRNAs, a recently characterized subclass of ncRNA, have a distinct covalent loop structure without the typical 5' cap or 3' tail. They have been reported to modulate various cellular processes and play roles in embryogenesis and eukaryotic development. To achieve this, we conducted a comprehensive circRNA sequencing analysis (circRNA-seq) using total RNA extracted from the blood samples of five pairs of MZTs. We identified a total of 15,257 circRNAs in all MZTs using circRNA-seq. Among them, 3, 21, 338, and 2967 differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) were shared among five, four, three, and two pairs of MZTs, respectively. Subsequently, we validated twelve selected DEcircRNAs using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays, which included hsa_circ_0004724, hsa_circ_0054196, hsa_circ_004964, hsa_circ_0000591, hsa_circ_0005077, hsa_circ_0054853, hsa_circ_0054716, hsa_circ_0002302, hsa_circ_0004482, hsa_circ_0001103, novel_circ_0030288 and novel_circ_0056831. Among them, hsa_circ_0005077 and hsa_circ_0004482 exhibited the best performance, showing differences in 7 out of 10 pairs of MZTs. These twelve differentially expressed circRNAs also demonstrated strong discriminative power when tested on saliva samples from 10 pairs of MZTs. Notably, hsa_circ_0004724 displayed differential expression in 8 out of 10 pairs of MZTs in their saliva. Additionally, we evaluated the detection sensitivity, longitudinal temporal stability, and suitability for aged bloodstains of these twelve DEcircRNAs in forensic scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of circRNAs as molecular markers for distinguishing MZTs, emphasizing their suitability for forensic application.",

    "abstract": "Liver injury associated with the use of a number of different of herbal and dietary supplements\u00a0are increasingly recognized. It is though often unclear which of the sometimes multiple ingredients are responsible for the liver injury. Several case reports have been published on suspected liver injury due to Hydroxycut, which is a multi-ingredient supplement often used to induce weight loss. However, the hepatotoxic potential of Hydroxycut has though been disputed, and steatotic liver disease has also been implicated in patients who are found to have elevated liver enzymes while on Hydroxycut. We report clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice associated with the use of Hydroxycut in monozygotic twins with remarkably similar type of liver injury. Both had the genotype HLA-B 35:01 allele, a risk factor for green-tea extract induced liver injury, which is included in Hydroxycut.",

    "abstract": "Digital Twins offer vast potential, yet many companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, hesitate to implement them. This hesitation stems partly from the challenges posed by the interdisciplinary nature of creating Digital Twins. To address these challenges, this paper explores systematic approaches for the development and creation of Digital Twins, drawing on relevant methods and approaches presented in the literature. Conducting a systematic literature review, we delve into the development of Digital Twins while also considering analogous concepts, such as Cyber-Physical Systems and Product-Service Systems. The compiled literature is categorised into three main sections: holistic approaches, architecture, and models. Each category encompasses various subcategories, all of which are detailed in this paper. Through this comprehensive review, we discuss the findings and identify research gaps, shedding light on the current state of knowledge in the field of Digital Twin development. This paper aims to provide valuable insights for practitioners and researchers alike, guiding them in navigating the complexities associated with the implementation of Digital Twins.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought about significant transformations in multiple sectors, including healthcare and navigation systems, by offering essential functionalities crucial for their operations. Nevertheless, there is ongoing debate surrounding the unexplored possibilities of the IoT within the energy industry. The requirement to better the performance of distributed energy systems necessitates transitioning from traditional mission-critical electric smart grid systems to digital twin-based IoT frameworks. Energy storage systems (ESSs) used within nano-grids have the potential to enhance energy utilization, fortify resilience, and promote sustainable practices by effectively storing surplus energy. The present study introduces a conceptual framework consisting of two fundamental modules: (1) Power optimization of energy storage systems (ESSs) in peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. (2) Task orchestration in IoT-enabled environments using digital twin technology. The optimization of energy storage systems (ESSs) aims to effectively manage surplus ESS energy by employing particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques. This approach is designed to fulfill the energy needs of the ESS itself as well as meet the specific requirements of participating nano-grids. The primary objective of the IoT task orchestration system, which is based on the concept of digital twins, is to enhance the process of peer-to-peer nano-grid energy trading. This is achieved by integrating virtual control mechanisms through orchestration technology combining task generation, device virtualization, task mapping, task scheduling, and task allocation and deployment. The nano-grid energy trading system's architecture utilizes IoT sensors and Raspberry Pi-based edge technology to enable virtual operation. The evaluation of the proposed study is carried out through the examination of a simulated dataset derived from nano-grid dwellings. This research analyzes the efficacy of optimization approaches in mitigating energy trading costs and optimizing power utilization in energy storage systems (ESSs). The coordination of IoT devices is crucial in improving the system's overall efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare has always been a strategic domain in which innovative technologies can be applied to increase the effectiveness of services and patient care quality. Recent advancements have been made in the adoption of Digital Twins (DTs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) in this field. Despite this, their introduction has been hindered by the complex nature of the context itself which leads to many challenges both technical and organizational. In this article, we reviewed the literature about these technologies and their integrations, identifying the most critical requirements for clinical platforms. These latter have been used to design CONNECTED (COmpreheNsive and staNdardized hEalth-Care plaTforms to collEct and harmonize clinical Data), a conceptual framework aimed at defining guidelines to overcome the crucial issues related to the development of healthcare applications. It is structured in a multi-layer shape, in which heterogeneous data sources are first integrated, then standardized, and finally used to realize general-purpose DTs of patients backed by PKGs and accessible through dedicated APIs. These DTs will be the foundation on which smart applications can be built.",

    "abstract": "The influence of genetics and environment on the association of the plasma proteome with body mass index (BMI) and changes in BMI remains underexplored, and the links to other omics in these associations remain to be investigated. We characterized protein-BMI trajectory associations in adolescents and adults and how these connect to other omics layers.\nOur study included two cohorts of longitudinally followed twins: FinnTwin12 (N\u2009=\u2009651) and the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) (N\u2009=\u2009665). Follow-up comprised 4 BMI measurements over approximately 6 (NTR:\u00a023-27\u00a0years old) to 10\u00a0years (FinnTwin12:\u00a012-22\u00a0years old), with omics data collected at the last BMI measurement. BMI changes were calculated in latent growth curve models. Mixed-effects models were used to quantify the associations between the abundance of 439 plasma proteins with BMI at blood sampling and changes in BMI. In FinnTwin12, the sources of genetic and environmental variation underlying the protein abundances were quantified by twin models, as were the associations of proteins with BMI and BMI changes. In NTR, we investigated the association of gene expression of genes encoding proteins identified in FinnTwin12 with BMI and changes in BMI. We linked identified proteins and their coding genes to plasma metabolites and polygenic risk scores (PRS) applying mixed-effects models and correlation networks.\nWe identified 66 and 14 proteins associated with BMI at blood sampling and changes in BMI, respectively. The average heritability of these proteins was 35%. Of the 66 BMI-protein associations, 43 and 12 showed genetic and environmental correlations, respectively, including 8 proteins showing both. Similarly, we observed 7 and 3 genetic and environmental correlations between changes in BMI and protein abundance, respectively. S100A8 gene expression was associated with BMI at blood sampling, and the PRG4 and CFI genes were associated with BMI changes. Proteins showed strong connections with metabolites and PRSs, but we observed no multi-omics connections among gene expression and other omics layers.\nAssociations between the proteome and BMI trajectories are characterized by shared genetic, environmental, and metabolic etiologies. We observed few gene-protein pairs associated with BMI or changes in BMI at the proteome and transcriptome levels.",

    "results": "We identified 66 and 14 proteins associated with BMI at blood sampling and changes in BMI, respectively. The average heritability of these proteins was 35%. Of the 66 BMI-protein associations, 43 and 12 showed genetic and environmental correlations, respectively, including 8 proteins showing both. Similarly, we observed 7 and 3 genetic and environmental correlations between changes in BMI and protein abundance, respectively. S100A8 gene expression was associated with BMI at blood sampling, and the PRG4 and CFI genes were associated with BMI changes. Proteins showed strong connections with metabolites and PRSs, but we observed no multi-omics connections among gene expression and other omics layers.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have only focused on the risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in singleton vaginal deliveries and twin cesarean deliveries. We analyzed the factors of influencing PPH occurrence in twin vaginal deliveries and developed a nomogram for clinical application. This retrospective study included 274 pregnant women with twin pregnancies who were hospitalized for delivery from January 2014 to December 2018. The patients opted for vaginal delivery and experienced spontaneous labor. Univariate analysis of PPH risk factors was performed. Multivariate analysis was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to obtain relevant factors and build a prediction model, which was presented as a nomogram. The model was internally validated by bootstrap self-sampling method. Model accuracy was evaluated with the concordance index (C-index). There were 36 (13.14%) and 238 (86.9%) patients in the PPH and no PPH groups, respectively. Univariate analysis identified twin chorionicity, hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy (HDCP), anemia in pregnancy, delivery mode of the second twin, oxytocin use during labor, postpartum curettage, cervical laceration, intrapartum fever, fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and platelet count (PLT) as significant PPH factors. On multivariate analysis, HDCP, anemia in pregnancy, intrapartum fever, oxytocin use during labor, fetal distress, PLT, direct bilirubin, and FDP were noted as significant PPH factors and were included in the prediction model. A C-index of 0.816 was noted after internal validation, and the calibration curve showed good consistency. We developed a model to predict PPH risk in the vaginal delivery of twin pregnancies and visualized it with a nomogram that can be applied clinically to assess PPH risk and aid PPH prevention.",

    "abstract": "Monoamniotic twins develop when a blastocyst spontaneously splits its progenitor cells, and each group of progenitor cells independently grows to become an individual. It is the rarest type of twin pregnancy and usually has significant developmental or congenital abnormalities, a higher rate of abortion, perinatal morbidity, and mortality. There is no information regarding monoamniotic twins in livestock species. Here, we reported a spontaneous abortion of monoamniotic twins in a dromedary camel at 278\u2009days of gestation. Gonadorelin acetate (100\u2009\u03bcg) was injected intramuscularly to induce ovulation in the recipient. A 7\u2009days-old embryo produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer was transferred transcervically to the recipient. Early pregnancy was confirmed by an elevated level of serum progesterone followed by ultrasonography at 22 and 44\u2009days after embryo transfer. A single sac was observed on 22\u2009days while twins were evident 44\u2009days after embryo transfer. Pregnancy was periodically monitored by the tail-up phenomenon. A ruptured fetal sac was observed on the ground having two fetuses. On autopsy, full-grown fetuses were found. Their bodies were separated. There was no congenital anomaly or any malformation in the fetuses. According to the reported chronology in human twins, we hypothesized that the blastocyst splitted before 13\u2009days as it was monoamniotic and not conjoined. If the embryo splits within 4 to 8\u2009days, it develops two amniotic sacs, and splitting after 13\u2009days develops conjoined fetuses. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of monoamniotic twin abortion in dromedary camels. This report will increase awareness among practicing veterinarians and camel breeders about twin abortions.",

    "abstract": "The field of modeling and simulation including digital twins (DT) is getting a lot of traction in the health sector, with various benefits being outlined. Indeed, DT are designed to support the transformation of healthcare, ranging from the medical act itself to the organization of healthcare systems and hospitals, also including medical research. However, the technology is still in its infancy and needs to be evaluated according to medical standards. First and foremost, their clinical value remains to be assessed, taking into account the limits associated with AI tools. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the use cases being tested in hospital settings. We go back to the definition of the DT concept and provide a summary of current studies. Finally, we outline the challenges to be taken into account in order to provide a framework for the deployment of DT tools, guaranteeing the trust and safety of those involved, especially of patients.\nLe jumeau num\u00e9rique en sant\u00e9 - \u00c9tat des lieux et perspectives d\u2019application \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital.\nLa recherche et d\u00e9veloppement en sant\u00e9 est tr\u00e8s dynamique dans le champ de la simulation, et de nombreux projets se r\u00e9clament du jumeau num\u00e9rique (JN).

    "abstract": "Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are designed to produce evidence in selected populations. Assessing their effects in the real-world is essential to change medical practice, however, key populations are historically underrepresented in the RCTs. We define an approach to simulate RCT-based effects in real-world settings using RCT digital twins reflecting the covariate patterns in an electronic health record (EHR).\nWe developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, RCT-Twin-GAN, which generates a digital twin of an RCT (RCT-Twin) conditioned on covariate distributions from an EHR cohort. We improved upon a traditional tabular conditional GAN, CTGAN, with a loss function adapted for data distributions and by conditioning on multiple discrete and continuous covariates simultaneously. We assessed the similarity between a Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) RCT (TOPCAT), a Yale HFpEF EHR cohort, and RCT-Twin. We also evaluated cardiovascular event-free survival stratified by Spironolactone (treatment) use.\nBy applying RCT-Twin-GAN to 3445 TOPCAT participants and conditioning on 3445 Yale EHR HFpEF patients, we generated RCT-Twin datasets between 1141-3445 patients in size, depending on covariate conditioning and model parameters. RCT-Twin randomly allocated spironolactone (S)/ placebo (P) arms like an RCT, was similar to RCT by a multi-dimensional distance metric, and balanced covariates (median absolute standardized mean difference (MASMD) 0.017, IQR 0.0034-0.030). The 5 EHR-conditioned covariates in RCT-Twin were closer to the EHR compared with the RCT (MASMD 0.008 vs 0.63, IQR 0.005-0.018 vs 0.59-1.11). RCT-Twin reproduced the overall effect size seen in TOPCAT (5-year cardiovascular composite outcome odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.89 (0.75-1.06) in RCT vs 0.85 (0.69-1.04) in RCT-Twin).\nRCT-Twin-GAN simulates RCT-derived effects in real-world patients by translating these effects to the covariate distributions of EHR patients. This key methodological advance may enable the direct translation of RCT-derived effects into real-world patient populations and may enable causal inference in real-world settings.",

    "abstract": "Sleep medication use is an indicator of underlying sleep problems that might be induced by various factors such as alcohol use. However, the longitudinal relationship between drinking and sleep problems remains poorly understood. We investigated associations between sleep medication and alcohol use throughout adulthood, and examined the role of familial and potential confounding factors contributing to these associations.\nWe used information of zygosity and self-report questionnaire data over a follow-up period of 36 years from the Older Finnish Twin Cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a013\u00a0851).\nLogistic regression analyses suggested consistent associations between sleep medication use and heavy/binge drinking at all four time points (OR range\u00a0=\u00a01.36-3.18, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), implying that increased drinking is associated with increased sleep medication use over time. Cross-lagged path analyses suggested that moderate/heavy and binge drinking predict sleep medication use at most time points (OR range\u00a0=\u00a01.15-1.94, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whilst sleep medication use predicts subsequent abstaining from alcohol (OR range\u00a0=\u00a02.26-2.47, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Within-pair analyses implied that familial factors play a role, and quantitative genetic modelling estimated genetic factors to explain approximately 80\u00a0% of the lifetime association of sleep medication use with moderate/heavy and binge drinking.\nDrinking is associated with sleep medication use throughout adulthood. Further, our results suggest that drinking is likely to predict sleep medication use, thereby potentially constituting a risk factor for sleep problems, and that genetic factors contribute to the association. These findings are important in terms of better understanding the development of sleep and alcohol use disorders.",

    "abstract": "This study details the differentiation of identical twins based on single mutational base differences. There were three pairs of male monozygotic (MZ) twins in this study. DNA samples from blood, a buccal swab or saliva from each individual were all initially genotyped using 22 autosomal STR and 27 Y-STR loci. Preliminary screening confirmed there were no differences in the STR data between each pair of MZ twins. Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) data were generated from DNA extracted from the three body fluids from each individual. Kinship coefficients with 0.4254, 0.4557 and 0.4543 from 3 twins were generated based on WGS data to further confirm that their relationship was that of MZ twins. The fastq data generated by the Illumina Hiseq 2000 between MZ twins were then treated as \"normal\" as opposed to \"tumor\" using commercially available software tools to identify mutational single base changes. Sanger DNA sequencing confirmed there were 1, 5 and 9 single base changes found in WGS data from each of the three MZ twin sets. There was individual variation in the mutational base changes when comparing data from the three body fluids. The methods used in this study to differentiate MZ twins based on WGS data can readily be performed in many operational forensic DNA laboratories using user friendly software.",

    "abstract": "The objective is to predict the development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in discordant twins using a machine learning approach.\nThe records of 640 twin pairs born at 32-35 weeks gestational age (GA) with birth weight (BW) discordance were evaluated retrospectively. The infants' gender, GA, postmenstruel age at examination, BW, discordance rate, ROP Stages and Zones, and treatment options were recorded. The variables were used to develop a model to predict the development of ROP. Machine learning models were used for algorithm training and 10-fold cross-validation (CV) was applied for validation. The main measures were reported as sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic curve, and the area under the curve.\nA total of 640 twin pairs underwent ophthalmic examination, of which 55 (4.3%) were ROP. The infants' GA was 33.56\u00b11.01 weeks (32-35 weeks) and BW was 1996\u00b1335 g (1000-3400 g). The mean discordance rate of the infants was 11.8\u00b19.7% (0.0-53.9%). Using operating points, the Decision Tree algorithm detected ROP prediction with 71% sensitivity and 80% specificity in CV, while the Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithm detected 70% sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the X-Tree and Random Forest algorithms detected ROP prediction with 84% and 80% specificity, respectively.\nThe results of this study support that BW discordance may be effective in the development of ROP in preterm twins and that artificial intelligence models can predict the development of ROP in accordance with clinical findings.",

    "abstract": "Major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) are complex genetic mental illnesses. Their non-Mendelian features, such as those observed in monozygotic twins discordant for SCZ or BPD, are likely complicated by environmental modifiers of genetic effects. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an important epigenetic mark in gene regulation, and whether it is linked to genetic variants that contribute to non-Mendelian features remains largely unexplored.\nWe combined the 5hmC-selective chemical labeling method (5hmC-seq) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of peripheral blood DNA obtained from monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for SCZ or BPD to identify allelic imbalances in hydroxymethylome maps, and examined association of allele-specific hydroxymethylation (AShM) transition with disease susceptibility based on Bayes factors (BF) derived from the Bayesian generalized additive linear mixed model. We then performed multi-omics integrative analysis to determine the molecular pathogenic basis of those AShM sites. We finally employed luciferase reporter, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), PCR, FM4-64 imaging analysis, and RNA sequencing to validate the function of interested AShM sites in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells.\nWe identified thousands of genetic variants associated with AShM imbalances that exhibited phenotypic variation-associated AShM changes at regulatory loci. These AShM marks showed plausible associations with SCZ or BPD based on their effects on interactions among transcription factors (TFs), DNA methylation levels, or other epigenomic marks and thus contributed to dysregulated gene expression, which ultimately increased disease susceptibility. We then validated that competitive binding of POU3F2 on the alternative allele at the AShM site rs4558409 (G/T) in PLLP-enhanced PLLP expression, while the hydroxymethylated alternative allele, which alleviated the POU3F2 binding activity at the rs4558409 site, might be associated with the downregulated PLLP expression observed in BPD or SCZ. Moreover, disruption of rs4558409 promoted neural development and vesicle trafficking.\nOur study provides a powerful strategy for prioritizing regulatory risk variants and contributes to our understanding of the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors in mediating SCZ or BPD susceptibility.",

    "results": "We identified thousands of genetic variants associated with AShM imbalances that exhibited phenotypic variation-associated AShM changes at regulatory loci. These AShM marks showed plausible associations with SCZ or BPD based on their effects on interactions among transcription factors (TFs), DNA methylation levels, or other epigenomic marks and thus contributed to dysregulated gene expression, which ultimately increased disease susceptibility. We then validated that competitive binding of POU3F2 on the alternative allele at the AShM site rs4558409 (G/T) in PLLP-enhanced PLLP expression, while the hydroxymethylated alternative allele, which alleviated the POU3F2 binding activity at the rs4558409 site, might be associated with the downregulated PLLP expression observed in BPD or SCZ. Moreover, disruption of rs4558409 promoted neural development and vesicle trafficking.",

    "abstract": "The superlattice obtained by aligning a monolayer graphene and boron nitride (BN) inherits from the hexagonal lattice a sixty degrees periodicity with the layer alignment. It implies that, in principle, the properties of the heterostructure must be identical for 0\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 of layer alignment. Here, we demonstrate, using dynamically rotatable van der Waals heterostructures, that the moir\u00e9 superlattice formed in a bilayer graphene/BN has different electronic properties at 0\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 of alignment. Although the existence of these non-identical moir\u00e9 twins is explained by different relaxation of the atomic structures for each alignment, the origin of the observed valley Hall effect remains to be explained. A simple Berry curvature argument is not sufficient to explain the 120\u00b0 periodicity of this observation. Our results highlight the complexity of the interplay between mechanical and electronic properties in moir\u00e9 structures and the importance of taking into account atomic structure relaxation to understand their electronic properties.",

    "abstract": "Anterior chest wall defects have a wide range of etiologies in the pediatric population, ranging from infection, tumor, and trauma to congenital diseases. The reconstructive goals include restoring skeletal stability, obliterating dead space, preserving cardiopulmonary mechanics, and protecting vital underlying mediastinal organs. Although various reconstructive methods have been described in the literature, selecting the optimal method is challenging for the growing pediatric skeleton. Here, we report a case of previously thoraco-omphalopagus twins who underwent successful separation and reconstruction and presented for definitive anterior chest wall reconstruction.\nA pair of previously thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twins underwent definitive anterior chest wall defect reconstruction using cadaveric ribs and omental flap. Twin A received 2 cadaveric ribs, whereas twin B had a much larger sternal defect that required 3 cadaveric ribs combined with an omental flap for soft tissue chest coverage. Both twins were followed up for 8 months.\nTwin A's postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day 6. Twin B's course was complicated, and she was discharged on supported ventilation on postoperative day 10. At 8 months postoperatively, both twins healed well, and chest radiographs confirmed the stability of the chest reconstructions. The rib grafts in the twin with a tracheostomy were not mobile, and the patient had a solid sternum with adequate pulmonary expansion. The construct initially did not facilitate pulmonary functioning, but after a healing process, it eventually allowed for the twin with the tracheostomy who required pulmonary assistance to no longer need this device.\nCryopreserved cadaveric ribs and omental flaps offer safe and reliable reconstructive methods to successfully reconstruct congenital anterior chest wall skeletal defects in the growing pediatric population. The involvement of multidisciplinary team care is key to optimizing the outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The mode of delivery for twins born before 32\u00a0weeks of\u00a0gestation remains controversial. Our purpose is to conduct a meta-analysis of twin pregnancies less than 32\u00a0weeks or twin weight less than 1500\u00a0g, so as to find a suitable delivery mode.\nWe searched PubMed database, Cochrane Library database, and EMBASE database through December 2022. This protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023386946) prior to initiation. Studies that compared vaginal delivery to cesarean section for newborns less than 32\u00a0weeks of\u00a0gestation or birthweight under 1500\u00a0g were included. The primary result was neonatal mortality rate. Secondary result was neonatal morbidity. The quality of literatures included in the research was evaluated in accordance with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) literature quality evaluation scale. We use odds ratio (OR) as the effect index for binary variables. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. P\u2009<\u20090. 05 indicated statistically significant difference.\nOur search generated 5310 articles, and a total of 8 articles comprising a total of 14,703 newborns were included in the analysis. The odds ratios of neonatal mortality rate were for twins delivered by vaginal delivery compared to cesarean section were 0.84 (95% CI 0.57-1.24, P\u2009=\u20090.38). The 5-min Apgar score\u2009<\u20097 (95% CI 0.44-1.75, P\u2009=\u20090.72), necrotizing enterocolitis (95% CI 0.81-1.19, P\u2009=\u20090.82), intraventricular hemorrhage (95% CI 0.41-1.86, P\u2009=\u20090.71), periventricular leukomalacia (95% CI 0.16-4.52, P\u2009=\u20090.84), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (95% CI 0.88-1.36, P\u2009=\u20090.42), and respiratory distress syndrome (95% CI 0.23-2.01, P\u2009=\u20090.48) were not statistically significant between the two groups.\nWe have observed that vaginal delivery does not confer an increased risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality in twins born before 32\u00a0weeks of gestation. However, the current results are affected by substantial heterogeneity and confounding factors. We still need high-quality randomized-controlled studies require to address this important question.",

    "abstract": "Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements have facilitated tools capable of generating digital twins of real human faces and voices for interactive communication. In this research, we explore utilizing Digital Twins of Doctors (DTDs) in healthcare because using a doctor's identity can provide benefits like enhancing the credibility of the health information delivered using computers. DTDs are computer-controlled AI-generated digital replicas of doctors that closely resemble their characteristics. However, there exist limitations, including the social implications of using a doctor's identity, potential negative impacts on doctor-patient communication, and liability concerns. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of DTD usage in healthcare before widespread adoption, systematic research is essential. As a step towards this direction, in this qualitative research, we report findings from 13 semi-structured interviews with doctors. Our findings indicate that doctors believe DTDs offer benefits by saving doctors' time through the efficient delivery of repetitive information and personalizing patient care. Moreover, while using a doctor's identity can enhance credibility, it also raises concerns about using a doctor's identity to spread potential misinformation. These findings contribute by informing future researchers about doctors' perspectives on utilizing DTDs in healthcare, guiding the development of effective implementation strategies for responsible DTD integration into healthcare.",

    "abstract": "We present a unique case of monozygotic female twins with virtually identical clinical and radiological presentations of supratentorial hydrocephalus and cystic formations from the suprasellar cistern.\nEvaluating genetic predispositions and prenatal exposures is crucial for hydrocephalus in twins. Familial cases imply a genetic contribution to the development of these anomalies, including chromosomal abnormalities and specific variants linked to arachnoid cyst formation in various syndromes. Extensive genetic analyses found no pathogenic variants in the twins. Prenatal exposure to anti-epileptic medication was known during pregnancy and may be associated with fetal abnormalities, but not central nervous system (CNS) malformations, and was therefore not considered the cause of the condition in the twins. The twins presenting simultaneously with hydrocephalus caused by suprasellar cysts (SAC) underwent a two-step surgical management: initial ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement followed by fenestration. Postoperative imaging showed cyst reduction, but a secondary VPS was necessary in both cases.\nGenetic analysis is less likely to identify a monogenic etiology in non-syndromic cases of SACs, which are assumed to be multifactorial. There is no established evidence linking a teratogenic effect of anti-epileptic drugs to CNS malformations. Moreover, the surgical treatment of this complex condition constitutes a point of discussion.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies have demonstrated shared genetic and environmental effects between eating disorders and alcohol involvement in adults and middle adolescents. However, fewer studies have focused on late adolescents or investigated a wide range of eating disorder dimensions and alcohol involvement subscales in both sexes. We examined genetic and environmental correlations among three eating disorder dimensions and two alcohol involvement subscale scores in late adolescent twins using bivariate twin models.\nParticipants were 3568 female and 2526 male same-sex twins aged 18\u2009years old from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden. The Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI) assessed the drive for thinness, bulimia, and body dissatisfaction. Alcohol involvement was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test consumption (AUDIT-C) and problem (AUDIT-P) subscales.\nOnly phenotypic and twin correlations in female twins met our threshold for twin modeling. The proportion of total variance for each trait accounted for by additive genetic factors ranged from 0.50 to 0.64 in female twins, with the rest explained by nonshared environmental factors and measurement error. Shared environmental factors played a minimal role in the variance of each trait. The strongest genetic correlation (r\nWe observed distinct patterns of genetic and environmental effects for co-occurring eating disorder dimensions and alcohol involvement in female vs. male twins, supporting sex-specific treatment strategies for late adolescents with comorbid eating disorders and alcohol use disorder. Our findings emphasize the importance of assessing family history of multiple eating disorder dimensions while treating late adolescents with problematic alcohol use, and vice versa, to improve detection and treatment.",

    "abstract": "The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the correlation between placental anastomosis and superficial vascular branches in selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) in monochorionic diamniotic twins.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of the pregnancy data and placental perfusion of 395 patients with monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies delivered at our hospital from April 2013 to April 2020. We divided the patients into two groups and compared the number of placental superficial vascular branches in sFGR twins and normal MCDA twins. The correlation between the placental anastomosis and the number of superficial vascular branches in sFGR and normal MCDA twins was also investigated.\nThe number of umbilical arterial branches and umbilical venous branches was less than larger twins in sFGR, larger twins in normal MCDA and smaller twins in normal MCDA.

(r\u2009=\u20090.194, 0.182 and 0.211, p\u2009<\u20090.05) CONCLUSIONS: The risk of sFGR may arise when the placenta from MCDA twins shows a poor branching condition of placental superficial vessels. For the smaller twin of sFGR, regular ultrasound examination of the number of the umbilical venous branches may help to predict artery-to-artery (AA) overall diameter, artery-to-vein (AV) overall diameter and all anastomosis overall diameter.",

    "abstract": "Amniotic fluid (AF) is the primary intrauterine environment for fetal growth throughout gestation. Selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) is an adverse complication characterized by unequal growth in twins with nearly identical genetic makeup. However, the influence of AF-mediated intrauterine environment on the development and progression of sFGR remains unexplored.\nHigh-throughput targeted metabolomics analysis (G350) was performed on AF samples collected from sFGR (n\u00a0=\u00a018) and MCDA twins with birth weight concordance (MCDA-C, n\u00a0=\u00a020) cases. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify clinical features that may influence the metabolite composition in AF. Subsequently, partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to compare the different types of sFGR and MCDA-C twins. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and multivariate ROC curves were utilized to explore potential AF markers in twins with sFGR.\nIn our study, 182 metabolites were quantified in 76 AF samples. WGCNA indicated that the metabolite composition in late AF may not be influenced by gestational age. PLSDA demonstrated distinct variations between the metabolite profiles of AF in the sFGR and MCDA-C twins, with a significant emphasis on amino acids as the primary differential metabolite. The dissimilarities observed in sFGR twins were predominantly attributed to lipid metabolism-related metabolites. In particular, the KEGG enrichment metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant associations of both types of sFGR twins with central carbon metabolism in cancer. The multivariate ROC curves indicated that the combination of carnosine, sarcosine, l-alanine, beta-alanine, and alpha-n-phenylacetylglutamine significantly improved the AUC to 0.928. Notably, the ROC curves highlighted creatine (AUC:0.934) may be a potential biomarker for severe sFGR.\nThe data presented in this study offer a comprehensive metabolic map of the AF in cases of sFGR, shedding light on potential biomarkers associated with fetal growth and development in MCDA twins.",

PLSDA demonstrated distinct variations between the metabolite profiles of AF in the sFGR and MCDA-C twins, with a significant emphasis on amino acids as the primary differential metabolite. The dissimilarities observed in sFGR twins were predominantly attributed to lipid metabolism-related metabolites. In particular, the KEGG enrichment metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant associations of both types of sFGR twins with central carbon metabolism in cancer. The multivariate ROC curves indicated that the combination of carnosine, sarcosine, l-alanine, beta-alanine, and alpha-n-phenylacetylglutamine significantly improved the AUC to 0.928. Notably, the ROC curves highlighted creatine (AUC:0.934) may be a potential biomarker for severe sFGR.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that, compared with an omnivorous diet, a vegan diet confers potential cardiovascular benefits from improved diet quality (ie, higher consumption of vegetables, legumes, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and seeds).\nTo compare the effects of a healthy vegan vs healthy omnivorous diet on cardiometabolic measures during an 8-week intervention.\nThis single-center, population-based randomized clinical trial of 22 pairs of twins (N\u2009=\u200944) randomized participants to a vegan or omnivorous diet (1 twin per diet). Participant enrollment began March 28, 2022, and continued through May 5, 2022. The date of final follow-up data collection was July 20, 2022. This 8-week, open-label, parallel, dietary randomized clinical trial compared the health impact of a vegan diet vs an omnivorous diet in identical twins. Primary analysis included all available data.\nTwin pairs were randomized to follow a healthy vegan diet or a healthy omnivorous diet for 8 weeks. Diet-specific meals were provided via a meal delivery service from baseline through week 4, and from weeks 5 to 8 participants prepared their own diet-appropriate meals and snacks.\nThe primary outcome was difference in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration from baseline to end point (week 8). Secondary outcome measures were changes in cardiometabolic factors (plasma lipids, glucose, and insulin levels and serum trimethylamine N-oxide level), plasma vitamin B12 level, and body weight. Exploratory measures were adherence to study diets, ease or difficulty in following the diets, participant energy levels, and sense of well-being.\nA total of 22 pairs (N\u2009=\u200944) of twins (34 [77.3%] female; mean [SD] age, 39.6 [12.7] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 25.9 [4.7]) were enrolled in the study. After 8 weeks, compared with twins randomized to an omnivorous diet, the twins randomized to the vegan diet experienced significant mean (SD) decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (-13.9 [5.8] mg/dL; 95% CI, -25.3 to -2.4 mg/dL), fasting insulin level (-2.9 [1.3] \u03bcIU/mL; 95% CI, -5.3 to -0.4 \u03bcIU/mL), and body weight (-1.9 [0.7] kg; 95% CI, -3.3 to -0.6 kg).\nIn this randomized clinical trial of the cardiometabolic effects of omnivorous vs vegan diets in identical twins, the healthy vegan diet led to improved cardiometabolic outcomes compared with a healthy omnivorous diet. Clinicians can consider this dietary approach as a healthy alternative for their patients.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05297825.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins are made of a real-world component where data is measured and a virtual component where those measurements are used to parameterize computational models. There is growing interest in applying digital twins-based approaches to optimize personalized treatment plans and improve health outcomes. The integration of artificial intelligence is critical in this process, as it enables the development of sophisticated disease models that can accurately predict patient response to therapeutic interventions. There is a unique and equally important application of AI to the real-world component of a digital twin when it is applied to medical interventions. The patient can only be treated once, and therefore, we must turn to the experience and outcomes of previously treated patients for validation and optimization of the computational predictions. The physical component of a digital twins instead must utilize a compilation of available data from previously treated cancer patients whose characteristics (genetics, tumor type, lifestyle, etc.) closely parallel those of a newly diagnosed cancer patient for the purpose of predicting outcomes, stratifying treatment options, predicting responses to treatment and/or adverse events. These tasks include the development of robust data collection methods, ensuring data availability, creating precise and dependable models, and establishing ethical guidelines for the use and sharing of data. To successfully implement digital twin technology in clinical care, it is crucial to gather data that accurately reflects the variety of diseases and the diversity of the population.",

    "abstract": "While the concept of digital twin has already consolidated in industry, its spinoff in the urban environment-in the form of a City Digital Twin (CDT)-is more recent. A CDT is a dynamic digital model of the physical city whereby the physical and the digital are integrated in both directions, thus mutually affecting each other in real time. Replicating the path of smart cities, literature remarks that agendas and discourses around CDTs remain (1) tech-centered, that is, focused on overcoming technical limitations and lacking a proper sociotechnical contextualization of digital twin technologies; (2) practice-first, entailing hands-on applications without a long-term strategic governance for the management of these same technologies. Building on that, the goal of this article is to move beyond high-level conceptualizations of CDT to (a) get a cognizant understanding of what a CDT can do, how, and for whom; (b) map the current state of development and implementation of CDTs in Europe. This will be done by looking at three case studies-Dublin, Helsinki, and Rotterdam-often considered as successful examples of CDTs in Europe. Through exiting literature and official documents, as well as by relying on primary interviews with tech experts and local officials, the article explores the maturity of these CDTs, along the Gartner's hype-mainstream curve of technological innovations. Findings show that, while all three municipalities have long-term plans to deliver an integrated, cyber-physical real-time modeling of the city, currently their CDTs are still at an early stage of development. The focus remains on technical barriers-e.g., integration of different data sources-overlooking the societal dimension, such as the systematic involvement of citizens. As for the governance, all cases embrace a multistakeholder approach; yet CDTs are still not used for policymaking and it remains to see how the power across stakeholders will be distributed in terms of access to, control of, and decisions about CDTs.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to identify optimal digital twin policies for enhancing renewable energy projects. Through a comprehensive analysis, the research evaluates the potential of digital twins in the renewable energy sector while considering triple bottom line perspectives.\nThe study's main goal is to prioritize digital twin policies that can effectively boost renewable energy projects. The research aims to demonstrate the practical application and reliability of a proposed evaluation model.\nNine criteria, derived from literature review and triple bottom line viewpoints, are selected. Using the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology and Quantum picture fuzzy rough sets, criteria weights are determined. Quantum picture fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) evaluates sustainable industrial internet of things strategies in new-gen energy investments. VIsekriterijumska optimizcija i KOmpromisno Resenje (VIKOR) methodology enables a comparative assessment, and sensitivity analysis is conducted across nine cases.\nConsistent outcomes across various methods validate the model's reliability. Ecosystem preservation carries the highest weight (0.1147), followed by resource policy optimization with digital twins (0.1139). Distributed energy resilience ranks first (RCi 0.576), closely followed by energy efficiency optimization (RCi 0.542).\nThis study underscores ecosystem preservation and efficient resource policies as pivotal for successful digital twin deployment in renewable energy projects. The findings highlight digital twins' potential contribution to environmental protection and ecosystem sustainability, emphasizing resource efficiency through their effective use.",

    "abstract": "A multitude of additional anomalies can be observed in virtually all types of symmetrical conjoined twins. These concomitant defects can be divided into different dysmorphological patterns. Some of these patterns reveal their etiological origin through their topographical location. The so-called shared anomalies are traceable to embryological adjustments and directly linked to the conjoined-twinning mechanism itself, inherently located within the boundaries of the coalescence area. In contrast, discordant patterns are anomalies present in only one of the twin members, intrinsically distant from the area of union. These dysmorphological entities are much more difficult to place in a developmental perspective, as it is presumed that conjoined twins share identical intra-uterine environments and intra-embryonic molecular and genetic footprints. However, their existence testifies that certain developmental fields and their respective developmental pathways take different routes in members of conjoined twins. This observation remains a poorly understood phenomenon. This article describes 69 cases of external discordant patterns within different types of otherwise symmetrical mono-umbilical conjoined twins and places them in a developmental perspective and a molecular framework. Gaining insights into the phenotypes and underlying (biochemical) mechanisms could potentially pave the way and generate novel etiological visions in the formation of conjoined twins itself.",

    "abstract": "To summerize the results of the JUMODA study (JUmeaux MODe d'Accouchement) on the planned mode of delivery of twin pregnancy and the management of second twin delivery.\nJUMODA was a national observational prospective comparative study that took place between february 2014\u00a0and march 2015\u00a0in 176\u00a0french maternity units performing more than 1500\u00a0deliveries per year. Its main objectives were the comparison of neonatal and maternal morbidity according to the planned mode of delivery and the determination of the managements of second twin delivery associated with the best neonatal outcomes. To control for potential confounding factors and indication biases, statistical analyses comprized multivariate logistic regressions and matching on propensity scores.\nThe JUMODA study recruited 8823\u00a0women with twin delivery at or beyond 22\u00a0weeks of gestation. For twin pregnancies with a cephalic first twin at 32\u00a0weeks of gestation and beyond, severe neonatal morbidity was higher in the planned cesarean (150/2908 (5.2\u00a0%) than in the planned vaginal delivery group (199/8922 (2.2\u00a0%), aOR 1.56, 95\u00a0% CI 1.19-2.04). Increased neonatal morbidity in the planned cesarean delivery group was explained by higher severe morbidity in neonates born preterm (aOR 1.64, 95\u00a0% CI 1.13-2.39, for deliveries between 32\nPlanned vaginal delivery is the planned mode of delivery to encourage for the majority of pregnant women with twins, whatever first twin presentation and gestational age at delivery. No management of cephalic second twin appears better than an other, its choice will rest on obstetrician preferences.",

    "abstract": "Female fertility is a complex trait with age-specific changes in spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twinning and fertility. To elucidate factors regulating female fertility and infertility, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on mothers of spontaneous DZ twins (MoDZT) versus controls (3273 cases, 24,009 controls). This is a follow-up study to the Australia/New Zealand (ANZ) component of that previously reported (Mbarek et al., 2016), with a sample size almost twice that of the entire discovery sample meta-analysed in the previous article (and five times the ANZ contribution to that), resulting from newly available additional genotyping and representing a significant increase in power. We compare analyses with and without male controls and show unequivocally that it is better to include male controls who have been screened for recent family history, than to use only female controls. Results from the SNP based GWAS identified four genomewide significant signals, including one novel region, ",

An individual's observed BMI in 1975 was considered within (\u00b12.0), below (<-2.0), or above (>+2.0) genetically predicted BMI, measured by a polygenic risk score of 996,919 single nucleotide polymorphisms.\nIn monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs with large intrapair BMI differences, the co-twin with a higher observed BMI in 1975 deviated above predicted BMI more frequently (~2/3) than the co-twin with a lower BMI deviated below prediction (~1/3). Individuals below, within, and above prediction in 1975 reached, respectively, normal weight, overweight, and obesity by 2011, with a mean BMI increase of 4.5 (95% CI: 4.3-4.8).\nCategorizing BMI as below, within, or above polygenic risk score-predicted BMI helps identifying individuals who have been resistant or susceptible to weight gain.

    "abstract": "We report a case of monozygotic twin sisters with hereditary spastic paraplegia type 4 (SPG4) and epilepsy, only one of whom had a diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 (NT1). The older sister with NT1 exhibited excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep-onset rapid eye movement period in the multiple sleep latency test, and decreased orexin levels in cerebrospinal fluid. Both sisters had HLA-DRB1*15:01-DQB1*06:02 and were further identified to have a novel missense mutation (c.1156A\u2009>\u2009C, p.Asn386His) in the coding exon of the spastin (SPAST) gene. The novel missense mutation might be involved in the development of epilepsy. This case is characterised by a combined diagnosis of SPG4 and epilepsy, and it is the first report of NT1 combined with epilepsy and genetically confirmed SPG4. The fact that only one of the twins has NT1 suggests that acquired and environmental factors are important in the pathogenesis of NT1.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of assisted reproductive technology and the trend of increasing maternal age at conception have contributed to a significant rise in the incidence of multiple pregnancies. Multiple pregnancies bear several inherent risks for both mother and child. These risks increase with plurality and type of chorionicity. Multifetal pregnancy reduction is the selective abortion of \u22651 fetuses to improve the outcome of the remaining fetus(es) by decreasing the risk of premature birth and other complications.\nThis study aimed to compare birth outcomes of trichorionic triplets reduced to twins with those of trichorionic triplets and primary dichorionic twins. The added value of this study is the comparison with an additional control group, namely primary dichorionic twins.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study. Data from January 1990 to November 2016 were collected from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey, one of the largest European multiple birth registries. A total of 85 trichorionic triplet pregnancies (170 neonates) undergoing multifetal pregnancy reduction to twins were compared with 5093 primary dichorionic twin pregnancies (10,186 neonates) and 104 expectantly managed trichorionic triplet pregnancies (309 neonates). The assessed outcomes were gestational age at delivery, birthweight, and small for gestational age.\nPregnancy reduction from triplets to twins was associated with higher birthweight (+365.44 g; 95% confidence interval, 222.75-508.14 g; P<.0001) and higher gestational age (1.7 weeks; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-2.46; P<.0001) compared with ongoing trichorionic triplets after adjustment for sex, parity, method of conception, birth year, and maternal age. A trend toward lower risk of small for gestational age was observed. Reduced triplets had, on average, lower birthweight (-263.12 g; 95% confidence interval, -371.80 to -154.44 g; P<.0001) and lower gestational age (-1.13 weeks; 95% confidence interval, -1.70 to -0.56; P=.0001) compared with primary twins. No statistically significant difference was observed between primary twins and reduced triplets that reached 32 weeks of gestation.\nMultifetal pregnancy reduction from trichorionic triplets to twins significantly improved birth outcomes. This suggests that multifetal pregnancy reduction of trichorionic triplets to twins is medically justifiable. However, the birth outcomes of primary twins before 32 weeks of gestation are still better than those of reduced triplets. The process of multifetal pregnancy reduction includes at least 1 fetal death by definition, and thus prevention of higher-order pregnancies is preferable.",

    "abstract": "The association in the occurrence of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is 0.25\u00a0% to 0.44\u00a0% between monozygotic twins and 0.05\u00a0% to 0.10\u00a0% in dizygotic twins. A combination of genetic and environmental factors may have contributed to the occurrence of HPS. In view of the few related cases reported recently, we present two dizygotic twins who were diagnosed with HPS.\nThis report describes a rare case of congenital infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in preterm dizygotic twins diagnosed early, in which the first case presented with severe clinical features and managed surgically while the second presented with moderate features and hence managed non-operatively with atropine for 14\u00a0days. At 6\u00a0months of age, both twins continued to tolerate feeds, demonstrated satisfactory weight gain and had achieved appropriate developmental milestones. The postoperative course was uneventful in the twin A.\nCongenital HPS in premature twins remains an underdiagnosed pathology due to its clinical picture mimicking digestive intolerance to feeds. The mean age at diagnosis is about 38\u00a0days, and only 0.4\u00a0% of all children suffering from HPS show symptoms in the first 3\u00a0days of life. Symptom relief is achieved after a classic pyloromyotomy is performed by a more preferable laparoscopic technique or using the open surgical technique.\nIf one of the dizygotic twins has HPS, the other baby should be evaluated for the same diagnosis as early as possible, to ensure timely management. HPS with moderate clinical features can be treated with atropine for 14\u00a0days while severe HPS should be treated by pyloromyotomy.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we introduce a decentralized digital twin (DDT) modeling framework and its potential applications in computational science and engineering. The DDT methodology is based on the idea of federated learning, a subfield of machine learning that promotes knowledge exchange without disclosing actual data. Clients can learn an aggregated model cooperatively using this method while maintaining complete client-specific training data. We use a variety of dynamical systems, which are frequently used as prototypes for simulating complex transport processes in spatiotemporal systems, to show the viability of the DDT framework. Our findings suggest that constructing highly accurate decentralized digital twins in complex nonlinear spatiotemporal systems may be made possible by federated machine learning.",

    "abstract": "The circumstances and subsequent life events of the first twins to have been born in different countries are examined. Given that both twins were born in the United Kingdom, their common citizenship was never questioned. In contrast, twins born in Canada to a legally married gay transnational couple - composed of one American and one Israeli - were assigned as citizens of different nations and their parents were regarded as if unmarried. This essay is followed by reviews of research on the Hallermann-Streiff syndrome in monozygotic (MZ) twins, the effects of technology on conjoined twin separation, reciprocal deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) transplantation in MZ twins and new guidelines for managing multifetal pregnancies. Finally, media reports on a book by the world's oldest Auschwitz-Birkenau twin survivor, the passing of Dr Ian Wilmut, the identical twinship of Zhores Medvedev, another case of gay fathers with twin sons, twins and siblings admitted to medical school, and the first and fourth records for major league baseball twins are presented.",

    "abstract": "Given the digitalization trends within the field of engineering, we propose a practical approach to engineering digitization. This method is established based on a physical sandbox model, camera equipment and simulation technology. We propose an image processing modeling method to establish high-precision continuous mathematical models of transmission towers. The calculation of the wind field is realized by using wind speed calculations, a load-wind-direction-time algorithm and the Continuum-Discontinuum Element Method (CDEM). The sensitivity analysis of displacement- and acceleration-controlled transmission tower loads under two different wind direction conditions is conducted. The results show that the digital model exhibits a proportional relationship with the physical dimensions of the transmission tower model. The error between the numerical simulation results and the experimental results falls within a reasonable range. Nodes at higher positions of the transmission tower experience significantly higher forces compared to those at lower positions, and the structural forms with larger windward projected areas yield similar simulation results. The proposed digital twin system can help monitor the performance of structural bodies and assess the disaster degree in extreme conditions. It can guide specific maintenance and repair tasks.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal diagnosis comprises a set of investigations, both instrumental and laboratory-based, which aim to monitor the health of the foetus during pregnancy, from the early stages of embryonic development to the moments preceding delivery. A growing interest is emerging for the preterm ultrasound morphological screening of embryos and foetuses, aimed at assessing the integrity and viability of the conceptus, as well as the early diagnosis of anomalies which can cause complications. This study is a retrospective study of the ultrasonographic findings of twins in the authors' clinical activity from 2016 to 2022. Only seven cases of monochorionic twins were recorded, out of the whole number of evaluations performed on 3120 foetuses, with a prevalence of 0.6% and 0.2% in feline and canine foetuses. All the twins had their own amniotic sac and umbilical cord but presented a single placenta and a single allantoic sac. Unfortunately, the three feline cases were not more recognizable at term. In the four canine cases, three were of opposite sex and then necessarily dizygotic. Twins may have an impact on the success of a pregnancy due to the risk of dystocia, as observed in some of the reported cases. Prenatal ultrasound allows early recognition of twins in dogs and cats.",

    "abstract": "Birth weight (BW) discordant twins have an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. We aimed to study the effect of BW discordance on the risk of neonatal hearing loss (NHL) in very and extremely preterm twins.\nResults of the nationwide newborn hearing screening program in Dutch Neonatal Intensive Care Units and diagnostic examination were centrally registered between 2003 and 2021 and included in this study. We selected twins and singletons with a gestational age (GA) 24-\u00a0<\u00a032\u00a0weeks. Logistic regression analyses were applied to study the effect of BW discordance on the risk of NHL adjusted for BW, GA and sex. Singletons and concordant twins, defined as a BW discordance of \u226420\u00a0%, were used as two reference groups. BW discordance was further categorized as medium (>20-30\u00a0%) and high (>30\u00a0%).\nIn total, 3430 twins (2694 concordant, 428 medium and 308 high BW discordant), and 23,114 singletons were available. Smaller newborns of high BW discordant twins showed an increased risk of NHL compared to singletons (adjusted odds ratio with 95\u00a0% confidence interval was 3.56 (2.26-5.60)). Also, smaller newborns of medium and high BW discordant twins showed an increased risk of NHL compared to concordant twins (adjusted odds ratio with 95\u00a0% confidence interval were 1.97 (1.13-3.44) and 4.17 (2.56-6.82), respectively). No other statistically significant differences were found.\nBW discordance increased the risk of NHL in the smaller of the twin born very or extremely preterm.

Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia belongs to the group of primary dyskinesias, which also includes paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia and exercise-induced paroxysmal dyskinesia. The most common cause of paroxysmal kinesiogenic dyskinesia is mutations in the PRRT2 gene; in cases of non-kinesiogenic dyskinesia, a mutation in the MR1 gene is detected. The diagnosis of primary dyskinesias causes significant difficulty for clinicians due to the rarity of occurrence, as well as the large spectrum of conditions occurring with paroxysmal motor disorders in childhood. The article describes the clinical observation of 16-year-old twin brothers with transient attacks of dystonic, choreic and ballistic hyperkinesis that suddenly arose during movement. Patients were treated for tics and epilepsy for 12 years. Taking into account the clinical picture - transient attacks of hyperkinesis, their connection with movement, as well as data from video-electroencephalographic monitoring, a diagnosis of paroxysmal kinesiogenic dyskinesia was established, which in a further diagnostic search was confirmed by targeted sequencing of the pathological variant of the PRRT2 gene previously described in patients with kinesiogenic dyskinesia. The administration of carbamazepine, which is the drug of choice in the treatment of this category of patients, has achieved significant control over hyperkinesis in twins. Thus, molecular genetic diagnosis helps confirm the diagnosis of paroxysmal dyskinesias, but careful analysis of the clinical picture, considering the provoking factor, remains the basis of diagnosis.\n\u041f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0438 \u2014 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0444\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0430\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0437\u043e\u0432, \u0441 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0438 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u044e, \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u044e, \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u044e, \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0446\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0437\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u041d\u0430\u0438\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0438 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435 ",

    "abstract": "To determine the effect of perinatal and neonatal risk factors on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and to examine the association of fertility treatments on the risk for ROP in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm twins.\nThe population-based observational study consisted of VLBW twins born at 24-29 weeks gestational age (GA). Data from the Israel national database (1995-2020) were applied. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression using the General Estimating Equation were used for assessment of risk factors.\nThe study population comprised 4092 infants of whom 2374 (58%) were conceived following fertility treatments. ROP was diagnosed in 851 (20.8%) infants. The odds for ROP approximately doubled with each week decrease in GA: at 24 weeks, Odds Ratio (OR) 58.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 31.83-105.68); 25 weeks, OR 25.88 (95% CI 16.76-39.96); 26 weeks, OR 12.69 (95% CI 8.84-18.22) compared to 29 weeks GA. Each decrease in one birthweight z-score was associated with 1.82-fold increased risk for ROP (OR, 1.82, 95% CI 1.59-2.08). Infertility treatments were not associated with ROP. Neonatal morbidities significantly associated with ROP were surgical necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (OR, 2.04, 95% CI 1.31-3.19); surgically treated patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (OR, 1.63, 95% CI 1.12-2.37); sepsis (OR, 1.43, 95% CI 1.20-1.71) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR, 1.52, 95% CI 1.22-1.90).\nAmong preterm VLBW twins, poor intrauterine growth and surgical interventions for NEC and PDA were associated with high odds for ROP. This study does not support an association of fertility treatments with increased risk for ROP.",

Primary considerations should include chorionicity and the presence or absence of other obstetrical complications such as fetal growth restriction or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. More than half of twin gestations will deliver preterm, and a significant portion will be due to spontaneous labor or medical indications, such that the timing of delivery for twins is typically less determined by the provider discretion. Future studies are needed to assist in clarifying the optimal timing for delivery of twin pregnancies.",

The unique differences in placentation in monochorionic twins leads to unique complications, including twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, the twin anemia-polycythemia sequence, and selective fetal growth restriction. Not only does the understanding of the monochorionic placenta lead to an understanding of the pathophysiology of the complications of monochorionic twins, but it also has led to the development of highly effective directed fetal therapy via fetoscopic laser coagulation used in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Ninety percent of congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) are X-linked inherited and are caused by mutations in the vasopressin type 2 receptor gene (AVPR2). Most affected individuals are males. Only sporadic female cases have been reported. Here, we first reported a female monozygotic twin with discordant phenotypes for NDI carrying a missense variant c.845T>C (p.Leu282Pro) in exon 4 of AVPR2. Intracellular cAMP concentrations in COS7 cells transfected with AVPR2-L282P were significantly decreased by about 60% compared with those in wild-type AVPR2 plasmid transfected cells, suggesting this variation was pathogenic. The X-inactivation pattern was investigated in peripheral leukocytes and urine sediments in both the unaffected and affected pair. Results showed that the affected pair had a skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern in urine sediments and a random XCI pattern in leukocytes, while the unaffected pair showed a random XCI pattern both in leukocytes and urine sediments. This was the first report of monozygotic twins who developed different phenotypes of NDI. Our study suggested that the development of NDI symptoms is more closely associated with the XCI pattern in urine sediments compared with the XCI pattern in peripheral leukocytes. Analysis of XCI in peripheral leukocytes may not be enough to explore possible mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "A mathematical toy model of chiral spiral cyclic twins is presented, describing a family of deterministically generated aperiodic point sets. Its individual members depend solely on a chosen pair of integer parameters, a modulus m and a multiplier \u03bc. By means of their specific parameterization they comprise local features of both periodic and aperiodic crystals. In particular, chiral spiral cyclic twins are composed of discrete variants of continuous curves known as circle involutes, each discrete spiral being generated from an integer inclination sequence. The geometry of circle involutes does not only provide for a constant orthogonal separation distance between adjacent spiral branches but also yields an approximate delineation of the intrinsically periodic twin domains as well as a single aperiodic core domain interconnecting them. Apart from its mathematical description and analysis, e.g. concerning its circle packing densities, the toy model is studied in association with the crystallography and crystal chemistry of \u03b1-uranium and CrB-type crystal structures.",

The host-virus interactions regulating viral latency and reactivation and viral control of the cellular environment (immune regulation, differentiation, epigenetics) are highly complex. Understanding these processes is essential to controlling infection and can be leveraged as a novel approach for understanding basic cell biology.\nImmune digital twins (IDTs) are digital simulations integrating knowledge of human immunology, physiology, and patient-specific clinical data to predict individualized immune responses and targeted treatments. Recent studies used IDTs to elucidate mechanisms of T cells, dendritic cells, and epigenetic control-all key to HCMV biology.\nHere, we discuss how leveraging the unique biology of HCMV and IDTs will clarify immune response dynamics, host-virus interactions, and viral latency and reactivation and serve as a powerful IDT-validation platform for individualized and holistic health management.",

    "abstract": "The investigation of environmental effects on clinical measurements using individual samples is challenging because their genetic and environmental factors are different. However, using monozygotic twins (MZ) makes it possible to investigate the influence of environmental factors as they have the same genetic factors within pairs because the difference in the clinical traits within the MZ mostly reflect the influence of environmental factors. We hypothesized that the within-pair differences in the traits that are strongly affected by genetic factors become larger after genetic risk score (GRS) correction. Using 278 Japanese MZ pairs, we compared the change in within-pair differences in each of the 45 normalized clinical measurements before and after GRS correction, and we also attempted to correct for the effects of genetic factors to identify Cytosine-phosphodiester-Guanine (CpG) sites in DNA sequences with epigenetic effects that are regulated by genetic factors. Five traits were classified into the high heritability group, which was strongly affected by genetic factors. CpG sites could be classified into three groups: regulated only by environmental factors, regulated by environmental factors masked by genetic factors, and regulated only by genetic factors. Our method has the potential to identify trait-related methylation sites that have not yet been discovered.",

    "abstract": "The authors present the cases of monozygotic male twins with right-sided Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease (LCPD) with different formation of the lumbosacral junction. This is likely the fi rst description of a lumbosacral junction formation disorder associated with identical twins who were both treated for LCPD as children. The disease began at 6 and 9 years of age and during treatment as well as in adulthood signifi cantly different bone formation of the lumbosacral transitional vertebra, was observed in both brothers. Twin A has a unilateral right-sided fusion of the enlarged L5 transverse process with the ipsilateral sacral ala, twin B has a complete sacralization of the fi fth lumbar vertebra. The LCPD treatment outcomes in the twins were consistent with the results from large studies, i.e., age at the time of LCPD onset is the main factor infl uencing the prognosis, however the morphological difference in the transitional vertebrae in these monozygotic twins was signifi cantly. Key words: lumbosacral transitional vertebra, lumbosacral junction formation, sacralization of lumbar vertebra, megatransverse of vertebra L5.",

    "abstract": "The article provides an overview of the digitisation project conducted by the Parco Archeologico dell'Appia Antica (PAAA) in Rome, focusing on an 11.7 km section of the Appian Way. This effort is part of the \"Appia Regina Viarum\" project, supporting the UNESCO heritage site candidacy of the Appian Way. Advanced sensor technologies, including the Mobile Mapping System (MMS), 360\u00b0 Cameras, Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS), digital cameras, and drones, are employed to collect extensive data sets. The primary goal is to create highly accurate three-dimensional (3D) models for knowledge enhancement, conservation, and communication purposes. Innovative tools are introduced to manage High Resolution 3D textured models, improving maintenance, management, and design processes over traditional CAD methods. The project aims to develop multi-temporal Digital Twins integrated with historical documentation, such as Piranesi's imaginary views and architect Canina's monument reconstructions. These informative models function as nodes within the DT, serving the PAAA's geographic hub by means of an eXtended Reality (XR) platform: the paper proposes bridging the physical object and virtual models, contributing to supporting the operators in the maintenance planning as well as information dissemination and public awareness, offering an immersive experience beyond conventional reality.",

    "abstract": "One of the most promising advancements in healthcare is the application of digital twin technology, offering valuable applications in monitoring, diagnosis, and development of treatment strategies tailored to individual patients. Furthermore, digital twins could also be helpful in finding novel treatment targets and predicting the effects of drugs and other chemical substances in development. In this review article, we consider digital twins as virtual counterparts of real human patients. The primary aim of this narrative review is to give an in-depth look into the various data sources and methodologies that contribute to the construction of digital twins across several healthcare domains. Each data source, including blood glucose levels, heart MRI and CT scans, cardiac electrophysiology, written reports, and multi-omics data, comes with different challenges regarding standardization, integration, and interpretation. We showcase how various datasets and methods are used to overcome these obstacles and generate a digital twin. While digital twin technology has seen significant progress, there are still hurdles in the way to achieving a fully comprehensive patient digital twin. Developments in non-invasive and high-throughput data collection, as well as advancements in modeling and computational power will be crucial to improve digital twin systems. We discuss a few critical developments in light of the current state of digital twin technology. Despite challenges, digital twin research holds great promise for personalized patient care and has the potential to shape the future of healthcare innovation.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine is the vision of health care where therapy is tailored to each patient. As part of this vision, digital twinning technology promises to deliver a digital representation of organs or even patients by using tools capable of simulating personal health conditions and predicting patient or disease trajectories on the basis of relationships learned both from data and from biophysics knowledge. Such virtual replicas would update themselves with data from monitoring devices and medical tests and assessments, reflecting dynamically the changes in our health conditions and the responses to treatment. In precision cardiology, the concepts and initial applications of heart digital twins have slowly been gaining popularity and the trust of the clinical community. In this article, we review the advancement in heart digital twinning and its initial translation to the management of heart rhythm disorders.",

    "abstract": "The voice of an individual is the result of interaction between the laryngeal and supra-laryngeal structures of a person. Since the laryngeal and supra-laryngeal structures differ from one person to another, the voice produced by each person becomes unique and recognizably different from another person. If this uniqueness in voice can be found in the acoustic parameters of the voice, it can contribute to the fields of forensic speaker identification and voice biometrics. The best methodology for such a study would be a comparison of the voices of twins who have a number of similar characteristics.\nTo find out whether it is possible to perceptually differentiate the cry of identical twins from each other. To compare the acoustic parameters of cry among the twin pairs to find out the differentiating parameter.\nThis was an observational longitudinal study. Nineteen pairs of twins less than 1 week old who had completed 34 months of gestation period with no major congenital abnormalities were included in the study. The PRAAT software was used for the analysis of the voice samples.\nThe present study on neonates could not identify one single differentiating acoustic parameter among the twins. We infer from the study that rather than an individual parameter, it could be a complex interaction of different parameters that could give individual identity to a person's voice.\nThe high similarity noticed in the acoustic parameters among the twin pairs, suggests that rather than individual parameters, it could be a complex interaction of different parameters that could give individual identity to a person's voice. The study can offer information to automatic speaker recognition, Forensic speaker identification, and voice biometry.",

    "abstract": "We present TWINS (TWo INclining Slits), a method for characterizing phase spatial light modulators (SLMs), inspired by Young interferometry. TWINS is an elegant and versatile approach, using minimal equipment and alignment. It measures phase response locally rather than globally, both horizontally and vertically, with high resolution and at wide angles. It can also measure beam intensity profiles as directly seen by the SLM. TWINS characterizes the anisotropic aberrations in the mainstream models of liquid crystal phase SLMs, which is crucial to improve hologram quality. Compensating for anisotropic aberrations measured by TWINS improved the image quality of planar holograms by 10\u00a0dB.",

    "abstract": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a genetic cardiac disease that leads to ventricular tachycardia (VT), a life-threatening heart rhythm disorder. Treating ARVC remains challenging due to the complex underlying arrhythmogenic mechanisms, which involve structural and electrophysiological (EP) remodeling. Here, we developed a novel genotype-specific heart digital twin (Geno-DT) approach to investigate the role of pathophysiological remodeling in sustaining VT reentrant circuits and to predict the VT circuits in ARVC patients of different genotypes. This approach integrates the patient's disease-induced structural remodeling reconstructed from contrast-enhanced magnetic-resonance imaging and genotype-specific cellular EP properties. In our retrospective study of 16 ARVC patients with two genotypes: plakophilin-2 (",

    "abstract": "Digital twins (DTs) have received widespread attention recently, providing new ideas and possibilities for future healthcare. This review aims to provide a quantitative review to analyze specific study contents, research focus, and trends of DT in healthcare. Simultaneously, this review intends to expand the connotation of \"healthcare\" into two directions, namely \"Disease treatment\" and \"Health enhancement\" to analyze the content within the \"DT\u2009+\u2009healthcare\" field thoroughly.\nA data mining method named Structure Topic Modeling (STM) was used as the analytical tool due to its topic analysis ability and versatility. Google Scholar, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure supplied the material papers in this review.\nA total of 94 high-quality papers published between 2018 and 2022 were gathered and categorized into eight topics, collectively covering the transformative impact across a broader spectrum in healthcare. Three main findings have emerged: (1) papers published in healthcare predominantly concentrate on technology development (artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, etc.) and application scenarios(personalized, precise, and real-time health service); (2) the popularity of research topics is influenced by various factors, including policies, COVID-19, and emerging technologies; and (3) the preference for topics is diverse, with a general inclination toward the attribute of \"Health enhancement.\"\nThis review underscores the significance of real-time capability and accuracy in shaping the future of DT, where algorithms and data transmission methods assume central importance in achieving these goals. Moreover, technological advancements, such as omics and Metaverse, have opened up new possibilities for DT in healthcare. These findings contribute to the existing literature by offering quantitative insights and valuable guidance to keep researchers ahead of the curve.",

    "abstract": "Hyperlexia, a strong orientation towards written materials, along with a discrepancy between the precocious acquisition of decoding skills and weaker comprehension abilities, characterizes up to 20% of autistic children. Sometimes perceived as an obstacle to oral language acquisition, hyperlexia may alternatively be the first step in a non-social pathway of language acquisition in autism.\nWe describe two monozygotic twin brothers, both autistic and hyperlexic, from the ages of 4 to 8\u00a0years old. Following an in-depth diagnostic assessment, we investigated cross-sectionally and longitudinally their verbal and non-verbal cognitive abilities, language, reading and writing skills, interests, and strengths.\nThe twins' features, including their high non-verbal level of intelligence, their special interests, and their skills in various domains, were highly similar. Their language consisted exclusively of letters and numbers until their fourth year. After that, their vocabulary broadened until they developed full sentences, and their perception-related interests expanded and merged over time to serve the development of other skills.\nOur results show that hyperlexic skills can be harnessed to favor oral language development. Given the strong concordance between the twins' cognitive and behavioral phenotypes, we discuss the environmental and genetic influence that could explain their abilities.",

    "abstract": "Even when the same treatment is employed, some patients are cured, while others are not. The patients that are cured may have beneficial microbes in their body that can boost treatment effects, but it is vice versa for the patients that are not cured. That is, treatment effects can vary depending on the patient's microbiome. If the effects of candidate treatments are well-predicted based on the patient's microbiome, we can select a treatment that is suited to the patient's microbiome or alter the patient's microbiome to improve treatment effects. Here, I introduce a streamlined analytic method, microbiome virtual twins (MiVT), to probe for the interplay between microbiome and treatment. MiVT employs a new prediction method, distance-based machine learning (dML), to improve prediction accuracy in microbiome studies and a new significance test, bootstrap-based test for regression tree (BoRT), to test if each subgroup's treatment effect is the same with the overall treatment effect. MiVT will serve as a useful guideline in microbiome-based personalized medicine to select the therapy that is most suited to the patient's microbiome or to tune the patient's microbiome to be suited to the treatment.",

This hospital-based cohort study included dichorionic twin gestations. Blood samples were collected at a median of 14.7\u2009weeks of gestation. Blood plasma metabolite levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Generalized estimating equations and mixed effects models were used to explore associations between plasma metabolite levels and fetal growth. In total, 115 women with dichorionic diamniotic pregnancies were included. The maternal plasma DMG level was negatively correlated with fetal birth weight (",

    "abstract": "The idea of a systematic digital representation of the entire known human pathophysiology, which we could call the Virtual Human Twin, has been around for decades. To date, most research groups focused instead on developing highly specialised, highly focused patient-specific models able to predict specific quantities of clinical relevance. While it has facilitated harvesting the low-hanging fruits, this narrow focus is, in the long run, leaving some significant challenges that slow the adoption of digital twins in healthcare. This position paper lays the conceptual foundations for developing the Virtual Human Twin (VHT). The VHT is intended as a distributed and collaborative infrastructure, a collection of technologies and resources (data, models) that enable it, and a collection of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) that regulate its use. The VHT infrastructure aims to facilitate academic researchers, public organisations, and the biomedical industry in developing and validating new digital twins in healthcare solutions with the possibility of integrating multiple resources if required by the specific context of use. Healthcare professionals and patients can also use the VHT infrastructure for clinical decision support or personalised health forecasting. As the European Commission launched the EDITH coordination and support action to develop a roadmap for the development of the Virtual Human Twin, this position paper is intended as a starting point for the consensus process and a call to arms for all stakeholders.",

The prevalence of dental caries, and the frequency of tooth brushing, the children's oral habits, molar relationships, and occlusal traits were recorded.\nThe percentage of children who brushed their teeth more than twice daily was statistically significantly higher in multiple births than in singletons. Higher correlation coefficients were found in dental caries index, except for decayed, filled (df) (2-5 age group) and filled (f) (6-11 age group), in the monozygotic twin pairs compared to those in the dizygotic twin pairs. In children between the ages of 6 and 11 years, mouth breathing, bruxism, lip biting, and pencil biting were higher in singletons than in children of multiple births. There were statistically significant differences between children of multiple births and singletons, with increased overjet in the 2-5 year age group being observed.\nWhen analyzing these parameters, environmental factors must also be investigated. Due to the low incidence of twin births, longitudinal follow-up studies with more twin pairs are necessary to determine whether these results are generalizable.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are crucial to assess the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors. This study was conducted to evaluate association between deleterious oral habits and dental caries-periodontal parameters among Turkish twins.\nThe study comprised 143 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins and 59 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins aged 3-15 years. Twins were examined for dental caries, plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing and deleterious oral habits. Mann Whitney U test was used to examine the data.\nThe MZ twin pairs consisted of 60 male and 58 female twin pairs, whereas the DZ twin pairs consisted of 144 male and 142 female. The mean age of the twins was 9.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0 in MZ twins and 9.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2 in DZ twins. The mean DMFS value of MZ twins with bruxism is higher than those of MZ twins without bruxism (\nThese findings suggest that dental caries-periodontal parameters are similarly affected by deleterious oral habits in MZ and DZ twins.",

    "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a technology that connects devices to collect data and conduct in-depth analysis to provide value-added services to industries. The integration of the physical and digital domains is crucial for unlocking the full potential of the IIoT, and digital twins can facilitate this integration by providing a virtual representation of real-world entities.\nBy combining digital twins with the IIoT, industries can simulate, predict, and control physical behaviors, enabling them to achieve broader value and support industry 4.0 and 5.0. Constituents of cooperative IIoT domains tend to interact and collaborate during their complicated operations.\nTo secure such interaction and collaborations, we introduce a blockchain-based cross-domain authentication protocol for IIoT. The blockchain maintains only each domain's dynamic accumulator, which accumulates crucial materials derived from devices, decreasing the overhead. In addition, we use the on-chain accumulator to effectively validate the unlinkable identities of cross-domain IIoT devices.\nThe implementation of the concept reveals the fact that our protocol is efficient and reliable. This efficiency and reliability of our protocol is also substantiated through comparison with state-of-the-art literature. In contrast to related protocols, our protocol exhibits a minimum 22.67% increase in computation cost efficiency and a 16.35% rise in communication cost efficiency.\nThe developed protocol guarantees data transfer security across the domain and thwarts IoT devices from potential physical attacks. Additionally, in order to protect privacy, anonymity and unlinkability are also guaranteed.",

    "abstract": "Similarities between twins have been widely demonstrated, underscoring the remarkable influence of genetics across numerous traits. In this study, we explore the genetic underpinnings of the human brain by examining MRI data from the Queensland Twin Imaging study. Specifically, this study seeks to compare brain structure and function between twins and unrelated subjects, with an emphasis on describing the effects of genetic factors. To achieve these goals, we employed the source-based morphometry method to extract intrinsic components and elucidate recognizable patterns. Our results show that twins exhibit a higher degree of similarity in gray and white matter density compared with unrelated individuals. In addition, four distinct states of brain activity were identified using coactivation patterns analysis. Furthermore, twins demonstrated a greater degree of similarity in the temporal and spatial features of each state compared with unrelated subjects. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that twins show greater similarity in both brain structure and dynamic functional brain activity. Further exploration of these methods may advance our understanding of the complex interplay between genes, environment, and brain networks.",

    "abstract": "Esophageal atresia (EA) is the most common malformation of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The estimated incidence of EA is 1 in 3500 births. EA is more frequently observed in boys and in twins. The exact cause of isolated EA remains unknown; a multifactorial etiology, including epigenetic gene expression modifications, is considered. The study included six pairs of twins (three pairs of monozygotic twins and three pairs of dizygotic twins) in which one child was born with EA as an isolated defect, while the other twin was healthy. DNA samples were obtained from the blood and esophageal tissue of the child with EA as well as from the blood of the healthy twin. The reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) technique was employed for a whole-genome methylation analysis. The analyses focused on comparing the CpG island methylation profiles between patients with EA and their healthy siblings. Hypermethylation in the promoters of 219 genes and hypomethylation in the promoters of 78 genes were observed. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed the statistically significant differences in methylation profile of 10 hypermethylated genes in the Rho GTPase pathway, previously undescribed in the field of EA (",

    "abstract": "The Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) is a longitudinal study following a cohort of twins born 1994-1996 in England and Wales. Of the 13,759 families who originally consented to take part, over 10,000 families remain enrolled in the study. The current focus of TEDS is on mental health in the mid-twenties. Making use of over 25\u00a0years of genetically sensitive data, TEDS is uniquely placed to explore the longitudinal genetic and environmental influences on common mental health disorders in early adulthood. This paper outlines recent data collection efforts supporting this work, including a cohort-wide mental health assessment at age 26 and a multi-phase Covid-19 study. It will also provide an update on data linkage efforts and the Children of TEDS (CoTEDS) project.",

    "abstract": "Enteroviruses are among the most common causes of acute viral illness worldwide, and in neonates, the clinical course of these infections is heterogeneous. Severe complications, such as myocarditis, are associated with high mortality rates. In this case report, we present the clinical course of premature twins born at 35 weeks of gestational age, suffering from a severe neonatal enterovirus infection with cardiac involvement, which proved fatal in one of the twins. This course led to prompt identification in the other twin and facilitated timely transfer to a neonatal intensive care unit with neonatal hemodynamic expertise, and facilitated the timely transfer to a neonatal intensive care nit with hemodynamic expertise and immediate availability of AZCMO would it have been indicated. Early supportive therapy in the other twin contributed to a positive outcome. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of early recognition in averting adverse consequences. As a recommendation, we propose routine screening of enterovirus in viral panels for febrile newborns.",

Although benign, cholesteatomas can cause significant morbidity including hearing loss, infection, facial palsy and thrombosis. Congenital cholesteatomas are incredibly rare and bilateral disease has not commonly been published in the literature.\nWe describe the case of female identical (monozygotic, monochorionic, diamniotic) twins who both developed congenital cholesteatomas. In this report, we review the aetiology, treatment, embryology and pathology of cholesteatoma.\nThe patients have been followed up 15 years after their initial surgery with promising results - pure-tone audiometry and repeat scans have not illustrated any disease recurrence.\nThis paper presents one of the only cases of female monozygotic twins presenting with unilateral and bilateral cholesteatomas.",

    "abstract": "Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with increased susceptibility to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that epigenetic changes play critical roles in the regulation of fetal growth. We sought to present a comprehensive analysis of the associations between placental DNA methylation and selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR), which is a severe complication of monochorionic twin pregnancies, characterized by one fetus experiencing restricted growth. Genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on 24 placental samples obtained from 12 monochorionic twins with sFGR (Cohort 1) using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Integrative analysis of our EPIC data and two previous placental methylation studies of sFGR (a total of 30 placental samples from 15 sFGR twins) was used to identify convincing differential promoter methylation. Validation analysis was performed on the placentas from 15 sFGR twins (30 placental samples), 15 FGR singletons, and 14 control singletons (Cohort 2) using pyrosequencing, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). A globe shift toward hypomethylation was identified in the placentas of growth-restricted fetuses compared with the placentas of normal fetuses in monochorionic twins, including 5625 hypomethylated CpGs and 452 hypermethylated CpGs, especially in the regions of CpG islands, gene-body and promoters. The analysis of pathways revealed dysregulation primarily in steroid hormone biosynthesis, metabolism, cell adhesion, signaling transduction, and immune response. Integrative analysis revealed a differentially methylated promoter region in the CYP11A1 gene, encoding a rate-limiting enzyme of steroidogenesis converting cholesterol to pregnenolone. The CYP11A1 gene was validated to have hypomethylation and higher mRNA expression in sFGR twins and FGR singletons. In conclusion, our findings suggested that the changes in placental DNA methylation pattern in sFGR may have functional implications for differentially methylated genes and regulatory regions. The study provides reliable evidence for identifying abnormally methylated CYP11A1 gene in the placenta of sFGR.",

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 supports the vision of networked machines in decentralized production plants across the value chain. Hence, it requires highly connected partners exchanging relevant data about products, processes, and production resources. This paper proposes the usage of data spaces and digital twins to enable this Industry 4.0 vision and investigates the building blocks to realize a data space for Industry 4.0, e.g., the integration of digital twins inside the data space based upon the latest specification of the Industry 4.0 Asset Administration Shell. A prototypical implementation shows the feasibility of storing product carbon footprints inside a digital twin and sharing it over a data space with other partners.",

    "abstract": "The paper sheds light on the process of creating and validating the digital twin of bridges, emphasizing the crucial role of load testing, BIM models, and FEM models. At first, the paper presents a comprehensive definition of the digital twin concept, outlining its core principles and features. Then, the framework for implementing the digital twin concept in bridge facilities is discussed, highlighting its potential applications and benefits. One of the crucial components highlighted is the role of load testing in the validation and updating of the FEM model for further use in the digital twin framework. Load testing is emphasized as a key step in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the digital twin, as it allows the validation and refinement of its models. To illustrate the practical application and issues during tuning and validating the FEM model, the paper provides an example of a real bridge. It shows how a BIM model is utilized to generate a computational FEM model. The results of the load tests carried out on the bridge are discussed, demonstrating the importance of the data obtained from these tests in calibrating the FEM model, which forms a critical part of the digital twin framework.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is multifactorial and strongly affected by genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. Several studies have reported development of concomitant CAD in identical twins. We report a case in which a pair of Caucasian male monozygotic twins presented almost concomitantly with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and had concordant coronary anatomy and identical site of occlusion. We performed a systematic literature review of PubMed, Web Of Science and Scopus databases from inception until 28 February 2023 of case reports/case series reporting the concomitant development of CAD in monozygotic twins. We found 25 eligible case reports with a total of 31 monozygotic twin pairs (including the case from our center) suffering from CAD and presenting (most of them simultaneously) with ACS (mean age of presentation: 45 \u00b1 12 years, males: 81%). Coronary angiograms demonstrated lesion and anatomy concordance in 77% and 79% of the twin pairs, respectively. Screening for disease-related genetic mutations was performed in six twin pairs leading to the identification of five CAD-related genetic polymorphisms. This is the first systematic literature review of studies reporting identical twin pairs suffering from CAD. In summary, there is high concordance of coronary anatomy and clinical presentation between monozygotic twins. Future monozygotic twin studies-unbiased by age effects-can provide insights into CAD heritability being able to disentangle the traditional dyad of genetic and environmental factors and investigate the within-pair epigenetic drift.",

    "abstract": "To explore the risk factors and develop a predictive model for postpartum hemorrhage in twin pregnancies.\nAll patients who gave birth at Ningbo Women and Children's Hospital from January 2018 to August 2022 were recruited. Patients were randomly allocated to a training cohort (n[Formula: see text]1395) validation cohort (n[Formula: see text]650) at a 7:3 ratio. In the training cohort, LASSO regression for screening variables and multifactorial logistic regression analysis were performed to identify independent risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage in twin pregnancies. A nomogram was established based on the results of multiple logistic regression analysis. Nomogram performance was quantified using the receiver operating characteristic curve, Hosmer- Lemeshow test and decision curve analysis.\nA total of 2045 patients were included in this study. Multifactorial Logistic regression analysis showed maternal age, assisted reproduction, platelet count, fibrinogen level, albumin level, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, placenta praevia, number of previous cesarean deliveries, number of previous intrauterine manipulation, and neonatal weight were independent risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage in twin births. The area under curve (AUC) for the training cohort was 0.810 [95[Formula: see text] CI (0.781, 0.839)], with a sensitivity of 76.5[Formula: see text], specificity of 71.0[Formula: see text], and positive and negative predictive values of 0.358 and 0.935, respectively, while the AUC for the validation cohort was 0.821 [95[Formula: see text] CI (0.781, 0.860)], with a sensitivity of 80.9[Formula: see text], specificity of 69.49[Formula: see text], and positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 0.426 and 0.929, respectively.\nThe predictive model can effectively and quantitatively assess the risk of postpartum hemorrhage in twin pregnancies and help clinicians to take personalized preventive measures.",

    "abstract": "Moebius syndrome is a congenital cranial dysinnervation disorder (CCDD) that presents with nonprogressive cranial nerve (CN) VI and VII palsies resulting in facial weakness and inability to abduct the eye(s). While many CCDDs have an underlying genetic cause, the etiology of Moebius syndrome remains unclear as most cases are sporadic. Here, we describe a pair of monochorionic, diamniotic twin girls; one with normal growth and development, and one with micrognathia, reduced facial expression, and poor feeding. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain performed on the affected twin at 19\u2009months of age showed severely hypoplastic or absent CN IV bilaterally, left CN VI smaller than right, and bilateral hypoplastic CN VII and IX, consistent with a diagnosis of a CCDD, most similar to that of Moebius syndrome. Genomic sequencing was performed on each twin and data was assessed for discordant variants, as well as variants in novel and CCDD-associated genes. No pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of uncertain significance were identified in genes known to be associated with CCDDs or other congenital facial weakness conditions. This family provides further evidence in favor of a stochastic event as the etiology in Moebius syndrome, rather than a monogenic condition.",

    "abstract": "The human skeletal muscle drives skeletal movement through contraction. Embedding its functional information into the human morphological framework and constructing a digital twin of skeletal muscle for simulating physical and physiological functions of skeletal muscle are of great significance for the study of \"virtual physiological humans\". Based on relevant literature both domestically and internationally, this paper firstly summarizes the technical framework for constructing skeletal muscle digital twins, and then provides a review from five aspects including skeletal muscle digital twins modeling technology, skeletal muscle data collection technology, simulation analysis technology, simulation platform and human medical image database. On this basis, it is pointed out that further research is needed in areas such as skeletal muscle model generalization, accuracy improvement, and model coupling. The methods and means of constructing skeletal muscle digital twins summarized in the paper are expected to provide reference for researchers in this field, and the development direction pointed out can serve as the next focus of research.\n\u4eba\u4f53\u9aa8\u9abc\u808c\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u7f29\u5e26\u52a8\u9aa8\u9abc\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u4eba\u4f53\u5f62\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9aa8\u9abc\u808c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u9aa8\u9abc\u808c\u7269\u7406\u53ca\u751f\u7406\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5bf9\u201c\u865a\u62df\u751f\u7406\u4eba\u201d\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u56fd\u5185\u5916\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5f52\u7eb3\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u9aa8\u9abc\u808c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u6280\u672f\u6784\u67b6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5206\u522b\u4ece\u9aa8\u9abc\u808c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6280\u672f\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u3001\u4eba\u4f53\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e94\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u5728\u9aa8\u9abc\u808c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8026\u5408\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u9aa8\u9abc\u808c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u6240\u6307\u51fa\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u4e5f\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eca\u540e\u503c\u5f97\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u8bfe\u9898\u5185\u5bb9\u3002.",

    "abstract": "To investigate childhood growth patterns in twins and to determine whether they show the same signs of excess growth as singletons born small-for-gestational age (SGA), which may confer future cardiometabolic risk.\nIn the Upstate KIDS cohort of infants delivered from 2008 through 2010, we compared height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) z-scores at 0-3 and 7-9\u00a0years of age, as well as risk of rapid weight gain (RWG) in infancy and overweight/obesity beginning at 2\u00a0years, among appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) twins (n\u00a0=\u00a01121), AGA singletons (n\u00a0=\u00a02684), and two groups of SGA twins: uncertain SGA twins (<10th percentile for birthweight by a singleton reference but >10th% by a population-based twin birthweight reference; n\u00a0=\u00a0319) and true SGA twins (<10th% by a population-based twin reference; n\u00a0=\u00a0144).\nCompared with AGA twins, both SGA twin groups had lower weight and BMI z-scores at both time points. By 7-9\u00a0years, both groups caught up in height with AGA twins. Compared with AGA singletons, z-score differences decreased between 0-3 and 7-9\u00a0years for uncertain SGA and true SGA twins, though true SGA twins had the lowest z-scores for all measures. During infancy, twins were more likely to display RWG compared with AGA singletons (RR\u00a0=\u00a02.06 to 2.67), which may reflect normal catch-up growth, as no twin group had higher prevalence of overweight/obesity at either time point.\nThough twins had lower height, weight, and BMI z-scores at birth and into toddlerhood, differences were reduced by 7-9\u00a0years, with no evidence of pathological growth and no group of twins showing elevated risk of overweight/obesity.",

Extensive studies on familial and non-familial cases have implicated a number of segregating mutations and de novo changes in SZ that may include changes to the mitochondrial genome. Yet, no single universally causal variant has been identified, highlighting its extensive genetic heterogeneity. This report specifically focuses on the assessment of changes in the mitochondrial genome in a unique set of monozygotic twins discordant (MZD) for SZ using blood.

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are rare, high-stakes cases requiring complex management. This report presents thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twins who shared parts of liver and abdominal wall. The main obstacle in separating these patients was liver fusion.\nTwo-year-old female conjoined twins presented with liver fusion between segments 2 and 3 in twin A and segments 2 and 4A in twin B. Liver separation was performed using the modified liver hanging maneuver. After separating the triangular ligaments and surrounding adhesions, a 12-Fr Foley catheter was inserted under the fused liver, suspending it upward and producing a clear separation plane. Liver separation required only 32\u00a0min. No notable bleeding or bile leakage was observed.\nThe liver hanging maneuver was originally used as an adjunct technique for liver tumor hepatectomy. We used this technique to separate the fused livers in conjoined twins. The advantages of LHM include potentially reducing excess manipulation, which may result in parenchyma and vascular pedicle injury, and facilitating bleeding control, thereby reducing the operation time.\nThe liver hanging maneuver using a conventional Foley catheter is a simple and useful method for separating fused livers in conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "Clinical practice guidelines recommend determining gestational age (GA) for twin pregnancies using the fetal crown rump length (CRL) of the larger fetus. This study investigated whether the CRL of the larger or smaller fetus at 11-14 weeks best predicted in\u00a0vitro fertilization (IVF) assigned GA.\nA retrospective cohort study of twin pregnancies conceived by IVF \u00b1 intracytoplasmic sperm injection, 2004-2022, generated GA estimations for each co-twin CRL at the 11-14 week ultrasound, to determine which fetus (smaller or larger) more consistently predicted IVF-assigned GA. Monoamniotic twins and twins with known structural or vascular abnormalities were excluded. Paired t tests evaluated the ability of CRL to predict GA, and logistic regression evaluated the predictive ability of each of the co-twin groups with increasing size differences. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.\nViewpoint 6 identified 359 eligible twin pairs. CRL was closest with the smaller fetus (0.38 days); CRL for both the smaller (95% CI 0.16-0.61) and the larger (2.25 days, 95% CI 2.04-2.46) fetus showed deviation from IVF-assigned GA. As the absolute difference between the small and large fetus increased, the ultrasound-estimated GA of the smaller fetus was still consistently closer to IVF-assigned GA.\nIn this selected population of twins with known GA, the CRL of the smaller fetus more accurately predicted IVF-assigned GA even with increasing differences in fetal size. These findings provide important information for appropriately dating pregnancies to facilitate adherence to national guidelines to monitor for pregnancy complications, and plan frequency and type of fetal surveillance, as well as timing of delivery.",

    "abstract": "Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most prevalent heart valve disease in western countries that poses a significant public health challenge due to the lack of a medical treatment to prevent valve calcification. Given the aging population demographic, the prevalence of AS is projected to rise, resulting in a progressively significant healthcare and economic burden. While surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the gold standard approach, the less invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is poised to become the dominant method for high- and medium-risk interventions. Computational simulations using patient-specific models, have opened new research avenues for optimizing emerging devices and predicting clinical outcomes. The traditional techniques of generating digital replicas of patients' aortic root, native valve, and calcification are time-consuming and labor-intensive processes requiring specialized tools and expertise in anatomy. Alternatively, deep learning models, such as the U-Net architecture, have emerged as reliable and fully automated methods for medical image segmentation. Two-dimensional U-Nets have been shown to produce comparable or more accurate results than trained clinicians' manual segmentation while significantly reducing computational costs. In this study, we have developed a fully automatic AI tool capable of reconstructing the digital twin geometry and analyzing the calcification distribution on the aortic valve. The developed automatic segmentation package enables the modeling of patient-specific anatomies, which can then be used to simulate virtual interventional procedures, optimize emerging prosthetic devices, and predict clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Digital Twins serve as virtual counterparts, replicating the characteristics and functionalities of tangible objects, processes, or systems within the digital space, leveraging their capability to simulate and forecast real-world behavior. They have found valuable applications in smart farming, facilitating a comprehensive virtual replica of a farm that encompasses vital aspects such as crop cultivation, soil composition, and prevailing weather conditions. By amalgamating data from diverse sources, including soil, plants condition, environmental sensor networks, meteorological predictions, and high-resolution UAV and Satellite imagery, farmers gain access to dynamic and up-to-date visualization of their agricultural domains empowering them to make well-informed and timely choices concerning critical aspects like efficient irrigation plans, optimal fertilization methods, and effective pest management strategies, enhancing overall farm productivity and sustainability. This research paper aims to present a comprehensive overview of the contemporary state of research on digital twins in smart farming, including crop modelling, precision agriculture, and associated technologies, while exploring their potential applications and their impact on agricultural practices, addressing the challenges and limitations such as data privacy concerns, the need for high-quality data for accurate simulations and predictions, and the complexity of integrating multiple data sources. Lastly, the paper explores the prospects of digital twins in agriculture, highlighting potential avenues for future research and advancement in this domain.",

In health and medical care, they enable the real-time monitoring of patients, whereby large amounts of data can be collected to produce actionable information. These powerful tools are constructed with the aid of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning; the Internet of Things; and cloud computing to collect a diverse range of digital data (e.g., from digital patient journals, wearable sensors, and digitized monitoring equipment or processes), which can provide information on the health conditions and therapeutic responses of their physical twins. Intelligent digital twins can enable data-driven clinical decision making and advance the realization of personalized care. Migraines are a highly prevalent and complex neurological disorder affecting people of all ages, genders, and geographical locations. It is ranked among the top disabling diseases, with substantial negative personal and societal impacts, but the current treatment strategies are suboptimal. Personalized care for migraines has been suggested to optimize their treatment. The implementation of intelligent digital twins for migraine care can theoretically be beneficial in supporting patient-centric care management. It is also expected that the implementation of intelligent digital twins will reduce costs in the long run and enhance treatment effectiveness. This study briefly reviews the concept of digital twins and the available literature on digital twins for health disorders such as neurological diseases. Based on these, the potential construction and utility of digital twins for migraines will then be presented. The potential and challenges when implementing intelligent digital twins for the future management of migraines are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins are computer programs that use real-world data to create simulations that predict the performance of processes, products, and systems. Digital twins may integrate artificial intelligence to improve their outputs. Models for dealing with uncertainties and noise are used to improve the accuracy of digital twins. Most currently used systems aim to reduce noise to improve their outputs. Nevertheless, biological systems are characterized by inherent variability, which is necessary for their proper function. The constrained-disorder principle defines living systems as having a disorder as part of their existence and proper operation while kept within dynamic boundaries. In the present paper, we review the role of noise in complex systems and its use in bioengineering. We describe the use of digital twins for medical applications and current methods for dealing with noise and uncertainties in modeling. The paper presents methods to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of digital twin systems by continuously implementing variability signatures while simultaneously reducing unwanted noise in their inputs and outputs. Accounting for the noisy internal and external environments of complex biological systems is necessary for the future design of improved, more accurate digital twins.",

    "abstract": "Blood perfusion is a fundamental physiological property of all organs and is closely linked to brain metabolism. Genetic factors were reported to have important influences on cerebral blood flow. However, the profile of genetic contributions to cerebral blood flow in adolescents or young adults was underexplored. In this study, we recruited a sample of 65 pairs of same-sex adolescent or young adult twins undergoing resting arterial spin labeling imaging to conduct heritability analyses. Our findings indicate that genetic factors modestly affect cerebral blood flow in adolescents or young adults in the territories of left anterior cerebral artery and right posterior cerebral artery, with the primary contribution being to the frontal regions, cingulate gyrus, and striatum, suggesting a profile of genetic contributions to specific brain regions. Notably, the regions in the left hemisphere demonstrate the highest heritability in most regions examined. These results expand our knowledge of the genetic basis of cerebral blood flow in the developing brain and emphasize the importance of regional analysis in understanding the heritability of cerebral blood flow. Such insights may contribute to our understanding of the underlying genetic mechanism of brain functions and altered cerebral blood flow observed in youths with brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "Low birthweight (bw) and unfavorable intrauterine conditions have been associated with metabolic sequelae in later life, but little is known about their impact on glucocorticoid metabolism.\nWe studied monozygotic twins with intratwin bw differences to analyze the long-term impact of bw on glucocorticoid metabolism.\n46 monozygotic twin pairs with bw differences of <1 SDS (concordant; n = 29) and \u22651 SDS (discordant; n = 17) were recruited. At 6.9 years (mean age), saliva samples were collected (at 7 hours, 13 hours, 18 hours and 21 hour) and analyzed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\nWe found significant or highly significant intratwin correlations in all twin pairs at 3 of 4 (cortisol), and 4 of 4 (cortisone) time points. Graphic evaluation of the diurnal cortisol patterns for each twin pair showed a distinct alignment in all groups. Analyses of the change of intratwin differences over the day by mixed linear modeling showed no intratwin differences in diurnal patterns. Regression analyses of intratwin differences at 7:00 hours showed a significant influence of catch-up growth, indicating lower cortisol concentrations in smaller twins with more catch-up growth (adj. R2 = 0.159, P = .014, \u00df = -3.71, F(1,42) = 9.15, f2 = 0.19).\nIn monozygotic twins with intratwin bw differences, intratwin catch-up growth showed a moderate influence on intratwin differences in morning cortisol concentrations. We observed no differences regarding diurnal patterns. In contrast, in all groups, we found significant intratwin correlations for cortisol and cortisone over the day and a pronounced graphic alignment of cortisol diurnal patterns. We therefore suggest a predominant significance of the genetic background compared with bw differences on cortisol metabolism.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of nine-month-old twins who presented with bright green diarrhea along with progressively worsening jaundice over one week. On initial evaluation, they were found to have significantly elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels but without signs of liver failure. They were tested for multiple causes of liver injury including autoimmune and infectious etiologies, which were negative as well. Both twins were incidentally found to be positive for COVID-19 on testing per hospital protocol but did not have any respiratory symptoms. They were monitored closely during their hospital stay and showed clinical stability but with only slight improvement in abnormal lab levels. Ultimately, they were discharged with close outpatient follow-up. They demonstrated full resolution of all lab abnormalities and symptoms two months post discharge.",

    "abstract": "The modern maritime industry is producing data at an unprecedented rate. The capturing and processing of such data is integral to create added value for maritime companies and other maritime stakeholders, but their true potential can only be unlocked by innovative technologies such as extreme-scale analytics, AI, and digital twins, given that existing systems and traditional approaches are unable to effectively collect, store, and process big data. Such innovative systems are not only projected to effectively deal with maritime big data but to also create various tools that can assist maritime companies, in an evolving and complex environment that requires maritime vessels to increase their overall safety and performance and reduce their consumption and emissions. An integral challenge for developing these next-generation maritime applications lies in effectively combining and incorporating the aforementioned innovative technologies in an integrated system. Under this context, the current paper presents the architecture of VesselAI, an EU-funded project that aims to develop, validate, and demonstrate a novel holistic framework based on a combination of the state-of-the-art HPC, Big Data and AI technologies, capable of performing extreme-scale and distributed analytics for fuelling the next-generation digital twins in maritime applications and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Research on irregular stone masonry walls is hampered by the lack of detailed geometrical models of their internal micro-structure, i.e. the shape and size of each stone and its position within the wall. Without such a geometric digital twin of walls tested in the laboratory, it is difficult to evaluate the accuracy of existing numerical simulation techniques. Here, we describe the generation of geometrical digital twins of three irregular stone masonry walls built in the laboratory. We labelled each stone manually and then obtained the geometry of the individual stones using a portable laser scanning device. With the same device we scanned the wall after the construction of each layer. We then registered the position of each stone in the layer. This paper outlines the methodology for the data acquisition and digital reconstruction and presents the datasets for the walls. The developed geometrical digital twins provide unique information regarding the micro-structure of constructed walls that is key for the development and validation of numerical simulation techniques for stone masonry.",

    "abstract": "Health digital twins (HDTs) are virtual representations of real individuals that can be used to simulate human physiology, disease, and drug effects. HDTs can be used to improve drug discovery and development by providing a data-driven approach to inform target selection, drug delivery, and design of clinical trials. HDTs also offer new applications into precision therapies and clinical decision making. The deployment of HDTs at scale could bring a precision approach to public health monitoring and intervention. Next steps include challenges such as addressing socioeconomic barriers and ensuring the representativeness of the technology based on the training and validation data sets. Governance and regulation of HDT technology are still in the early stages.",

Both twins were females that presented at 3 years with low back swelling since birth, associated with bisphincteric dysfunction but normal motor and sensory functions in the lower extremities. They had repair of myelomeningocele 2 months after presentation and there was no new deficit postoperatively.There was no family history of neural tube defects and it would have been good to do genetic studies in this case but we do not have facilities for such.\nThis is the first reported case of identical twins with concurrent myelomeningocele and preserved motor functions in the lower limbs in Nigeria and West Africa.",

    "abstract": "Personal identification of monozygotic twins (MZT) has been challenging in forensic genetics. Previous research has demonstrated that microbial markers have potential value due to their specificity and long-term stability. However, those studies would use the complete information of detected microbial communities, and low-value species would limit the performance of previous models.\nTo address this issue, we collected 80 saliva samples from 10 pairs of MZTs at four different time points and used 16s rRNA V3-V4 region sequencing to obtain microbiota information. The data formed 280 inner-individual (Self) or MZT sample pairs, divided into four groups based on the individual relationship and time interval, and then randomly divided into training and testing sets with an 8:2 ratio. We built 12 identification models based on the time interval ( \u2264 1 year or \u2265 2 months), data basis (Amplicon sequence variants, ASVs or Operational taxonomic unit, OTUs), and distance parameter selection (Jaccard distance, Bray-Curist distance, or Hellinger distance) and then improved their identification power through genetic algorithm processes. The best combination of databases with distance parameters was selected as the final model for the two types of time intervals. Bayes theory was introduced to provide a numerical indicator of the evidence's effectiveness in practical cases.\nFrom the 80 saliva samples, 369 OTUs and 1130 ASVs were detected. After the feature selection process, ASV-Jaccard distance models were selected as the final models for the two types of time intervals. For short interval samples, the final model can completely distinguish MZT pairs from Self ones in both training and test sets.\nOur findings support the microbiota solution to the challenging MZT identification problem and highlight the importance of feature selection in improving model performance.",

    "abstract": "Low back pain (LBP) is the number one cause of disability world-wide. It is also the most expensive area in healthcare. Patient-centered innovations are needed. This paper uses medical storytelling to illustrate the common problems that often lead to unnecessary suffering for patients, and costs to society. We present innovative solutions, including narrative interventions.\nWe use medical storytelling to present a scenario in which hypothetical twin patients with identical LBP episodes enter the healthcare system, with one twin managed in an appropriate manner, and the other inappropriately.\nOne twin becomes a chronic LBP sufferer, while the other experiences quick resolution, despite identical conditions. Recommendations are made to de-implement inappropriate action and to implement a more productive approach.\nMany patients with LBP descend into chronic pain. This is rarely inevitable based on clinical factors. Much of chronic LBP results from how the condition is handled within the healthcare system. Medical narrative may be one innovation to illustrate the problem of current LBP management, recommend solutions and foster changes in clinical behavior.\nThe starkly different outcomes for each identical twin are illustrated. Recommendations are made for reframing the situation to de-implement the inappropriate and to implement a more appropriate approach.",

    "abstract": "Research suggests that postnatal catch-up growth after fetal growth restriction (FGR) occurs frequently. Yet, postnatal growth in singletons may be influenced by multiple factors. Identical twins with discordant prenatal growth, termed selective FGR (sFGR), can be regarded as a natural experiment eliminating these sources of bias.\nObservational cohort study.\nMonochorionic twins with sFGR born between 2002 and 2017 (aged 3-17 years) were eligible. Growth measurements (height, weight, head circumference, and body mass index) were performed at follow-up. Detailed growth curves documented by a systematic primary care system in the Netherlands were collected. Measurements were converted to standard deviation scores (SDSs). A mixed-effects model was used to assess within-pair SDS difference and individual height SDS relative to target height SDS.\nForty-seven twin pairs (94 children) were included at a median age of 11 (interquartile range 8-13) years. At the last measurement, smaller twins at birth had a lower height SDS [-0.6 vs -0.3, P < .001, median difference 0.5 (95%CI 0.4-0.7)], lower weight SDS [-0.5 vs -0.1, P < .001, median difference 0.8 (95%CI 0.5-1.0)], and lower head circumference SDS [-0.5 vs 0.2, P < .001, median difference 0.8 (95%CI 0.6-0.9)] compared to larger twins. These differences persisted until the age of 17. Smaller twins showed rapid catch-up growth in the first 2 years and reached their target height range between 8 and 11 years.\nIdentical twins with discordant prenatal growth maintain a modest but significant difference in height, weight, and head circumference, indicating a persistent, inhibitory effect of an adverse intrauterine environment on childhood growth.",

    "abstract": "The present review addresses the oocyte and the preimplantation embryo, and is intended to highlight the underlying principle of the \"nature versus/and nurture\" question. Given the diversity in mammalian oocyte maturation, this review will not be comprehensive but instead will focus on the porcine oocyte. Historically, oogenesis was seen as the development of a passive cell nursed and determined by its somatic compartment. Currently, the advanced analysis of the cross-talk between the maternal environment and the oocyte shows a more balanced relationship: Granulosa cells nurse the oocyte, whereas the latter secretes diffusible factors that regulate proliferation and differentiation of the granulosa cells. Signal molecules of the granulosa cells either prevent the precocious initiation of meiotic maturation or enable oocyte maturation following hormonal stimulation. A similar question emerges in research on monozygotic twins or multiples: In Greek and medieval times, twins were not seen as the result of the common course of nature but were classified as faults. This seems still valid today for the rare and until now mainly unknown genesis of facultative monozygotic twins in mammals. Monozygotic twins are unique subjects for studies of the conceptus-maternal dialogue, the intra-pair similarity and dissimilarity, and the elucidation of the interplay between nature and nurture. In the course of in vivo collections of preimplantation sheep embryos and experiments on embryo splitting and other microsurgical interventions we recorded observations on double blastocysts within a single zona pellucida, double inner cell masses in zona-enclosed blastocysts and double germinal discs in elongating embryos. On the basis of these observations we add some pieces to the puzzle of the post-zygotic genesis of monozygotic twins and on maternal influences on the developing conceptus.",

    "abstract": "DICER1\u00a0syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome resulting in benign and malignant tumors in various organs with tumors\u00a0in endocrine organs (pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, ovaries, and pancreas). Here we present a rare case of 18-year-old twin sisters with DICER1 syndrome who presented at the age\u00a0of 15 years with hirsutism, deepening of the voice, and amenorrhea. They were diagnosed with a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor of the ovary and underwent unilateral\u00a0oophorectomy, with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis during follow-up. Genetic analysis showed the same germline DICER1 mutation in both cases. They also had large multinodular goiters (nodule size ranging from 1.0 to 2.3 cm) nodules were increasing in size. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of thyroid nodules for both the sisters showed atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS), and they both underwent total thyroidectomy revealing papillary thyroid carcinoma. No pituitary lesion was observed in the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of either of them. A chest CT scan\u00a0showed bilateral sub-pleural benign-looking nodules in both patients. The twin sisters developed some features, such as Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, multinodular goiter, and papillary thyroid carcinoma, and had positive genetic tests for DICER1 germline mutation. The father and paternal grandfather had a family history of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Both patients\u00a0require active surveillance due to the\u00a0increased risk of developing tumors in multiple\u00a0organs associated with this disease.",

    "abstract": "A digital twin is a computer-based \"virtual\" representation of a complex system, updated using data from the \"real\" twin. Digital twins are established in product manufacturing, aviation, and infrastructure and are attracting significant attention in medicine. In medicine, digital twins hold great promise to improve prevention of cardiovascular diseases and enable personalised health care through a range of Internet of Things (IoT) devices which collect patient data in real-time. However, the promise of such new technology is often met with many technical, scientific, social, and ethical challenges that need to be overcome-if these challenges are not met, the technology is therefore less likely on balance to be adopted by stakeholders. The purpose of this work is to identify the facilitators and barriers to the implementation of digital twins in cardiovascular medicine. Using, the Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework, we conducted a document analysis of policy reports, industry websites, online magazines, and academic publications on digital twins in cardiovascular medicine, identifying potential facilitators and barriers to adoption. Our results show key facilitating factors for implementation: preventing cardiovascular disease, in silico simulation and experimentation, and personalised care. Key barriers to implementation included: establishing real-time data exchange, perceived specialist skills required, high demand for patient data, and ethical risks related to privacy and surveillance. Furthermore, the lack of empirical research on the attributes of digital twins by different research groups, the characteristics and behaviour of adopters, and the nature and extent of social, regulatory, economic, and political contexts in the planning and development process of these technologies is perceived as a major hindering factor to future implementation.",

    "abstract": "The first case of virtual polymerization based on the concept of digital twins (DTs) is presented. The free-radical polymerization of vinyl monomers is considered to be a chain reaction consisting of a set of elementary ones. Those three types, related to the polymerization initiation and propagation as well as to the termination of polymer chain growth, are discussed. Special sets of DTs, whose total number approaches 60, distinguish each reaction type. The calculations are carried out using a semi-empirical version of the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation. The main energy and spin-density parameters of the ground state of the DTs are determined. The barrier profiles of two pairs of DTs are calculated, based on which two Evans-Polanyi-Semenov relations, attributed to elementary reactions of type (1) and (2), are constructed. These provide a quite reliable evaluation of the activation energy for the initiation and propagation of the free-radical polymerization of vinyl monomers in all the cases. The decisive role of spins in the formation of the elementary reaction transition states is established.",

    "abstract": "Twin-twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) represents a significant complication in monochorionic twin pregnancies, caused by an unbalanced shunting of blood through intertwin placental vascular anastomoses. Despite advances in fetoscopic laser surgery, TTTS is still associated with a high rate of cerebral injury. However, there are no studies comparing these pregnancies with uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies, establishing the baseline risk of neurodevelopmental impairment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the odds of neurodevelopmental impairment in MCDA twins who undergo fetoscopic laser surgery for twin-twin transfusion syndrome, in comparison to a cohort of uncomplicated MCDA twin pregnancies.\nThis is a retrospective cohort study of children born from MCDA twin pregnancies at a single center between 2008 and 2019. A routine, standardized follow-up assessment was conducted at a minimum of 2 years after delivery. The primary outcome of this was a 2 year neurodevelopmental impairment. Neurological, motor, and cognitive development was assessed by using the revised Brunet-L\u00e9zine scale.\n176 children met the enrolment criteria. Of these, 42 (24%; TTTS group) underwent fetoscopic laser surgery for TTTS during pregnancy, and 134 (76%; uncomplicated MCDA group) were uncomplicated MCDA pregnancies. The primary outcome was found in four children (9.52%) in the TTTS group and ten children (7.46%) in the uncomplicated MCDA group (\nThe outcome in MCDA twins who underwent fetoscopic laser surgery for TTTS is comparable to the outcome in uncomplicated MCDA twins. Our findings emphasize the need for long-term neurodevelopmental follow-ups in all children from monochorionic twin gestations.",

    "abstract": "Fetal growth restriction (FGR) in dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twin gestations is a known complication associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. The international guidelines have no consensus on whether to use singleton or twin-specific growth charts. Thus, we aimed to compare growth charts in correlation with pregnancy outcomes and placental histopathology.\nThe medical files of all DCDA twin deliveries between 2010 and 2020 were reviewed. Birthweight percentile for gestational age (GA) for each individual neonate was assigned using the updated local singleton and twin-specific growth chart. We then divided the study population into two groups, neonates that were FGR based on the local singleton charts (FGR-singleton group) versus FGR on both twin-specific and singleton charts (FGR-twin group). Placental lesions were classified as lesions related to maternal or fetal malperfusion lesions (MVM, FVM), vascular and villous changes, and inflammatory lesions.\nOverall, 185 neonates met the inclusion criteria. The FGR-twin group (59/185) had a higher rate of PE, lower GA at delivery, lower birthweight, and a higher rate of neonatal composite adverse outcomes compared to the FGR-singleton group. Moreover, placental pathology of the FGR-twin group demonstrated a higher rate of MVM lesions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035).\nIn our cohort, neonates considered FGR based on twin-specific charts had worse neonatal outcomes with underlying placental insufficiency demonstrated by a higher rate of placental malperfusion vascular lesions. Our findings support using a twin-specific chart to diagnose FGR that is more clinically relevant.",

    "abstract": "Psychotic-like experiences (PLE) have been associated with the subsequent emergence of psychotic disorders as well as several other domains of psychopathology. In this twin study, we estimated the genetic and environmental correlations between PLE and 10 personality disorders (PD).\nDiagnoses of 10 PDs according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and PLE from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) were retrieved for 2793 young adult twins from the Norwegian Twin Registry. Risk for having a PD and PLEs was modeled using item response theory. Biometric twin models were fitted to estimate the genetic and environmental correlations between PDs and PLEs. Co-twin control analysis was performed to estimate additional within-family risk for PLEs when having a PD.\nPhenotypic overlap between PDs and PLEs ranged from 14% to 44% in males and from 11% to 39% in females, with the highest overlap for borderline PD in both sexes. In general, we found higher genetic correlations (r\u2009=\u20090.14-0.72) than environmental correlations (r\u2009=\u20090.06-0.28) between PDs and PLEs. The highest genetic correlations between PLE and PDs were found for borderline (r\u2009=\u20090.72), paranoid (r\u2009=\u20090.56), schizotypal (r\u2009=\u20090.56) and antisocial PD (r\u2009=\u20090.49).\nWe found that the co-occurrence between PDs and PLE is the best explained by shared genetic determinants, with minor contributions from environmental factors. Interestingly, borderline PD was highly genetically correlated with PLE, warranting molecular genetic studies of this association.",

    "abstract": "To characterize fetal growth in dichorionic twins using individualized growth assessment (IGA), a method based on individual growth potential estimates.\nThis secondary analysis included 286 fetuses/neonates from 143 dichorionic twin pregnancies that were part of the ESPRiT (Evaluation of Sonographic Predictors of Restricted Growth in Twins) study. The sample was subcategorized according to birth weight into appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) (n\u2009=\u2009243) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (n\u2009=\u200943) cohorts. Serial biometric scans evaluating biparietal diameter, head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference, femur diaphysis length and estimated weight at 2-week intervals were used to evaluate fetal growth, while measurements of birth weight, crown-heel length and HC determined neonatal growth outcome. Six abnormalities (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, respiratory distress, sepsis and death) constituted the evaluated adverse neonatal outcomes (ANO). IGA was used to: evaluate differences in second-trimester growth velocities between singletons (from a published dataset) and dichorionic twins (138 AGA twins with normal third-trimester growth); describe the degree to which actual third-trimester growth in twins followed expected growth (111 AGA twins, normal fetal growth and neonatal growth outcomes); determine if the fetal growth pathology score 1 (-FGPS1) could detect, quantify and classify twin growth pathology (224 AGA, 42 SGA); and assess the relationship between -FGPS1 and ANO (24 SGA twins with progressive growth restriction confirmed by abnormal neonatal growth outcome).\nThe differences in second-trimester growth velocity between singletons and twins (means and variances) were small and not statistically significant. Percent deviations from the expected third-trimester size trajectories were within the 95% reference ranges derived from singletons at 95.7% (1677/1752) of timepoints studied. Abnormal growth was detected in 37.9% of AGA twins and 85.7% of SGA twins. Growth restriction was more heterogeneous in AGA twins, while in SGA twins progressive growth restriction was the principal type (66.7%). -FGPS1 patterns previously defined in singletons classified 97.5% of pathological twin cases. In our most severe form of growth restriction (progressive), there were only three (12.5%) ANOs related to growth abnormalities, all in cases with -FGPS1 values more negative than -2.0%. Using these criteria, the frequency of ANO was 33%.\nWith respect to growth, dichorionic twins can be considered as two singletons in the same uterus. Normally growing dichorionic twins have the same growth potential as singletons with normal growth outcome. These twins also follow expected third-trimester growth trajectories with the same precision as do singletons. Third-trimester growth pathology can be detected, quantified and classified using -FGPS1 as in singletons. Limited evidence of a relationship between fetal growth abnormalities and adverse neonatal outcome was found. \u00a9 2023 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.",

    "abstract": "Crown-rump length discordance, defined as \u226510% discordance, has been investigated as an early sonographic marker of subsequent growth abnormalities and is associated with an increased risk of fetal loss in twin pregnancies. Previous studies have not investigated the prevalence of fetal aneuploidy or structural anomalies in twins with discordance or the independent association of crown-rump length discordance with adverse perinatal outcomes. Moreover, data are limited on cell-free DNA screening for aneuploidy in dichorionic twins with discordance.\nThis study aimed to evaluate whether crown-rump length discordance in dichorionic twins between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation is associated with a higher risk of aneuploidy, structural anomalies, or adverse perinatal outcomes and to assess the performance of cell-free DNA screening in dichorionic twin pregnancies with crown-rump length discordance.\nThis was a secondary analysis of a multicenter retrospective cohort study that evaluated the performance of cell-free DNA screening for the common trisomies in twin pregnancies from December 2011 to February 2020. For this secondary analysis, we included live dichorionic pregnancies with crown-rump length measurements between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation. First, we compared twin pregnancies with discordant crown-rump lengths with twin pregnancies with concordant crown-rump lengths and analyzed the prevalence of aneuploidy and fetal structural anomalies in either twin. Second, we compared the prevalence of a composite adverse perinatal outcome, which included preterm birth at <34 weeks of gestation, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, stillbirth or miscarriage, small-for-gestational-age birthweight, and birthweight discordance. Moreover, we assessed the performance of cell-free DNA screening in pregnancies with and without crown-rump length discordance. Outcomes were compared with multivariable regression to adjust for confounders.\nOf 987 dichorionic twins, 142 (14%) had crown-rump length discordance. The prevalence of aneuploidy was higher in twins with crown-rump length discordance than in twins with concordance (9.9% vs 3.9%, respectively; adjusted relative risk, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.9). Similarly, structural anomalies (adjusted relative risk, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.4]) and composite adverse perinatal outcomes (adjusted relative risk, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.3) were significantly higher in twins with discordance. A stratified analysis demonstrated that even without other ultrasound markers, there were increased risks of aneuploidy (adjusted relative risk, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-8.4) and structural anomalies (adjusted relative risk, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-4.8) in twins with CRL discordance. Cell-free DNA screening had high negative predictive values for trisomy 21, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13, regardless of crown-rump length discordance, with 1 false-negative for trisomy 21 in a twin pregnancy with discordance.\nCrown-rump length discordance in dichorionic twins is associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy, structural anomalies, and adverse perinatal outcomes, even without other sonographic abnormalities. Cell-free DNA screening demonstrated high sensitivity and negative predictive values irrespective of crown-rump length discordance; however, 1 false-negative result illustrated that there is a role for diagnostic testing. These data may prove useful in identifying twin pregnancies that may benefit from increased screening and surveillance and are not ascertained by other early sonographic markers.",

Each participant had to fill out a web-based questionnaire which comprised 23 questions (Google Forms). The data were collated and the oral health/hygiene habits of MZ and DZ twins were compared.\nNo significant differences were detected between MZ and DZ twins with regards to their daily tooth-cleaning habits or the tooth-cleaning products used by the 2 groups. For instance, when asked how often they clean their teeth, 80% of MZ twins and 71% of DZ twins responded similarly. Further, both groups provided similar responses when questioned about the use of fluoride toothpaste, frequency of dental visits, and dental counselling received as well as a number of other parameters such as snacking of sweets and fear of visiting dentists.\nOur pilot analysis of the questionnaire responses from MZ and DZ twins in Hungary did not indicate any significant differences in their oral care habits in general. Further studies with a large cohort are required to confirm or refute our findings.",

    "abstract": "A subset of spondyloarthritis (SpA) called 'reactive arthritis' is triggered by causal pathogens, usually bacteria related to venereal disease or gastrointestinal infection. During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there have been case reports about SpA after COVID-19, but the causality is still elusive. We described cases of 23-year-old monozygotic twins both diagnosed with SpA after COVID-19. The probable linkage between SpA and COVID-19 was elaborated with our cases as well as literature reviews. Of note, shared genetic traits by monozygotic twins, particularly HLA-B27 positivity, might have contributed to their susceptibility to COVID-19-induced SpA. Moreover, single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed that the transcriptomic profile of peripheral compartment of SpA after COVID-19 was distinctive from that of typical radiographic axial SpA as shown by differential expression of ribosomal protein S26 (RPS26) and small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) in nearly all subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twin is an extremely rare condition and requires a thorough knowledge of anatomy, and a multidisciplinary approach is essential to successfully separate the twins. Thoracopagus twins lie face to face and are attached from chest to upper abdomen. They are the most common among all the varieties but have a poor survival rate.\nThis study is a review of literature from 2019 to the oldest via PubMed and Google Scholar using keywords: Conjoined twins, Thoracopagus twins, Thoracoomphalopagus and Thoraco-omphalopagus twins. The articles were reviewed for the description of the anatomy of shared organs, management and outcome of these twins.\nOne hundred and fifty-eight sets of thoracopagus and thoraco-omphalopagus twins including our twins were included in this study. Out of 158 reported thoracopagus twin sets in literature, with M: F ratio of 1:2.3, 71 sets were found to be non-operable and all of them subsequently expired; 82 sets were operated upon, out of which 83 babies survived, suggesting an overall surgical success rate of about 50%.\nThoracopagus twins have a dismal prognosis. The most important decisive parameter for successful separation is the extent of sharing of organs between twins. The role of a motivated multidisciplinary team is also indispensable and cannot be overemphasised.",

    "abstract": "Elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels can increase morbidity and mortality even when it is below the diagnostic threshold of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to detect DNA methylation (DNAm) variants potentially related to FPG in Chinese monozygotic twins.\nGenome-wide DNA methylation profiling in whole blood of twins was performed using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), yielding 551,447 raw CpGs. Association between DNAm of single CpG and FPG was tested using a generalized estimation equation. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using comb-P approach. ICE FALCON method was utilized to perform the causal inference. Candidate CpGs were quantified and validated using Sequenom MassARRAY platform in a community population. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted using gene expression data from twins.\nThe mean age of 52 twin pairs was 52\u00a0years (SD: 7). The relationship between DNAm of 142 CpGs and FPG reached the genome-wide significance level. Thirty-two DMRs within 24 genes were identified, including TLCD1, MRPS31P5, CASZ1, and CXADRP3. The causal relationship of top CpGs mapped to TLCD1, MZF1, PTPRN2, SLC6A18, ASTN2, IQCA1, GRIN1, and PDE2A genes with FPG were further identified using ICE FALCON method. Pathways potentially related to FPG were also identified, such as phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase activity and mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 binding. Three CpGs mapped to SLC6A18 gene were validated in a community population, with a hypermethylated direction in diabetic patients. The expression levels of 18 genes (including SLC6A18 and TLCD1) were positively correlated with FPG levels.\nWe detect many DNAm variants that may be associated with FPG in whole blood, particularly the loci within SLC6A18 gene. Our findings provide important reference for the epigenetic regulation of elevated FPG levels and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "When considering the vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP) family, major receptors at the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it appears that VAP-A and VAP-B paralogs largely overlap in structure and function, and that specific features to distinguish these two proteins hardly exist or are poorly documented. Here, we question the degree of redundancy between VAP-A and VAP-B: is one simply a backup plan, in case of loss of function of one of the two genes, or are there molecular and functional divergences that would explain their maintenance during evolution?",

    "abstract": "The first observation in the world literature of the development of subglottic cysts in the larynx in monochorionic monoamniotic twins is presented. The girls were born prematurely at 34 weeks of gestation, from the first day of life for 7 and 8 days, respectively, were transferred to mechanical ventilation. At the fourth month of life, symptoms of laryngeal stenosis appeared and began to gradually progress, conservative therapy had no effect. The diagnosis of subglottic cysts was established on the basis of fibrolaryngoscopy; after endolaryngeal surgery, breathing returned to normal. This case demonstrates the importance of timely endoscopic examination of the respiratory tract in children with stridor.\n\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0432 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0443 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0431\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043e\u0432. \u0414\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e? \u043d\u0430 34-\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438, \u0441 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 7 \u0441\u0443\u0442 \u0438 8 \u0441\u0443\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u0418\u0412\u041b. \u041d\u0430 4-\u043c \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0435 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0442\u043e\u043c\u044b \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u044f \u044d\u0444\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430. \u0414\u0438\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0437 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0444\u0438\u0431\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u044d\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442 \u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c. \u041a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044d\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0443 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c.",

We examined associations between 23 early life characteristics with handedness in a large sample of 37,495 5-year-old twins. We considered three definitions of handedness: left-handedness (LH), mixed-handedness (MH), and non-right-handedness (NRH). Our main aim was to test whether the associations with sex, birth weight, gestational age, and season of birth - as reported in singletons - replicate in twins, and to examine twin-specific variables, including zygosity, chorionicity, birth order, and intertwin delivery time. Compared to previously published data from adults born as singletons (7.23%), the prevalence of NRH was higher in both twins (16.19%) and their parents (15.09%). In the twins, LH and NRH were associated with parents' LH. Male sex and lower gestational age were associated with NRH, and LH was associated with not being breastfed. MH was related to neurodevelopmental delays and higher externalizing problems later in childhood. Other previously reported associations were not replicated, and no twin-specific characteristics were related to handedness. These results emphasize the importance of considering multiple definitions of handedness and indicate a small number of replicated associations across studies.",

    "abstract": "We assess the relative and joint contributions of genetic and environmental factors on health during childhood and assume that parental resources are part of the environmental factors shaping children's health. We discuss theoretical background and empirical evidence concerning the effects of parental resources and heritability on children's health. Based on these findings we formulate six hypotheses guiding our empirical analysis, using data from TwinLife, a nationally representative sample of same sex twin pairs in Germany. We analyze self-rated health of 1,584 twin pairs aged 4-18. We did find strong support for the idea that parental resources influence children's health: household income and fathers' education consistently show positive effects. In contrast to our expectation, we did not find that genetic factors influence the health of well-off children less than the health of children living in families with lower SES. We also did not find that the genetic influence on health increases during childhood and adolescence. On the contrary our results indicate that the role played by genetic factors diminishes whereas environmental factors gain importance for health of children while growing up. This finding is good news for those interested in improving health chances of children from lower SES backgrounds because it demonstrates the malleability of children's health.",

    "abstract": "All patients with twin pregnancy should have first trimester ultrasound and be offered screening for chromosomal aneuploidy as well as diagnostic testing. Screening for aneuploidy in twins presents unique challenges compared with singletons. Cell-free DNA screening should be considered first-line; however, this option may not be available or may have limitations in certain clinical scenarios, such as vanishing twins. If cell-free DNA screening is not available, maternal serum marker screening in conjunction with nuchal translucency assessment should be offered. Patients with positive aneuploidy screening tests or fetal structural abnormalities should be offered diagnostic testing.",

    "abstract": "Robot swarms are becoming popular in domains that require spatial coordination. Effective human control over swarm members is pivotal for ensuring swarm behaviours align with the dynamic needs of the system. Several techniques have been proposed for scalable human-swarm interaction. However, these techniques were mostly developed in simple simulation environments without guidance on how to scale them up to the real world. This paper addresses this research gap by proposing a metaverse for scalable control of robot swarms and an adaptive framework for different levels of autonomy. In the metaverse, the physical/real world of a swarm symbiotically blends with a virtual world formed from digital twins representing each swarm member and logical control agents. The proposed metaverse drastically decreases swarm control complexity due to human reliance on only a few virtual agents, with each agent dynamically actuating on a sub-swarm. The utility of the metaverse is demonstrated by a case study where humans controlled a swarm of uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) using gestural communication, and via a single virtual uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV). The results show that humans could successfully control the swarm under two different levels of autonomy, while task performance increases as autonomy increases.",

We characterized protein-BMI trajectory associations in adolescents and adults and how these connect to other omics layers.\nOur study included two cohorts of longitudinally followed twins: FinnTwin12 (\nWe identified 66 and 14 proteins associated with BMI at blood sampling and changes in BMI, respectively. The average heritability of these proteins was 35%. Of the 66 BMI-protein associations, 43 and 12 showed genetic and environmental correlations, respectively, including 8 proteins showing both. Similarly, we observed 6 and 4 genetic and environmental correlations between changes in BMI and protein abundance, respectively. \nAssociations between the proteome and BMI trajectories are characterized by shared genetic, environmental, and metabolic etiologies. We observed few gene-protein pairs associated with BMI or changes in BMI at the proteome and transcriptome levels.",

    "abstract": "To assess soft tissue differences between monozygotic twins (MZ) for the total face and between facial regions using three-dimensional (3D) stereophotogrammetry and quantitative surface-based 3D deviation analyses.\nThe study sample consisted of 14 untreated MZ twins (6 males, 8 females, mean age: 14.75 years) from the archive of Marmara University, Department of Orthodontics. The images were taken by the 3dMDface system, and 3dMDvultus software was used for removal of undesired areas and approximation of the images. Then, stereolithography (.stl) format images were superimposed using the best-fit algorithm using 3-matic software. The face was divided into facial thirds, and upper lip and lower lip + chin regions were created. For the comparison, 3D deviation analyses were performed, and a color map and histogram were created. The data were presented as mean deviation, root mean square (RMS), median, and interquartile range.\nBetween the facial thirds, there was no significant difference in soft tissue differences for mean deviation. A statistically significant difference was found between the upper and lower face for the RMS value. For the comparison of upper lip and lower lip + chin region, the only significant difference was for the RMS. When the data were presented as median and interquartile range, there were no statistically significant differences between any facial regions.\nLower facial third and lower lip + chin regions had the greatest differences within MZ twin pairs. The genetic and environmental influences might not be the same for different parts of the face.",

    "abstract": "Twins' memoirs and autobiographies both enlighten and entertain. These works, often overlooked by researchers, may suggest new avenues for investigation, such as nonshared environmental events that propel twins in different directions. Of course, MZ twins' generally parallel experiences and DZ twins generally criss-crossing paths are the bases of fascinating life stories. The following sections examined recent research on fetal reduction in twin pregnancy, twins' personality and military service, growth restriction in twins, and advances in conjoined twin separation. This article closes with reports of a scientist who performed gene editing on twins, a twin conception from 33-year-old embryos, twins' physical outcomes from dietary differences, fraternal twins with the world's largest height difference and the Twin Home Experts who conquer rat infestation in New York.",

Confirmatory testing performed postpartum included short tandem repeat analysis determining monozygosity and pathology examination reporting DC placental configuration.\nDichorionic monozygotic twins are thought to arise from the splitting of an embryo before the blastocyst stage. This case suggests that placental configuration of monozygotic twins may not strictly depend on timing of embryo division. Genetic analysis is the only tool to confirm the zygosity.",

Treating ARVC remains challenging due to the complex underlying arrhythmogenic mechanisms, which involve structural and electrophysiological (EP) remodeling. Here, we developed a novel genotype-specific heart digital twin (Geno-DT) approach to investigate the role of pathophysiological remodeling in sustaining VT reentrant circuits and to predict the VT circuits in ARVC patients of different genotypes. This approach integrates the patient's disease-induced structural remodeling reconstructed from contrast-enhanced magnetic-resonance imaging and genotype-specific cellular EP properties.

    "abstract": "Digital twins were initially introduced in the aerospace industry, but they have been applied to the medical field in the 2020s. The development of the Internet of Things, sensor technology, cloud computing, big data analysis, and simulation technology has made this idea feasible. Essentially, digital twins are virtual representations of real-world data that can generate virtual outcomes related to a patient based on their actual data. With this technology, doctors can predict treatment outcomes, plan surgery, and monitor patients' medical conditions in real time. While digital twins have endless potential, challenges include the need to deal with vast amounts of data and ensure the security of personal information. In the field of rhinology, which deals with complex anatomy from the sinus to the skull base, the adoption of digital twins is just beginning. Digital twins have begun to be incorporated into surgical navigation and the management of chronic diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite the limitless potential of digital twins, challenges related to dealing with vast amounts of data and enhancing the security of personal data need to be surmounted for this method to be more widely applied.",

    "abstract": "Little is currently known about epigenetic alterations associated with body composition in obesity. Thus, we aimed to explore epigenetic relationships between genome-wide DNA methylation levels and three common traits of body composition as measured by body fat percentage (BF%), fat mass (FM) and lean body mass (LBM) among Chinese monozygotic twins.\nGeneralized estimated equation model was used to regress the methylation level of CpG sites on body composition. Inference about Causation Through Examination Of Familial Confounding was used to explore the evidence of a causal relationship. Gene expression analysis was further performed to validate the results of differentially methylated genes.\nWe identified 32, 22 and 28 differentially methylated CpG sites (p\u2009<\u200910\nThese DNA methylation signatures will contribute to increased knowledge about the epigenetic basis of body composition and provide new strategies for early prevention and treatment of obesity and its related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Distortion of dentition may occur in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans due to artifacts, and further imaging is frequently required to produce digital twins. The use of a plaster model is common; however, it has certain drawbacks. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of different digital dentition models over that of plaster casts. Plaster models, alginate impressions, intraoral scan (IOS) images, and CBCT images of 20 patients were obtained. The desktop model scanner was used to scan the alginate impression twice, five minutes and two hours after impression-making. Using an IOS, the full arch was scanned in segments using CS 3600 and simultaneously with i700\u00a0wireless. The digital twins obtained from the alginate impression and IOS were superimposed with those obtained from the plaster cast. The differences and distances at each reference point were measured. Scans of alginate impressions after two hours showed the greatest discrepancies, but these were all less than the CBCT voxel size of 0.39\u00a0mm. Alginate impression scans and IOS are suitable supplements to CBCT compared to the plaster model. Accuracy can be improved by scanning the alginate impression within five minutes or by intraoral scanning of the entire arch with segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Low birth weight is associated with an increased likelihood of neurodivergence and neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability. However, it is unclear whether birth weight contributes independently to NDCs or whether the association is predominantly driven by genetic predisposition.\nTo estimate the associations between birth weight and dimensional (trait) and categorical (diagnoses) NDC outcomes, while adjusting for genetic risks.\nA co-twin design was applied to this case-control study conducted in Sweden. Diagnostic assessments were conducted between August 2011 and March 2022, within the Roots of Autism and ADHD Twin Study in Sweden (RATSS) during a 2.5-day participant visit to the clinic. The RATSS sample comprised phenotyped monozygotic and dizygotic twins enriched for NDCs. Data analysis was conducted in November 2022.\nBirth weight.\nCategorical and dimensional operationalizations of autism, ADHD, and intellectual disability were assessed. Generalized estimating equation models were fitted across and within twin pairs.\nThe study sample included 393 twins: 230 were monozygotic and 159 were dizygotic (zygosity was unknown for 4). Their median age was 15 (range, 8-37) years. There were 185 female participants (47.1%) and 208 male participants (52.9%). Across twin pairs, higher birth weight was associated with fewer autistic traits (unstandardized \u03b2 [B],\u2009-5.51 [95% CI, -10.09 to -0.94]) and lower odds of autism diagnosis (OR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88]) and intellectual disability (OR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.19 to 0.92]). Within pairs, the association between birth weight and dimensional autism (B, -17.35 [95% CI, -28.66 to -6.04]) and categorical autism (OR, 0.02 [95% CI, 0.001 to 0.42]) remained among monozygotic pairs but not dizygotic pairs. In addition, higher birth weight was associated with lower odds of ADHD diagnosis (OR, 0.003 [95% CI, 0 to 0.70]), fewer ADHD traits (B, -0.25 [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.11]), and higher IQ ratings (B, 7.43 [95% CI, 1.05 to 13.82]) among monozygotic twins.\nThe findings of this co-twin study suggest an association between low birth weight and NDCs, but they also acknowledge the importance of genetics because the associations observed were only statically significant among monozygotic twins. It is of pivotal importance to facilitate early identification of factors contributing to fetal growth restriction to minimize detrimental outcomes.",

    "results": "The study sample included 393 twins: 230 were monozygotic and 159 were dizygotic (zygosity was unknown for 4). Their median age was 15 (range, 8-37) years. There were 185 female participants (47.1%) and 208 male participants (52.9%). Across twin pairs, higher birth weight was associated with fewer autistic traits (unstandardized \u03b2 [B],\u2009-5.51 [95% CI, -10.09 to -0.94]) and lower odds of autism diagnosis (OR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88]) and intellectual disability (OR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.19 to 0.92]). Within pairs, the association between birth weight and dimensional autism (B, -17.35 [95% CI, -28.66 to -6.04]) and categorical autism (OR, 0.02 [95% CI, 0.001 to 0.42]) remained among monozygotic pairs but not dizygotic pairs. In addition, higher birth weight was associated with lower odds of ADHD diagnosis (OR, 0.003 [95% CI, 0 to 0.70]), fewer ADHD traits (B, -0.25 [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.11]), and higher IQ ratings (B, 7.43 [95% CI, 1.05 to 13.82]) among monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Acne vulgaris, a common dermatological condition that affects most adolescents and young adults, can indicate an underlying pathology if present prematurely in mid-childhood. Premature acne can be caused by premature adrenarche secondary to non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NC-CAH), a condition arising from 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This report describes a pair of monozygotic twin brothers with identical premature onset of acne, who were found to have an identical homozygous mutation in the promoter region of the CYP21A2 gene. While it is widely known that NCCAH is associated with genetic changes, the drive behind onset of adrenarche are widely unknown. As such, this report provokes thoughts on whether adrenarche could be influenced by adrenal genetic polymorphisms.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the feasibility of incorporating clinical decision support (CDS) into health digital twins (HDTs). A HDT is visualized in a web application, health data are stored in a FHIR-based electronic health record, and an Arden-Syntax-based CDS interpretation and alert service is connected. The prototype focuses on interoperability of these components. The study confirms the feasibility of CDS integration into HDTs and provides insight into possibilities for further expansion.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate transitions to and from sickness absence, or disability pension among individuals with back, neck, or shoulder pain and/or with common mental disorders (CMDs), and the role of familial (genetics and shared environment) influences on the transitions. Swedish twins born 1935-1985 who responded to pain and CMDs survey items (N\u2009=\u200941,516) were followed on average 8.7\u00a0years for sickness absence states in national registers. Multi-state Cox regression models were applied for three exposure groups: pain, CMDs, and presence of both, compared to unexposed. Exposure discordant twin pairs, stratified by zygosity, were analysed to assess the role of familial factors. Hazard Ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals and transition intensities were calculated. HRs were similar for transitions between states among those with pain or CMDs. The highest HRs were for transitions from entry to sickness absence and sickness absence to disability pension among those with both pain and CMDs (HRs: 1.61 and 1.43, respectively). Higher HRs for dizygotic compared to monozygotic twins for the first transition to sickness absence and for altering back to not being sickness absent indicate familial confounding. Back, neck, or shoulder pain and/or CMDs indicate a higher risk to become sickness absent and for repeated sickness absence episodes over time compared to unaffected.",

    "abstract": "What are the major sources of worldwide variability in subjective well-being (SWB)? Twin and family studies of SWB have found substantial heritability and strong effects from unique environments but virtually no effects from shared environments. However, extant findings are not necessarily valid at the global level. Prior studies have examined within-countries variability but did not take into account mean differences across nations. In this article, we aim to estimate the effects of genetic factors, individual environmental exposures, and shared environments for the global population. We combine a set of knowns from national well-being studies (means and standard deviations) and behavioral-genetic studies (heritability) to model a scenario of twin studies across 157 countries. For each country, we simulate data for a set of twin pairs and pool the data into a global sample. We find a worldwide heritability of 31% to 32% for SWB. Individual environmental factors explain 46% to 52% of the variance (including measurement error), and shared environments account for 16% to 23% of the global variance in SWB. Worldwide, well-being is somewhat less heritable than within nations. In contrast to previous within-countries studies, we find a notable effect of shared environments. This effect is not limited to within families but operates at a national level.",

Therefore, this study seeks to determine how a new treatment (also known as twins therapy, TT) for stroke patients can improve an existing problem associated with neglect. (2) Method: A pre/post-test control group research design was used and both groups continued to receive existing rehabilitation treatment, whilst TT intervention was only added to the experimental group. TT intervention was conducted for a total of 20 sessions (1 session for 30 min/day, 5 days/week, for 4 weeks).

    "abstract": "In this preliminary study, the underlying pathophysiology mechanisms of cerebral aneurysms (CAs) in monozygotic twins (MTs) were investigated via a rare pair of MTs (twin A and twin B) involving four reconstructed arterial models using preclinical information. First, dimensions and configurated outlines of three-perspective geometries were compared. Adopting an in-vitro validated numerical CA model, hemodynamic characteristics were investigated in the MTs, respectively. Despite expected genetic similarities, morphological comparisons show that configurations of cerebral arteries exhibit significant differences between the twins. The ICA size of twin A is larger than that in twin B (2.23~25.86%), varying with specific locations, attributing to variations during embryological developments and environmental influences. Numerical modeling indicates the MTs have some hemodynamic similarities such as pressure distributions (~13,400 Pa) and their oscillatory shear index (OSI) (0~0.49), but present significant differences in local regions. Specifically, the difference in blood flow rate in the MTs is from 16% to 221%, varying with specifically compared arteries. The maximum time-averaged wall shear stress (53.6 Pa vs. 37.8 Pa) and different local OSI distributions were also observed between the MTs. The findings revealed that morphological variations in MTs could be generated by embryological and environmental factors, further influencing hemodynamic characteristics on CA pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there have been concentrations on the Digital Twin from researchers and companies due to its advancement in IT, communication systems, Cloud Computing, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Blockchain. The main concept of the DT is to provide a comprehensive tangible, and operational explanation of any element, asset, or system. However, it is an extremely dynamic taxonomy developing in complication during the life cycle that produces an enormous quantity of the engendered data and information from them. Likewise, with the development of the Blockchain, the digital twins have the potential to redefine and could be a key strategy to support the IoT-based digital twin's applications for transferring data and value onto the Internet with full transparency besides promising accessibility, trusted traceability, and immutability of transactions. Therefore, the integration of digital twins with the IoT and blockchain technologies has the potential to revolutionize various industries by providing enhanced security, transparency, and data integrity. Thus, this work presents a survey on the innovative theme of digital twins with the integration of Blockchain for various applications. Also, provides challenges and future research directions on this subject. In addition, in this paper, we propose a concept and architecture for integrating digital twins with IoT-based blockchain archives, which allows for real-time monitoring and control of physical assets and processes in a secure and decentralized manner. We also discuss the challenges and limitations of this integration, including issues related to data privacy, scalability, and interoperability. Finally, we provide insights into the future scope of this technology and discuss potential research directions for further improving the integration of digital twins with IoT-based blockchain archives. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the potential benefits and challenges of integrating digital twins with IoT-based blockchain and lays the foundation for future research in this area.",

    "abstract": "This observational study aims to compare the effectiveness of helmet therapy versus natural course in twin siblings suffering from nonsynostotic head deformations. A retrospective analysis of all twin couples treated with helmet therapy between March 2009 and May 2017\u00a0at an orthopedic hospital was conducted. Inclusion criteria were me if only one twin received helmet therapy. The other twin acted as control. A classification for different head shapes was used. A total of 61 twin couples was included. Change in outcome parameters of helmet therapy and natural course differed significantly: cranial vault asymmetry (CVA)\u00a0-0.66\u00a0cm vs.\u00a0-0.04\u00a0cm, cranial vault asymmetry index (CVAI)\u00a0-5.35% vs.\u00a0-0.51% (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), cephalic index (CI)\u00a0-3.10% vs.\u00a0-1.91% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Helmet therapy showed a success rate (CI\u00a0<\u00a090% and CVAI \u22647% or better) of 63.6% vs. 21.1% in children with natural course (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002).

    "abstract": "Hemodynamic mechanisms of the formation and growth of intracranial aneurysms (IA) in monozygotic twins (MTs) are still under-reported. To partially fill such knowledge gap, this study employed an experimentally validated numerical model to compare hemodynamics in 3 anatomical and 5 ablation study neurovascular models from a rare pair of MTs in terms of 7 critical hemodynamic parameters. Numerical results showed significant differences in hemodynamics between the MTs, although they share the same genes, indicating that genetic mutation and environmental factors might affect neurovascular morphologies and cause hemodynamic changes. After virtual removals of IAs in the ablation study, the locations where the aneurysmal sac/bleb generated in bifurcated anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) register a locally high instantaneous wall shear stress (IWSS) of 52.9 and 70.1\u00a0Pa at the systolic peak in twin A and twin B, respectively. Same scenario can be observed in the distribution of instantaneous wall shear stress gradient (IWSSG), with 571.1\u00a0Pa/mm for twin A and 301.3\u00a0Pa/mm for twin B due to aggressive blood impingements, leading to IA generation. The fenestrated complex approaching ACA bifurcations in twin A may assist IA growth and rupture, via. Causing abnormal IWSS of 116.3\u00a0Pa, IWSSG of 832.5\u00a0Pa/mm, and oscillatory shear index (OSI) of 0.49. The bleb in twin B has high risks of progression and possible rupture as the IA suffers relatively low IWSS and high OSI. Additionally, IA generation can change blood flow rates in each connected artery, then affecting blood supplies to associated tissues and organs.",

    "abstract": "Eating disorders are associated with subsequent alcohol problems, but it is not known whether this association also extends to broader eating disorder symptoms not captured by clinical diagnoses. We assessed the longitudinal association of broad eating disorder symptoms with alcohol problems in a nationwide twin sample (FinnTwin16).\nFinnish women (N\u2009=\u20091905) and men (N\u2009=\u20091449) self-reported their eating disorder symptoms using the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 Bulimia, Drive for Thinness, and Body Dissatisfaction subscales at the mean age of 24.4\u2009years in 2000-2003. A subsample of participants also completed items on drive for muscularity, height dissatisfaction, and muscle-enhancing supplement use. Alcohol problems were assessed 10\u2009years later at the age of 34.1 in 2010-2012 with the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index.\nEating disorder symptoms were associated with later alcohol problems (odds ratio per point increase 1.02-1.18). Bulimia showed stronger associations among men than women (p for interaction .012). Drive for muscularity and height dissatisfaction were also associated with later alcohol problems, but supplement use was not. When accounting for baseline alcohol problems, only Bulimia (among women and men) and Drive for Thinness (among men) were significantly associated with later alcohol problems. Bulimia was also significantly associated with later alcohol problems in within-twin-pair analyses among dizygotic twins, but not among monozygotic twins.\nIn a longitudinal setting, eating disorder symptoms were associated with later alcohol problems. Bulimic symptoms were a stronger risk factor for men than women. These associations may be attributable to baseline alcohol problems, childhood environment and genetic liability.\nThis study found that both young adult women and men with broad eating disorder symptoms are at a higher risk of alcohol-related problems than those without such symptoms. Men with bulimic symptoms were at a particularly high risk. These findings emphasize the need for better prevention and treatment of disordered eating, body image concerns and alcohol problems for both young adult women and men.",

    "abstract": "The intensity and frequency of hydro-meteorological hazards have increased due to fast-growing urbanisation activities and climate change. Hybrid approaches that combine grey infrastructure and Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs) have been applied as an adaptive and resilient strategy to cope with climate change uncertainties and incorporate other co-benefits. This research aims to investigate the feasibility of Real Time Control (RTC) for NBS operation in order to reduce flooding and improve their effectiveness. The study area is the irrigation and drainage system of the Rangsit Area in Thailand. The results show that during the normal flood events, the RTC system effectively reduces water level at the Western Raphiphat Canal Station compared to the system without RTC or with additional storage. Moreover, the RTC system facilitates achieving the required minimum volume and increasing the volume in the retentions. These findings highlight the potential of using RTC to improve the irrigation and drainage system operation as well as NBS implementation to reduce flooding. The RTC system can also assists in equitable water distribution between Klongs and retention areas, while also increasing the water storage in the retention areas. This additional water storage can be utilized for agricultural purposes, providing further benefits. These results represent an essential starting point for the development of Smart Solutions and Digital Twins in utilizing Real-Time Control for flood reduction and water allocation in the Rangsit Area in Thailand.",

Ultrasound confirmed vital pregnancy of conjoined twins - thoracopagus. After prenatal diagnostic consultation the patient decided for termination of pregnancy. Molecular analysis confirmed a female fetus without any chromosomal anomalies.\nThe occurrancce of conjoined twins is very rare. Early prenatal ultrasound diagnosis plays an important role. Presented case report describes conjoined twins with poor prognosis because of one shared malformed heart.",

    "abstract": "This review aimed to assess the agreement of dental caries experience between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins.\nThis systematic review was performed by reviewers in the databases Embase, MEDLINE-PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and manual searches and gray literature Google Scholar\u00ae and Opengray. Observational studies that evaluated dental caries in twins were included. The risk of bias was analyzed using the Joanna Briggs checklist. Meta-analyses were performed to assess the pooled Odds Ratio to estimate the agreement values of dental caries experience and DMF index between pairs of twins (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). To assess the certainty of evidence, the GRADE scale was used.\n2533 studies were identified, of which 19 were included in the qualitative analysis, six in the quantitative synthesis, with two meta-analyses being carried out. Association between genetics and the development of the disease was observed in most studies. In the risk of bias analysis, 47.4% had moderate risk. Higher agreement of dental caries experience was observed in MZ twins than DZ in both dentitions (OR: 5.94; 95% CI: 2.00-17.57). However, there was no difference between the MZ and DZ twin groups in the analysis comparing DMF index agreement (OR: 2.86; 95%CI: 0.25-32.79). The certainty of evidence was considered low and very low for all studies included in meta-analyses.\nWith very low certainty of the evidence, the genetic factor seems to influence the agreement of the caries experience.\nUnderstanding the genetic influence on the disease has the potential to contribute to the development of studies that may use biotechnologies for prevention and treatment as well as guide future research involving gene therapies aiming to prevent the occurrence of dental caries.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) is an IGF-activating enzyme suggested to influence aging-related diseases. However, knowledge on serum PAPP-A concentration and regulation in elderly subjects is limited. Therefore, we measured serum PAPP-A in elderly same-sex monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, as this allowed us to describe the age-relationship of PAPP-A, and to test the hypothesis that serum PAPP-A concentrations are genetically determined. As PAPP-A is functionally related to stanniocalcin-2 (STC2), an endogenous PAPP-A inhibitor, we included measurements on STC2 as well as IGF-I and IGF-II.\nThe twin cohort contained 596 subjects (250 MZ twins, 346 DZ twins), whereof 33% were males. The age ranged from 73.2 to 94.3 (mean 78.8) years. Serum was analyzed for PAPP-A, STC2, IGF-I, and IGF-II by commercial\u00a0immunoassays.\nIn the twin cohort, PAPP-A increased with age (r=0.19; \nThis twin study confirms our hypothesis that the heritability of PAPP-A serum concentrations is substantial, and the same is true for STC2. As regards the age relationship, PAPP-A increases with age, whereas STC2 remains unchanged, thereby supporting the idea that the ability of STC2 to inhibit PAPP-A enzymatic activity decreases with increasing age.",

    "abstract": "Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) can be employed to determine crystal structures but has not been used alone to identify defects at the atom scale due to the lack of understanding of the EBSD patterns generated by various structure defects. In the present work, the EBSD patterns of FCC-Fe with 9-layer, 6-layer and 3-layer twin structures are simulated, respectively, using the revised real space (RRS) method and compared with the counterpart of perfect crystals. Our results show that when the electron beam is incident along a direction parallel to the twin plane, the pattern appears symmetrical with respect to the corresponding Kikuchi band of the twin plane, and the diffraction details within the Kikuchi band also exhibit symmetry with respect to the middle line of the Kikuchi band. Moreover, the overall clarity of the patterns decreases, and the pattern becomes more blurred with increasing the distance from the Kikuchi band corresponding to the twin plane. By contrast, the incident electron beam along the direction perpendicular to the twin plane results in diffraction superposition of the matrix region and the shear region, which shows twofold rotational symmetry with respect to the Kikuchi pole corresponding to the normal to the twin plane. In addition, some extra Kikuchi bands appear in the EBSD patterns due to the long-period structures of the multilayer twins. As the number of multilayer twins decreases, the number of extra Kikuchi bands decreases and the area of the blurring pattern increases. The correlation between twin structures and EBSD patterns provides theoretical insights for identifying twin structures by the EBSD technique.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine use are highly comorbid and alarmingly prevalent in young adults. The hippocampus may be particularly sensitive to substance exposure. This remains largely untested in humans and familial risk may confound exposure effects. We extend prior work on alcohol and hippocampal volume in women by testing common and unique substance use effects and the potential moderating role of sex on hippocampal volume during emerging adulthood. A quasi-experimental cotwin control (CTC) design was used to separate familial risk from exposure consequences.\nIn a population-based sample of 435 24-year-old same-sex twins (58% women), dimensional measures (e.g. frequency, amount) of alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine use across emerging adulthood were assessed. Hippocampal volume was assessed using MRI.\nGreater substance use was significantly associated with lower hippocampal volume for women but not men. The same pattern was observed for alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine. CTC analyses provided evidence that hippocampal effects likely reflected familial risk and the consequence of substance use in general and alcohol and nicotine in particular; cannabis effects were in the expected direction but not significant. Within-pair mediation analyses suggested that the effect of alcohol use on the hippocampus may reflect, in part, comorbid nicotine use.\nThe observed hippocampal volume deviations in women likely reflected substance-related premorbid familial risk and the consequences of smoking and, to a lesser degree, drinking. Findings contribute to a growing body of work suggesting heightened risk among women toward experiencing deleterious effects of substance exposure on the still-developing young adult hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "We estimate the causal effect of income on happiness using a unique dataset of Chinese twins. This allows us to address omitted variable bias and measurement errors. Our findings show that individual income has a large positive effect on happiness, with a doubling of income resulting in an increase of 0.26 scales or 0.37 SDs in the four-scale happiness measure. We also find that income matters most for males and the middle-aged. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for various biases when studying the relationship between socioeconomic status and subjective well-being.",

    "abstract": "Empty sella syndrome is a complex syndrome with a diverse clinical presentation. The combination with functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a real challenge for the clinician. Mutations in the CHD7 gene could be a possible, yet unproven, cause of \"empty sella\" syndrome. Patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism should be examined for possible CHD7 mutations, even if they do not have any CHARGE syndrome characteristics.\nEmpty sella is an anatomo-radiological finding characterized by arachnoid herniation into the sellar fossa with reduction of pituitary volume and/or pituitary stalk compression). We report a clinical case of 35-year-old identical male twins, admitted to the clinic of endocrinology and metabolic diseases with history of infertility, hormonal constellation of hyposomatotropism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The patients presented with hyposmia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hypothalamic-pituitary region revealed the presence of partial empty sella. ",

    "abstract": "As the adoption of Industry 4.0 advances and the manufacturing process becomes increasingly digital, the Digital Twin (DT) will prove invaluable for testing and simulating new parameters and design variants. DT solutions build a 3D digital replica of the physical object allowing the managers to develop better products, detect physical issues sooner, and predict outcomes more accurately. In the past few years, Digital Twins (DTs) dramatically reduced the cost of developing new manufacturing approaches, improved efficiency, reduced waste, and minimized batch-to-batch variability. This paper aims to highlight the evolution of DTs, review its enabling technologies, identify challenges and opportunities for implementing DT in Industry 4.0, and examine its range of applications in manufacturing, including smart logistics and supply chain management. The paper also highlights some real examples of the application of DT in manufacturing.",

We present the twelfth reported case of\u00a0this uncommon condition undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis.\u00a0Dealing with discordant fetal anomalies in monochorionic pregnancy can be challenging for physicians and patients; pros and cons of different invasive procedure options must be discussed with the couple, contending with certain specific peculiarities of this type of pregnancy. Although chorionic villi sampling can be performed earlier, higher risk of misdiagnosis of discordant aneuploidy is reported. Indeed, when heterokaryotic twins are suspected, a two-sampling amniocentesis is recommended, to ensure independent sampling of each fetus and to rule out confined placental mosaicism as well. The couple should be informed of the possible management and the risks for the non-affected twin whether selective reduction is required, and likewise if the pregnancy continues without selective termination.",

    "abstract": "Surgical separation of conjoined twins remains one of the most unique and rewarding experiences in the field of pediatric surgery, bearing in mind that this decision is their best chance of survival. These are the first reported cases of successfully separating omphalopagus conjoined twins by the liver in Sudan. After an emergency cesarean section, 62-day-old term-conjoined twins were referred to our pediatric surgery center. Examination revealed well-appearing twins fused from the xiphoid to the umbilicus; imaging confirmed a fused liver with a separate portal and caval structures, necessitating surgical separation and closure, which was done successfully on subsequent hours with well tolerance and recovery discharged on day 21. The second case involved 21-day-old term-conjoined female twins who were fused from the xiphoid to the umbilicus and shared the same cord, as well as complete fusion of the liver with separate other vital organs. They were successfully separated and recovered well.",

We report on preterm twins born at 29 weeks of gestation: Twin B was 31 days old when he developed LOS GBS sepsis and meningitis, and Twin A was 35 days old when he developed LOS GBS sepsis. Tests for maternal GBS colonization in breast milk were negative. Both babies were treated with antibiotics and eventually discharged without complications.",

I show, in detail, that (a) his criticisms of previous TRA studies depend on sources that were discredited prior to MISTRA, as they all failed the test of replicability, (b) the list of biases he uses to invalidate MISTRA do not support his arguments, (c) the accusations of questionable research practices are unsubstantiated, (d) his claim that MISTRA should be evaluated in the context of psychology's replication crisis is refuted. The TRA studies are constructive replications. Like many other scholars, past and present, he has been misled by the variation introduced by small samples (sampling error) and the distortion created by walking in the garden of forking paths. His endeavor is a concatenation of elision and erroneous statistical/scientific reasoning.",

    "abstract": "The aims of the study were to evaluate perinatal outcome in monochorionic (MC) twins complicated with single intrauterine fetal death, spontaneously vs after fetal therapy, and to assess antenatal events that increase the risk of cerebral injury.\nHistorical cohort study of MC pregnancies with single intrauterine fetal death diagnosed or referred to a tertiary referral hospital (2012-2020). Adverse perinatal outcome included termination of pregnancy, perinatal death, abnormal fetal or neonatal neuroimaging and abnormal neurological development.\nA total of 68 MC pregnancies with single intrauterine fetal death after 14\u2009weeks of gestation were included. Sixty-five (95.6%) occurred in complicated MC pregnancies (twin to twin transfusion syndrome: 35/68 [51.5%]; discordant malformation: 13/68 [19.1%], selective intrauterine growth restriction: 10/68 [14.7%], twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence: 5/68 [7.3%] and cord entanglement in monoamniotic twins: 2/68 [2.94%]). In 52 cases (76.5%) single intrauterine fetal demise occurred after fetal therapy and in 16 (23.5%) occurred spontaneously. Cerebral damage included 14/68 cases (20.6%): 6/68 cases (8.82%) were prenatal lesions and 8/68 cases (11.8%) were postnatal. Risk of cerebral damage tended to be higher in the spontaneous death group (6/16, 37.5%) compared to the therapy-group (8/52, 15.38%) (p\u2009=\u20090.07). The risk increased with gestational age at intrauterine death (OR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.41, p\u2009=\u20090.014) and was higher in those surviving co-twins who developed anemia (OR 9.27, 95% CI: 1.50-57.12, p\u2009=\u20090.016). Pregnancies complicated with selective intrauterine growth restriction tended to be at higher risk for neurological damage (OR 2.85, 95% CI: 0.68-11.85, p\u2009=\u20090.15). Preterm birth rate (<37\u2009weeks of pregnancy) was 61.7% (37/60). Seven of eight postnatal cerebral lesions (87.5%) were related to extreme prematurity. Overall perinatal survival rate was 88.3% (57/68) and 7% (4/57) of children had an abnormal neurological outcome.\nRisk of cerebral damage in single intrauterine fetal death is especially high when it occurs spontaneously. Gestational age at single intrauterine fetal death, selective intrauterine growth restriction and anemia of the surviving co-twin are the main predictors for prenatal lesions and might be useful in parent counseling. Abnormal postnatal neurological outcome is closely related to extreme prematurity.",

    "abstract": "Differentiating between monozygotic (MZ) twins remains difficult because they have the same genetic makeup. Applying the traditional STR genotyping approach cannot differentiate one from the other. Heteroplasmy refers to the presence of two or more different mtDNA copies within a single cell and this phenomenon is common in humans. The levels of heteroplasmy cannot change dramatically during transmission in the female germ line but increase or decrease during germ-line transmission and in somatic tissues during life. As massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technology has advanced, it has shown the extraordinary quantity of mtDNA heteroplasmy in humans. In this study, a probe hybridization technique was used to obtain mtDNA and then MPS was performed with an average sequencing depth of above 4000. The results showed us that all ten pairs of MZ twins were clearly differentiated with the minor heteroplasmy threshold at 1.0%, 0.5%, and 0.1%, respectively. Finally, we used a probe that targeted mtDNA to boost sequencing depth without interfering with nuclear DNA and this technique can be used in forensic genetics to differentiate the MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins (MZTs) are associated with high risks of maternal and fetal complications. Even with the widely used elective single embryo transfer (SET), the risk of MZTs following assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments remains. However, most studies of MZTs focused on the relevant etiology, with few studies describing pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.\nThis retrospective cohort study included 19,081 SET cycles resulting from in-vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) and testicular sperm aspiration (TESA) performed between January 2010 and July 2020 in a single university-based center. A total of 187 MZTs were included in this investigation. The main outcome measures were the incidence, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes of MZTs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to figure out the risk factors for pregnancy loss.\nThe overall rate of MZTs from ART treatment in SET cycles was 0.98%. No significant difference was found in the incidence of MZTs among the four groups (p\u2009=\u20090.259). The live birth rate of MZTs in the ICSI group (88.5%) was significantly more favorable than in the IVF, PGT and TESA groups (60.5%, 77.2% and 80%, respectively). IVF resulted in a significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss (39.4%) and early miscarriage (29.5%) in MZT pregnancies compared to ICSI (11.4%, 8.5%), PGT (22.7%, 16.6%) and TESA (20%, 13.3%). The total rate of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in MZTs was 2.7% (5/187); however, the TESA group had the highest rate at 20% and was significantly higher than the PGT group (p\u2009=\u20090.005). The four ART groups had no significant effect on the occurrence of congenital abnormalities or other neonatal outcomes in newborns from MZT pregnancies. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that infertility duration, cause of infertility, the total dose of Gn used, history of miscarriages, and the number of miscarriages were not related to the risk of pregnancy loss (p\u2009>\u20090.05).\nThe rate of MZTs was similar among the four ART groups. The pregnancy loss and the early miscarriage rate of MZTs was increased in IVF patients. Neither the cause of infertility nor the history of miscarriage was correlated with the risk of pregnancy loss. MZTs in the TESA group had a higher risk of TTTS, placental effects influenced by sperm and paternally expressed genes may play a role. However, due to the small total number, studies with larger sample sizes are still needed to validate these result. Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes of MZTs after PGT treatment seem to be reassuring but the duration of the study was short, and long-term follow-up of the children is needed.",

    "abstract": "Parental monitoring is a key intervention target for adolescent substance use, however this practice is largely supported by causally uninformative cross-sectional or sparse-longitudinal observational research designs.\nWe therefore evaluated relationships between adolescent substance use (assessed weekly) and parental monitoring (assessed every two months) in 670 adolescent twins for two years. This allowed us to assess how individual-level parental monitoring and substance use trajectories were related and, via the twin design, to quantify genetic and environmental contributions to these relationships. Furthermore, we attempted to devise additional measures of parental monitoring by collecting quasi-continuous GPS locations and calculating a) time spent at home between midnight and 5am and b) time spent at school between 8am-3pm.\nACE-decomposed latent growth models found alcohol and cannabis use increased with age while parental monitoring, time at home, and time at school decreased. Baseline alcohol and cannabis use were correlated (\nOverall, we found developmental changes in each phenotype, baseline correlations between substance use and parental monitoring, co-occurring changes and mutual genetic influences for time at home and cannabis use, and substantial genetic influences on many substance use and parental monitoring phenotypes. However, our geospatial variables were mostly unrelated to parental monitoring, suggesting they poorly measured this construct. Furthermore, though we did not detect evidence of genetic confounding, changes in parental monitoring and substance use were not significantly correlated, suggesting that, at least in community samples of mid-to-late adolescents, the two may not be causally related.",

    "abstract": "To improve risk stratification in extracranial internal carotid artery disease (CAD), patients who would benefit maximally from revascularization must be identified. In cardiology, the fractional flow reserve (FFR) has become a reference standard for evaluating the functional severity of coronary artery stenosis, and noninvasive surrogates thereof relying on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been developed. Here, we present a CFD-based workflow using digital twins of patients' carotid bifurcations derived from computed tomography angiography for the noninvasive functional assessment of CAD. We reconstructed patient-specific digital twins of 37 carotid bifurcations. We implemented a CFD model using common carotid artery peak systolic velocity (PSV) acquired with Doppler ultrasound (DUS) as inlet boundary condition and a two-element Windkessel model as oulet boundary condition. The agreement between CFD and DUS on the PSV in the internal carotid artery (ICA) was then compared. The relative error for the agreement between DUS and CFD was 9%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020% and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.88. Furthermore, hyperemic simulations in a physiological range were feasible and unmasked markedly different pressure drops along two ICA stenoses with similar degree of narrowing under comparable ICA blood flow. Hereby, we lay the foundation for prospective studies on noninvasive CFD-based derivation of metrics similar to the FFR for the assessment of CAD.",

    "abstract": "The dysfunction of energy metabolism in white adipose tissue (WAT) induces adiposity. Obesogenic diets that are high in saturated fat disturb nutrient metabolism in adipocytes. This study investigated the effect of an isocaloric high-fat diet without the confounding effects of weight gain on the gene expression of fatty acid and carbohydrate transport and metabolism and its genetic inheritance in subcutaneous (s.c.) WAT of healthy human twins.\nForty-six healthy pairs of twins (34 monozygotic, 12 dizygotic) received an isocaloric carbohydrate-rich diet (55% carbohydrates, 30% fat, 15% protein; LF) for 6 weeks followed by an isocaloric diet rich in saturated fat (40% carbohydrates, 45% fat, 15% protein; HF) for another 6 weeks.\nGene expression analysis of s.c. WAT revealed that fatty acid transport was reduced after one week of the HF diet, which persisted throughout the study and was not inherited, whereas intracellular metabolism was decreased after six weeks and inherited. An increased inherited gene expression of fructose transport was observed after one and six weeks, potentially leading to increased de novo lipogenesis.\nAn isocaloric dietary increase of fat induced a tightly orchestrated, partially inherited network of genes responsible for fatty acid and carbohydrate transport and metabolism in human s.c. WAT.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we introduce a new approach to human movement by defining the movement as a static super object represented by a single two-dimensional image. The described method is applicable in remote healthcare applications, such as physiotherapeutic exercises. It allows researchers to label and describe the entire exercise as a standalone object, isolated from the reference video. This approach allows us to perform various tasks, including detecting similar movements in a video, measuring and comparing movements, generating new similar movements, and defining choreography by controlling specific parameters in the human body skeleton. As a result of the presented approach, we can eliminate the need to label images manually, disregard the problem of finding the start and the end of an exercise, overcome synchronization issues between movements, and perform any deep learning network-based operation that processes super objects in images in general. As part of this article, we will demonstrate two application use cases: one illustrates how to verify and score a fitness exercise. In contrast, the other illustrates how to generate similar movements in the human skeleton space by addressing the challenge of supplying sufficient training data for deep learning applications (DL). A variational auto encoder (VAE) simulator and an EfficientNet-B7 classifier architecture embedded within a Siamese twin neural network are presented in this paper in order to demonstrate the two use cases. These use cases demonstrate the versatility of our innovative concept in measuring, categorizing, inferring human behavior, and generating gestures for other researchers.",

    "abstract": "Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of allergic diseases. However, there is limited information on these factors in the Korean population. This study investigated the importance of genetic and environmental factors in allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis, by comparing the disease incidence in Korean adult monozygotic and dizygotic twins. This cross-sectional study utilized data from 1296 twin pairs, including 1052 monozygotic and 244 dizygotic twins, aged over 20 years, from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (2005-2014). The study utilized binomial and multinomial logistic regression models to compute odds ratios of disease concordance. The concordance rate (92%) of the presence or absence of atopic dermatitis in monozygotic twins was slightly higher than that in dizygotic twins (90.2%), which only had a borderline significance (",

    "abstract": "Multi-dimensional facial imaging is increasingly used in hospital clinics. A digital twin of the face can be created by reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) facial images using facial scanners. Therefore, the reliability, strengths, and weaknesses of scanners should be investigated and approved; Methods: Images obtained from three facial scanners (RayFace, MegaGen, and Artec Eva) were compared with cone-beam computed tomography images as the standard. Surface discrepancies were measured and analyzed at 14 specific reference points; Results: All scanners used in this study achieved acceptable results, although only scanner 3 obtained preferable results. Each scanner exhibited weak and strong points because of differences in the scanning methods. Scanner 2 exhibited the best result on the left endocanthion; scanner 1 achieved the best result on the left exocanthion and left alare; and scanner 3 achieved the best result on the left exocanthion (both cheeks); Conclusions: These comparative analysis data can be used when creating digital twins through segmentation, selecting and merging data, or developing a new scanner to overcome all shortcomings.",

    "abstract": "The palatal scans of the same individuals were compared after two years to assess forensic reproducibility. The effect of orthodontic treatment, the comparison area and the digitization approach were investigated.\nThe palate was scanned three times in 20 pairs of monozygotic twins with an intraoral scanner (IOS), to assess repeatability. The same subjects were re-scanned two years later, with two different IOSs. An elastic impression and a plaster model were also made and scanned with a laboratory scanner (indirect digitization). Mean absolute distance between scans was compared after best-fit alignment. Scans from the two sessions were compared to evaluate the combined effect of aging, orthodontic treatment and different digitization methods (forensic reproducibility). Additionally, the scans of different digitization methods from the second session were compared (technical reproducibility). The between-siblings difference was compared in the two sessions, to evaluate the effect of aging on palatal morphology.\nThe anterior palatal area showed significantly better repeatability and forensic reproducibility than the whole palate (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but orthodontic treatment had no effect. Indirect digitization produced lower forensic and technical reproducibility than IOSs. For IOSs, repeatability (22\u00a0\u00b5m) was significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) better than either forensic (75-77\u00a0\u00b5m) or technical reproducibility (37\u00a0\u00b5m). No significant changes were observed from the first to the second session in the between-sibling comparison. The closest between-sibling value (239\u00a0\u00b5m) considerably exceeded the highest forensic reproducibility value (141\u00a0\u00b5m).\nReproducibility is acceptable between the different IOSs, even after two years, but is poor between IOS and indirect digitization. The anterior palate is relatively stable in young adults.\nIntraoral scanning of the anterior palatal area has superior reproducibility, regardless of the IOS brand. Therefore, the IOS method could be suitable for identifying humans through anterior palatal morphology. However, the digitization of elastic impressions or plaster models had low reproducibility, preventing their application for forensic purposes.",

    "abstract": "The screening performance of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in vanishing twin (VT) pregnancies is relatively unknown. To close this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review of the available literature. Studies describing the test performance of NIPT for trisomy 21, 18, 13, sex chromosomes and additional findings in pregnancies with a VT were retrieved from a literature search with a publication date until October 4, 2022. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed with the quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies-2 (QUADAS-2). The screen positive rate of the pooled data and the pooled positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated using a random effects model. Seven studies, with cohort sizes ranging from 5 to 767, were included. The screen positive rate of the pooled data for trisomy 21 was 35/1592 (2.2%), with a PPV of 20% (confirmation in 7/35 cases [95% CI 9.8%-36%]). For trisomy 18, the screen positive rate was 13/1592 (0.91%) and the pooled PPV 25% [95% CI 1.3%-90%]. The screen positive rate for trisomy 13 was 7/1592 (0.44%) and confirmed in 0/7 cases (pooled PPV 0% [95% CI 0%-100%]). The screen positive rate for additional findings was 23/767 (2.9%), of which none could be confirmed. No discordant negative results were reported. There is insufficient data to fully evaluate NIPT performance in pregnancies with a VT. However, existing studies suggest that NIPT can successfully detect common autosomal aneuploidies in pregnancies affected by a VT but with a higher false positive rate. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal timing of NIPT in VT pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "The recruitment of patients for rare or complex cardiovascular diseases is a bottleneck for clinical trials and digital twins of the human heart have recently been proposed as a viable alternative. In this paper we present an unprecedented cardiovascular computer model which, relying on the latest GPU-acceleration technologies, replicates the full multi-physics dynamics of the human heart within a few hours per heartbeat. This opens the way to extensive simulation campaigns to study the response of synthetic cohorts of patients to cardiovascular disorders, novel prosthetic devices or surgical procedures. As a proof-of-concept we show the results obtained for left bundle branch block disorder and the subsequent cardiac resynchronization obtained by pacemaker implantation. The in-silico results closely match those obtained in clinical practice, confirming the reliability of the method. This innovative approach makes possible a systematic use of digital twins in cardiovascular research, thus reducing the need of real patients with their economical and ethical implications. This study is a major step towards in-silico clinical trials in the era of digital medicine.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins (DTs) are an emerging phenomenon in the public and private sectors as a new tool to monitor and understand systems and processes. DTs have the potential to change the status quo in ecology as part of its digital transformation. However, it is important to avoid misguided developments by managing expectations about DTs. We stress that DTs are not just big models of everything, containing big data and machine learning. Rather, the strength of DTs is in combining data, models, and domain knowledge, and their continuous alignment with the real world. We suggest that researchers and stakeholders exercise caution in DT development, keeping in mind that many of the strengths and challenges of computational modelling in ecology also apply to DTs.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins (Siamese twins) represent the rarest form of twin pregnancy. Reported here are two rare cases of conjoined term twins presented to the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology within 3 months. The first case, 32 years of gravida 6 parity 5 referred from periphery after full trial of labour following multi-organ dysfunction and term intrauterine dead twins. Intraoperatively it was dead conjoined thoraco-omphalopagus females. The patient died after 3 days following multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The second case, 22 years gravida 2 parity 1 also referred from periphery in second stage of labour with diagnosis of 39 weeks intrauterine dead twins with obstructed labour, delivered by caesarean with intraoperative conjoined dead females of thoracophagus type. Twins are high-risk pregnancy. This rare diagnosis with complications could have been prevented by regular antenatal checkups, ultrasonography performed by radiologists and early referral antenatally in labour along with multidisciplinary approach.\nconjoined; monozygotic twinning; siamese twins; twins.",

    "abstract": "To examine the association between pre-pregnancy BMI and severe maternal morbidity (SMM), perinatal death and severe neonatal morbidity in twin pregnancies.\nAll twin births at \u2265\u200920 weeks gestation in British Columbia, Canada, from 2000 to 2017 were included. We estimated rates of SMM, a perinatal composite of death and severe morbidity, and its components per 10,000 pregnancies. Confounder-adjusted rate ratios (aRR) between pre-pregnancy BMI and outcomes were estimated using robust Poisson regression.\nOverall, 7770 (368 underweight, 1704 overweight, and 1016 obese) women with twin pregnancy were included. The rates of SMM were: 271.1, 320.4, 270.0, and 225.9 in underweight, normal BMI, overweight and obese women, respectively. There was little association between obesity and any of the primary outcomes (e.g., aRR\u2009=\u20091.09, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.85, 1.38 for composite perinatal outcome). Underweight women had higher rates of the composite perinatal adverse outcome (aRR\u2009=\u20091.79, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.32-2.43), driven by increased rates of severe respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal death.\nThere was no evidence of elevated risk of adverse outcomes among twin pregnancies of women who were overweight or obese. Risk was higher in underweight women, who may require specific care when carrying twins.",

Many studies have shown that in older MZ twins, there are significant differences in overall content and genomic distribution of methylation.\nIn this study, we analyzed the DNA methylome profile of blood to identify recurrent differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) to discriminate between MZ twins.\nBlood samples were collected from 47 paired MZ twins. We performed the DNA methylation profiling using the HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip platform and identified recurrent DMCs between MZ twins. Then, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Ontology (GO), and motif enrichment analyses were performed to reveal the biological functions of recurrent DMCs. We collected DNA methylome data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public database to verify the recurrent DMCs between MZ twins.\nWe identified recurrent DMCs between MZ twin samples and observed that they were enriched in immune-related genes. In addition, we verified our DMCs in a public dataset.\nOur results suggest that the methylation level at recurrent DMCs between MZ twins may serve as a valuable biomarker for identification of individuals in a pair of MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "Immediate consequences of trauma include a rapid and immense activation of the immune system, whereas long-term outcomes include premature death, physical disability, and reduced workability.\nTo investigate if moderate to severe trauma is associated with long-term increased risk of death or immune-mediated or cancer disease.\nThis registry-based, matched, co-twin control cohort study linked the Danish Twin Registry and the Danish National Patient Registry to identify twin pairs in which 1 twin had been exposed to severe trauma and the other twin had not from 1994 to 2018. The co-twin control design allowed for matching on genetic and environmental factors shared within twin pairs.\nTwin pairs were included if 1 twin had been exposed to moderate to severe trauma and the other twin had not (ie, co-twin). Only twin pairs where both twins were alive 6 months after the trauma event were included.\nTwin pairs were followed up from 6 months after trauma until 1 twin experienced the primary composite outcome of death or 1 of 24 predefined immune-mediated or cancer diseases or end of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression was used for intrapair analyses of the association between trauma and the primary outcome.\nA total of 3776 twin pairs were included, and 2290 (61%) were disease free prior to outcome analysis and were eligible for the analysis of the primary outcome. The median (IQR) age was 36.4 (25.7-50.2) years. The median (IQR) follow-up time was 8.6 (3.8-14.5) years. Overall, 1268 twin pairs (55%) reached the primary outcome; the twin exposed to trauma was first to experience the outcome in 724 pairs (32%), whereas the co-twin was first in 544 pairs (24%). The hazard ratio for reaching the composite outcome was 1.33 (95% CI, 1.19-1.49) for twins exposed to trauma. Analyses of death or immune-mediated or cancer disease as separate outcomes provided hazard ratios of 1.91 (95% CI, 1.68-2.18) and 1.28 (95% CI, 1.14-1.44), respectively.\nIn this study, twins exposed to moderate to severe trauma had significantly increased risk of death or immune-mediated or cancer disease several years after trauma compared with their co-twins.",

    "abstract": "The timing of primary tooth eruption is critical for children's health planning and the diagnosis of specific growth disorders. The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between twin pairs' birth weight, gestational age, and gender, which are indicators of prenatal factors; breast-feeding duration, which is an indicator of postnatal factors; type of delivery, which is an indicator of maternal as well as genetic factors; and age of the primary tooth. Twin children aged from 3 to 15 years who applied to the clinic for the first dental examination constituted the sample group. In this twin study, 59 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and 143 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs were included. Genetic (MZ vs. DZ), maternal (type of delivery, gestational age), perinatal (birth weight, gender), and postnatal (duration of breastfeeding) information was obtained, and effects on the children's Eruption Timing of the First Primary Tooth (ETFPT) were examined. Statistical analysis was performed using the consistent partial least squares structural equation model (robust PLSc) technique. As birth weight increased, the age at first eruption became younger, but this change was different between MZ and DZ twins (",

    "abstract": "This population-based cohort study investigated the prevalence, potential risk factors, and consequences of birth weight discordance (BWD) among same-sex twins. We retrieved data from the automated system of healthcare utilization databases of Lombardy Region, Northern Italy (2007-2021). BWD was defined as 30% or more disparity in birth weights between the larger and the smaller twin. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors of BWD in deliveries with same-sex twins. In addition, the distribution of several neonatal outcomes was assessed overall and according to BWD level (i.e., \u226420%, 21-29, and \u226530%). Finally, a stratified analysis by BWD was performed to assess the relationship between assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and neonatal outcomes. We identified 11,096 same-sex twin deliveries; 556 (5.0%) pairs of twins were affected by BWD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that maternal age \u226535 years (",

    "abstract": "Multiple gestations are a risk factor for most pregnancy complications. The current study aimed to study whether offspring born after twin pregnancies are at increased risk for long-term health complications.\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted in a large medical center, including all offspring born between the years 1991-2021, which were followed-up until 18\u2009years of age. Hospital-based diagnoses of the offspring were categorized into main groups of morbidities: cardiac, respiratory, infectious, neurological, malignancy, and metabolic. Incidence of hospitalization with diagnoses from each main group was compared between twins and singletons, as well as time to first hospitalization. Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the association between twins vs singletons and hospitalizations by grouped morbidities, while adjusting for maternal age, ethnicity and gender, besides maternal recurrence in the cohort.\nA total of 369\u2009478 offspring were included in the analysis; of these 11\u2009986 (3.2%) were twins and 357\u2009492 (96.8%) were singletons. Twins were more likely to be delivered preterm (odds ratio\u2009=\u200917.65, 95% CI: 16.74-18.60), by cesarean delivery and following infertility treatments. Incidence of hospitalizations with all morbidity groups was slightly, some significantly, higher among twins, including cardiac: 1.9% vs 1.5%, respiratory; 8.4% vs 7.1%, neurological: 7.7% vs 7.4%, infectious: 26.0% vs 24.1%, and malignancies: 0.7% vs 0.4%. The risk remained higher in the multivariable analyses (adjusted hazard ratios ranging between 1.09-1.75). When stratifying by gestational age at delivery, the risk for most morbidities was lower among twins vs singletons born in similar gestational ages.\nTwins as compared to singletons are at increased risk for most morbidities due to their risk of being born earlier.",

    "abstract": "Trial of labor is considered safe also among twins, yet nearly 50% are born via cesarean section in Finland. While planned cesarean births have declined among twins, intrapartum cesarean deliveries have risen, postulating evaluation of criteria for trial of labor. The objective of this study was to create an outline of the mode of delivery of dichorionic and monochorionic-diamniotic Finnish twins. By evaluating risk factors for intrapartum cesarean delivery (CD), we aimed at creating a risk score for intrapartum cesarean birth for twins.\nA retrospective observational study based on a cohort of dichorionic and monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies considered as candidates for trial of labor in 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018 (\nA total of 23.8% (171/720, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u200920.7-26.9) of parturients experienced intrapartum CD. Induction of labor, primiparity, fear of childbirth, artificial reproductive technology, higher maternal age, and other than cephalic/cephalic presentation independently associated with intrapartum CD. The achieved total risk score ranged from 0 to 13 points with significantly higher points among the CD group (6.61 vs. 4.42, \nFair-level risk stratification could be achieved with higher maternal age, primiparity, induction of labor, artificial reproductive technology, fear of childbirth, and other than cephalic/cephalic presentation increasing the risk. Parturients with low-risk score (0-7 points) appear to be the best candidates for trial of labor with acceptable CD rates in this group (18.4%).",

    "abstract": "Most of the buildings that exist today were built based on 2D drawings. Building information models that represent design-stage product information have become prevalent in the second decade of the 21st century. Still, it will take many decades before such models become the norm for all existing buildings. In the meantime, the building industry lacks the tools to leverage the benefits of digital information management for construction, operation, and renovation. To this end, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art practice and research for constructing (generating) and maintaining (updating) geometric digital twins. This paper also highlights the key limitations preventing current research from being adopted in practice and derives a new geometry-based object class hierarchy that mainly focuses on the geometric properties of building objects, in contrast to widely used existing object categorisations that are mainly function-oriented. We argue that this new class hierarchy can serve as the main building block for prioritising the automation of the most frequently used object classes for geometric digital twin construction and maintenance. We also draw novel insights into the limitations of current methods and uncover further research directions to tackle these problems. Specifically, we believe that adapting deep learning methods can increase the robustness of object detection and segmentation of various types; involving design intents can achieve a high resolution of model construction and maintenance; using images as a complementary input can help to detect transparent and specular objects; and combining synthetic data for algorithm training can overcome the lack of real labelled datasets.",

    "abstract": "Accurate sonographic estimation of fetal weight is essential for every pregnancy, especially in twin gestation. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the sonographically estimated fetal weight (sEFW) of all twin gestations performed within 14 days of delivery in a single center that aimed to evaluate the accuracy of sEFW in predicting neonatal weight and small for gestational age (SGA) by comparing the first fetus to the second. A total of 190 twin gestations were evaluated for the study. There was no statistically significant difference in the sEFW between the first and the second twins, but the second twin had a statistically significant lower birth weight (2434 vs. 2351 g, ",

    "abstract": "Almost all creatinine is excreted by the kidney in individuals. Serum creatinine concentration, a widely used renal function index in clinical practice, can be affected by both genetic and environmental factors, as evidenced by current research exploring the relationship between these factors and kidney function. However, few studies have explored the heritability of serum creatinine in Asian populations. Therefore, we explored the genetic and environmental factors that affect the serum creatinine level in Asian populations. Participants in this study came from the Qingdao Twin Registry in China, and 374 pairs of twins were included, of which 139 pairs were dizygotic twins, whose ages ranged from 40 to 80 years old, and the serum creatinine level ranged from 10 to 126 \u03bcmol/L. Structural equation models were constructed using Mx software to calculate heritability, with adjusted covariates being age, sex, and body mass index. The results of heritability analysis showed that ACE was the best fit model. Serum creatinine level is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The result of heritability was 35.44%, and the influence of shared environmental factors accounted for 52.13%. This study provided the relevant basis for future research on genetic and environmental factors affecting serum creatinine levels in Asian populations.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins refers to twins that are physically fused in utero and consequently at birth. The first mention of conjoined twins historically comes from the neolithic period.\u00a0The condition is proposed to result from either fission or fusion.\u00a0It happens when a monozygotic twin pregnancy cleaves more than 13\u00a0days after fertilization. Conjoined twins are monochorionic (one placenta) and monoamniotic (one amniotic sac). Conjoined twins exist in a female to male ratio of 3\u00a0to 1. This type of pregnancy is a complicated phenomenon that requires an interprofessional approach to manage it effectively.",

    "abstract": "The digital twin (DT) is an emerging technology that builds on the convergence of computer science, mathematics, engineering, and the life sciences. Given the multiscale nature of biological structures and their environment, biomedical DTs can represent molecules, cells, tissues, organs, systems, patients, and populations and can include aspects from across the modeling and simulation ecosystem. DTs have the potential advance biomedical research with applications for personalized medicine, pharmaceutical development, and clinical trials. On January 30, 2023, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hosted a workshop to discuss the definitions and taxonomy of DTs within the biomedical field, current methods and promising practices for DT development and use as various levels of complexity, key technical challenges and opportunities in the near and long term for DT development and use, and opportunities for translation of promising practices from other field and domains. Workshop panelists highlighted key challenges and opportunities for medical DTs at varying scales, including the varied visions and challenges for DTs, the trade-offs between embracing or simplifying complexity in DTs, the unique spatial and temporal considerations that arise, the diversity of models and data being used in DTs, the challenges with connecting data and models across scales, and implementation issues surrounding data privacy in DTs. This publication summarizes the presentation and discussion of the workshop.",

    "abstract": "General and specific factors of psychopathology are associated with future adverse outcomes, indicating that they might be useful for identifying individuals at greatest risk. However, it remains unknown if these associations are attributable to confounders that may influence both the psychopathology factors and later outcomes.\nTo analyze associations between psychopathology factors and clinically relevant outcomes within family pairs, adjusting for unmeasured confounds by applying co-twin control and sibling comparison designs.\nThis longitudinal cohort study with a follow-up range of 9 to 13 years included all Swedish twins born from 1959 to 1985 who participated in the Study of Twin Adults: Genes and Environment (60% response rate) and the oldest pair of all Swedish siblings born from 1959 to 1985 per the Multi-Generation Register. Twins were evaluated based on responses to a hierarchical factor model derived using multivariate statistics. Sibling pairs were evaluated based on psychiatric diagnoses per the Swedish National Patient Register. Information on outcome events and prescriptions were derived from the National Patient Register, Prescribed Drug Register, and Crime Register. Baseline assessment was in August 2005, and data were analyzed from January 2022 to February 2023.\nHierarchical factor model consisting of 1 general and 4 specific factors fit to 48 psychiatric symptoms on which twin participants self-reported in 2005 and 1 general and 3 specific factors fit to 9 register-based psychiatric diagnoses assigned to sibling participants prior to 2005.\nOutcomes consisted of 7 register-based events occurring after 2005, including suicidal behavior, substance overdoses, and criminal suspicion or convictions (data available until the end of 2013), and prescription of antidepressants, antialcohol or antiopioid medication, antipsychotics, and stimulants (data available until the end of 2017).\nThe study included 32\u202f328 twins (mean [SD] age, 34 [8] years; 16\u202f076 [49.73%] male) and 1\u202f942\u202f106 siblings (mean [SD] age, 34 [7] years; 991\u202f500 [51.05%] male). General psychopathology was significantly associated with all 7 outcomes within sibling pairs (mean within-pair odds ratio [OR], 2.28; 95% CI, 2.19-2.37) and dizygotic twin pairs (within-pairs OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.38-1.98) and with 3 outcomes within monozygotic twin pairs (mean within-pairs OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.35-2.36). Within sibling pairs, the specific internalizing factor was associated with antidepressant prescriptions (within-pairs OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.59-1.71), the specific substance misuse factor was associated prescription of antialcohol and antiopioid medication (within-pairs OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 2.20-2.54), and the specific psychotic factor was associated with antipsychotic medications (within-pairs OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.51-1.72). Similar results emerged within twin pairs.\nIn this cohort study, general psychopathology was significantly associated with all 7 outcomes within sibling and dizygotic twin pairs and 3 outcomes within monozygotic twin pairs at 10 years. Within twin and sibling pairs, the specific factors were primarily associated with related outcomes. Several of the associations in this cohort study could not be attributed to unmeasured confounds shared by family members, suggesting that interventions toward broad psychopathology dimensions might help reduce the risk of future clinically relevant events.",

    "abstract": "Subjective memory concern has long been considered a state-related indicator of impending cognitive decline or dementia. The possibility that subjective memory concern may itself be a heritable trait is largely ignored, yet such an association would substantially confound its use in clinical or research settings.\nTo assess the heritability and traitlike dimensions of subjective memory concern and its clinical correlates.\nThis longitudinal twin cohort study was conducted from 1967 to 2019 among male adults with a mean (SD) age of 37.75 (2.52) years to follow-up at mean ages of 56.15 (2.72), 61.50 (2.43), and 67.35 (2.57) years (hereafter, 38, 56, 62, and 67 years, respectively) in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. The study included a national community-dwelling sample with health, education, and lifestyle characteristics comparable to a general sample of US men in this age cohort. Participants were monozygotic and dizygotic twins randomly recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Data were analyzed from May 2021 to December 2022.\nMeasures included subjective memory concern at 4 time points; objective memory, depressive symptoms, and anxiety at the last 3 time points; negative emotionality (trait neuroticism) at age 56 years; polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for neuroticism, depression, and Alzheimer disease; APOE genotype; and parental history of dementia. Primary outcomes were heritability and correlations between subjective memory concern and other measures.\nThe sample included 1555 male adults examined at age 38 years, 520 at age 56 years (due to late introduction of subjective memory concern questions), 1199 at age 62 years, and 1192 at age 67 years. Phenotypically, subjective memory concerns were relatively stable over time. At age 56 years, subjective memory concern had larger correlations with depressive symptoms (r, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.42), anxiety (r, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.51), and neuroticism (r, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.41) than with objective memory (r, -0.24; 95% CI, -0.33 to -0.13). Phenotypic results were similar at ages 62 and 67 years. A best-fitting autoregressive twin model indicated that genetic influences on subjective memory concern accumulated and persisted over time (h2\u2009=\u20090.26-0.34 from age 38-67 years). At age 56 years, genetic influences for subjective memory concern were moderately correlated with genetic influences for anxiety (r, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.51), negative emotionality (r, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.44-0.57), and depressive symptoms (r, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.29) as well as objective memory (r, -0.22; 95% CI, -0.30 to -0.14). Similar genetic correlations were seen at ages 62 and 67 years. The neuroticism PRS was associated with subjective memory concern at age 38 years (r, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03. to 0.18) and age 67 years (r, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.16). Subjective memory concern was not associated with any Alzheimer disease risk measures.\nThis cohort study found stable genetic influences underlying subjective memory concern dating back to age 38 years. Subjective memory concern had larger correlations with affect-related measures than with memory-related measures. Improving the utility of subjective memory concern as an indicator of impending cognitive decline and dementia may depend on isolating its statelike component from its traitlike component.",

    "results": "The sample included 1555 male adults examined at age 38 years, 520 at age 56 years (due to late introduction of subjective memory concern questions), 1199 at age 62 years, and 1192 at age 67 years. Phenotypically, subjective memory concerns were relatively stable over time. At age 56 years, subjective memory concern had larger correlations with depressive symptoms (r, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.42), anxiety (r, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.51), and neuroticism (r, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.41) than with objective memory (r, -0.24; 95% CI, -0.33 to -0.13). Phenotypic results were similar at ages 62 and 67 years. A best-fitting autoregressive twin model indicated that genetic influences on subjective memory concern accumulated and persisted over time (h2\u2009=\u20090.26-0.34 from age 38-67 years). At age 56 years, genetic influences for subjective memory concern were moderately correlated with genetic influences for anxiety (r, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.51), negative emotionality (r, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.44-0.57), and depressive symptoms (r, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.29) as well as objective memory (r, -0.22; 95% CI, -0.30 to -0.14). Similar genetic correlations were seen at ages 62 and 67 years. The neuroticism PRS was associated with subjective memory concern at age 38 years (r, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03. to 0.18) and age 67 years (r, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.16). Subjective memory concern was not associated with any Alzheimer disease risk measures.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins are virtual replicas of real-world objects and processes, and they have potential applications in the field of surgical procedures, such as enhancing situational awareness. We introduce Twin-S, a digital twin framework designed specifically for skull base surgeries.\nTwin-S is a novel framework that combines high-precision optical tracking and real-time simulation, making it possible to integrate it into image-guided interventions. To guarantee accurate representation, Twin-S employs calibration routines to ensure that the virtual model precisely reflects all real-world processes. Twin-S models and tracks key elements of skull base surgery, including surgical tools, patient anatomy, and surgical cameras. Importantly, Twin-S mirrors real-world drilling and updates the virtual model at frame rate of 28.\nOur evaluation of Twin-S demonstrates its accuracy, with an average error of 1.39\u00a0mm during the drilling process. Our study also highlights the benefits of Twin-S, such as its ability to provide augmented surgical views derived from the continuously updated virtual model, thus offering additional situational awareness to the surgeon.\nWe present Twin-S, a digital twin environment for skull base surgery. Twin-S captures the real-world surgical progresses and updates the virtual model in real time through the use of modern tracking technologies. Future research that integrates vision-based techniques could further increase the accuracy of Twin-S.",

    "abstract": "ALS is a fatal motor neuron disease that displays a broad variety of phenotypes ranging from early fatal courses to slowly progressing and rather benign courses. Such divergence can also be seen in genetic ALS cases with varying phenotypes bearing specific mutations, suggesting epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation act as disease modifiers. However, the epigenotype dictated by, in addition to other mechanisms, DNA methylation is also strongly influenced by the individual's genotype. Hence, we performed a DNA methylation study using EPIC arrays on 7 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for ALS in whole blood, which serves as an ideal model for eliminating the effects of the genetic-epigenetic interplay to a large extent. We found one CpG site showing intra-pair hypermethylation in the affected co-twins, which maps to the Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor Kainate Type Subunit 1 gene (",

    "abstract": "We compared milk volumes, skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding by the mothers of very preterm twins and singleton infants born at 28-32\u2009weeks of gestation.\nThis Norwegian longitudinal prospective comparative study was carried out in two neonatal intensive care units: one with single family rooms and one open bay unit. It comprised 49 singleton infants, 28 twins and their mothers. The mothers' milk volume and direct breastfeeding were recorded from birth until 4 months' of corrected age. They also answered the breastfeeding self-efficacy scale and skin-to-skin contact was recorded.\nThe mothers of preterm twins produced doubled the volume of expressed milk at day 14, compared to the mothers of singletons (mean 816\u2009\u00b1\u2009430\u2009mL vs. 482\u2009\u00b1\u2009372\u2009mL, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and this difference was still sustained at 34\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks/days (p\u2009<\u20090.02). Mothers of twins had their first breastfeeding attempt later than mothers of singletons (median of 133\u2009h compared to 56 (p\u2009<\u20090.002). Preterm twins received less daily skin-to-skin contact (mean 157\u2009\u00b1\u200966\u2009min each vs. 244\u2009\u00b1\u2009109) (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There were no differences in receiving mother's own milk, exclusively direct breastfeeding or perceived breastfeeding self-efficacy.\nBreastfeeding was initiated as successfully in preterm twins as singletons as the mothers' milk production doubled.",

    "abstract": "Computational models are being explored to simulate in silico the efficacy and safety of drug candidates and medical devices. Disease models that are based on patients' profiling data are being produced to represent interactomes of genes or proteins and to infer causality in the pathophysiology, which makes it possible to mimic the impact of drugs on relevant targets. Virtual patients designed from medical records as well as digital twins are generated to simulate specific organs and to predict treatment efficacy at the individual patient level. As the acceptance of digital evidence by regulators grows, predictive artificial intelligence (AI)-based models will support the design of confirmatory trials in humans and will accelerate the development of efficient drugs and medical devices.",

Data were analyzed by group-based trajectory modeling. Associations of family-related life events with trajectory groups were estimated by multinomial logistic regression.\nMost participants had no or low levels of LMM. Individuals who stayed married over time or changed from single without children to married with children had a decreased risk of LMM. The risk of LMM over time was higher among individuals who changed from married to being single.\nBeing or getting married as well as having children decreases the risk of LMM while divorce is a risk factor for LMM.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we examine whether there is genetic overlap between personality traits and political participation, interest, and efficacy. We make several contributions to the literature. First, we use new data from a large sample of twins from Denmark to examine the link between genes, the Big Five traits, and political behavior. Previous research in this area has not examined the Danish context. Second, because our measures have some overlap with those used in previous studies, we are able to examine whether previous findings replicate in a different sample. Finally, we extend the literature by examining the possible genetic link between some personality and political traits that have not yet been explored. Overall, we find that genes account for a fairly large share of the correlation between two of the Big Five personality traits (openness and extraversion), political participation, and political interest. Thus, most of the relationship between these personality traits and our measures of political behavior can be accounted for by a common underlying genetic component.",

    "abstract": "Whether the decline of birth weight (BW) reported in developed countries in the early 2000s is ongoing remains unknown. Furthermore, despite recent sharp increases in twin births, comparing secular trends of BW between singletons and twins is difficult, as studies have rarely examined secular trends of BW in twins and singletons simultaneously. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the most recent 20-year trends (2000-2020) of BW in twins and singletons in South Korea. Annual natality files from 2000 to 2020 obtained from the Korean Statistical Information Service were analyzed. A yearly decrease of BW was 3 g among singletons and 5 to 6 g in twins from 2000 to 2020, indicating a widening gap of BW between twins and singletons with increasing years. Gestational age (GA) also decreased in twins and singletons with yearly decreases of 0.28 days in singletons and 0.41 days in twins. Whereas BW decreased in term (GA \u2265 37 weeks), and very preterm groups (28 weeks \u2264 GA < 32 weeks) from 2000 to 2020 in twins and singletons, it increased in moderate to late preterm (32 weeks \u2264 GA < 37 weeks) groups, indicating a non-linear relationship between BW and GA. The prevalence of macrosomia (BW > 4000 g) in singletons decreased from 2000 to 2020, whereas low birth weight (LBW; BW < 2500 g) increased in twins and singletons. LBW is associated with adverse health outcomes. Effective public health strategies aiming at reduction in the incidence of LBW in the population should be developed.",

    "abstract": "Two healthy 12-year-old monozygotic twin sisters presented with strikingly similar, painless orbital masses along their frontozygomatic suture line that had been slowly enlarging since birth. The masses were clinically consistent with orbital dermoid cysts and the patients underwent excision of their lesions, with the diagnosis confirmed by histological analysis. There are prior case reports of both nasal and ovarian dermoid cysts in twins, however, no prior case of orbital dermoid cysts in twins have been described. These dermoid cysts are generally thought to be a sporadic disorder of embryogenesis, yet the authors' case suggests genetics may play a role in the underlying etiology of dermoid cysts.",

    "abstract": "In perinatal medicine, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is one of the greatest challenges. The etiology of IUGR is multifactorial, but most cases are thought to arise from placental insufficiency. However, identifying the placental cause of IUGR can be difficult due to numerous confounding factors. Selective IUGR (sIUGR) would be a good model to investigate how impaired placentation affects fetal development, as the growth discordance between monochorionic twins cannot be explained by confounding genetic or maternal factors. Herein, we constructed and analyzed the placental proteomic profiles of IUGR twins and normal cotwins. Specifically, we identified a total of 5481 proteins, of which 233 were differentially expressed (57 up-regulated and 176 down-regulated) in IUGR twins. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) are mainly associated with cardiovascular system development and function, organismal survival, and organismal development. Notably, 34 DEPs are significantly enriched in angiogenesis, and diminished placental angiogenesis in IUGR twins has been further elaborately confirmed. Moreover, we found decreased expression of metadherin (MTDH) in the placentas of IUGR twins and demonstrated that MTDH contributes to placental angiogenesis and fetal growth in vitro. Collectively, our findings reveal the comprehensive proteomic signatures of placentas for sIUGR twins, and the DEPs identified may provide in-depth insights into the pathogenesis of placental dysfunction and subsequent impaired fetal growth.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins are considered to be genetically identical in that they have the same genomic DNA sequences in theory, and thus cannot be differentiated using forensic standard STR-based DNA profiling. However, a recent study employed deep sequencing to explore extremely rare mutations in the nuclear genome and reported that the mutation analysis could be applied to differentiate between MZ twins. Compared with the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) exhibits higher mutation rates due to fewer DNA repair mechanisms in the mitochondrial genome (mtGenome) and the lack of proofreading capability of the mtDNA polymerase. In a previous study, we used Illumina ultra-deep sequencing to describe point heteroplasmy (PHP) and nucleotide variant of the mtGenomes in venous blood samples of MZ twins. In the present study, we characterized minor differences of the mtGenomes in three tissue samples from seven sets of MZ twins using Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing (Thermo Fisher Ion S5 XL system) and commercialized mtGenome sequencing kit (Precision ID mtDNA Whole Genome Panel). PHP was observed in blood samples from one set of MZ twins and in saliva samples from two sets of twins, but it presented in hair shaft samples from all seven sets of MZ twins. Overall, the coding region of the mtGenome exhibits more PHPs than the control region. The results of this study have further attested the competence of mtGenome sequencing in differentiating between MZ twins, and that among the three kinds of samples tested, hair shaft is more likely to accumulate minor differences in the mtGenomes of MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "Supply chains of fresh fruit must maintain a very narrow window of hygrothermal conditions after harvest. Any excursions outside this range can markedly lower the consumer acceptability of the fruit. However, the loss in fruit quality and marketability largely remains invisible to stakeholders throughout the supply chain. Here we developed a physics-based digital twin of citrus fruit to pinpoint when, why and to what extent fruit quality and marketability are reduced. Sensor data on 47 commercial shipments are thereby translated into actionable metrics for supply chain stakeholders by mapping the variability using principal component analysis. We unveiled a large spread (between 3% and 60%) in the shipments for different metrics of quality and marketability. Half of the shipments currently lie outside the ideal trade-off range between maintaining quality, killing fruit fly larvae and avoiding chilling injury. The digital twin technology opens the possibility to obtain the real-time coupling with sensor data to monitor food quality and marketability.",

    "abstract": "The last decade saw the emergence of highly autonomous, flexible, re-configurable Cyber-Physical Systems. Research in this domain has been enhanced by the use of high-fidelity simulations, including Digital Twins, which are virtual representations connected to real assets. Digital Twins have been used for process supervision, prediction, or interaction with physical assets. Interaction with Digital Twins is enhanced by Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, and Industry 5.0-focused research is evolving with the involvement of the human aspect in Digital Twins. This paper aims to review recent research on Human-Centric Digital Twins (HCDTs) and their enabling technologies. A systematic literature review is performed using the VOSviewer keyword mapping technique. Current technologies such as motion sensors, biological sensors, computational intelligence, simulation, and visualization tools are studied for the development of HCDTs in promising application areas. Domain-specific frameworks and guidelines are formed for different HCDT applications that highlight the workflow and desired outcomes, such as the training of AI models, the optimization of ergonomics, the security policy, task allocation, etc. A guideline and comparative analysis for the effective development of HCDTs are created based on the criteria of Machine Learning requirements, sensors, interfaces, and Human Digital Twin inputs.",

    "abstract": "Medical digital twins, which represent medical assets, play a crucial role in connecting the physical world to the metaverse, enabling patients to access virtual medical services and experience immersive interactions with the real world. One serious disease that can be diagnosed and treated using this technology is cancer. However, the digitalization of such diseases for use in the metaverse is a highly complex process. To address this, this study aims to use machine learning (ML) techniques to create real-time and reliable digital twins of cancer for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The study focuses on four classical ML techniques that are simple and fast for medical specialists without extensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) knowledge, and meet the requirements of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in terms of latency and cost. The case study focuses on breast cancer (BC), the second most prevalent form of cancer worldwide. The study also presents a comprehensive conceptual framework to illustrate the process of creating digital twins of cancer, and demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of these digital twins in monitoring, diagnosing, and predicting medical parameters.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between genetic and environmental impacts on dental and facial morphology has been widely analyzed, but little is known about their relative contributions to airway morphology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic and environmental influences on the cephalometric variables of airway morphology in a group of postpubertal twins with completed craniofacial growth.\nThe materials comprised lateral head cephalograms of 94 pairs of twins (50 monozygotic, 44 dizygotic) with completed craniofacial growth. Zygosity was determined using 15 specific DNA markers. The computerized cephalometric analysis included 22 craniofacial, hyoideal, pharyngeal structural linear and angular variables. Genetic analysis and heritability estimation were performed using maximum likelihood genetic structural equation modeling (GSEM). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess the correlations between cephalometric measurement variables.\nUpper airway dimensions showed moderate to high genetic determination (SPPW-SPP and U-MPW: a\nThe dimensions of the upper airway are strongly determined by genes, while the parameters of the lower airway depend mainly on environmental factors.\nThe protocol has been approved by the Kaunas Regional Ethical Committee (No. BE - 2-41., May 13, 2020).",

    "abstract": "We highlight the recent advances in home monitoring of patients with asthma, and show that these advances converge towards the implementation of digital twin systems.\nConnected devices for asthma are increasingly numerous, reliable and effective: new electronic monitoring devices extend to nebulizers and spacers, are able to assess the quality of the inhalation technique, and to identify asthma attack triggers when they include a geolocation function; environmental data can be acquired from databases and refined by wearable air quality sensors; smartwatches are better validated. Connected devices are increasingly integrated into global monitoring systems. At the same time, machine learning techniques open up the possibility of using the large amount of data collected to obtain a holistic assessment of asthma patients, and social robots and virtual assistants can help patients in the daily management of their asthma.\nAdvances in the internet of things, machine learning techniques and digital patient support tools for asthma are paving the way for a new era of research on digital twins in asthma.",

    "abstract": "Perinatal outcomes of twin pregnancies are determined by several factors, such as gestational age (GA), chorionicity, and discordance at birth. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the association of chorionicity and discordance with neonatal and neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twin infants from uncomplicated pregnancy. Data of very preterm twin infants who were both live-born between 2014 and 2019 on the chorionicity of the twin, diagnosis of the twin-to-twin syndrome (TTTS), weight discordance at birth, and neonatal and neurodevelopmental outcomes at\u00a024\u00a0months of corrected age (CA) were collected. Of the 204 twin infants analyzed, 136 were dichorionic (DC) and 68 were monochorionic (MC), including 15 pairs with TTTS. After adjusting for GA, brain injury, including severe intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia, was mostly found in the MC with TTTS group, with a higher incidence of cerebral palsy and motor delay at CA 24\u00a0months. After excluding TTTS, multivariable analysis showed no association between chorionicity and neonatal and developmental outcomes, whereas small infants among co-twins (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.33, 95% confidence interval 1.03-10.74) and greater discordance (%) of weight at birth (aOR 1.04, 1.00-1.07) were associated with neurodevelopmental impairment. Monochorionicity might not determine adverse outcomes among very preterm twins from uncomplicated pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Providing increasingly personalized treatments to patients is a major goal of precision medicine, and digital twins are an emerging paradigm to support this goal. A clinical digital twin is a digital representation of a patient and can be used to deliver personalized treatment recommendations. However, the centralized data collection to support and train digital twin models is already brushing up against patient privacy restrictions. We posit that the use of federated learning, an approach to decentralized machine learning model training, can support digital twins\u2019 performance for clinical applications. We emphasize that the combination of the two could alleviate privacy concerns while bolstering machine learning model performance and resulting predictions.",

    "abstract": "The growing demand for personalized medicine we are currently witnessing has given rise to more in-depth research in the field of biomarker discovery and, thus, in biological banks that hold the ability to process, collect, store, and distribute \"high-quality\" biological specimens. However, the notion of \"specimen quality\" is subject to change with technological advancements. In this perspective, we propose that the notion of sample quality should shift from a broad definition of \"high-quality\" to a \"fit-for-purpose\" concept more suitable for precision medicine studies. Digital twins are a digital replica of real entities. These are largely adopted in any digitalized domain and are currently finding applications in biomedicine. The adoption of digital twins for biosamples, proposed in this paper, can provide prompt information about the whole lifecycle of the physical twin (i.e., the biosample) and substantially extend the possible matching criteria between the available samples and the researchers' and physicians' requests. This fine-tuning matching could greatly contribute to improving the \"fit-for-purpose\" quality, not only for studies based on current needs, but also to improve the identification of the best available samples in future situations, determined by the evolution of technologies and biosciences. Assuming and exploiting a data-science view in our biobank perspective, the more (accurate) data there are available, the more information can be extrapolated from them, the more opportunities there are for matching future, currently unknown, needs. This should be a mandatory principle that the 'time machines' called biobanks should follow.",

    "abstract": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) during pregnancy is rare and difficult to treat. To the best of our knowledge, there is little precedent for successful treatment with combined chemotherapeutic agents without affecting delivery. The present study reported the case of a 31-year-old woman pregnant with twins who presented to the antenatal service at 13-week gestational age with complaints of vaginal bleeding, lower abdominal pain, bleeding gums and skin ecchymosis, and was eventually diagnosed with APL. After treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO)-based induction regimen, the patient achieved a complete remission (CR) and delivered two healthy male infants at 34 weeks of gestation. The use of ATRA and ATO for the treatment of APL is controversial due to teratogenic effects and lethal retinoic acid syndrome. However, the patient demonstrated that the chemotherapy regimen with ATRA and ATO during the second and third trimesters can result in a sustainable remission and successful pregnancy outcome.",

    "abstract": "We describe the management of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome in monozygotic female twins with congenital cataracts, exudative retinal detachments, and 1 case of corneal descemetocele with associated dellen and subsequent perforation.\nThis study was a case report and review of the literature.\nTwins 1 and 2 exhibited all 7 cardinal characteristics of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, presenting with spontaneous lenticular resorption, anterior uveitis, and glaucoma. They underwent bilateral cataract extraction with near total capsulectomy. Both twins experienced recurrent glaucoma, for which twin 1 underwent successful endocyclophotocoagulation in both eyes and twin 2 in the left eye alone. The fellow eye developed 2 sites of perilimbal corneal descemetoceles with associated dellen at the inferotemporal limbal corneal junction leading to spontaneous perforation of 1 site, requiring a full-thickness corneal graft. Both twins developed recurrent bilateral exudative retinal detachments unresponsive to oral prednisolone. Twin 1's last best-corrected visual acuity with aphakic spectacles was 20/260 in the right eye and 20/130 in the left eye at age 4 years and 8 months. Twin 2's last best-corrected visual acuity was 20/130 in each eye at age 4 years and 11 months, over a year after right eye penetrating keratoplasty.\nWe describe 2 rare cases of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome in monozygotic twins complicated by corneal perforation requiring penetrating keratoplasty in 1 eye of 1 twin. Although corneal opacities have been described in this condition, this is the first case of corneal descemetocele in Hallermann-Streiff syndrome. The cornea was stabilized with a relatively favorable visual outcome over 1 year later.",

Research with twins and triplets with autism offers a unique opportunity to gain a clear picture of the play behaviors of children with autism because twins and triplets share many similarities (age, access to toys, etc.). Through semistructured interviews, this descriptive phenomenological study aimed to describe the active play behaviors of 19 twins and triplets with autism from the perspective of their parents (N = 9). The interviews revealed two main themes: (a)\u00a0parents' descriptions of active play and (b)\u00a0parents' descriptions of social play. The results reveal the diverse active and social play behaviors of twins and triplets with autism; parents described their children's play behavior when engaging in sensory, indoor, outdoor, and organized play. These results suggest that children with autism may be meeting the definition of active play in nontraditional ways.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the advancement in process analytical technology\u00a0and artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled the generation of enormous culture data sets from biomanufacturing processes that produce various recombinant therapeutic proteins (RTPs), such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Thus, now it is very important to exploit them for the enhanced reliability, efficiency, and consistency of the RTP-producing\u00a0culture processes and for the reduced incipient or abrupt faults. It is achievable by AI-based data-driven models (DDMs), which allow us to correlate biological and process conditions and cell culture states. In this work, we provide practical guidelines for choosing the best combination of model elements to design and implement successful DDMs for given hypothetical in-line data sets during mAb-producing Chinese hamster ovary\u00a0cell culture, as such enabling us to forecast dynamic behaviors of culture performance such as viable cell density, mAb titer as well as glucose, lactate and ammonia concentrations. To do so, we created DDMs that balance computational load with model accuracy and reliability by identifying the best combination of multistep ahead forecasting strategies, input features, and AI algorithms, which is potentially applicable to implementation of interactive DDM within bioprocess digital twins. We believe this systematic study can help bioprocess engineers start developing predictive DDMs with their own data sets and learn how their cell cultures behave in near future, thereby rendering proactive decision possible.",

Case reports of families affected with CLE imply a genetic etiology. However, the genetic contributions have not been well-described. We present a case of CLE in a monozygotic twin brother with respiratory distress diagnosed with right upper lobe (RUL) CLE and treated with a lobectomy. His asymptomatic twin brother was screened prophylactically, found to have RUL CLE and subsequently underwent a lobectomy. Our report provides further evidence supporting the genetic predisposition and potential benefit of early screening for CLE in comparable scenarios.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate long-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes of discordant twins delivered at term.\nRetrospective cohort study.\nNationwide (Republic of Korea).\nAll twin children delivered at term between 2007 and 2010.\nThe study population was divided into two groups according to inter-twin birthweight discordancy: the 'concordant twin group', twin pairs with inter-twin birthweight discordancy less than 20%; and the 'discordant twin group', twin pairs with inter-twin birthweight discordancy of 20% or more. The risk of long-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes was compared between the concordant twin group and the discordant twin group. Long-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes between smaller and larger twin children within twin pairs were further analysed. The composite adverse neurodevelopmental outcome was defined as the presence of at least one of the following: motor developmental delay, cognitive developmental delay, autism spectrum disorders/attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, tics/stereotypical behaviour or epileptic/febrile seizure.\nLong-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcome.\nOf 22\u2009468 twin children (11\u2009234 pairs) included, 3412 (15.19%) twin children were discordant. The risk of composite adverse neurodevelopmental outcome was higher in the discordant twin group than in the concordant twin group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.24). The long-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes were not significantly different between smaller and larger twin children in discordant twin pairs (adjusted HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81-1.28).\nIn twin pairs delivered at term, an inter-twin birthweight discordancy of 20% or greater was associated with long-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes; and long-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes were not significantly different in smaller or larger twin children in discordant twin pairs.",

    "abstract": "Biological and genetic factors, as well as contextual influences, contribute to the etiology of externalizing behaviors in children and adolescents. The current project used a longitudinal design to examine how individual vulnerability for externalizing behavior is influenced by the interplay among biological/genetic and environmental factors, and how this occurs across development. We investigated the influence of dopamine receptor D4 genotype (DRD4), child temperament, and household chaos on children's externalizing behaviors using a sample of twins/triplets tested at the ages of 4 and 5\u00a0years (n\u00a0=\u00a0229), including a subset of these who were tested again in middle childhood (ages 7-13 years; n\u00a0=\u00a0174). Multilevel linear regression modeling demonstrated that the DRD4-7repeat genotype, 4-year-old negative affectivity, and household chaos at the age of 4 years were related to 5-year-old externalizing behaviors. Stability in externalizing behaviors from the age of 5 years to middle childhood was demonstrated. A significant interaction between DRD4 and household chaos showed that children with no 7-repeat DRD4 alleles had significantly higher levels of externalizing in homes with extremely low levels of parent-reported chaos, suggesting a \"goodness-of-fit\" pattern of gene-environment interaction. These findings suggest that risk for childhood externalizing behaviors is likely multifaceted and differs across developmental periods.",

    "abstract": "The Twin Birth Study showed no differences in major severe adverse neonatal outcomes between those with planned vaginal delivery and those with planned cesarean delivery.\nThis was a secondary analysis of the Twin Birth Study in which mild neonatal morbidities, not previously reported, were compared between parturients with planned cesarean deliveries and those with planned vaginal delivery in twin births.\nThis was a secondary analysis of the Twin Birth Study. In this study, women with a twin pregnancy at 32+0/7 to 38+6/7 weeks of gestation with the first twin in cephalic presentation and with an estimated weight between 1500 and 4000 g were randomized to either planned cesarean delivery or planned vaginal delivery. The primary outcome of this study was a composite mild neonatal outcome of respiratory and neurologic morbidities and neonatal intensive care unit admission that were not reported in the original Twin Birth Study at 34+0/7 to 38+6/7 weeks of gestation. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with the composite adverse neonatal outcomes. Neonatal outcomes were further stratified by gestational age at delivery and by actual mode of delivery.\nA total of 1304 women and 1326 women were randomly assigned to planned cesarean delivery and planned vaginal delivery, respectively. Demographic and obstetrical characteristics were similar between the study groups. The rate of cesarean delivery was 90.1% in the planned cesarean delivery group and 40.1% in the planned vaginal delivery group. There was no significant difference in the primary composite outcome between the groups (10.6% vs 11.3%; P=.45) neither by planned mode of delivery nor by actual mode of delivery. Stratification by gestational age found a lower rate of the primary outcomes at \u226538+0/7 weeks of gestation in the planned cesarean delivery group when compared with the planned vaginal delivery group (4.8% vs 10.8%, respectively; P=.02). Furthermore, a lower risk for some individual outcomes was reported in the planned cesarean delivery group when compared with the planned vaginal delivery group, including intraventricular hemorrhage stage 1 to 2 (0.2% vs 0.6%; P<.05), low Apgar scores (0.8% vs 2.3%; P<.05), pH <7.0 (0.3 vs 1%; P<.05), and assisted ventilation needed at delivery (0.4% vs 0.9%; P<.05).\nIn twin deliveries, with the first twin in the cephalic presentation, composite mild neonatal morbidity was not affected by the planned mode of delivery. These findings reinforce the original results of the Twin Birth Study. Nevertheless, an increased composite outcome after 38 weeks' gestation and a higher risk for some individual morbidities in the planned vaginal delivery group might be viewed as a concerning signal for the safety of vaginal delivery in twin deliveries and requires further research.",

These findings reinforce the original results of the Twin Birth Study. Nevertheless, an increased composite outcome after 38 weeks' gestation and a higher risk for some individual morbidities in the planned vaginal delivery group might be viewed as a concerning signal for the safety of vaginal delivery in twin deliveries and requires further research.",

There was no significant difference in the primary composite outcome between the groups (10.6% vs 11.3%; P=.45) neither by planned mode of delivery nor by actual mode of delivery. Stratification by gestational age found a lower rate of the primary outcomes at \u226538+0/7 weeks of gestation in the planned cesarean delivery group when compared with the planned vaginal delivery group (4.8% vs 10.8%, respectively; P=.02). Furthermore, a lower risk for some individual outcomes was reported in the planned cesarean delivery group when compared with the planned vaginal delivery group, including intraventricular hemorrhage stage 1 to 2 (0.2% vs 0.6%; P<.05), low Apgar scores (0.8% vs 2.3%; P<.05), pH <7.0 (0.3 vs 1%; P<.05), and assisted ventilation needed at delivery (0.4% vs 0.9%; P<.05).",

    "abstract": "Reared-apart twin studies are a powerful means for identifying the relative contributions of heredity and environment to variation in human physical and behavioural traits. One such characteristic is handedness, for which it has long been noted that approximately 20% of twin pairs are comprised of one right-handed cotwin and one left-handed cotwin. Reared-together twin studies suggest a slightly greater concordance in monozygotic (MZT) than dizygotic (DZT) twins, implying that genetics influences hand preference. We report here two studies of handedness in reared-apart twins. Study 1 synthesizes the available data and estimates that at least N\u00a0=\u00a0560 same-sex reared-apart twin pairs (for which zygosity is known with reasonable confidence) have been identified. Of these, handedness data are available for both members of n\u00a0=\u00a0415 pairs. We observed similar levels of concordance/discordance for reared-apart monozygotic (MZA) and dizygotic (DZA) twins. However, although direction of handedness (right or left) has frequently been examined, strength of handedness (strong or weak) has not. Study 2 examined strength of hand preference and relative hand skill, as well as right- and left-hand speed, information available for participants in the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart (MISTRA). We provide evidence of heritability for right-hand and left-hand speed. We also found hand preference strength was more alike than chance in DZA, but not MZA, twins. Findings are discussed in relation to genetic and environmental influences on human handedness.",

    "abstract": "The rate of kidney function decline is different for each individual regardless of any difference in the medical histories. This study set out to identify the risk factors for high discordance in kidney function decline in an identical twin cohort.\nThis study included 333 identical twins from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study who were categorized into two groups according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline: the slow and rapid progressor groups. The mean differences of variables were compared between the two groups. We calculated the difference in the annual eGFR change between twins and analyzed the risk factors associated with high discordance in twins who had > 5 mL/min/1.73 m2 /yr of the intra-twin difference in the annual eGFR decline. Identical twins with diabetes and baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded.\nThe high discordance twins showed significant differences in body mass index; waist-to-hip ratio; total body fat percentage; and levels of blood hemoglobin, serum fasting glucose, albumin, triglyceride, and uric acid; however, there were no differences in low discordance twins. Multivariable logistic regression showed that blood hemoglobin level is the only significant factor associated with high discordance of eGFR decline in twins.\nBlood hemoglobin level may play a role in the individual differences in kidney function decline.",

    "abstract": "Risk of sleep disturbances depends on individuals' personality, and a large body of evidence indicates that individuals prone to neuroticism, impulsivity, and (low) extraversion are more likely to experience them. Origins of these associations are unclear, but common genetic background may play an important role. Participants included 405 twin pairs (mean age of 54\u2009years; 59% female) from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) who reported on their personality traits (broad and specific), as well as sleep disturbances (problems with falling asleep, staying asleep, waking early, and feeling unrested). Uni- and bivariate biometric decompositions evaluated contributions of genetic and environmental factors to associations between personality and poor sleep, as well as unique contributions from individual traits. Neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, and aggressiveness were the strongest phenotypic predictors of poor sleep. Genetic sources of covariance were about twice as large as non-shared environmental sources, and only shared genetic background accounted for links between aggressiveness and poor sleep. Neuroticism and extraversion accounted for most of the genetic overlap between personality and sleep disturbances. The findings shed light on developmental antecedents of ties between personality and poor sleep, suggesting a larger role of common genetic background than idiosyncratic life experiences. The results also suggest that emotion-related traits play the most important role for poor sleep, compared to other personality traits, and may partially account for genetic associations with other traits.",

    "abstract": "Residential regions may impact the possibilities to achieve a sustainable working life (SWL, i.e. not having interruptions due to sickness absence, disability pension or unemployment) due to disparities in social security and labour market. We aimed to investigate concurrent trajectories of regions and SWL among Swedish twins.\nNational register data were used for the degree of SWL in each year, old-age pension, emigration, death and residential regions classified in three categories (cities; towns and suburbs; or rural areas) of Swedish twins in 1998-2016 (n\u2009=\u200980\u2009398). Group-based multi-trajectory modelling and multinomial regression for relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were calculated.\nThe six-group solution had the best fit to data with trajectories: stable living in towns and suburbs with SWL (33.8%); stable living in cities with SWL (22.1%); stable living in towns and suburbs with increasing SWL (13.9%); stable living in towns and suburbs with lack of SWL (13.2%); stable living towns and suburbs with decreasing SWL (8.8%); and stable living towns and suburbs with decreasing and ultimately lack of SWL (8.3%). Age and being woman increased and being married and higher education decreased the likelihood of belonging to groups 2-6 (vs. 1).\nThe simultaneous assessment of trajectories of three residential regions and SWL indicated that most people in Sweden seem to live continuously over time in towns and suburbs, but the degree of SWL may vary. More fine-grained assessment of residential regions would be needed to clarify the associations with SWL.",

    "abstract": "Being born with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) was associated with subsequent health issues later in life. However, the underlying role of adipokines in IUGR is unknown.\nTo measure the adiponectin and leptin concentrations in the cord blood of monochorionic (MC) twins with selective IUGR (sIUGR) and evaluate their associations with childhood growth trajectories.\nCord blood samples were collected from 22 pairs of MC twins with sIUGR and 20 pairs of normal MC twins. Adiponectin and leptin concentrations in cord blood were determined by ELISA. Data regarding perinatal outcomes and infantile growth trajectories from birth to 24\u2009months were obtained.\nOnly cord blood adiponectin concentrations were associated with IUGR (\u03b2 -1.51, 95% CI -2.45, -0.57, p\u2009=\u20090.002), and cord blood leptin concentrations were significantly lower in sIUGR twins compared to normal twins (2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 vs. 6.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Adiponectin concentrations were negatively associated with height increments from birth to 6\u2009months (\u03b2 -0.28, 95% CI -0.51, -0.06, p\u2009=\u20090.015). Leptin concentrations were negatively associated with weight at 6 and 24\u2009months (\u03b2 -0.12 95% CI -0.22, -0.02, p\u2009=\u20090.002; \u03b2 -0.18 95% CI -0.33, -0.03, p\u2009=\u20090.019) and weight and height increments from birth to 6\u2009months (\u03b2 -0.17 95% CI -0.29, -0.06, p\u2009=\u20090.020; \u03b2 -0.40 95% CI -0.81, -0.01, p\u2009=\u20090.037).\nCord blood adiponectin concentrations were negatively associated with IUGR but did not predict childhood growth. Cord blood leptin concentrations were inversely associated with weight and height increments in the first 6\u2009months.",

    "abstract": "Comorbidity between depression and type 2 diabetes is thought to arise from the joint effects of psychological, behavioral, and biological processes. Studies of monozygotic twins may provide a unique opportunity for clarifying how these processes inter-relate. This paper describes the rationale, characteristics, and initial findings of a longitudinal co-twin study aimed at examining the biopsychosocial mechanisms linking depression and risk of diabetes in mid-life.\nParticipants in the Mood and Immune Regulation in Twins (MIRT) Study were recruited from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry. MIRT consisted of 94 individuals who do not have diabetes at baseline, representing 43 twin pairs (41 monozygotic and 2 dizygotic), one set of monozygotic triplets, and 5 individuals whose co-twin did not participate. A broad set of variables were assessed including \nMean age was 53 years, 68% were female, and 77% identified as white. One-third had a history of MD, and 18 sibling sets were discordant for MD. MD was associated with higher systolic (139.1 vs 132.2 mmHg, p=0.05) and diastolic BP (87.2 vs. 80.8 mmHg, p=0.002) and IL-6 (1.47 vs. 0.93 pg/mL, p=0.001). MD was not associated with BMI, HbA1c, or other immune markers. While the biological characteristics of the co-twins were significantly correlated, all within-person ICCs were higher than the within-pair correlations (e.g., HbA1c within-person ICC=0.88 vs. within-pair ICC=0.49; IL-6 within-person ICC=0.64 vs. within-pair=0.54). Among the pairs discordant for MD, depression was not substantially associated with metabolic or immune markers, but was positively associated with stress.\nTwin studies have the potential to clarify the biopsychosocial processes linking depression and diabetes, and recently completed processing of RNA samples from MIRT permits future exploration of gene expression as a potential mechanism.",

Genetic testing of the HLA haplotypes in both sisters were A*02 B*39 DRB1*04 DQB1*03\u2009:\u200902/A*24 B*35 DRB1*16 DQB1*03\u2009:\u200901.

    "abstract": "Science faces challenges in developing much-needed precision mental health treatments to accurately identify and diagnose mental health problems and the optimal treatment for each individual. Digital twins (DTs) promise to revolutionize the field of mental health, as they are doing in other fields of science, including oncology and cardiology, where they have been successfully deployed. The use of DTs in mental health is yet to be explored. In this Perspective, we lay the conceptual foundations for mental health DTs (MHDT). An MHDT is a virtual representation of an individual's mental states and processes. It is continually updated from data collected over the lifespan of the individual, and guides mental health professionals in diagnosing and treating patients based on mechanistic models and statistical and machine learning tools. The merits of MHDT are demonstrated through the example of the working alliance between the therapist and the patient, which is one of the most consistent mechanisms predicting treatment outcome.",

    "abstract": "Selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) complicates 10%-26% of monochorionic twins. Treatment options include cord coagulation, expectant management, and fetoscopic laser photocoagulation. This review compared laser to expectant management for situations when cord coagulation is not an option. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were queried for studies that compared laser to expectant management for sFGR. GRADE was used to assess quality prior to meta-analysis. A random-effects model was used to generate relative risks. Six studies were included, encompassing 299 pregnancies. One study was randomized and the remainder were retrospective cohorts. Laser is associated with more fetal deaths of the FGR twin compared to expectant management (risk ratio [RR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-4.37, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, I2\u00a0=\u00a048%). Neonatal deaths and gestational age at delivery did not differ. Laser was associated with decreased abnormal neuroimaging in the AGA twin (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07-0.97, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Neurodevelopmental outcomes did not differ, although these data are limited. Laser causes more fetal deaths of the FGR twin without altering gestational age at delivery or rates of neonatal death. The literature is heterogeneous and the level of bias is high. Randomized trials that address laser for type II sFGR are needed and should include long-term neurological outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The thin-wall heat pipe is an efficient heat transfer component that has been widely used in the field of heat dissipation of high-power electronic equipment in recent years. In this study, the orange peel morphology defect of thin-wall heat pipes after bending deformation was analyzed both for the macro-3D profile and for the micro-formation mechanism. The morphology and crystal orientations of the grains and annealing twins were carefully characterized utilizing optical metallography and the electron backscatter diffraction technique. The results show that after high-temperature sintering treatment, the matrix grains of the heat pipe are seriously coarsened and form a strong Goss texture, while certain annealing twins with the unique copper orientation are retained. The distribution of the Schmid factor value subjected to the uniaxial stress indicates that inhomogeneity in the intergranular deformation exists among the annealing twins and matrix grains. The annealing twin exhibits a \"hard-oriented\" component during the deformation; thus, it plays a role as a barrier and hinders the slipping of dislocation. As the strain accumulates, part of the annealing twins may protrude from the surface of the heat pipe, forming a large-scale fluctuation of the surface as the so-called \"orange peel\" morphology. The 3D profile shows the bulged twins mostly perpendicular to the drawing direction, about 200-300 in width and 10-20 \u03bcm in height.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest a bidirectional association between atrial fibrillation and breast cancer. This study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to elucidate the prevalence of atrial fibrillation among breast cancer patients, and the bidirectional association between atrial fibrillation and breast cancer.\nPubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched to identify studies reporting the prevalence, incidence, and bidirectional association between atrial fibrillation and breast cancer. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022313251). Levels of evidence and recommendations were assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).\nTwenty-three studies (17 retrospective cohort studies, 5 case-control studies and 1 cross-sectional study) involving 8,537,551 participants were included. Among patients with breast cancer, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 3% (11 studies; 95% CI: 0.6 to 7.1%) and the incidence was 2.7% (6 studies; 95% CI: 1.1 to 4.9%). Breast cancer was associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (5 studies; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.82, I\nAtrial fibrillation is not uncommon in patients with breast cancer and vice versa. There is a bidirectional association between atrial fibrillation (low certainty) and breast cancer (moderate certainty).",

    "abstract": "Single-cell 'omics methodology has yielded unprecedented insights based largely on data-centric informatics for reducing, and thus interpreting, massive datasets. In parallel, parsimonious mathematical modeling based on abstractions of pathobiology has also yielded major insights into inflammation and immunity, with these models being extended to describe multi-organ disease pathophysiology as the basis of 'digital twins' and in silico clinical trials. The integration of these distinct methods at scale can drive both basic and translational advances, especially in the context of critical illness, including diseases such as COVID-19. Here, I explore achievements and argue the challenges that are inherent to the integration of data-driven and mechanistic modeling approaches, highlighting the potential of modeling-based strategies for rational immune system reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies can be complicated by birthweight (BW) discordance. We analyzed the impact of BW discordance on clinical outcomes of very-low-birthweight (VLBW) twins.\nThe study population was preterm infants in the Korean Neonatal Network registry. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the contribution of BW discordance on respiratory morbidities and mortality of VLBW infants. Also, we assessed the effect of small for gestational age (SGA) on morbidity and mortality in discordant twins (DTs) and compared separately the clinical outcomes of smaller and larger DTs with different singletons matched for perinatal factors including BW percentile.\nA total of 935 twin pairs [1548 concordant twins (CTs) and 322 DTs] were included. BW discordance was associated with increased odds of moderate bronchopulmonary dysplasia, mortality, and composite outcomes. Compared with the CTs, the smaller, but not larger, DTs had greater odds of morbidities and mortality. DTs had higher odds of adverse neonatal outcome when combined with SGA. Meanwhile, DTs had morbidities and mortality similar to singletons matched for BW percentile.\nBW discordance in VLBW twins adversely affects neonatal mortality or respiratory morbidity which is predominant in smaller DTs. The impact of BW discordance could be increased through SGA.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is highly prevalent yet a more complete understanding of the interplay between genes and probable environmental risk factors, such as night work, remains lagging. Using a discordant twin pair design, we examined the association between night shift work and breast cancer risk, controlling for familial confounding. Shift work pattern was prospectively assessed by mailed questionnaires among 5,781 female twins from the Older Finnish Twin Cohort. Over the study period (1990-2018), 407 incident breast cancer cases were recorded using the Finnish Cancer Registry. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for potential confounders. Within-pair co-twin analyses were employed in 57 pairs to account for potential familial confounding. Compared to women who worked days only, women with shift work that included night shifts had a 1.58-fold higher risk of breast cancer (HR\u2009=\u20091.58; 95%CI, 1.16-2.15, highest among the youngest women i.e. born 1950-1957, HR\u2009=\u20092.08; 95%CI, 1.32-3.28), whereas 2-shift workers not including night shifts, did not (HR\u2009=\u20090.84; 95%CI, 0.59-1.21). Women with longer sleep (average sleep duration\u2009>\u20098\u00a0h/night) appeared at greatest risk of breast cancer if they worked night shifts (HR\u2009=\u20092.91; 95%CI, 1.55-5.46; P",

    "abstract": "Pygopagus twin is a rare congenital malformation with a worldwide incidence of 1in 200,000. Few literature reports are published regarding the matter. In some cases, neuromonitoring is essential for safe surgical separation. We believe it is important to share our challenges and nuances in order to minimize obstacles one might encounter. We utilized neuromonitoring during our separation of both twins, and we planned a multidisciplinary approach and efficient communication system with the other teams in order to plan a successful, safe, and timely separation of the twins. We seek to highlight not our success but rather the obstacles and challenges we encountered during the separation of pygopagus twins in our institute using neuromonitoring for future reference.",

    "abstract": "Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease and the most common hereditary disease leading to end-stage renal disease in children and adolescents. The NPHP1 gene was the first NPHP gene to be discovered. Pathogenic variation of the NPHP1 gene can cause juvenile renal wasting disease type 1.\nHere, we report the first case of living related kidney transplantation of monozygotic twins with NPHP1 nephronophthisis in China; one of these cases involved cross-blood type kidney transplantation. Our experience shows that patients with NPHP1 nephronophthisis have almost no risk recurrent kidney disease following living related kidney transplantation and genetic testing. The two twins recovered well without any complications.\nThis is the first report of living related kidney transplantation of monozygotic twins with heterozygous deletion of the NPHP1 gene in a Chinese family with NPHP. In addition, genetic testing provides an efficient means of evaluating the safety of living related kidney transplantation in patients with NPHP1 nephronophthisis.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genetic factors affecting the regulation of the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene and estimating the genetic contribution of the MGMT gene through within-pair correlation in monozygotic twin pairs is of particular importance in various types of cancer such as glioblastoma. We used gene expression data in whole blood from 448 monozygotic twins from the Middle Age Danish Twins (MADT) study to investigate genetic regulation of the MGMT gene by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the variation in MGMT expression. Additionally, we estimated within-pair dependence measures of the expression values looking for the genetic influence of significant identified genes. We identified 243 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly (p\u202f<\u202f5e-8) associated with expression of MGMT, all located on chromosome 10 near the MGMT gene. Of the 243 SNPs, 7 are novel cis-eQTLs. By further looking into the suggestively significant SNPs (increasing cutoff to p\u202f=\u202f1e-6), we identified 11 suggestive trans-eQTLs located on chromosome 17. These variants were in or proximal to a total of seven genes, which may regulate MGMT expression. The within-pair correlation of the expression of MGMT, TRIM37, and SEPT4 provided the upper bound genetic influence of these genes. Overall, identifying cis- or trans-acting genetic variations regulating the MGMT gene can pave the way for a better understanding of the MGMT gene function and ultimately in understanding the patient's sensitivity to therapeutic alkylating agents.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the methods used to represent loads do not differ between the characteristics that compose them or the nature of these. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to develop digital twins mirroring load models that can be used for more precise studies on power-flows and stability within the National Transmission Grid (NTG). Off-line sampling data of different electric measurements have been used in six substations of the Guayaquil (Ecuador) area. These values were organized by statistical methods and by time periods, to determine the parameters that make up the static load model. Dynamic models are also constructed for the same six substations using the analysis of current and voltage signals obtained from the substations. All data is organized to show a digital twin mirroring visual representation of the disturbances that may occur in the substation buses. A more accurate description of the static and dynamic responses can be obtained by replacing the general model that is currently used by engineers and planners with off-line sampling data. Digital twins help the electric utility businesses gather, visualise, and contextualise data from different sources, and enable to act on data, and to understand what-if modelling stability scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This work aims to explore the impact of Digital Twins Technology on industrial manufacturing in the context of Industry 5.0. A computer is used to search the Web of Science database to summarize the Digital Twins in Industry 5.0. First, the background and system architecture of Industry 5.0 are introduced. Then, the potential applications and key modeling technologies in Industry 5.0 are discussd. It is found that equipment is the infrastructure of industrial scenarios, and the embedded intelligent upgrade for equipment is a Digital Twins primary condition. At the same time, Digital Twins can provide automated real-time process analysis between connected machines and data sources, speeding up error detection and correction. In addition, Digital Twins can bring obvious efficiency improvements and cost reductions to industrial manufacturing. Digital Twins reflects its potential application value and subsequent potential value in Industry 5.0 through the prospect. It is hoped that this relatively systematic overview can provide technical reference for the intelligent development of industrial manufacturing and the improvement of the efficiency of the entire business process in the Industrial X.0 era.",

    "abstract": "Are perinatal outcomes following fresh blastocyst versus fresh cleavage stage embryo transfer (ET) different in singletons, twins, and between singleton siblings?\nSingleton babies conceived following fresh blastocyst, versus cleavage stage, ET are less likely to be small for gestational age (SGA) or to have a congenital anomaly (a result confirmed by comparing singleton siblings), while singletons born following fresh blastocyst ET were at a higher risk of being large for gestational age (LGA) than their sibling born following fresh cleavage stage ET.\nBlastocyst stage transfer is now the preferred strategy in most IVF units. Previous studies have suggested that babies conceived through blastocyst transfer are at increased risk of preterm birth and LGA.\nA national population-based retrospective cohort study was performed using linked Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) data on 130\u200a516 IVF and ICSI livebirths occurring from 103\u200a062 women between 2000 and 2017.\nWe included women who had at least one singleton livebirth resulting from IVF/ICSI fresh embryo treatment, using their own eggs and partner's sperm. A linked HFEA dataset was analysed using a multilevel framework, which accommodated repeated IVF cycles resulting in livebirths in the same woman. A population-averaged robust Poisson model was used for binary outcomes and a multinomial logistic regression model was used for categorical outcomes. Unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) (95% CI) were calculated.\nThere were 130\u200a516 livebirths in 103\u200a062 women, including 86\u200a630 singletons, 43\u200a886 twin births, and 5384 pairs of singleton siblings. In comparison with fresh cleavage stage ET, fresh blastocyst stage transfer in singletons was associated with a lower risk of low birthweight (aRR\u2009=\u20090.92; 95% CI 0.86, 0.99), lower risk of being SGA (0.83; 0.78, 0.89), and lower risk of congenital anomaly (0.79; 0.71, 0.89). This analysis did not show an increase in risk associated with preterm birth (1.00; 0.94, 1.06), high birthweight (0.99; 0.93, 1.06), LGA (0.99; 0.93, 1.05), and the chance of healthy singleton baby (1.00; 1.00, 1.02). Twins resulting from fresh blastocyst stage ET were at slightly higher risk of preterm birth (1.05; 1.02, 1.10) compared with twins conceived following fresh cleavage stage ET. There was insufficient evidence for an association with the other perinatal outcomes. Singleton siblings born following fresh blastocyst stage ET were at a higher risk of being LGA (1.57; 1.01, 2.46) and at lower risk of having a congenital anomaly (0.52; 0.28, 0.97) compared to their singleton siblings born following cleavage stage ET. There was some evidence of excess risk of preterm birth (1.42; 0.97, 2.23) associated with blastocyst stage transfer. However, we could not confirm an association between blastocyst stage ET and low birthweight (1.35; 0.81, 2.27), high birthweight (1.19; 0.80, 1.77), and the chance of being a healthy baby (0.97; 0.86, 1.09).\nThis was an observational study where we were unable to adjust for some key confounders, such as maternal smoking status and BMI, which may change from one pregnancy to another and are not recorded in the HFEA dataset.\nIn the largest study of its kind, our analysis of singleton siblings, corrected for unmeasured, non-time varying maternal factors, confirms the previously reported association between blastocyst transfer and LGA babies, and shows a reduced risk of congenital anomaly following blastocyst transfer. Our sibling analysis did not confirm a decreased risk of low birthweight following blastocyst transfer. Overall, absolute risks are low and there is insufficient evidence to challenge the practice of extended culture of embryos.\nThis project is financed by an NHS Grampian Endowment Research Grant, project number 17/052.

    "abstract": "Phase I oncology clinical trials often comprise a limited number of patients representing different disease subtypes who are divided into cohorts receiving treatment(s) at different dosing levels and schedules. Here, we leverage a previously developed quantitative systems pharmacology model of the anti-CD20/CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, mosunetuzumab, to account for different dosing regimens and patient heterogeneity in the phase I study to inform clinical dose/exposure-response relationships and to identify biological determinants of clinical response. We developed a novel workflow to generate digital twins for each patient, which together form a virtual population (VPOP) that represented variability in biological, pharmacological, and tumor-related parameters from the phase I trial. Simulations based on the VPOP predict that an increase in mosunetuzumab exposure increases the proportion of digital twins with at least a 50% reduction in tumor size by day 42. Simulations also predict a left-shift of the exposure-response in patients diagnosed with indolent compared to aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype; this increased sensitivity in indolent NHL was attributed to the lower inferred values of tumor proliferation rate and baseline T-cell infiltration in the corresponding digital twins. Notably, the inferred digital twin parameters from clinical responders and nonresponders show that the potential biological difference that can influence response include tumor parameters (tumor size, proliferation rate, and baseline T-cell infiltration) and parameters defining the effect of mosunetuzumab on T-cell activation and B-cell killing. Finally, the model simulations suggest intratumor expansion of pre-existing T-cells, rather than an influx of systemically expanded T-cells, underlies the antitumor activity of mosunetuzumab.",

    "abstract": "To determine and compare the safety and efficacy of different methods of induction of labor in twin gestations and their effect on maternal and neonatal outcomes.\nA retrospective observational cohort study was conducted at a single university-affiliated medical center. Patients with a twin gestation undergoing induction of labor at >32 + 0 weeks comprised the study group. Outcomes were compared to patients with a twin gestation at >32 + 0 weeks who went into labor spontaneously. The primary outcome was cesarean delivery. Secondary outcomes included operative vaginal delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, uterine rupture, 5 min APGAR < 7, and umbilical artery pH < 7.1. A subgroup analysis comparing outcomes for the induction of labor with oral prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), IV Oxytocin \u00b1 artificial rupture of membranes (AROM), and extra-amniotic balloon (EAB)+ IV Oxytocin was performed. Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test, ANOVA, and chi-square tests.\n268 patients who underwent induction of labor with a twin gestation comprised the study group. 450 patients with a twin gestation who went into labor spontaneously comprised the control group. There were no clinically significant differences between the groups for maternal age, gestational age, neonatal birthweight, birthweight discordancy, and non-vertex second twin. There were significantly more nulliparas in the study group compared to the control group (23.9% vs. 13.8% \nInduction of labor in twin gestations is associated with a two-fold increased risk of cesarean delivery, although this is not associated with adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. Furthermore, the method of induction of labor used does not affect the chances of success nor the rate of adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In the traditional person re-identification model, the CNN network is usually used for feature extraction. When converting the feature map into a feature vector, a large number of convolution operations are used to reduce the size of the feature map. In CNN, since the receptive field of the latter layer is obtained by convolution operation on the feature map of the previous layer, the size of this local receptive field is limited, and the computational cost is large. For these problems, combined with the self-attention characteristics of Transformer, an end-to-end person re-identification model (twinsReID) is designed that integrates feature information between levels in this article. For Transformer, the output of each layer is the correlation between its previous layer and other elements. This operation is equivalent to the global receptive field because each element needs to calculate the correlation with other elements, and the calculation is simple, so its cost is small. From these perspectives, Transformer has certain advantages over CNN's convolution operation. This paper uses Twins-SVT Transformer to replace the CNN network, combines the features extracted from the two different stages and divides them into two branches. First, convolve the feature map to obtain a fine-grained feature map, perform global adaptive average pooling on the second branch to obtain the feature vector. Then divide the feature map level into two sections, perform global adaptive average pooling on each. These three feature vectors are obtained and sent to the Triplet Loss respectively. After sending the feature vectors to the fully connected layer, the output is input to the Cross-Entropy Loss and Center-Loss. The model is verified On the Market-1501 dataset in the experiments. The mAP/rank1 index reaches 85.4%/93.7%, and reaches 93.6%/94.9% after reranking. The statistics of the parameters show that the parameters of the model are less than those of the traditional CNN model.",

    "abstract": "While the genetic and environmental underpinnings of body weight and alcohol use are fairly well-known, determinants of simultaneous changes in these traits are still poorly known. We sought to quantify the environmental and genetic components underlying parallel changes in weight and alcohol consumption and to investigate potential covariation between them.\nThe analysis comprised 4,461 adult participants (58% women) from the Finnish Twin Cohort with four measures of alcohol consumption and body mass index (BMI) over a 36-year follow-up. Trajectories of each trait were described by growth factors, defined as intercepts (i.e., baseline) and slopes (i.e., change over follow-up), using latent growth curve modeling. Growth values were used for male (190 monozygotic pairs, 293 dizygotic pairs) and female (316 monozygotic pairs, 487 dizygotic pairs) same-sex complete twin pairs in multivariate twin modeling. The variances and covariances of growth factors were then decomposed into genetic and environmental components.\nThe baseline heritabilities were similar in men (BMI: h2 = 79% [95% confidence interval: 74, 83]; alcohol consumption: h2 = 49% [32, 67]) and women (h2 = 77% [73, 81]; h2 = 45% [29, 61]). Heritabilities of BMI change were similar in men (h2 = 52% [42, 61]) and women (h2 = 57% [50, 63]), but the heritability of change in alcohol consumption was significantly higher (p = 0.03) in men (h2 = 45% [34, 54]) than in women (h2 = 31% [22, 38]). Significant additive genetic correlations between BMI at baseline and change in alcohol consumption were observed in both men (rA = -0.17 [-0.29, -0.04]) and women (rA = -0.18 [-0.31, -0.06]). Non-shared environmental factors affecting changes in alcohol consumption and BMI were correlated in men (rE = 0.18 [0.06, 0.30]). Among women, non-shared environmental factors affecting baseline alcohol consumption and the change in BMI were inversely correlated (rE = -0.11 [-0.20, -0.01]).\nBased on genetic correlations, genetic variation underlying BMI may affect changes in alcohol consumption. Independent of genetic effects, change in BMI correlates with change in alcohol consumption in men, suggesting direct effects between them.",

    "abstract": "Individuals can vary drastically in their response to the same treatment, and this heterogeneity has driven the push for more personalized medicine. Accurate and interpretable methods to identify subgroups that respond to the treatment differently from the population average are necessary to achieving this goal. The Virtual Twins (VT) method is a highly cited and implemented method for subgroup identification because of its intuitive framework. However, since its initial publication, many researchers still rely heavily on the authors' initial modeling suggestions without examining newer and more powerful alternatives. This leaves much of the potential of the method untapped. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of VT with different combinations of methods in each of its component steps, under a collection of linear and nonlinear problem settings. Our simulations show that the method choice for Step 1 of VT, in which dense models with high predictive performance are fit for the potential outcomes, is highly influential in the overall accuracy of the method, and Superlearner is a promising choice. We illustrate our findings by using VT to identify subgroups with heterogeneous treatment effects in a randomized, double-blind trial of very low nicotine content cigarettes.",

    "abstract": "Gardner's syndrome (GS) is a very rare autosomal dominant multisystem disease. Osteomas, skin and soft tissue tumors are present with gastrointestinal polyposis. The polyps have very high malignancy potentials. If prophylactic resection is not performed, colorectal cancer development is inevitable in all patients with GS. Polyposis is usually asymptomatic. Therefore, careful evaluation of extraintestinal findings of the disease is very important for early diagnosis. In this article, diagnosis and treatment of GS are presented in monozygotic twins, which have not been previously described in the literature. The diagnostic process, which started with dental complaints of one case, was carried out in an effective manner and then, prophylactic surgery was performed in twins. This article aimed to make clinicians and dentists attentive for early diagnosis of disease and to review treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is an epidemic\u00a0disease that is believed to link to other pathologies as well as\u00a0life-threatening cardiovascular pathology. Here we report a case of monozygotic twins who successfully lost weight following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy at the end of the 18-month follow-up period. We aimed to determine the factors affecting the weight loss outcome after sleeve gastrectomy in monozygotic twins. The twins' initial BMIs were 37.1 kg/m2 and 40.2 kg/m2, respectively. Twin A's excess weight loss was 48.4%, 61.3%, 80.6%, 96.8%, and 112.9% at three, six, nine, 12 and 18 months, while Twin B's in the third, sixth, ninth, 12th and 18th months was 23.1%, 41%, 51.3%, 61.5% and 71.8%. On the third, sixth, ninth, 12th, and 18th months of Twin A, the total weight loss was 15.8%, 20%, 26.3%, 31.6%, and 36.8%. In Twin B in the third, sixth, ninth, 12th, and 18th months, it was 8.7%, 15.5%, 19.4%, 23.3%, and 27.2%. When the twins were compared in terms of excess weight loss and total weight loss at 18 months, Twin A was more successful than Twin B. Especially at this point, Twin B's having a child (three years old) at a young age, her low compliance with the recommendations in the post-operative period and her difficulty in changing her lifestyle, environmental factors are as important as hereditary factors in achieving weight loss and a healthy body mass index (BMI) range.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a crucial risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease and reducing life expectancy. We aimed to detect DNA methylation (DNAm) variants potentially related to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by conducting epigenome-wide association studies in 60 and 59 Chinese monozygotic twin pairs, respectively.\nGenome-wide DNA methylation profiling in whole blood of twins was performed using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, yielding 551,447 raw CpGs. Association between DNAm of single CpG and blood pressure was tested by applying generalized estimation equation. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified by comb-P approach. Inference about Causation through Examination of Familial Confounding was utilized to perform the causal inference. Ontology enrichment analysis was performed using Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool. Candidate CpGs were quantified using Sequenom MassARRAY platform in a community population. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted using gene expression data.\nThe median age of twins was 52\u00a0years (95% range 40, 66). For SBP, 31 top CpGs (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nWe detect many DNAm variants that may be associated with blood pressure in whole blood, particularly the loci within WNT3A and COL5A1.

    "abstract": "This article examines how the New Woman's premature aging happens in tandem with patriarchal marriage at the fin de si\u00e8cle through a scrutiny of Sarah Grand's New Woman novel, The Heavenly Twins (1893/1992). The novel is a narrative of female degeneration, in which its three young and married New Woman characters become impuissant to realize the cumbersome feminized ideals of national regeneration and age or die prematurely in their twenties. Their premature decline is caused by moral and sexual degeneration of their military husbands who practice the ideology of progress at the imperial frontier. In the article, I explain how the patriarchal culture of the late Victorian society expedites women's aging process in marriage. The symptoms of mental and physical sickness experienced by the novel's Victorian wives in their twenties are a product not merely of excruciating syphilis but also the patriarchal culture. I ultimately contend that Grand unveils the other side of the male-oriented ideology of progress in criticizing the late Victorian reality where there is negligible scope for the New Woman's vision of female-led regeneration.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the\u00a0magnitude\u00a0and\u00a0timing\u00a0of\u00a0sex and gender disparities in child development by describing differences in health outcomes for male and female siblings, comparing twins to control for all aspects of life circumstances other than sex and gender.\nWe construct a repeat cross-sectional dataset of 191\u2009838 twins among 1.7 million births recorded in 214 nationally representative household surveys for 72 countries between 1990 and 2016. To test for biological or social mechanisms that might favor the health of male or female infants, we describe differences in birthweights, attained heights, weights, and survival to distinguish gestational health from care practices after each child is born.\nWe find that male fetuses grow at the expense of their co-twin, significantly reducing their sibling's birthweight and survival probabilities, but only if the other fetus is male. Female fetuses are born significantly heavier when they share the uterus with a male co-twin and have no significant difference in survival probability whether they happen to draw a male or a female co-twin. These findings demonstrate that sex-specific sibling rivalry and male frailty begin in utero, prior to gender bias after birth that typically favors male children.\nSex differences in child health may have competing effects with gender bias that occurs during childhood. Worse health outcomes for males with a male co-twin could be linked to hormone levels or male frailty, and could lead to underestimates of the effect sizes of later gender bias against girls. Gender bias favoring surviving male children may explain the lack of differences in height and weight observed for twins with either male or female co-twins.",

    "abstract": "The concept of Digital Twin is of fundamental importance to meet the main requirements of Industry 4.0. Among the standards currently available to realize Digital Twins there is the Digital Twins Definition Language. Digital Twin requires exchange of data with the real system it models and with other applications that use the digital replica of the system. In the context of Industry 4.0, a reference standard for an interoperable exchange of information between applications, is Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture. The authors believe that interoperability between Digital Twins and Open Platform Communications Unified Architectures communication standard should be enabled. For this reason, the main goal of this paper is to allow a Digital Twin based on the Digital Twins Definition Language to exchange data with any applications compliant to the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture. A proposal about the mapping from Digital Twins Definition Language to the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture will be presented. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposal, an implementation has been made by the authors, and its description will be introduced in the paper. Furthermore, the main results of the validation process accomplished on the basis of this implementation will be given.",

    "abstract": "Aiming at the real-time robust optimization problem of perishable supply-chain systems in complex environments, a real-time robust optimization scheme based on supply-chain digital twins is proposed. Firstly, based on the quantitative logical relationship between production and sales of single-chain series supply-chain system products, the state space equation of the supply-chain system with logical characteristics, structural characteristics, and quantitative characteristics was constructed, and twin data were introduced to construct the digital twins of supply chains based on the state-space equation. Secondly, the perishable supply-chain system in complex environments was regarded as an uncertain closed-loop system from the perspective of the state space equation, and then a robust H\u221e controller design strategy was proposed, and the supply-chain digital twins was used to update and correct the relevant parameters of the supply-chain system in real-time, to implement the real-time robust optimization based on the supply-chain digital twins. Finally, the simulation experiment was carried out with a cake supply-chain production as an example. The experimental results show that the real-time updating of relevant parameters through the digital twins can help enterprise managers to formulate reasonable management plans, effectively avoid the shortage problem of enterprises in the cake supply-chain system, and reduce the maximum inventory movement standard deviation of each link by 12.65%, 6.50%, and 14.87%, and the maximum production movement standard deviation by 70.21%, 56.84%, and 45.19%.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a robustness optimization method for rapid prototyping (RP) of functional artifacts based on visualized computing digital twins (VCDT). A generalized multiobjective robustness optimization model for RP of\u00a0scheme design prototype\u00a0was first built, where thermal, structural, and multidisciplinary knowledge could be integrated for visualization. To implement visualized computing, the membership function of fuzzy decision-making was optimized using a genetic algorithm. Transient thermodynamic, structural statics, and flow field analyses were conducted, especially for glass fiber composite materials, which have the characteristics of high strength, corrosion resistance, temperature resistance, dimensional stability, and electrical insulation. An electrothermal experiment was performed by measuring the temperature and changes in temperature during RP. Infrared thermographs were obtained using thermal field measurements to determine the temperature distribution. A numerical analysis of a lightweight ribbed ergonomic artifact is presented to illustrate the VCDT. Moreover, manufacturability was verified based on a thermal-solid coupled finite element analysis. The physical experiment and practice proved that the proposed VCDT provided a robust design paradigm for a layered RP between the steady balance of electrothermal regulation and manufacturing efficacy under hybrid\u00a0uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "Subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) may be a precursor to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.\nThis study aimed to examine the heritability of SCCs, correlations between SCCs and memory ability, and the influence of personality and mood on these relationships.\nParticipants were 306 twin pairs. The heritability of SCCs and the genetic correlations between SCCs and memory performance, personality, and mood scores were determined using structural equation modelling.\nSCCs were low to moderately heritable. Memory performance, personality and mood were genetically, environmentally, and phenotypically correlated with SCCs in bivariate analysis. However, in multivariate analysis, only mood and memory performance had significant correlations with SCCs. Mood appeared to be related to SCCs by an environmental correlation, whereas memory performance was related to SCCs by a genetic correlation. The link between personality and SCCs was mediated by mood. SCCs had a significant amount of both genetic and environmental variances not explained by memory performance, personality, or mood.\nOur results suggest that SCCs are influenced both by a person's mood and their memory performance, and that these determinants are not mutually exclusive. While SCCs had genetic overlap with memory performance and environmental association with mood, much of the genetic and environmental components that comprised SCCs were specific to SCCs, though these specific factors are yet to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Emergency separation of conjoined twins is performed when one twin is already dead or dying and threatens the survival of the other. The particular decision to perform an emergency separation of conjoined twins provides an ethical dilemma that needs special attention. Adding to the complexity of surgical and postsurgical management in emergency separation, ethical and sociocultural aspects further complicate decision-making.\nFrom 1987 to 2022, 18 conjoined twin separations were performed in our centre. This paper describes three conjoined twin emergency separations. In the first case of thoracoomphalopagus babies at nine days of age, one baby was diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis with frequent desaturation and seizures, and the other baby was healthy. Emergency separation was performed on the twelfth day of age; unfortunately, neither baby survived the surgery. In the second case, emergency separation was performed on the 110th day of life due to sepsis in one baby. The nonseptic twin passed away six hours after surgery, while the septic twin died 12\u00a0days after surgery due to wound dehiscence and abdominal sepsis. The third case was of an omphalopagus conjoined twin with a parasitic twin. The healthy baby was deemed nonviable but found to be healthy upon birth. Immediate emergency separation was performed at 2\u00a0h of age. The living baby survived the surgery but passed away two months later.\nWhen separation is deemed necessary to save one twin, it becomes difficult to apply standard ethical medical reasoning. The decision to separate results in most cases in very high-risk surgeries with poor outcomes during surgery and postsurgery. Compounded by the complexity of the case, sociocultural and religious aspects further add to the dynamics of decision-making. A multidisciplinary team must work together with a health ethics committee and navigate through this ethical conundrum with the patient and family at its decision-making centre to decide on the best plan of care.",

    "abstract": "X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences one X in female cells to balance sex-differences in X-dosage. A subset of X-linked genes escape XCI, but the extent to which this phenomenon occurs and how it varies across tissues and in a population is as yet unclear. To characterize incidence and variability of escape across individuals and tissues, we conducted a transcriptomic study of escape in adipose, skin, lymphoblastoid cell lines and immune cells in 248 healthy individuals exhibiting skewed XCI. We quantify XCI escape from a linear model of genes' allelic fold-change and XIST-based degree of XCI skewing. We identify 62 genes, including 19 lncRNAs, with previously unknown patterns of escape. We find a range of tissue-specificity, with 11% of genes escaping XCI constitutively across tissues and 23% demonstrating tissue-restricted escape, including cell type-specific escape across immune cells of the same individual. We also detect substantial inter-individual variability in escape. Monozygotic twins share more similar escape than dizygotic twins, indicating that genetic factors may underlie inter-individual differences in escape. However, discordant escape also occurs within monozygotic co-twins, suggesting environmental factors also influence escape. Altogether, these data indicate that XCI escape is an under-appreciated source of transcriptional differences, and an intricate phenotype impacting variable trait expressivity in females.",

    "abstract": "Globally, the rapid increase of obesity is reaching alarming proportions. A new approach to reduce obesity and its comorbidities involves tackling the built environment. Environmental influences seem to play an important role, but the environmental influences in early life on adult body composition have not been thoroughly investigated. This study seeks to fill the research gap by examining early-life exposure to residential green spaces and traffic exposure in association with body composition among a population of young adult twins.\nAs part of the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey (EFPTS) cohort, this study included 332 twins. Residential addresses of the mothers at time of birth of the twins were geocoded to determine residential green spaces and traffic exposure. To capture body composition, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference, skinfold thickness, leptin levels, and fat percentage were measured at adult age. Linear mixed modelling analyses were conducted to investigate early-life environmental exposures in association with body composition, while accounting for potential confounders. In addition, moderator effects of zygosity/chorionicity, sex and socio-economic status were tested.\nEach interquartile range (IQR) increase in distance to highway was found associated with an increase of 1.2% in WHR (95%CI 0.2-2.2%). For landcover of green spaces, each IQR increase was associated with 0.8% increase in WHR (95%CI 0.4-1.3%), 1.4% increase in waist\u00a0circumference (95%CI 0.5-2.2%), and 2.3% increase in body fat (95%CI 0.2-4.4%). Stratified analyses by zygosity/chorionicity type indicated that in monozygotic monochorionic twins, each IQR increase in land cover of green spaces was associated with 1.3% increase in WHR (95%CI 0.5-2.1%). In monozygotic dichorionic twins, each IQR increase in land cover of green spaces was associated with 1.4% increase in waist-circumference (95%CI 0.6-2.2%).\nThe built environment in which mothers reside during pregnancy might play a role on body composition among young adult twins. Our study revealed that based on zygosity/chorionicity type differential effects of prenatal exposure to green spaces on body composition at adult age might exist.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, characterised by an accelerated loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, is associated with negative outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate factors associated with skeletal muscle strength, mass and sarcopenia, particularly protein intake, and to assess whether shared twin characteristics are important.\nThis study utilised cross-sectional data from a study of community-dwelling twins aged \u226560\u00a0years. Multivariable logistic regression and between- and within-twin pair regression modelling were used.\nParticipants (n\u2009=\u20093,302) were 89% female (n\u2009=\u20092,923), aged a mean of 72.1 (\u00b17.3) years and composed of 858 (55%) monozygotic, 709 (45%) dizygotic twin pairs and 168 individual lone twins. Using optimal protein intake as the reference group (1.0-1.3\u00a0g/kg/day), there was no significant association between protein intake (neither high nor low) and low muscle strength, or between low protein intake and sarcopenia (odds ratio (OR) 0.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-1.25; P\u2009=\u20090.229) in unadjusted models. High protein intake (>1.3\u00a0g/kg/day) was associated with low muscle mass (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.39-2.24; P\u2009<\u20090.0001), while low protein intake was protective (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.40-0.67; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). High protein intake was associated with sarcopenia (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.21-3.44; P\u2009=\u20090.008), and this was robust to adjustment for demographic, anthropometric and dietary factors. The association between muscle strength and weight, body mass index, healthy eating index, protein intake and alpha diversity was not significantly influenced by shared twin factors, indicating greater amenability to interventions.\nHigh protein intake is associated with sarcopenia in a cohort of healthy older twins.",

    "abstract": "Type II and IV twins with irrational twin boundaries are studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy in two plagioclase crystals. The twin boundaries in these and in NiTi are found to relax to form rational facets separated by disconnections. The topological model (TM), amending the classical model, is required for a precise theoretical prediction of the orientation of the Type II/IV twin plane. Theoretical predictions also are presented for types I, III, V, and VI twins. The relaxation process that forms a faceted structure entails a separate prediction from the TM. Hence, faceting provides a difficult test for the TM. Analysis of the faceting by the TM is in excellent agreement with the observations.",

    "abstract": "The development of coronary artery disease (CAD) is strongly influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Monozygotic twins represent a unique population that provides insights into the interaction of genetic, environmental, and social factors and their effects on the development of CAD.\nTwo 54-year-old identical twins presented to an outside hospital with acute chest pain. Twin B developed chest pain after witnessing Twin A in distress from an acute chest pain episode. Electrocardiogram performed on each of them was diagnostic of ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Upon arrival at the angioplasty centre, Twin A was taken for emergency coronary angiography yet his pain subsided on the way to the catheterization lab hence, Twin B was taken for angiography instead. Twin B angiography demonstrated acute occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. Twin A coronary angiogram demonstrated 60% ostial first diagonal branch stenosis with a normal distal flow. He was diagnosed with possible coronary vasospasm.\nThis is the first report of a simultaneous presentation of monozygotic twins with ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. While genetic and environmental contributions to the development of CAD have been described, this case highlights the strong social bond that exists between monozygotic twins. Once CAD is diagnosed in one twin, aggressive risk factor modification and screening should be implemented in the other.",

    "abstract": "Given the common anatomical features and similar short-term weight loss outcomes, Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD/DS) and Single-Anastomosis Duodenoileal bypass with Sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) are considered identical bariatric procedures, apart from technical complexity being lower for SADI-S. In the absence of prospective randomized trials or long-term comparative studies the rationale for choosing between procedures is hampered. Post-bariatric hormonal profiles could contribute to understand the underlying mechanisms and potentially be used as a decision aid when choosing between procedures. The main aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of BPD/DS and SADI-S, in genetically identical individuals exposed to similar environmental factors. Two identical twin (T) female patients, one submitted to BPD/DS (T_BPD/DS) and another to SADIS-S (T_SADI-S) were followed up to one year after surgery. Before surgery and at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, both patients underwent mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTT) to evaluate postprandial glucose, glucagon and GLP-1 response. In addition, 3 months after surgery, glucose dynamics were assessed using a Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) system for 14 days. The percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) was higher for T_BPD/DS compared to T_SADI-S (34.03 vs 29.03 %). During MMTT, T_BPD/DS presented lower glucose, glucagon, insulin and C-peptide excursions at all timepoints when compared to SADI-S; along with a greater percentage of time within the low glucose range (55.97 vs 39.93 %) and numerically lower glucose variability indexes on FGM (MAG change:0.51 vs 0.63\u00a0mmol/l\u00d7h",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twin pregnancies are rare, usually occurring in cases of monochorionic monoamniotic twin pregnancies. The most common type of conjoined twins, thoracopagus (42%), is difficult to deliver via a low-segment transverse incision hysterotomy after 35 weeks of gestation. Therefore, conjoined twin cesarean deliveries are typically performed using the classical incision method. However, this often leads to an increased risk of postoperative maternal morbidity and uterine rupture during a subsequent pregnancy. Because of the low survival rate of conjoined twins, subsequent pregnancies are often desired. Hence, minimizing trauma to the uterus is a primary concern. A technique for delivering conjoined twins at 35 weeks of gestation by cesarean delivery with a low-segment transverse incision hysterotomy is proposed here. A video is included to explain and demonstrate these procedures. This method can minimize uterine trauma and maximize the chances of a successful subsequent pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an overview of various types of virtual museums (ViM) as native artifacts or as digital twins (DT) of physical museums (PM). Depending on their mission and features, we discuss various enabling technologies and sensor equipment with their specific requirements and complexities, advantages and drawbacks in relation to each other at all stages of a DT's life cycle. A DT is a virtual construct and embodies innovative concepts based on emerging technologies (ET) using adequate sensor configurations for (meta-)data import and exchange. Our keyword-based search for articles, conference papers, (chapters from) books and reviews yielded 43 contributions and 43 further important references from Industry 4.0, Tourism and Heritage 4.0. After closer examination, a reference corpus of 40 contributions was evaluated in detail and classified along with their variants of DT-content-, communication-, and collaboration-centric and risk-informed ViMs. Their system features correlate with different application areas (AA), new or improved technologies-mostly still under development-and sensors used. Our proposal suggests a template-based, generative approach to DTs using standardized metadata formats, expert/curator software and customers'/visitors' engagement. It advocates for stakeholders' collaboration as part of a comprehensive validation and verification assessment (V&VA) throughout the DT's entire life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Do twins conceived through assisted reproductive treatments (ART) grow differently from naturally conceived (NC) twins in early life?\nAssessments at 6-8\u2009weeks old and at school entry show that ART twins conceived from frozen embryo transfer (FET) grow faster than both NC twins and ART twins conceived from fresh embryo transfer (ET).\nSingletons born from fresh ET grow more slowly in utero and in the first few weeks of life but then show postnatal catch-up growth by school age, compared to NC and FET babies. Evidence on early child growth of ART twins relative to NC twins is inconsistent; most studies are small and do not distinguish FET from fresh ET cycles.\nThis cohort study included 13\u00a0528 live-born twin babies conceived by ART (fresh ET: 2792, FET: 556) and NC (10\u00a0180) between 1991 and 2009 in Scotland. The data were obtained by linking Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority ART register data to the Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR02) and Scottish child health programme datasets. Outcome data were collected at birth, 6-8\u2009weeks (first assessment), and school entry (4-7\u2009years old) assessments. The primary outcome was growth, measured by weight at the three assessment points. Secondary outcomes were length (at birth and 6-8\u2009weeks) or height (at school entry), BMI, occipital circumference, gestational age at birth, newborn intensive care unit admission, and growth rates (between birth and 6-8\u2009weeks and between 6-8\u2009weeks and school entry).\nAll twins in the linked dataset (born between 1991 and 2009) with growth data were included in the analysis. To determine outcome differences between fresh ET, FET, and NC twins, linear mixed models (or analogous logistic regression models) were used to explore the outcomes of interest. All models were adjusted for available confounders: gestational age/child age, gender, maternal age and smoking, Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, year of treatment, parity, ICSI, and ET stage.\nIn the primary birth weight models, the average birth weight of fresh ET twins was lower [-35 g; 95% CI: (-53, -16)g] than NC controls, while FET twins were heavier [71 g; 95% CI (33, 110) g] than NC controls and heavier [106 g; 95% CI (65, 146) g] than fresh ET twins. However, the difference between FET and NC twins was not significant when considering only full-term twins (\u226537\u2009weeks gestation) [26 g; 95% CI (-30, 82)\u2009g], while it was significantly higher in preterm twins [126 g; 95% CI (73, 179)\u2009g]. Growth rates did not differ significantly for the three groups from birth to 6-8\u2009weeks. However, FET twins grew significantly faster from 6 to 8\u2009weeks than NC (by 2.2\u2009g/week) and fresh ET twins (by 2.1\u2009g/week). By school entry, FET twins were 614\u2009g [95% CI (158, 1070) g] and 581\u2009g [95% CI (100, 1063) g] heavier than NC and fresh ET twins, respectively. Length/height and occipital frontal circumference did not differ significantly at any time point.\nAlthough the differences between ART and NC reflect the true ART effects, these effects are likely to be mediated partly through the different prevalence of mono/dizygotic twins in the two groups. We could not explore the mediating effect of zygosity due to the unavailability of data. The confounding variables included in the study were limited to those available in the datasets.\nLive-born twins from FET cycles are heavier at birth, grow faster than their fresh ET and NC counterparts, and are still heavier at school entry. This differs from that observed in singletons from the same cohort, where babies in the three conception groups had similar weights by school entry age. The results are reassuring on known differences in FET versus fresh ET and NC twin outcomes. However, FET twins grow faster and are consistently larger, and more ART twins depict catch-up growth. These may lead to an increased risk profile for non-communicable diseases in later life. As such, these twin outcomes require careful evaluation using more recent and comprehensive cohorts.\nThis study was funded by the EU H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN) grant Dohartnet (H2020-MSCA-ITN-2018-812660).

    "abstract": "Two examples of contact twins in pyrite from Peru are described. The first one, from Pasto Bueno ore deposit, shows the pyritohedron {120} as principal form, accompanied by the {111} octahedron and {100} cube as secondary forms, giving a lenticular aspect. (111) is the composition plane, and the twin operation is any one of the three binary axes \u27e8110\u27e9 within this plane. The second one (unknown ore deposit) presents two forms, the octahedron {111} and the pyritohedron {120}; the two crystals in the twin are elongated along [101] and [011], respectively, producing a V profile. It is a reflection twin where the twin plane (110) coincides with the composition plane. These twins are by merohedry. Another contact twin is known in the literature, reported by Gaubert [Bull. Soc. Fr. Min\u00e9ral. Cristallogr. (1928), 51, 211-212] who described it as a spinel twin, i.e. a reflection twin with twin and composition plane (111); here it is shown that it is actually a rotation twin in which the twin operation is a 180\u00b0 rotation about any of the three equivalent directions \u27e8211\u27e9, contained in the (111) composition plane. The occurrence of these twins as well as the doubtfulness of the spinel twin in pyrite shows a direct relationship with the structural interpretation based on the pseudo-symmetry of the crystallographic orbits.",

    "abstract": "Pericentric inversion of chromosome 9 (inv(9)) is one of the most common variants seen in a normal human karyotype that occurs during meiosis. Despite being categorized as a normal variant, some studies using classical cytogenetics have recently shown that inv(9) could be associated with azoospermia, congenital anomalies, growth retardation, and rarely with abnormal karyotype. However, there is no reported\u00a0association with cyclopia. Interestingly this genetic variant involves twin fetuses. A 36-year-old multiparous lady with\u00a0dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy\u00a0presented to the fetomaternal unit with\u00a0fetal growth restriction\u00a0at 34 weeks of gestation. An ultrasound scan revealed both have microcephaly, fisting hands, holoprosencephaly, and proboscis suspicious of Patau syndrome. Amniocentesis was not issued due to late pregnancy and guarded prognosis. The mother presented with pre-eclampsia at 35 weeks of gestation. The pregnancy managed to prolong up to 36 weeks after which caesarean section was performed due to the leading twin being in a transverse lie. Two baby twin girls were born 3 minutes apart with microcephaly and cyclops appearance. Chromosomal analysis of both twins revealed similar karyotypes of 46, XX, inv(9)(p11,q13). Pericentric inversion of chromosome 9 is regarded as a normal chromosomal variation in the general population, but\u00a0in twins with cyclops\u00a0is considered rare.\u00a0Early referral to a tertiary hospital for twin management is highly required. It may identify fetuses with such abnormalities and counsel the parents with appropriate management.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of preterm birth has been rising, and there is a paucity of nationwide data on the perinatal characteristics and neonatal outcomes of twin deliveries of very preterm infants (VPIs) in China. This study compared the perinatal characteristics and outcomes of singletons and twins admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in China.\nThe study population comprised all infants born before 32\u00a0weeks in the Chinese Neonatal Network (CHNN) between January 2019 and December 2019. Three-level and population-average generalized estimating equation (GEE)/alternating logistic regression (ALR) models were used to determine the association of twins with neonatal morbidities and the use of NICU resources.\nDuring the study period, there were 6634 (71.2%) singletons and 2680 (28.8%) twins, with mean birth weights of 1333.70\u00a0g and 1294.63\u00a0g, respectively. Twins were significantly more likely to be delivered by caesarean section (p\u2009<\u20090.01), have antenatal steroid usage (p\u2009=\u20090.048), have been conceived by assisted reproductive technology (ART) (p\u2009<\u20090.01), have a higher prevalence of maternal diabetes (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and be inborn (p\u2009<\u20090.01) than singletons. In addition, twins had a lower prevalence of small for gestational age, maternal hypertension, and primigravida mothers than singletons (all p\u2009<\u20090.01). After adjusting for potential confounders, twins had higher mortality rates (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.49), higher incidences of short-term composite outcomes (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (AOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12-1.50), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (AOR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.21), more surfactant usage (AOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.41) and prolonged hospital stays (adjusted mean ratio 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), compared to singletons.\nOur work suggests that twins have a greater risk of mortality, a higher incidence of RDS and BPD, more surfactant usage, and longer NICU stays than singletons among VPIs in China.",

    "abstract": "Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is characterized by an extremely limited range and/or amount of food eaten, resulting in the persistent failure to meet nutritional and/or energy needs. Its etiology is poorly understood, and knowledge of genetic and environmental contributions to ARFID is needed to guide future research.\nTo estimate the extent to which genetic and environmental factors contribute to the liability to the broad ARFID phenotype.\nThis nationwide Swedish twin study includes 16\u202f951 twin pairs born between 1992 and 2010 whose parents participated in the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS) at twin age 9 or 12 years. CATSS was linked to the National Patient Register (NPR) and the Prescribed Drug Register (PDR). Data were collected from July 2004 to April 2020, and data were analyzed from October 2021 to October 2022.\nFrom CATSS, NPR, and PDR, all parent reports, diagnoses, procedures, and prescribed drugs that were relevant to the DSM-5 ARFID criteria were extracted when twin pairs were aged 6 to 12 years and integrated into a composite measure for the ARFID phenotype (ie, avoidant/restrictive eating with clinically significant impact, such as low weight or nutritional deficiency, and with fear of weight gain as an exclusion). In sensitivity analyses, autism and medical conditions that could account for the eating disturbance were controlled for. Univariate liability threshold models were fitted to estimate the relative contribution of genetic and environmental variation to the liability to the ARFID phenotype.\nOf 33\u202f902 included children, 17\u202f151 (50.6%) were male. A total of 682 children (2.0%) with the ARFID phenotype were identified. The heritability of ARFID was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85), with significant contributions from nonshared environmental factors (0.21; 95% CI, 0.15-0.30). Heritability was very similar when excluding children with autism (0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.84) or medical illnesses that could account for the eating disturbance (0.79; 95% CI, 0.70-0.86).\nPrevalence and sex distribution of the broad ARFID phenotype were similar to previous studies, supporting the use of existing epidemiological data to identify children with ARFID. This study of the estimated genetic and environmental etiology of ARFID suggests that ARFID is highly heritable, encouraging future twin and molecular genetic studies.",

Fewer than 75 cases have been described. Variants in TRPV3 result in constitutive activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 3, leading to increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, palmoplantar epidermal hyperproliferation, and exquisite lesional pain. We describe pre-school aged twins with OS with partial improvement from oral erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, but dramatic reduction of their persistent palmoplantar thickening and pain from adding acitretin.",

    "abstract": "To synthesize the evidence on the benefits and risks of cobedding for infant twins and to assess the perceptions and practices of parents and health care workers regarding this practice.\nWe searched the following databases for articles published between 1997 and 2022: CINAHL, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar.\nWe included full-text articles published in English in which the authors addressed twin cobedding in hospital or home settings. We reviewed the abstracts of 106 articles and retained 54 for full-text review. Of these, 18 met eligibility criteria and were included in the review.\nWe extracted the following data: author(s), year of publication, setting, purpose, study design, sample characteristics, methodologic details, outcomes and findings, and limitations. We appraised the quality of each study.\nIn the included articles, researchers identified no differences in apnea, heart rate, or oxygen saturation between cobedded and separately bedded infants. Compared to separately bedded infants, cobedded infants had greater weight gain and synchronization of sleep-wake states. Researchers found benefits for procedural pain relief and recovery after heel lance among cobedded infants. Researchers report that many parents are choosing to cobed their twins, but we found limited qualitative data exploring parents' perceptions or practices. In the included articles, nurses had positive perceptions of twin cobedding. Overall, the quality of evidence was low because of inconsistencies in study methods and small sample sizes that resulted in imprecise results.\nWe found potential benefits and no evidence of harm related to cobedding of twin infants. However, the evidence was insufficient to provide recommendations for practice, and additional research is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins are computational models of complex systems, which aim to understand and optimize those systems more effectively than would be possible in real life. Ideally, digital twins can be translated to individual patients, to characterize and computationally treat their diseases with thousands of drugs, to select the drug or drugs that cure the patients. The background problem is that many patients do not respond adequately to drug treatment. This problem reflects a wide gap between the complexity of diseases and clinical practice. Each disease may involve altered interactions between thousands of genes that vary between different cell types in different organs. To our knowledge, these altered interactions have not been characterized on a genome-, cellulome-, and organ-wide scale in any disease. Thus, clinical translation of the digital twin ideal for predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory treatment involves formidable challenges, which are close to the limits of, or beyond today's technologies. Here, I discuss recent developments and challenges in relation to that ideal focusing on immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, as well as examples from other diseases.",

    "abstract": "Despite being essentially genetically identical, monozygotic (MZ) twins can be discordant for congenital heart disease (CHD), thus highlighting the importance of in utero environmental factors for CHD pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify the epigenetic variations between discordant MZ twin pairs that are associated with CHD at birth.\nCord blood of CHD-discordant MZ twins from the Chongqing Longitudinal Twin Study Cohort was subjected to whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, then validated by MeDIP-qPCR and qRT-PCR.\n379 DMRs mapped to 175 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were associated with CHD. Functional enrichment analysis identified these DMGs are involved in histone methylation, actin cytoskeleton organization, the regulation of cell differentiation, and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes. Of note, SPESP1 and NOX5 were hypermethylated in CHD, and associated with lower gene expression levels.\nSpecific DNA methy (DNAm) variations in cord blood were associated with CHD, thus illustrating new biomarkers and potential interventional targets for CHD.\nChiCTR-OOC-16008203, registered on 1 April 2016 at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.",

    "abstract": "Determining the cause of intrauterine fetal death is essential for patients to manage their next pregnancy. However, in the majority of cases of fetal death, the cause remains unexplained despite comprehensive evaluation, especially in the cases of twins. Among twin pregnancies, conditions of monochorionic twinning, commonly regarded as monozygotic, are more complicated than dichorionic ones.\nWe systematically evaluated the cause of fetal death for a Han Chinese woman with monochorionic twinning following \nThis study demonstrated the importance of recognizing the presence of monochorionic dizygotic twinning and the challenges of clinical management for twins following ",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins with highly similar genomic DNA sequences can not be distinguished by conventional forensic DNA testing. The immune repertoire (IR) reflects an individual's immune history, which is unique between individuals, has been applied to individualized treatment in precision medicine. However, the application of IR in forensic genetics has not been reported to date. In this study, the diversity in the complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) of both the T-cell receptor \u03b2 chain (TCR\u03b2) and B-cell receptor heavy chain (also known as immunoglobulin heavy chain, IGH) in four pairs of MZ twins were analyzed. The results showed that the amino acid sequences length distribution frequency of TCR\u03b2 CDR3 had 4-10 differences, and the nucleic acid sequences length distribution frequency of TCR\u03b2 CDR3 had 2-7 differences between MZ twins. The shared difference of four pairs of MZ twins focused on the length distribution frequency of 34\u00a0bp nucleotide sequences in TCR\u03b2. By analyzing the usage frequency of V and J genes in TCR\u03b2 and IGH CDR3 DNA sequence rearrangements, we also found that there were biases between each pair of MZ twins, and the usage frequency of TRBJ2-3 showed common differences between each pair of MZ twins. Furthermore, each pair of MZ twins had its own unique V-J genes combination mode in TCR\u03b2 and IGH CDR3 DNA sequences. This study, for the first time, suggested that IR can be used as a potential biological marker to distinguish MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic created the need for telerehabilitation development, while Industry 4.0 brought the key technology. As motor therapy often requires the physical support of a patient's motion, combining robot-aided workouts with remote control is a promising solution. This may be realised with the use of the device's digital twin, so as to give it an immersive operation. This paper presents an extensive overview of this technology's applications within the fields of industry and health. It is followed by the in-depth analysis of needs in rehabilitation based on questionnaire research and bibliography review. As a result of these sections, the original concept of controlling a rehabilitation exoskeleton via its digital twin in the virtual reality is presented. The idea is assessed in terms of benefits and significant challenges regarding its application in real life. The presented aspects prove that it may be potentially used for manual remote kinesiotherapy, combined with the safety systems predicting potentially harmful situations. The concept is universally applicable to rehabilitation robots.",

The MPOD was measured using the one-wavelength reflectometry method. Fundus reflectance (Visucam 500, reflectance of a single 460 nm wavelength) was used to measure the MPOD levels, MPOD parameters including max and mean optical density (OD), and area and volume. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms.\nwe detected a positive correlation of MPOD in the right and left eyes in MZ twin pairs (r = 0.830 and r = 0.860, respectively) (\nthis twin study showed a strong heritability of the retina pigment, which was 86% prevalent in Lithuania.

Reproductive duration was categorized into three groups: short (\u226434\u2009years), average (35-39\u2009years), and long (\u226540\u2009years). Depression was ascertained from the Sweden National Patient Registry.\nDuring the follow up, 593 (5.24%) women developed depression. In the multi-adjusted generalized estimating equation model, the odds ratios (ORs) of depression were 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.55) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.01-1.55) for women with short and long reproductive durations, respectively, compared with those women with average reproductive duration. Women with a non-typical reproductive duration (\u226434 or\u2009\u226540\u2009years) who received HRT were at a higher risk of depression (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.42-2.33). There was a significant additive interaction between non-typical reproductive duration and the use of HRT on depression (attributable proportion 0.26, 95% CI 0.03-0.50).\nWomen with a short or long reproductive duration, especially those with a history of HRT use, have a higher risk of depression after menopause compared with those with an average reproductive duration.",

    "abstract": "Remanufacturing is widely recognised as a key contributor to the circular economy (CE) as it extends the in-use life of products, but its synergy with Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has received little attention when compared to manufacturing. An agglomeration of I4.0 technologies and methodologies is reflected in the emerging digital twin (DT) concept, which has been identified as a life-extending enabler. This article captures the design and demonstration of a DT model that optimises remanufacturing planning using data from different instances in a product's life cycle. The model uses a neural network for remaining useful life predictions and the Bees Algorithm for decision making within a DT. The model is validated using a real case study. The findings support the idea that intelligent tools within a DT can enhance decision-making if they have visibility and access to the product's current status and reliable remanufacturing process information.",

    "abstract": "A gestational age of 22 to 23 weeks is the lower threshold for selective active intervention. Few infants delivered at a gestational age of 22 to 23 weeks survive if resuscitated. Among those who survive, most develop severe complications, especially in cases of multiple births at the limit of viability.\nWe report the intact survival of extremely preterm twins, a girl (Twin A) and a boy (Twin B), weighing 504g and 475g, respectively, born at the edge of viability at 22 2/7 weeks gestation without significant morbidity.\nextremely preterm twins born at the edge of viability at 22 2/7 weeks.\nTwin A required 6 weeks of mechanical ventilation. She received conventional and high-frequency oscillation ventilation. She was extubated to noninvasive positive airway pressure ventilation at 28 weeks and 2 days post conception. Twin B required longer duration of invasive ventilation lasting 11 weeks. Moreover, he had several episodes of feeding intolerance and abdominal distension. However, his serial abdominal radiographs showed nonspecific findings. The gastric tubes were eventually removed from both twins. Full oral feeding was successful on discharge.\nBoth infants are presently in good condition.They were discharged home with a full oral feeding, and without any respiratory support. Now they are 18-month-old with unimpaired development.\nThis report would support healthcare providers in decision-making. It highlights the importance of perinatal and neonatal management optimization to improve survival rates and clinical outcomes of periviable birth. In addition it emphasize the individuality of each case and the need to consider the parents' wishes in the management decision.",

A lawsuit involving alleged cheating on a medical school examination by identical twins is also reviewed. General interest stories cover opposite-sex twin Holocaust survivors, twin models at a Gucci fashion show, twins with different fathers, reunited female twins who entered the same convent, the death of an MZ female twin soldier during training, and the surgical separation of conjoined twins in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether twin zygosity influences the association between neonatal outcomes and gestational weight gain (GWG) based on the Chinese guidelines in twin-pregnancy women.\nA retrospective cohort study. And it is not a clinical trial.\nWomen with twin pregnancies living in Wuhan, China.\nA total of 5140\u2009women who delivered live and non-malformed twins from 1 January 2011 to 31 August 2017 were included in this study.\nThe primary neonatal outcomes included paired small for gestational age (SGA, <10\u2009th percentile birth weight for gestational age and sex), low birth weight (LBW, <2500\u2009g) and gestational age (<33 weeks and <37 weeks). The association between GWG and neonatal outcomes was examined by Logistic regression analyses.\nA total of 5140\u2009women were included, of whom 22.24%, 54.78% and 22.98% were below, within and above the Chinese guidelines, respectively. Among the including 10\u2009280 infants, 26.28% of them were monozygotic (MZ) twins and 73.72% of them were dizygotic (DZ) twins. Women with low GWG had a significantly higher proportion of LBW/LBW and LBW/NBW infants, a greater likelihood of SGA/SGA and SGA/appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants and a higher incidence of preterm birth. The associations persisted both in MZ and DZ twins, and twin zygosity influenced the degree of association between GWG and SGA, LBW and preterm birth. High GWG was associated with significant risk reductions in SGA/AGA pairs, LBW/LBW or LBW/NBW pairs, and less than 33 gestational weeks. However, high GWG was only associated with reduced risk of LBW/LBW pairs both in MZ and DZ twins.\nGWG below the Chinese recommendations increased the risk of SGA, LBW and preterm birth in both MZ and DZ twins. The effect was more pronounced in MZ twins than that in DZ twin pairs. A high GWG only reduced the risk of LBW/LBW pairs both in MZ and DZ twins.",

Among the including 10\u2009280 infants, 26.28% of them were monozygotic (MZ) twins and 73.72% of them were dizygotic (DZ) twins. Women with low GWG had a significantly higher proportion of LBW/LBW and LBW/NBW infants, a greater likelihood of SGA/SGA and SGA/appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants and a higher incidence of preterm birth. The associations persisted both in MZ and DZ twins, and twin zygosity influenced the degree of association between GWG and SGA, LBW and preterm birth. High GWG was associated with significant risk reductions in SGA/AGA pairs, LBW/LBW or LBW/NBW pairs, and less than 33 gestational weeks. However, high GWG was only associated with reduced risk of LBW/LBW pairs both in MZ and DZ twins.",

    "abstract": "One of the main topics within research activities is the management of research data. Large amounts of data acquired by heterogeneous scientific devices, sensor systems, measuring equipment, and experimental setups have to be processed and ideally be managed by Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data management approaches in order to preserve their intrinsic value to researchers throughout the entire data lifecycle. The symbiosis of heterogeneous measuring devices, FAIR principles, and digital twin technologies is considered to be ideally suited to realize the foundation of reliable, sustainable, and open research data management. This paper contributes a novel architectural approach for gathering and managing research data aligned with the FAIR principles. A reference implementation as well as a subsequent proof of concept is given, leveraging the utilization of digital twins to overcome common data management issues at equipment-intense research institutes. To facilitate implementation, a top-level knowledge graph has been developed to convey metadata from research devices along with the produced data. In addition, a reactive digital twin implementation of a specific measurement device was devised to facilitate reconfigurability and minimized design effort.",

    "abstract": "Innovative digital twins (DTs) that allow engineers to visualise, share information, and monitor the condition during operation is necessary to optimise railway construction and maintenance. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an approach for creating and managing an inventive 3D model simulating digital information that is useful to project management, monitoring and operation of a specific asset during the whole life cycle assessment (LCA). BIM application can help to provide an efficient cost management and time schedule and reduce the project delivery time throughout the whole life cycle of the project. In this study, an innovative DT has been developed using BIM integration through a life cycle analysis. Minnamurra Railway Bridge (MRB), Australia, has been chosen as a real-world use case to demonstrate the extended application of BIM (i.e., the DT) to enhance the operation, maintenance and asset management to improve the sustainability and resilience of the railway bridge. Moreover, the DT has been exploited to determine GHG emissions and cost consumption through the integration of BIM. This study demonstrates the feasibility of DT technology for railway maintenance and resilience optimisation. It also generates a virtual collaboration for co-simulations and co-creation of values across stakeholders participating in construction, operation and maintenance, and enhancing a reduction in costs and GHG emission.",

    "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases continues to rise globally and obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases. However, to our knowledge, evidence of the relative roles of genes and the environment underlying obesity and cardiometabolic disease traits and the correlations between them are still lacking, as is how they change with age. Method: Data were obtained from the Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR). A total of 1421 twin pairs were included. Univariate structural equation models (SEMs) were performed to evaluate the heritability of BMI and cardiometabolic traits, which included blood hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Bivariate SEMs were used to assess the genetic/environmental correlations between them. The study population was divided into three groups for analysis: \u226450, 51\u221260, and >60 years old to assess the changes in heritability and genetic/environmental correlations with ageing. Results: Univariate SEMs showed a high heritability of BMI (72%) and cardiometabolic traits, which ranged from 30% (HbA1c) to 69% (HDL-C). With age increasing, the heritability of all phenotypes has different degrees of declining trends. Among these, BMI, SBP, and DBP presented significant monotonous declining trends. The bivariate SEMs indicated that BMI correlated with all cardiometabolic traits. The genetic correlations were estimated to range from 0.14 (BMI and LDL-C) to 0.39 (BMI and DBP), while the environmental correlations ranged from 0.13 (BMI and TC/LDL-C) to 0.31 (BMI and TG). The genetic contributions underlying the correlations between BMI and SBP and DBP, TC, TG, and HDL-C showed a progressive decrease as age groups increased. In contrast, environmental correlations displayed a significant increasing trend for HbA1c, SBP, and DBP. Conclusions: The findings suggest that genetic and environmental factors have essential effects on BMI and all cardiometabolic traits. However, as age groups increased, genetic influences presented varying degrees of decrement for BMI and most cardiometabolic traits, suggesting the increasing importance of environments. Genetic factors played a consistently larger role than environmental factors in the phenotypic correlations between BMI and cardiometabolic traits. Nevertheless, the relative magnitudes of genetic and environmental factors may change over time.",

    "abstract": "We report a pair of dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancy affected by Noonan syndrome (NS) with a novel mutation of LZTR1 determined by genetic analysis.\nA pregnant woman with monozygotic twins (DCDA) at 12\u2009+\u20092 weeks gestation was referred to our center. This was her second pregnancy following a previous delivery of a healthy infant. Nuchal translucency of two fetuses was 11.2\u00a0mm (CRL 62.0\u00a0mm) and 6.9\u00a0mm (CRL 62.1\u00a0mm) respectively. Ultrasound examination indicated cystic hygroma and hypoplastic ear. The couple was not consanguineous, and both had normal phenotype. Familial hereditary disease was also excluded. Under ultrasound guidance, 30\u00a0mg of chorionic villi was obtained for karyotyping, quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR), chromosomal microarray analysis(CMA), and Trio-whole-exome sequencing(WES) examination. We used the \"target region capture and sequencing\" for WES, and the BWA (Burrows Wheeler Aligner) Multi-Vision software package for the data analysis. The results of all these tests were normal except WES detected a c.427\u00a0A\u2009>\u2009G mutation in the exonic region of the LZTR1 gene and a p. Asn143Asp novel heterozygous mutation associated with NS in this pair of twins. In addition, WES suggested that the mutation in the twin fetuses originated from the mother. When the mother got the genetic test report, she came to our fetal medicine department for genetic counseling and she declined the appointment with a clinical geneticist. The couple opted to terminate the pregnancy. Because the patient did not choose to terminate the pregnancy at our hospital, we were unable to take further examination. With the help of colleagues in another hospital, photos of the fetuses were taken. Compared with the prenatal ultrasound results, the appearance of the \"cystic hygroma\" and \"hypoplastic ear\" was consistent with the ultrasound. The couple were depressed after knowing this pathogenic result and although we advised the mother to take further investigation, they refused.\nThe mutant locus might be incompletely dominant, which led to an abnormal fetal phenotype such as cystic hygroma and hypoplastic ear.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins may develop fetal anemia when blood is unequally distributed via the placental vascular anastomoses. This review focuses on the causes of fetal anemia in complicated monochorionic twins and highlights the differences in management and outcome.\nFetal anemia can occur in the context of twin anemia polycythemia sequence (TAPS), chronic twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and acute peripartum TTTS, and in cotwins after single fetal demise. Diagnosis of fetal anemia is based on abnormal Doppler ultrasound measurements. Management options include fetoscopic laser surgery, intrauterine blood transfusion, or expectant management, depending on the type of complication and the severity of the disease. In all complications, fetal anemia may lead to perinatal mortality, neonatal morbidity, severe cerebral injury, and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. In TAPS specifically, anemic donors may also show bilateral deafness.\nKnowledge on the diagnosis and optimal treatment in TTTS is nowadays widespread, but caregivers often fail to distinguish TAPS from acute peripartum TTTS at birth. A full blood count including reticulocyte count is required, and placental dye injection is extremely helpful to reach the correct diagnosis and establish the optimal management.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins (MC) develop under unique intrauterine conditions and show a high risk of compromise during fetal life. Here we describe umbilical vein blood flow (UVBF) and fetal oxygen and glucose utilization in uncomplicated MC twins and investigate possible differences within twin-pairs according to birth-order.\nProspective single-center study on 48 uncomplicated MC twins enrolled at the time of elective cesarean delivery. Ultrasound measurements of UVBF for Twin 1 and Twin 2 labelled according to birth-order were performed before spinal anesthesia. Umbilical arterial and venous blood samples were collected for each twin after fetal delivery, and fetal oxygen and glucose deliveries and uptakes were computed.\nAll twins were delivered within 2\u00a0min from one-another under steady-state conditions at 36.4 weeks of median gestational age (IQR 36.0-37.0). Birthweight and umbilical cord gas analyses were within physiological ranges for all twins. Second-born twins showed significantly lower UVBF, measured before delivery, and lower median birthweight compared to first-borns. Moreover, median values of estimated fetal oxygen and glucose consumption were lower in second compared to first MC twins.\nUncomplicated MC twins show different birthweight, oxygenation and metabolic rates based on their position in utero, hinting at pre-existing conditions possibly deriving by uneven vascular and metabolic distribution of the two placental territories. The innovative findings of this study emphasize the biological uniqueness of these pregnancies and prompt further physiological studies on MC twins and placenta metabolism.",

    "abstract": "This work emphasizes that patient data, including images, are not operable (clinically), but that digital twins are. Based on the former, the latter can be created. Subsequently, virtual clinical operations can be performed towards selection of optimal therapies. Digital twins are beginning to emerge in the field of medicine. We suggest that theranostic digital twins (TDTs) are amongst the most natural and feasible flavors of digitals twins. We elaborate on the importance of TDTs in a future where 'one-size-fits-all' therapeutic schemes, as prevalent nowadays, are transcended in radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs). Personalized RPTs will be deployed, including optimized intervention parameters. Examples include optimization of injected radioactivities, sites of injection, injection intervals and profiles, and combination therapies. Multi-modal multi-scale images, combined with other data and aided by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, will be utilized towards routine digital twinning of our patients, and will enable improved deliveries of RPTs and overall healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Earth's magnetotail plays a critical role in the dynamics of the magnetosphere, particularly during intervals of geomagnetic activity. To improve our understanding of the ion dynamics in this region, energetic neutral atom (ENA) imaging can provide global measurements to place in situ measurements in context and validate simulations. The NASA Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers mission provided near-continuous observations using ENA imagers. ENA data can be used to calculate maps of equatorial ion temperatures that often show observations of regions of enhanced temperatures associated with phenomena in the magnetotail such as magnetic reconnection and narrow flow channels. We present an algorithm that can be used to search through a collection of these maps to identify intervals with such enhancements for further study. The algorithm results are validated against two sets of related phenomena: (a) a database of dipolarizing flux bundle (DFB) measurements from THEMIS and (b) a list of substorm onsets from SuperMAG. We demonstrate that the algorithm is very good at identifying intervals when there are DFB measurements or substorm onsets as long as there sufficient ENA data. We discuss some potential scientific studies that can result from use of the algorithm. We also show a preliminary application of the algorithm to simulation output to demonstrate the usefulness for other datasets, facilitate comparative studies, and introduce a new method for model validation.",

    "abstract": "We describe new types of Lorenz-like attractors for three-dimensional flows and maps with symmetries. We give an example of a three-dimensional system of differential equations, which is centrally symmetric and mirror symmetric. We show that the system has a Lorenz-like attractor, which contains three saddle equilibrium states and consists of two mirror-symmetric components that are adjacent at the symmetry plane. We also found a discrete-time analog of this \"conjoined-twins\" attractor in a cubic three-dimensional H\u00e9non map with a central symmetry. We show numerically that both attractors are pseudohyperbolic, which guarantees that each orbit of the attractor has a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent, and this property is preserved under small perturbations. We also describe bifurcation scenarios for the emergence of the attractors in one-parameter families of three-dimensional flows and maps possessing the symmetries.",

Cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with homogenous and heterogeneous phenotypes have been described in the literature.\nWe report a pair of monozygotic twins (Twin A and Twin B) with identical morphological expression of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. On initial evaluation, both twins had resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, Grade II diastolic dysfunction, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II symptoms, but they had a different clinical course afterward. Twin A progressed from NYHA Class II to Class III with a high left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient that was unresponsive to medical treatment and required alcohol septal ablation. Twin B responded very well to medical treatment. Both patients had no risk factors for sudden cardiac death, and neither required an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.\nThe morphology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has a strong genetic basis, but epigenetic factors may affect disease expression.",

    "abstract": "Preterm-associated complications remain the main cause of neonatal death. Survivors face the challenges of short- and long-term complications. Among all complications, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the first important cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Current treatment does not address this main preterm complication. Cord blood is regarded as a convenient source of stem cells. The paracrine bioactive factors of stem cells contribute to tissue repair and immune modulation. Our clinical studies and those of others have shown that cord blood cell infusion is both safe and possibly effective in the prevention and treatment of BPD. The therapeutic use of cord blood has emerged as a promising therapy. However, the genetic heterogeneity between control and intervention groups may reduce the comparability especially among small sample trials. The purpose of this study protocol is to investigate the effects of autologous cord blood mononuclear cell (ACBMNC) infusion on the prevention of BPD in very preterm monozygotic twins of less than 32 gestation weeks.\nIn this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded multicenter clinical trial, 60 pairs of monozygotic twin preterm neonates of less than 32 weeks admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit are randomly assigned to receive intravenous ACBMNC infusion (targeted at 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nThis will be the first randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial to evaluate the efficacy of ACBMNC infusion to prevent BPD in monozygotic twin premature infants and investigate the underlying protective mechanisms. The results of this trial will provide valuable clinical evidence for translational application of cord blood cell therapy in very preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "A geometric digital twin (gDT) model capable of leveraging acquired 3D geometric data plays a vital role in digitizing the process of structural health monitoring. This study presents a framework for generating and updating digital twins of existing buildings by inferring semantic information from as-is point clouds (gDT's data) acquired regularly from laser scanners (gDT's connection). The information is stored in updatable Building Information Models (BIMs) as gDT's virtual model, and dimensional outputs are extracted for structural health monitoring (gDT's service) of different structural members and shapes (gDT's physical part). First, geometric information, including position and section shape, is obtained from the acquired point cloud using domain-specific contextual knowledge and supervised classification. Then, structural members' function and section family type is inferred from geometric information. Finally, a BIM is automatically generated or updated as the virtual model of an existing facility and incorporated within the gDT for structural health monitoring. Experiments on real-world construction data are performed to illustrate the efficiency and precision of the proposed model for creating as-is gDT of building structural members.",

    "abstract": "In the recent era, musculoskeletal disorders have affected millions of people worldwide. Chefs and other workers of the catering industry are at high risk of physical stresses, which makes them susceptible to develop various musculoskeletal pains and disorders.\nThe aim of the study is to examine the frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms among chefs working in restaurants of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.\nA cross-sectional observational study was conducted on 307 chef participants from the restaurants of the twin cities. The participants were included via convenient sampling and data was collected through Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ), Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) and Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) from February to July 2021.\nOut of 307 participants, 285 were males and 22 were females with a mean age of 32.87\u00b17.03 years. The working duration of 192 chefs were 9-12 hours while 106 and 9 chefs worked only for 4-8 and more than 12 hours, respectively. A total of 101 chefs reported lower back and knee pain. The chefs presented with pain in the shoulders, upper back and ankle as well as feet areas were 98, 93 and 26 respectively.\nChefs can develop musculoskeletal symptoms including pain as a result of increased physical stress on their bodies during their work, specifically in the lower back and knee area.",

    "abstract": "Young children in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), particularly those from resource-limited settings, are heavily burdened by anemia and malaria. While malaria infected children frequently become anemic (hemoglobin < 110 g/L), anemia is a strongly multifactorial disease with many other risk factors than malaria. Due to the complex and often overlapping contributors to anemia, it remains challenging to isolate the true impact of malaria on population level hemoglobin concentrations.\nWe quantified the malaria-induced effect on hemoglobin levels in children under 5 years of age, leveraging data from 7,384 twins and other multiples, aged 6 to 59 months, from 57 nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) from 23 SSA countries from 2006 to 2019. The quasi-experimental twin fixed-effect design let us minimize the impact of potential confounders that do not vary between twins.\nOur analyses of twins revealed a malaria-induced hemoglobin decrease in infected twins of 9 g/L (95% CI -10; -7, \nEven after rigorous control for confounding through a twin fixed-effects study design, malaria substantially decreased hemoglobin levels among SSA twins, rendering them much more susceptible to severe anemia. This effect reflects the population-level effect of malaria on anemia.",

    "abstract": "Radar is widely employed in many applications, especially in autonomous driving. At present, radars are only designed as simple data collectors, and they are unable to meet new requirements for real-time and intelligent information processing as environmental complexity increases. It is inevitable that smart radar systems will need to be developed to deal with these challenges and digital twins in cyber-physical systems (CPS) have proven to be effective tools in many aspects. However, human involvement is closely related to radar technology and plays an important role in the operation and management of radars; thus, digital twins' radars in CPS are insufficient to realize smart radar systems due to the inadequate consideration of human factors. ACP-based parallel intelligence in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) is used to construct a novel framework for smart radars, called Parallel Radars. A Parallel Radar consists of three main parts: a Descriptive Radar for constructing artificial radar systems in cyberspace, a Predictive Radar for conducting computational experiments with artificial systems, and a Prescriptive Radar for providing prescriptive control to both physical and artificial radars to complete parallel execution. To connect silos of data and protect data privacy, federated radars are proposed. Additionally, taking mines as an example, the application of Parallel Radars in autonomous driving is discussed in detail, and various experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of Parallel Radars.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) is a complication in monochorionic-diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies. This study analyzes whether the prenatal diagnosis using delta middle cerebral artery-peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) > 0.5 multiples of the median (MoM) (delta group) detects more TAPS cases than the guideline-based diagnosis using the MCA-PSV cut off levels of >1.5 and <1.0 MoM (cut-off group), in a heterogenous group of MCDA twins. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 348 live-born MCDA twin pregnancies from 2010 to 2021 with available information on MCA-PSV within one week before delivery and hemoglobin-values within 24 h postnatally were considered eligible. Results: Among postnatal confirmed twin pairs with TAPS, the cut-off group showed lower sensitivity than the delta group (33% vs. 82%). Specificity proved higher in the cut-off group with 97% than in the delta group at 86%. The risk that a TAPS is mistakenly not recognized prenatally is higher in the cut-off group than in the delta group (52% vs. 18%). Conclusions: Our data shows that delta MCA-PSV > 0.5 MoM detects more cases of TAPS, which would not have been diagnosed prenatally according to the current guidelines. In the collective examined in the present study, TAPS diagnostics using delta MCA-PSV proved to be a more robust method.",

    "abstract": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by enzyme deficiencies required for cortisol biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex. The majority of CAH are due to the deficiency of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme, while 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency accounts for less than five percent of all CAH cases. We report two Moroccan twins from a spontaneous triplet pregnancy. The 46,XY newborn exhibited a disorder of sexual differentiation (DSD) with hypo virilization, while the 46,XX newborn had normal female external genitalia. In the first week of life, they showed hyponatremia and primary adrenal insufficiency with a slight 17OHP elevation and increased DHEAS and renin levels. The aCGH-SNP analysis disclosed a 8.36 Mb long contiguous stretch of homozygosity (LCSH) on chromosome 1p13.2-p11.2 including the candidate ",

    "abstract": "This case study describes the impact of the 'Planning Health in School' programme (PHS-pro) on the nutritional status and lifestyle behaviours of two twins with obesity. As part of a larger research project involving 449 adolescents in grade-6, PHS-pro aims at preventing obesity and guiding children towards healthy behaviours. Twins were evaluated for anthropometric measurements-height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and lifestyle behaviours before (baseline) and after (8 months) PHS-pro and at a follow-up (one-year later). At the baseline, both twins were obese according to the international cut-off points of Cole. After PHS-pro, improvements in anthropometric parameters were found: the boy decreased his BMI by 10% and lost 9.0 cm in WC, while remaining obese; the girl decreased her BMI by 8% and lost 8.7 cm in WC, changing to the overweight category. At the follow-up, a slight increase in the anthropometric parameters was found in both twins; however, they did not return to the baseline values. The programme successfully promoted positive changes in behaviours and improved nutritional status, showing the long-term effects of the PHS-pro. Although it is a school-based intervention to prevent obesity, the PHS-pro is helpful in weight reduction even in children already with obesity.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between abnormal umbilical cord insertion and birthweight discordance in monochorionic diamnionic (MCDA) twins. A total of 137 pairs of MCDAs were retrospectively analyzed who delivered and survived in Hangzhou Women's Hospital from January 2016 to December 2021. According to different insertion methods, they were divided into normal cord insertion group (n\u2005=\u200557), marginal cord insertion (MCI) group (n\u2005=\u200534) and velamentous cord insertion (VCI) group (n\u2005=\u200546). The correlation was analyzed between different insertion methods of umbilical cord and the discordant birth weight of MCDAs. The gestational age of delivery with velamentous cord insertion was significantly earlier than those with normal and marginal insertion (P\u2005<\u2005.05). There were significant differences in birthweight between large fetus (F1) and small fetus (F2) with different umbilical insertion methods (P\u2005<\u2005.05). The birthweight of F1 and F2 in normal insertion group was significantly higher than those in MCI and VCI group (P\u2005<\u2005.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that VCI was significantly associated with birth weight in F1/F2, birthweight discordance\u2005\u2265\u200520%, and birthweight discordance\u2005\u2265\u200525%, however MCI and VCI were not an independent factor for discordance in birthweight of MCDAs (P\u2005>\u2005.05). Umbilical cord insertion method can lead to inconsistency in birthweight of MCDA twins, however they were not an independent factor for discordance in birthweight.",

    "abstract": "Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is the leading nonhereditary cause of pediatric sensorineural hearing loss. This systematic review evaluated infection concordance and comparative hearing abilities in twins/multiple births to model infection patterns.\nPubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.\nStudies that reported hearing outcomes of congenital cytomegalovirus infection in at least one multiple birth were eligible. Concordant infections (both twins) and discordant infections (single twin) were included. Multiple reviewers performed data extraction and quality assessment. Analyses involved relative risk of infection concordance by zygosity and chorionicity and odds of hearing loss by infection concordance. Hearing outcomes were compared between siblings.\nOf 247 studies screened, 31 were included (74.2% high quality). The review captured 40 eligible multiple births. Among infected patients, 42.9% (95% confidence interval, 31.2-55.2%) demonstrated hearing loss. All uninfected twins had normal hearing. Most infections were concordant, and infected patients experienced 4.11 (1.18-14.36) times greater odds of hearing loss if their twin was also infected ( p = .02). Yet siblings' hearing outcomes diverged in over 40% of concordant cases. If either twin is infected, infection risk in the second twin is 3.25 (1.83-5.79) times greater in monozygotic than dizygotic twins and 2.50 (1.61-3.88) times greater in monochorionic than dichorionic twins (both p < .001). We describe a case from our practice.\nCongenital cytomegalovirus infection patterns and hearing outcomes can vary widely even within a shared fetal and postnatal environment. Suspected infection in a twin indicates that both should receive testing and continued monitoring for late-onset sequelae.",

    "abstract": "Disorders of or differences in sexual development (DSD) are defined by congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex are atypical. Here, we report on monochorionic diamniotic twins delivered by caesarean section in the 36th week of pregnancy. Monochorionic twins are usually monozygous and thus should have the same sexual differentiation. In this case, one twin had female external genitalia, while the other showed ambiguous genitalia. At first, a diagnosis of mixed gonadal dysgenesis was proposed because of the obvious sexual discrepancy between the supposedly monozygous twins. Cytogenetic analyses were performed to assure the sex chromosome status for both children. Male and female cells were found subsequently in both children. While hematopoietic chimerism of monochorionic dizygous twins as a result of twin-to-twin blood transfusion is a rare but already well-documented phenomenon, to our knowledge this is the first case description of tetragametic chimerism that led to intersexuality.",

Preoperative, operative and, postoperative variables were collected. Perinatal outcomes were investigated. Primary outcome was survival to birth and to neonatal period. Secondary outcomes were gestational age (GA) at birth and procedure-to-delivery interval. Literature review was conducted in which PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from inception to September, 2020.\nTwenty four sets of DCTA triplets were compared to MCDA twins during the study period. There were no significant differences in survival (no survivor, single, or double survivors) to birth and to the neonatal period of the MC twin pairs of the DCTA triplets \nPerinatal survival including fetal and neonatal are comparable between DCTA triplets and MCDA twins. However, this might have resulted from the small sample size of the DCTA triplets. GA at delivery is earlier in triplets, which could be due to the nature of triplet gestation rather than to the laser procedure itself.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a heterogeneous, fatal neurodegenerative disease, characterized by motor neuron loss and in 50% of cases also by cognitive and/or behavioral changes. Mendelian forms of ALS comprise approximately 10-15% of cases. The majority is however considered sporadic, but also with a high contribution of genetic risk factors. To explore the contribution of somatic mutations and/or epigenetic changes to disease risk, we performed whole genome sequencing and methylation analyses using samples from multiple tissues on a cohort of 26 monozygotic twins discordant for ALS, followed by in-depth validation and replication experiments. The results of these analyses implicate several mechanisms in ALS pathophysiology, which include a role for de novo mutations, defects in DNA damage repair and accelerated aging.",

    "abstract": "New technologies enable the creation of digital twin systems (DTS) combining continuous data collection from children's home and artificial intelligence (AI)-based recommendations to adapt their care in real time. The objective was to assess whether children and adolescents with asthma would be ready to use such DTS. A mixed-method study was conducted with 104 asthma patients aged 8 to 17\u00a0years. The potential advantages and disadvantages associated with AI and the use of DTS were collected in semi-structured interviews. Children were then asked whether they would agree to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma. The strength of their decision was assessed as well as the factors determining their choice. The main advantages of DTS identified by children were the possibility to be (i) supported in managing their asthma (ii) from home and (iii) in real time. Technical issues and the risk of loss of humanity were the main drawbacks reported. Half of the children (56%) were willing to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma if it was as effective as current care, and up to 93% if it was more effective. Those with the best computer skills were more likely to choose the DTS, while those who placed a high value on the physician-patient relationship were less likely to do so.\u00a0 \u00a0Conclusions: The majority of children were ready to use a DTS for the management of their asthma, particularly if it was more effective than current care. The results of this study support the development of DTS for childhood asthma and the evaluation of their effectiveness in clinical trials. What is Known: \u2022 New technologies enable the creation of digital twin systems (DTS) for children with asthma. \u2022 Acceptance of these DTSs by children with asthma is unknown. What is New: \u2022 Half of the children (56%) were willing to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma if it was as effective as current care, and up to 93% if it was more effective. \u2022Children identified the ability to be supported from home and in real time as the main benefits of DTS.",

    "abstract": "Pharmaceutical product development guided by Quality by Design (QbD) is based on a complete understanding of the critical process parameters (CPPs) that are important for achieving the desired product critical quality attributes (CQAs). The effect of process settings, such as the screw speed, the throughput, the barrel temperature, and the screw configuration, is a well-known factor in the setup of pharmaceutical hot melt extrusion (HME) processes. A CPP that has not yet been extensively researched is the type of cross-section geometry of the screw elements. Typically, pharmaceutical extruders have double-flighted screw cross-sections, with some elements having a single- or triple-flighted element section. The exception is a NANO16 extruder from Leistritz, with all screw elements having a triple-flighted screw geometry. We investigated the process setup and scale-up to a double-flighted extruder experimentally and in silico via a digital twin. Two formulations were processed on a NANO16 extruder and virtually transferred to a ZSE18 double-flighted co-rotating twin-screw extruder. Detailed smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of all screw elements available from both extruders were performed, and their efficiency in conveying, pressure build-up, and power consumption were studied. Reduced-order 1D HME simulations, which were carried out to investigate the process space and scalability of both extruders, were experimentally validated.",

    "abstract": "The clinical presentation of COVID-19 shows a remarkably broad spectrum of symptoms. Although studies with adult twins on SARS-CoV-2 infection are rare so far, the fact that there is a genetic component associated with the highly variable clinical outcomes of COVID-19 has already been highlighted in recent studies investigating potential candidate genes and polymorphisms. This is the first study of adult monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins concordantly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection to estimate variances explained by genetic, shared, and individual environmental components of both somatic and psychological symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nData were collected from 10 adult twin pairs (5 MZ, 5 DZ) in which both twins already had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. A self-designed questionnaire, the Barthel Index, and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) were used to assess various symptoms and health status following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intra-class correlations were calculated, and the Falconer formula was used to quantify and differentiate the percentages of genetic influences as well as common environment and personal experiences on the examined traits. In addition, potential factors influencing symptom burden were examined and discussed.\nWe found high estimated heritability for mental impairment after SARS-CoV-2 infection (\nBoth genetics and individual environment play a role in health status after SARS-CoV-2 infection-mental status could be influenced primarily by genetic make-up, whereas for symptom burden and certain fatigue dimensions, non-shared environment could play a more critical role. Possible individual factors influencing the course of the disease were identified. However, gene-environment interactions may still be a source of differences between twins, and the search for candidate genes remains crucial on the road to personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "The exact cause of complete endocardial cushion defect (ECD) is still unknown. This report describes a unique pair of monozygotic twins (MZ twins) discordant for ECD. The chromosome karyotyping analysis revealed normal karyotype of 46, XY, 16qh+ and mat in both MZ twins. A genome-wide analysis of DNA using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 revealed identical genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs). An extensive methylation assay was carried out by NimbleGen 3 \u00d7 720 K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Arrays to analyze the potential epigenetic differences. The DNA methylation profiles of the affected twin seemed increased compared with that of the unaffected twin. However, further validation of Notch1 promoter hypermethylation and six top-ranked differentially methylated CpG sites by sodium bisulfate modification and methylation-specific PCR, failed to reveal consistent methylation differences between the twins. Other relevant factors, such as heritability and penetrance of the condition that place the MZ twins near to a threshold for ECD or variations in local epigenetic events in the twins' heart tissues, are probably responsible for the phenotypic discordance.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins technology (DTT) is an application framework with breakthrough rules. With the deep integration of the virtual information world and physical space, it becomes the basis for realizing intelligent machining production lines, which is of great significance to intelligent processing in industrial manufacturing. This review aims to study the application of DTT and the Metaverse in fluid machinery in the past 5 years by summarizing the application status of pumps and fans in fluid machinery from the perspective of DTT and the Metaverse through the collection, classification, and summary of relevant literature in the past 5 years. The research found that in addition to relatively mature applications in intelligent manufacturing, DTT and Metaverse technologies play a critical role in the development of new pump products and technologies and are widely used in numerical simulation and fault detection in fluid machinery for various pumps and other fields. Among fan-type fluid machinery, twin fans can comprehensively use technologies, such as perception, calculation, modeling, and deep learning, to provide efficient smart solutions for fan operation detection, power generation visualization, production monitoring, and operation monitoring. Still, there are some limitations. For example, real-time and accuracy cannot fully meet the requirements in the mechanical environment with high-precision requirements. However, there are also some solutions that have achieved good results. For instance, it is possible to achieve significant noise reduction and better aerodynamic performance of the axial fan by improving the sawtooth parameters of the fan and rearranging the sawtooth area. However, there are few application cases of the Metaverse in fluid machinery. The cases are limited to operating real equipment from a virtual environment and require the combination of virtual reality and DTT. The application effect still needs further verification.",

Digital twins, virtual devices and intellectual products, presenting the main constituents of the concept, are considered in detail on the example of a complex problem, which concerns an amazing identity of the D-G-doublet Raman spectra of parental and reduced graphene oxides. Digital twins, presenting different aspects of the GO and rGO structure and properties, were virtually synthesized using a spin-density algorithm emerging from the Hartree-Fock approximation. Virtual device presents AM1 version of the semi-empirical unrestricted HF approximation. The equilibrium structure of the twins as well as virtual one-phonon harmonic spectra of IR absorption and Raman scattering constitute a set of intellectual products. It was established that in both cases the D-G doublets owe their origin to the ",

    "abstract": "During the pandemic, mental health was not only impaired in people after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also in people without previous infection. This is the first study on twins without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection to estimate the influence of genetic components and shared as well as individual environments on pandemic-associated fatigue. The study sample included 55 monozygotic and 45 dizygotic twin pairs. A total of 34.5% reported an increase in fatigue since the pandemic. A significant correlation was shown between the responses within monozygotic (\u03c72[1] = 11.14, p = 0.001) and dizygotic pairs (\u03c72[1] = 18.72, p < 0.001). In all pandemic-associated fatigue dimensions, individual environment (ranging from e2 = 0.64 to e2 = 0.84) and heritability (ranging from h2 = 0.32 to h2 = 1.04) seem to have the highest impact. The number of comorbidities significantly correlated with physical fatigue (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 = 0.232, p < 0.001) and psychological impairment due to pandemic measures with the total fatigue score (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 = 0.243, p < 0.001). However, calculated ANCOVAs with these significant correlations as covariates showed no significant influence on the mean values of the respective fatigue dimensions. Susceptibility to pandemic-associated fatigue may be genetically and environmentally determined, while intensity is also influenced by individual components. The prevalence of fatigue is high even in individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future mental health prevention and intervention programs should be implemented to alleviate the impact of the pandemic on the global population.",

    "abstract": "The use of healthcare services is likely to be associated with need but also the factors relating to the care system and the ability to negotiate around it. Healthcare use and health status may also be associated with the factors that exist in childhood. This study aims to identify the demographic, clinical, and cognitive characteristics of children at age 4 that impact healthcare use and health status at age 21. The data from the Twins Early Development Study were used. Health problems, healthcare use, and cognitive ability at age 4 were entered into generalised estimating equations to predict the use of general practitioners, outpatient services, counselling, emergency clinic visits, and a healthcare helpline at age 21. Similar models existed for the prediction of whether problems were recorded on the EQ-5D-5L EuroQol instrument. The data on up to 6707 individuals were available for analysis. Sex was a significant predictor of service use, with boys being more likely than girls to later use all services, except for emergency clinic visits. Certain health conditions at age 4 predicted the use of services with models differing according to service type. Greater general cognitive ability predicted higher use of general practitioners, outpatient care, and health helplines. The current health status was strongly predictive of service use. Service use in young adulthood was significantly related to concurrent health status as well as health conditions in childhood. General cognitive ability was significantly associated with the use of general practitioner contacts, outpatient visits, and the use of a health helpline.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear technology is widely used for hydrocarbon exploration by deploying nuclear tools of detection to help obtain important parameters of a given geographical formation. Monte Carlo software is generally used to simulate nuclear tools in the environment of well logging, to accurately predict their responses downhole. In other words, a digital Monte Carlo twin of the designated tool is constructed, and its responses, are used to identify features that are important, for instance, for assessing the feasibility of deployment of the tool or optimizing the design of its hardware. However, the downhole environment is complex and changeable, such that it is determined by many parameters, e.g., the formation, the fluid, and the structure of the well. A significant modeling setup is thus often required to be able to consider all environmental variations, where this increases the burden on field engineers who need to construct several batches of repetitive models to simulate the same tool in a variety of environments. The appropriate automation of this process is thus highly desirable. In this work, the authors propose downhole Geant4-based Monte Carlo Automated Computational Platform (GMAC) to develop digital twins of nuclear tools. We construct a platform that enables us to design a Monte Carlo digital twin of a given nuclear tool. GMAC can automate the process of simulating the tool under various environments based on minimum user input and provide a comprehensive evaluation of its performance. The proposed platform also provides feasible means to optimize the tool by connecting the CAE twin directly to the Monte Carlo twin. The main structure and developer/user functions of the GMAC are discussed in detail. Three examples of nuclear tools are also provided to detail and verify its complete process from tool design to application. The results confirm the correctness and efficiency of the proposed computational platform.",

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Growth discordance is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia in twin pregnancies. The management of preeclampsia combined with discordant twins is difficult and controversial because of severe maternal conditions and severe growth restriction in 1 twin.\nA 34-year-old woman with dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia at 29 weeks of gestation, and 1 twin with severe growth restriction and fetal intracranial hemorrhage.\nThe patient developed severe preeclampsia with high blood pressure (>160/100\u2009mm Hg) and proteinuria, hydrothorax and leg edema. Ultrasound examination confirmed growth restriction (weight estimation: 915\u2009g, <1st percentile) and abnormal umbilical flow in 1 twin (twin B), with a normal co-twin (estimated weight: 1693\u2009g) (twin A). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed intracranial hemorrhage in the germinal matrix of twin B.\nSelective termination of twin B by intracardiac injection of potassium chloride was performed at 31 weeks and 2 days' gestation.\nSymptoms of preeclampsia resolved after selective termination, allowing the pregnancy to be prolonged for nearly 4 weeks. A healthy female infant was delivered at 35 weeks of gestation.\nDelivery of both fetus is not the only choice for the management for twin pregnancy with severe preeclampsia and discordant twins. Selective termination of the fetus with poor prognosis could be a reasonable treatment choice in carefully selected cases.",

    "abstract": "We propose a unified data-driven reduced order model (ROM) that bridges the performance gap between linear and nonlinear manifold approaches. Deep learning ROM (DL-ROM) using deep-convolutional autoencoders (DC-AE) has been shown to capture nonlinear solution manifolds but fails to perform adequately when linear subspace approaches such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) would be optimal. Besides, most DL-ROM models rely on convolutional layers, which might limit its application to only a structured mesh. The proposed framework in this study relies on the combination of an autoencoder (AE) and Barlow Twins (BT) self-supervised learning, where BT maximizes the information content of the embedding with the latent space through a joint embedding architecture. Through a series of benchmark problems of natural convection in porous media, BT-AE performs better than the previous DL-ROM framework by providing comparable results to POD-based approaches for problems where the solution lies within a linear subspace as well as DL-ROM autoencoder-based techniques where the solution lies on a nonlinear manifold; consequently, bridges the gap between linear and nonlinear reduced manifolds. We illustrate that a proficient construction of the latent space is key to achieving these results, enabling us to map these latent spaces using regression models. The proposed framework achieves a relative error of 2% on average and 12% in the worst-case scenario (i.e., the training data is small, but the parameter space is large.). We also show that our framework provides a speed-up of [Formula: see text] times, in the best case, and [Formula: see text] times on average compared to a finite element solver. Furthermore, this BT-AE framework can operate on unstructured meshes, which provides flexibility in its application to standard numerical solvers, on-site measurements, experimental data, or a combination of these sources.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with incidence of cardiovascular disease and with nocturnal angina, but evidence of a link with coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemia is limited and previous studies may have been affected by selection bias or unmeasured confounding factors.\nWe performed overnight polysomnography in 178 older male twins. The Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI) was calculated to assess OSA from the overnight sleep evaluation. AHI \u226515 was used as indicator of moderate/severe OSA. The following day, twins underwent myocardial perfusion imaging with [82Rb]-chloride positron emission tomography. Quantitative and semiquantitative measures of myocardial perfusion and absolute myocardial blood flow were obtained.\nThe mean age was 68 years and 40% of the sample had an AHI\u226515, which indicates moderate to severe OSA. Abnormal myocardial perfusion, both with stress and at rest, was more common in twins with elevated AHI. After adjusting for clinical, lifestyle and behavioral factors, and previous history of cardiovascular disease, twins with AHI \u226515 had 3.6 higher odds (95% CI, 1.5-8.9) of an abnormal total severity score, defined as a score \u2265100, and for each 5-point increment in AHI, the odds of abnormality increased by 20% (95% CI, 7%-34%). Twin pairs where both twins had OSA exhibited the greatest risk. There were no differences in measures of ischemia and absolute myocardial blood flow and flow reserve by AHI status.\nOSA is associated with myocardial perfusion abnormalities that suggest prior subclinical myocardial scarring or infarction. Early environmental factors that affect both twins equally may play a role and should be further explored.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) by comparing disease concordance in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. This cross-sectional study analyzed 1294 (1040 monozygotic and 254 dizygotic) twin pairs (>20 years) based on the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study data (2005\u22122014). The odds ratios of disease concordance were calculated using binomial and multinomial logistic regression models. The occurrence of CMDs (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, cerebral stroke, transient ischemic attack, and ischemic heart disease) and related physical and laboratory levels did not differ between the monozygotic and dizygotic twin groups. The odds for concordance of the presence/absence of CMDs and the likelihood of incident CMD within monozygotic twins were comparable to that of dizygotic twins. The absolute differences in hemoglobin A1c, insulin, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure were lower in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins. Absolute differences in fasting glucose and diastolic blood pressure did not differ between groups. Although baseline levels of several laboratory parameters related to CMD showed a strong likelihood of heritability in monozygotic twins, CMD phenotype appears to be largely affected by environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the mode of birth in early-preterm, late-preterm, and near-term twins as well as to compare the maternal and neonatal outcomes of each group following vaginal birth (VB) and lower-segment cesarean section (LSCS).\nA prospective cohort study was conducted of 100 twin pregnancies in a tertiary center between 2018 and 2019. Deliveries were allocated into the following three gestational age groups (weeks\u2009\u00b1\u2009days) and compared: (1) early-preterm (28 to 31\u2009\u00b1\u20096), (2) late-preterm (32 to 35\u2009\u00b1\u20096), and (3) near-term (\u226536\u2009weeks).\nThe proportion of VB and LSCS were similar when early-preterm twins (P\u00a0=\u20090.766; relative risk [RR], 1.08) and late-preterm twins (P\u00a0=\u20090.071; RR, 1.21) were compared separately with near-term twins. Perinatal outcomes did not differ between VB and LSCS within each gestational age group. When compared with the near-term group, the early-preterm group had more hypoglycemia (P\u00a0<\u20090.001), hyperbilirubinemia (P\u00a0<\u20090.001), respiratory distress (P\u00a0<\u20090.001), low APGAR scores (P\u00a0<\u20090.001), and death (P\u00a0<\u20090.001) irrespective of the mode of birth. The late-preterm group had lower morbidity and mortality (P\u00a0=\u20090.227). Postpartum hemorrhage and blood transfusion were similar between the groups.\nThe proportion of VB and LSCS and associated maternal and neonatal outcomes did not differ in twins of different gestational ages. The data provide reassurance to practitioners to perform vaginal delivery in preterm twins.",

    "abstract": "Studies that focus on individual covariates, while ignoring their interactions, may not be adequate for model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) in any given patient. Genetic variations that influence protein synthesis should be studied in conjunction with environmental covariates, such as cigarette smoking. The aim of this study was to build virtual twins (VTs) of real patients receiving clozapine with interacting covariates related to genetics and environment and to delineate the impact of interacting covariates on predicted clozapine plasma concentrations. Clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia (N\u00a0=\u00a042) with observed clozapine plasma concentrations, demographic, environmental, and genotype data were used to construct VTs in Simcyp. The effect of increased covariate virtualization was assessed by performing simulations under three conditions: \"low\" (demographic), \"medium\" (demographic and environmental interaction), and \"high\" (demographic and environmental/genotype interaction) covariate virtualization. Increasing covariate virtualization with interaction improved the coefficient of variation (R",

    "abstract": "An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed on buccal cells from monozygotic-twins (MZ) reared together as children, but who live apart as adults. Cohorts of twin pairs were used to investigate associations between neighborhood walkability and objectively measured physical activity (PA) levels. Due to dramatic cellular epigenetic sex differences, male and female MZ twin pairs were analyzed separately to identify differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs). A priori comparisons were made on MZ twin pairs discordant on body mass index (BMI), PA levels, and neighborhood walkability. In addition to direct comparative analysis to identify specific DMRs, a weighted genome coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify DNA methylation sites associated with the physiological traits of interest. The pairs discordant in PA levels had epigenetic alterations that correlated with reduced metabolic parameters (i.e., BMI and waist circumference). The DNA methylation sites are associated with over fifty genes previously found to be specific to vigorous PA, metabolic risk factors, and sex. Combined observations demonstrate that behavioral factors, such as physical activity, appear to promote systemic epigenetic alterations that impact metabolic risk factors. The epigenetic DNA methylation sites and associated genes identified provide insight into PA impacts on metabolic parameters and the etiology of obesity.",

    "abstract": "An association between blood pressure and aortic stiffness is well known, but ambiguity remains as to whether one precedes the other. This study aimed to investigate the association of aortic stiffness with contemporaneous versus historic blood pressure and direction of causality between aortic stiffening and hypertension in female twins.\nAortic stiffness, measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded in 2037 female TwinsUK participants (mean age: 62.4\u00b19.7 years) at a single time point. A subset of 947 participants had repeat PWV and MAP measures (mean interval 5.5\u00b11.7 years) with additional historic MAP (mean interval 6.6\u00b13.3 years before baseline).\nCross-sectional multivariable linear regression analysis confirmed PWV significantly associated with age and MAP. In longitudinal analysis, annual progression of PWV was not associated with historic MAP (standardized beta coefficient [\u03b2]=-0.02, \nProgression of aortic stiffness associates more strongly with contemporaneous MAP compared with historic MAP. In contrast, progression of MAP is associated with prior arterial stiffness. These findings suggest a bidirectional relationship between arterial stiffness and blood pressure, and that lowering blood pressure may prevent a cycle of arterial stiffening and hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a rare and chronic neurological disease characterized by sudden sleep attacks, overwhelming daytime drowsiness, and cataplexy. When associated with a sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy) narcolepsy is classified as type 1, while the absence of cataplexy indicates type 2. Genetic, degenerative, and immunological hypotheses to explain the pathophysiology of NT1 are still a matter of debate. To contribute to the understanding of NT1 genetic basis, here we describe, for the first time, a whole genome analysis of a monozygotic twin pair discordant for NT1.\nWe present the case of a pair of 17-year-old male, monozygotic twins discordant for NT1. The affected twin had Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) of 20 (can range from 0 to 24), cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, polysomnography without abnormalities, multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) positive for narcolepsy, a mean sleep latency of 3\u00a0min, sleep-onset REM periods SOREMPs of 5, presence of allele HLA-DQB1*06:02, and Hypocretin-1 level of zero pg/mL (normal values are\u2009>\u2009200\u00a0pg/mL). The other twin had no narcolepsy symptoms (ESS of 4), normal polysomnography, MSLT without abnormalities, presence of allele HLA-DQB1*06:02, and Hypocretin-1 level of 396,74\u00a0pg/mL. To describe the genetic background for the NT1 discordant manifestations in this case, we present the whole-genome analysis of this monozygotic twin pair. The whole-genome comparison revealed that both twins have identical NT1 pathogenic mutations in known genes, such as HLA-DQB1*06:02:01, HLA-DRB1*11:01:02/*15:03:01. The affected twin has the expected clinical manifestation while the unaffected twin has an unexpected phenotype. The unaffected twin has significantly more frameshift mutations as compared to the affected twin (108 versus 75) and mutations that affect stop codons (61 versus 5 in stop gain, 26 versus 2 in start lost).\nThe differences observed in frameshift and stop codon mutations in the unaffected twin are consistent with loss-of-function effects and protective alleles, that are almost always associated with loss-of-function rare alleles. Also, overrepresentation analysis of genes containing variants with potential clinical relevance in the unaffected twin shows that most mutations are in genes related to immune regulation function, Golgi apparatus, MHC, and olfactory receptor. These observations support the hypothesis that NT1 has an immunological basis although protective mutations in non-HLA alleles might interfere with the expression of the NT1 phenotype and consequently, with the clinical manifestation of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of eosinophilic pneumonia is currently poorly understood, and this disease has not been reported in twins since 1983. Herein, we report a case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia in twins, which appeared to be triggered by initial smoking at different times by both patients. One patient resumed smoking after recovering from eosinophilic pneumonia, with no observed recurrence. This study discussed the possibility of an association between susceptibility to eosinophilic pneumonia and genetic factors in twins.",

    "abstract": "Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) are currently the subject of much debate both in terms of their technological frontiers as well as their ethical, legal and societal implications (ELSI). Regulation of such technologies as medical devices currently lacks behind their level of adoption. Digital Twins are the next evolution step of such DHTs and provide an opportunity to anticipate and act on ELSI before adoption again leaps before the necessary review. This paper introduces the concept and use cases of digital twins in medicine, then frames the debate through the lens of related technologies, machine learning and personalized medicine, and maps ethical challenges stemming from those. Finally, we lay out how digital twins may change and challenge the future practice of medicine.",

    "abstract": "This paper makes a contribution to research on digital twins that are generated from robot sensor data. We present the results of an online user study in which 240 participants were tasked to identify real-world objects from robot point cloud data. In the study we manipulated the render style (point clouds vs voxels), render resolution (i.e., density of point clouds and granularity of voxel grids), colour (monochrome vs coloured points/voxels), and motion (no motion vs rotational motion) of the shown objects to measure the impact of these attributes on object recognition performance. A statistical analysis of the study results suggests that there is a three-way interaction between our independent variables. Further analysis suggests: ",

    "abstract": "Physical activity is a cornerstone of chronic disease prevention and treatment, yet most US adults do not perform levels recommended for health. The neighborhood-built environment (BE) may support or hinder physical activity levels. This study investigated whether identical twins who reside in more walkable BEs have greater activity levels than twins who reside in less walkable BEs (between-twin analysis), and whether associations remain significant when controlling for genetic and shared environmental factors (within-twin analysis).\nA cross-sectional study.\nThe Puget Sound region around Seattle, Washington, USA.\nThe sample consisted of 112 identical twin pairs who completed an in-person assessment and 2-week at-home measurement protocol using a global positioning system (GPS)monitor and accelerometer.\nThe walkability of each participants' place of residence was calculated using three BE dimensions (intersection density, population density and destination accessibility). For each variable, z scores were calculated and summed to produce the final walkability score.\nObjectively measured bouts of walking and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), expressed as minutes per week.\nWalkability was associated with walking bouts (but not MVPA) within the neighbourhood, both between (b=0.58, SE=0.13, p<0.001) and within pairs (b=0.61, SE=0.18, p=0.001). For a pair with a 2-unit difference in walkability, the twin in a more walkable neighbourhood is likely to walk approximately 16\u2009min per week more than the co-twin who lives in a less walkable neighbourhood.\nThis study provides robust evidence of an association between walkability and objective walking bouts. Improvements to the neighbourhood BE could potentially lead to increased activity levels in communities throughout the USA.",

Accurate prediction of radiation dosimetry pre-treatment with scope to adjust dosing for optimal target and non-target tissue doses is consistent with striving for improved the outcomes of precision medicine. The combination of artificial intelligence and production of digital twins could provide an avenue for an individualised therapy doses and enhanced outcomes in theranostics. While there are barriers to overcome, the maturity of individual technologies (i.e. radiation dosimetry, artificial intelligence, theranostics and digital twins) places these approaches within reach.",

    "abstract": "Fully effective intrapartum cardiotocographic (CTG) fetal heart monitoring is still missing. Visual analysis is far from credibility. Additional, computerized analysis techniques were proposed however they did not substantially decrease possible risks of fetal asphyxia. In twin pregnancies the problem is even more complicated. Our goal is to find the most valuable parameters in intrapartum CTG surveillance in twins, based on actual FIGO criteria.\nStudy included 58 women in labor who had been admitted to Delivery Department of tertiary care hospital with twin pregnancy in a period of one year. The features of the CTG (e.g., baseline, oscillation, decelerations, brady- or tachycardia) were grouped to create three variables that were closest to the FIGO CTG scale. All three groups were compared according to neonatal status (Apgar score at 5 min \u2265 7 or < 7; pH value in umbilical artery \u2265 7.20, < 7.20 or < 7.10 and BE (base excess) > or \u2264 -12). Fetal status and its acid - base equilibrium was compared either with long term variability (LTV), short term variability (STV), or percentage of the signal loss.\nOut of 58 twin pregnancies, a total of 116 babies were born. One baby was born dead. From this group, 11 deliveries were natural births and 47 deliveries were C-sections. None of the analyzed features (pH, BE, Apgar, CTG features except tracing length, CTG FIGO categories) were statistically different between groups of singleton and twin pregnancies, except percentage of C-sections. No differences were found either for STV or LTV and fetal status.org CTG categories.\nPrior to cardiotocographic tracing of twins during labor, ultrasound examination should be mandatory. Considerable loss of signal in CTG tracing in twins should provoke ultrasonographic confirmation of the fetal status.",

    "abstract": "A digital twin is a virtual model developed to accurately reflect a physical thing or a system. In radiology, a digital twin of a radiological device enables developers to test its characteristics, make alterations to the design or materials, and test the success or failure of the modifications in a virtual environment. Innovative technologies, such as AI and -omics sciences, may build virtual models for patients that are continuously adjustable based on live-tracked health/lifestyle parameters. Accordingly, healthcare could use digital twins to improve personalized medicine. Furthermore, the accumulation of digital twin models from real-world deployments will enable large cohorts of digital patients that may be used for virtual clinical trials and population studies. Through their further refinement, development, and application into clinical practice, digital twins could be crucial in the era of personalized medicine, revolutionizing how diseases are detected and managed. Although significant challenges remain in the development of digital twins, a structural modification to the current operating models is occurring, and radiologists can guide the introduction of such technology into healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Twins account for approximately 1 in 30 live births in the United States. However, there are limited clinical experience studies published in noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for detecting aneuploidies in twins. This study reports the performance of an SNP-based NIPT in the largest cohort with known outcomes for high-risk aneuploidy results.\nThis is a retrospective analysis of 18,984 results from commercial single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based NIPT tests performed in twins between October 2, 2017 and December 31, 2019. Follow-up for all 211 high-risk cases was solicited.\nFollow-up outcomes were obtained in 105 cases. Positive predictive values (PPVs) for high-risk results were 88.7% (63/71, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 79.0%-95.0%) for trisomy 21% and 72.7% (8/11, 95% CI: 39.0%-94.0%) for trisomy 18. The results were stratified into monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ). The PPVs in MZ were 100% for both trisomy 21 (4/4, 95% CI: 40%-100%) and trisomy 18 (1/1, 95% CI: 2.5%-100%). No trisomy 13 cases were detected in the MZ group. The PPVs\u00a0in DZ were 88.1% (59/67, 95% CI: 77.8%-94.7%), 70.0% (7/10, 95% CI: 34.8%-93.3%), and 66.7% (2/3, 95% CI: 9.4%-99.2%) for trisomy 21, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13, respectively.\nThe performance of SNP-based NIPT in this large twin cohort was comparable to previously reported twin NIPT studies. SNP-based NIPT allows for zygosity-based PPV assessment.",

    "abstract": "We aim to contribute to the literature reporting tests of selection in utero. The theory of reproductive suppression predicts that natural selection would conserve mechanisms, referred to collectively as selection in utero, that spontaneously abort fetuses unlikely to thrive as infants in the prevailing environment. Tests of this prediction include reports that women give birth to fewer than expected male twins, historically among the frailest of infants, during stressful times. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in Spring 2020 demonstrably stressed the population. We test the hypothesis that conception cohorts in gestation at the onset of the pandemic in the United States yielded fewer than expected live male twin births.\nWe retrieved deidentified data on the universe of live births in the United States from the National Center for Health Statistics birth certificate records. We applied Box-Jenkins time-series methods to the twin secondary sex ratio computed for 77 monthly conception cohorts spanning August 2013 to December 2019 to detect outlying cohorts in gestation at the onset of the pandemic.\nThe twin secondary sex ratio fell below expected values in three conception cohorts (i.e., July, September, and October 2019, all p\u00a0<\u2009.05) exposed in utero to the onset of the pandemic.\nOur results add to prior findings consistent with selection in utero. The role of selection in utero in shaping the characteristics of live births cohorts, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, warrants further scrutiny.",

    "abstract": "Premature infants are born with immature lungs that demonstrate abnormal pulmonary function with differences in passive respiratory system compliance and resistance, and functional residual capacity. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated differences in neonatal pulmonary function based on the type of twin gestation, or chorionicity. Given the effect of chorionicity on outcomes, we aimed to study the effect of twin type, monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) vs dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA), on neonatal early pulmonary function tests.\nIn this prospective cohort study, 5 sets of DCDA twins were matched to 5 sets of MCMA twins on gestational age at delivery, latency from antenatal corticosteroid exposure, birthweight, race and gender. Mean values were compared for passive respiratory system compliance and resistance, functional residual capacity, and tidal volume.\nMCMA infants had a significantly lower compliance (0.64 vs 1.25\u200amL/cm H2O /kg; p\u200a=\u200a0.0001) and significantly higher resistance (0.130 vs 0.087\u200acm H2O /mL/sec; p\u200a=\u200a0.0003) than DCDA infants. Functional residual capacity was lower for MCMA than DCDA infants (17.5 vs 23.4\u200amL/kg; p\u200a=\u200a0.17). Further, 80% of MCMA infants required intubation for surfactant administration compared to 20% of DCDA infants, indicating the clinical significance of these objective measures.\nDue to the matched case-control design, causality cannot be established. However, we speculate that these differences in lung function may derive from differential exposure to preterm labor and endogenous maternal corticosteroid exposure. Further study is necessary to establish the true causal relationship.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are described as having been physically fused during pregnancy and delivery. They were first mentioned a long time ago when there was not much known about this. They share some organs that are vital for survival, like the heart; these twins are almost impossible to save, but there are some cases wherein there is evidence of their survival. The article aims to present a unique discussion on conjoined twins. This article talks about the formation of conjoint twins, their types and nomenclatures, embryological concepts, past history/traditional tales, case studies, and the medical enhancements happening in this area.\u00a0Both fission and fusion are thought to contribute to the disease. A monozygotic twin pregnancy cleaves when it occurs more than thirteen days after fertilization. There is just one placenta and one womb for conjoined twins (one amniotic sac).\u00a0The twins that are born and stay alive after delivery usually stay alive for a few days or weeks. It's pretty rare for them to live a long prosperous life, but this article shows the otherwise, too, like the Siamese twins, which is a unique example of conjoint twins who lived for a long time. This kind of pregnancy is a complex procedure that needs to be managed by a team of professionals.",

    "abstract": "Humans are simultaneously exposed to phenols and phthalates (PAEs). However, the mixture effect of phenols and PAEs on the body size of twins is lacking. From 2016 to 2018, we recruited 228 pregnant twins and collected up to three urine samples. A total of 8 PAE metabolites and 7 phenols were detected in urine by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Chemical individual and mixture effects were estimated. Multivariable linear regression results presented the percentage change in twins' growth differences at one month old with maternal PAE and phenol exposure. These chemicals were positively associated with weight differences during the entire trimester. Moreover, the quantile g-computed model showed that increased urinary concentrations of all chemicals by one quartile were associated with a 22.85% (95%CI: 11.21-35.72%), 22.60% (95%CI: 12.31-33.83%), and 24.05% (95%CI: 13.11-36.05%) larger weight difference within twins in each trimester, respectively. Increasing all PAE metabolites and phenols by one quantile across the entire trimester, weight differences increased by 26.61% (95% CI: 15.79%, 38.44%), and height differences increased by 15.84% (95%CI: 3.92%, 29.13%). Co-exposure to PAEs and phenols may primarily play a role in twins' growth.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins capacitate the industry 4.0 paradigm by predicting and optimizing the performance of physical assets of interest, mirroring a realistic in-silico representation of their functional behaviour. Although advanced digital twins set forth disrupting opportunities by delineating the in-service product and the related process dynamic performance, they have yet to be adopted by the pharma sector. The latter, currently struggles more than ever before to improve solubility of BCS II i.e., hard-to-dissolve active pharmaceutical ingredients by micronization and subsequent stabilization. Herein we construct and functionally validate the first artificially intelligent digital twin thread, capable of describing the course of manufacturing of such solidified nanosuspensions given a defined lifecycle starting point and predict and optimize the relevant process outcomes. To this end, we referenced experimental data as the sampling source, which we then augmented via pattern recognition utilizing neural network propagations. The zeta-dynamic potential metrics of the nanosuspensions were correlated to the interfacial Gibbs energy, while the density and heat capacity of the material system was calculated via the Saft-\u03b3-Mie statistical fluid theory. The curated data was then fused to physical and empirical laws to choose the appropriate theory and numeric description, respectively, before being polished by tuning the critical parameters to achieve the best fit with reality.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To report the clinical and radiographic findings and molecular etiology of the first monozygotic twins affected with Pfeiffer syndrome. Methods: Clinical and radiographic examination and whole exome sequencing were performed on two monozygotic twins with Pfeiffer syndrome. Results: An acceptor splice site mutation in FGFR2 (c.940-2A>G) was detected in both twins. The father and both twins shared the same haplotype, indicating that the mutant allele was from their father\u2019s chromosome who suffered severe upper airway obstruction and subsequent obstructive sleep apnea. Hypertrophy of nasal turbinates appears to be a newly recognized finding of Pfeiffer syndrome. Increased intracranial pressure in both twins were corrected early by fronto-orbital advancement with skull expansion and open osteotomy, in order to prevent the more severe consequences of increased intracranial pressure, including hydrocephalus, the bulging of the anterior fontanelle, and the diastasis of suture. Conclusions: Both twins carried a FGFR2 mutation and were discordant for lambdoid synostosis. Midface hypoplasia, narrow nasal cavities, and hypertrophic nasal turbinates resulted in severe upper airway obstruction and subsequent obstructive sleep apnea in both twins. Hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates appears to be a newly recognized finding of Pfeiffer syndrome. Fronto-orbital advancement with skull expansion and open osteotomy was performed to treat increased intracranial pressure in both twins. This is the first report of monozygotic twins with Pfeiffer syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins represent a rare type of monoamniotic twins. Ultrasound assessment during the first trimester can facilitate the diagnosis, however further assessment by colour Doppler studies, 3D imaging, fetal echocardiography and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually required in order to determine the specific fetal abnormalities and to guide appropriate pregnancy management. This case report presents a rare case of conjoined twins complicating a dichorionic-diamniotic triplet pregnancy, achieved after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and blastocyst transfer. A 44-year-old woman was referred for chorionicity determination to our Fetal Medicine Centre due to suspicion of conjoined twins in a triplet pregnancy. Ultrasound assessment at 11 weeks demonstrated a dichorionic triplet pregnancy which was also complicated by a rare type of conjoined twins (thoracoomphalopagus) and after a successful embryo reduction a neonate of 2200 g was delivered by caesarean section at term. The accurate diagnosis and early detection of conjoined twins by a fetal medicine specialist is crucial, especially as far as multiple pregnancies with three or more fetuses are concerned.",

    "abstract": "Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction, often elevated myocardial enzymes, and electrocardiographic changes. Previous studies suggested that an overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system might cause TTS. However, the pathogenesis of TTS is largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated physiological stress reactivity with a standardized stress test in monozygotic twin sisters, only one of whom had experienced TTS.\nThe 60-year-old Caucasian monozygotic twins, one with and one without a previous episode of TTS, were recruited in the Department of Cardiology at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. We applied the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to investigate stress reactivity six weeks after the TTS. Hemodynamic measures (heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP)), heart rate variability (HRV), plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine and salivary cortisol levels were collected immediately before and after the TSST, and 15, 45, and 90 min after TSST. The monozygotic twins differed in their hemodynamic stress response with the TTS twin showing blunted HR and BP reactivity and vagal withdrawal beyond the acute phase of stress. In contrast, the TTS twin showed a higher catecholamine and cortisol stress response with a steady increase in norepinephrine during the recovery period from stress compared to her non-TTS twin sister.\nLarge studies applying a case-control design are needed to confirm blunted hemodynamic reactivity, increased catecholamine reactivity, vagal withdrawal, and increased cortisol reactivity to stress in TTS. This may advance the knowledge of psychophysiological mechanisms in TTS.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the research was to assess the genetic and environmental influences on bone properties. One hundred thirty-two pairs of twins (99/33 monozygotic/dizygotic) underwent anthropometric measurements and phalangeal quantitative ultrasound (DBM Sonic 1200, Igea, Italy) measuring the amplitude speed of sound (AD-SoS, m/s). The mean age was 16.78 \u00b1 12.35 years for monozygotic twins and 14.30 \u00b1 8 years for dizygotic. Interpair and intrapair correlations between twins were calculated. In the groups of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, Ad-SoS correlated significantly with age (r = 0.56\u22120.73, p < 0.05), weight (r = 0.73\u22120.78, p < 0.05), and height (r = 0.80\u22120.81, p < 0.05). The strongest intrapair correlation (r = 0.99\u22120.998) was noted in monozygotic females for Ad-SoS, weight, and height. There was a statistically significant correlation between the intrapair difference of Ad-SoS and age but only in the groups of monozygotic and dizygotic females (r = 0.281, r2 = 0.079, and p = 0.028; r = 0.544, r2 = 0.296, and p = 0.01, respectively). After age adjustment, it was estimated that 28.62% of Ad-SoS in women and 13.2% of Ad-SoS in men was explained by genetic influence, leading to the conclusion that Ad-SoS changed with age, weight, and height. The strongest correlation between pairs of twins was observed in monozygotic twins. The differences in bone values between female twins arose with age, which indicated the role of environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "This case reports peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomic changes in a pair of male monozygotic pediatric twins with metabolic syndrome (MetS) undertaking assisted weight loss. These 14-year-old boys presented with similar baseline biochemistry and body composition. After a 16-week weight-loss intervention, percent body weight loss was similar (Twin A 12%, and Twin B 13%). MetS resolved in Twin A but Twin B maintained elevated triglycerides after weight loss. Analysis of the PBMC transcriptome before and after weight loss revealed very different changes in gene expression including differences in the direction of expression of genes related to immune cell activation. 48.7% of genes that were downregulated in Twin A were upregulated in Twin B. This case highlights a novel approach to report the influence of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic dysfunction on the PBMC transcriptome. It explores whether expression of genes related to immune functions may underlie the differences in response to weight loss or whether transcriptomic alterations in immune cells may precede more traditional biomarkers of chronic pro-inflammation. These monozygotic twins present an example of divergence of phenotypic outcomes despite identical genetic background and similar treatment response.",

    "abstract": "We are rapidly approaching a future in which cancer patient digital twins will reach their potential to predict cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in individual patients. This will be realized based on advances in high performance computing, computational modeling, and an expanding repertoire of observational data across multiple scales and modalities. In 2020, the US National Cancer Institute, and the US Department of Energy, through a trans-disciplinary research community at the intersection of advanced computing and cancer research, initiated team science collaborative projects to explore the development and implementation of predictive Cancer Patient Digital Twins. Several diverse pilot projects were launched to provide key insights into important features of this emerging landscape and to determine the requirements for the development and adoption of cancer patient digital twins. Projects included exploring approaches to using a large cohort of digital twins to perform deep phenotyping and plan treatments at the individual level, prototyping self-learning digital twin platforms, using adaptive digital twin approaches to monitor treatment response and resistance, developing methods to integrate and fuse data and observations across multiple scales, and personalizing treatment based on cancer type. Collectively these efforts have yielded increased insights into the opportunities and challenges facing cancer patient digital twin approaches and helped define a path forward. Given the rapidly growing interest in patient digital twins, this manuscript provides a valuable early progress report of several CPDT pilot projects commenced in common, their overall aims, early progress, lessons learned and future directions that will increasingly involve the broader research community.",

    "abstract": "Early-onset isolated (DYT1) dystonia is one of the most common forms of primary dystonia in childhood, and deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus (GPi-DBS) is a highly effective treatment for it. However, the effectiveness of GPi-DBS in monozygotic twins with DYT1 dystonia has never been reported globally. Here, we report the cases of monozygotic twins with DYT1 dystonia who were treated using GPi-DBS, and we include a literature review. The younger brother showed an abnormal gait, with external rotation of the right lower leg at 6 years old. The symptoms gradually became so severe that he had difficulty walking on his own at 9 years of age. Treatment with levodopa-carbidopa partially resolved his symptoms, but most of the symptoms remained. Meanwhile, the older brother developed dystonia in both upper limbs at 8 years of age, with gradual symptom progression. At 13 years of age, they were diagnosed with DYT1 dystonia. Bilateral GPi-DBS was performed in both patients at 16 years of age. Their symptoms remarkably improved after surgery. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale (BFMDRS) movement score was reduced from 52 to 2 points for the younger brother and from 35 to 1 point for the older brother. Even if monozygotic twins have the same genes, the onset and severity of symptoms might vary in accordance with differences in epigenomic profiles. However, GPi-DBS treatment was very effective for the two cases; thus, we should consider the surgical interventions for each patient.",

    "abstract": "While reports of twin pairs concordant for insanity began to appear in the 19th century, the first modern psychiatric twin study that fulfilled Galton's 1875 promise of the value of the twin method was published by the German Psychiatrist and Geneticist Hans Luxenburger in 1928. Luxenburger introduced four major methodological advances: the use of representative sampling, proband-wise concordance, rigorous zygosity diagnoses, and age correction. He used a narrow Kraepelinian diagnostic approach diagnosis and ascertained twins hospitalized, on a specific day, in all large Bavarian asylums. We include a brief biography of Luxenburger, summarize the findings of his paper and provide a full English translation in the appendix. Luxenburger presents evidence that the frequency of twinning in those with severe mental illness were as expected and reports proband-wise concordance for probable and definite dementia praecox (MZ-76%, DZ-0%) and manic-depressive insanity (MZ-75%, DZ-0%). He also examined eccentricity and hyperthymic or hypothymic personality in the dementia praecox and manic-depressive pairs, respectively. Luxenburger's substantial contributions to the history of psychiatric genetics should be considered in the context of his intimate but ambivalent relationship with the racial-hygiene policy of the German National Socialists.",

    "abstract": "The influence of the host genome on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility and severity is supported by reports on monozygotic (MZ) twins where both were infected simultaneously with similar disease outcomes, including several who died due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection within days apart. However, successive exposures to pathogens throughout life along with other environmental factors make the immune response unique for each individual, even among MZ twins.\nHere we report a case of a young adult monozygotic twin pair, who caught attention since both presented simultaneously severe COVID-19 with the need for oxygen support despite age and good health conditions. One of the twins, who spent more time hospitalized, reported symptoms of long-COVID even 7 months after infection. Immune cell profile and specific responses to SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated as well as whole exome sequencing.\nAlthough the MZ twin brothers shared the same genetic mutations which may be associated with their increased risk of developing severe COVID-19, their clinical progression was different, reinforcing the role of both immune response and genetics in the COVID-19 presentation and course. Besides, post-COVID syndrome was observed in one of them, corroborating an association between the duration of hospitalization and the occurrence of long-COVID symptoms.",

The patients were divided into two groups: laser group and control group. Placentas with twin survival were injected, and pregnancy outcomes and placental characteristics of the two groups were compared. The correlation between the birth-weight discordance and placental characteristics in each group was analyzed.\nThe gestational age at first diagnosis in the laser group was significantly smaller than that in the control group (21.6 \u00b1 2.8 weeks vs. 27.7 \u00b1 3.0 weeks, \nThe birth-weight discordance is positively correlated with placental territory discordance in TTTS patients after FLS.",

    "abstract": "Deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2) is an autosomal recessive disease associated with a highly variable clinical presentation, including vasculitis, immunodeficiency, and hematologic manifestations, potentially progressing over time. The present study describes the long-term evolution of the immuno-hematological features and therapeutic challenge of two identical adult twin sisters affected by DADA2. The absence of plasmatic adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) activity in both twins suggested the diagnosis of DADA2, then confirmed by genetic analysis.

However, the roles of hypermethylation in this malignant disease are uncertain.\nBone marrow samples from a JMML patient and peripheral blood samples from a healthy monozygotic twin and an unrelated healthy donor were collected with the informed consent of the participant's parents. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was then performed. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to analyze specific differentially methylated region (DMG) related genes. The target genes were screened with Cytoscape and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING), which are gene/protein interaction databases. A data mining platform was used to examine the expression level data of the healthy control and JMML patient tissues in Gene Expression Omnibus data sets, and a survival analysis was performed for all the JMML patients.\nThe STRING analysis revealed that the red node [i.e., the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (",

    "abstract": "Twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence is an extremely rare congenital anomaly in monochorionic (MC) twins. The condition is characterized by a malformed fetus (acardiac twin) without cardiac activities being perfused by a structurally normal one (pump twin) \nWe described the first case of TRAP to receive laser surgery in Vietnam. The 26-wk pregnancy was originally misdiagnosed in another hospital as MC twins with single intrauterine fetal death. Following admission to our center, the diagnosis was amended to a 26-wk TRAP sequence stage IIb. The acardiac twin was 7.5 cm at the longest length, the ratio of the weight of the acardiac twin to the weight of the pump twin was more than 90%, the pump twin showed fetal distress with absent diastolic flow in umbilical artery of pump twin, and the peak systolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery = 1.6 MoM. We performed emergency laser photocoagulation of the acardiac twin's umbilical cord. After surgery, we successfully maintained the pregnancy for 8 wk and ended it electively by cesarean section at 34 wk of gestation due to rupture of membranes.\nTRAP should be appropriately diagnosed and treated early to avoid complications of the pump twin. Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation is a new and effective treatment for this condition.",

    "abstract": "The lifespan of humans varies greatly between individuals. Here, we aimed to explore what biological roles miRNAs may have on old age mortality-variation. Circulating miRNAs were measured in plasma from 43 monozygotic twin pairs (73-95\u00a0years of age) and mortality analyses were applied using Cox regression survival analyses and linear regression analyses of lifespan. In general, nominally significant miRNAs were mainly upregulated with shorter lifespan, both in Cox analysis (72\u00a0% upregulated) and in linear regression analysis (81\u00a0% upregulated). A total of 29 miRNAs were associated to mortality at a nominal significance level (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the survival analysis, but no miRNAs passed the FDR adjusted level of significance. Seven of the 29 miRNAs; hsa-miR-140-3p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-487b-3p, hsa-miR-19a-3p, hsa-let-7d-5p, hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-375, were nominally significant across two linear twin-paired analyses and the cox analysis. Pathway analyses of the 29 nominally significant miRNAs from the individual level analyses resulted in two nominally significant associated Reactome pathways (unadjusted p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); 'Negative regulation of FGFR signaling' and 'Neurotransmitter receptor binding and downstream transmission in the postsynaptic cell', and two significantly associated KEGG pathways; 'Linoleic acid metabolism' and 'Toxoplasmosis'. Additional pathway analyses and results of previous studies support that miRNAs linked to mortality at age 70\u00a0years or older play a role in lipid metabolism, tissues maintenance and morphology.",

Here, we evaluate DNA methylation at birth in 41 leukemia-discordant monozygotic twin pairs using the Illumina EPIC array on archived neonatal blood spots to identify epigenetic variation associated with development of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, independent of genetic influence. Through conditional logistic regression we identify 240 significant probes and 10 regions associated with the discordant onset of leukemia. We identify a significant negative coefficient bias, indicating DNA hypomethylation in cases, across the array and enhanced in open sea, shelf/shore, and gene body regions compared to promoter and CpG island regions. Here, we show an association between global DNA hypomethylation and future development of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia across disease-discordant genetically identical twins, implying DNA hypomethylation may contribute more generally to leukemia risk.",

    "abstract": "The visibility available to an equipment operator on a dynamic construction site can often be blocked by various obstacles such as materials, temporary or permanent facilities, other equipment, and workers. Equipment monitoring in real-time digital twins can thus play a crucial role in accident prevention. This paper develops a scalable technical approach and presents a prototype application framework for transmitting real world sensor data to update 3D equipment models inside a graphical digital twin for concurrent visualization of a monitored construction operation. The developed framework and workflow can be extended to visualize any construction operation, as it occurs, inside a dynamic 3D world simply by outfitting the real equipment with appropriate sensors and connecting them to their virtual counterparts. The implemented proof-of-concept interface is described in the context of a real-time 3D digital twin for assisting excavator operators prevent unintended strikes with underground utilities. Experiments to validate the proposed technical approach by simulating the real-time motion of a backhoe loader's articulated arm using orientation sensors installed on its boom, stick, and bucket are described. The experimental results characterize the scope and potential reasons for spatio-temporal discrepancies that can occur between a monitored real operation and its replicated digital twin. The effect of an operator warning mechanism based on preset safety thresholds is also investigated and described.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have suggested the role of multiple genetic and environmental factors in the development of non-neoplastic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases; however, little information is available on these factors in the Korean population. Therefore, this cross-sectional study explored the effect of these factors by analyzing the concordance of several benign GI disorders in 525 monozygotic twins compared to that in 122 dizygotic twins aged >20 years from the Healthy Twin Study data of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (2005-2014). Chi-square test, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and binomial and multinomial logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis. There was lack of concordance of gastric/duodenal ulcers and cholelithiasis/cholangitis between monozygotic twins compared to that in dizygotic twins, suggesting that environmental factors may mediate those concordant disease expressions in monozygotic twins. The concordance of intestinal polyps in monozygotic twins was 32% lower than that in dizygotic twins (",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the success rate of trial of labor in monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies and the impact of delivery mode on neonatal outcomes.\nSearches were performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from the inception of each database until April 2022.\nSelection criteria included observational studies analyzing the delivery mode among monochorionic diamniotic gestations.\nAll analyses were carried out using an intention-to-treat approach, evaluating women according to the delivery mode to which they were assigned in the original studies.\nSeventeen studies met the eligibility criteria and were suitable for qualitative and quantitative analysis. In total, 4116 women were analyzed. This meta-analysis showed that trial of labor in monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies resulted in vaginal delivery of both twins in 75.5% of cases (95% confidence interval, 69.1-80.9). Failure to deliver the second twin vaginally occurred in 3.8% of cases (95% confidence interval, 2.5-5.7). In addition, the neonatal outcomes were comparable among women with monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy undergoing different planned delivery modes. Neonatal death occurred in 3.7 per 1000 cases in the planned cesarean delivery group and in 1.6 per 1000 cases in the planned vaginal delivery group. Perinatal death was observed in 7.5 per 1000 cases in the planned cesarean delivery group and in 5.8 per 1000 cases in the planned vaginal delivery group. Umbilical artery pH <7.00 occurred in 0 per 1000 cases in the planned cesarean delivery and 4.6 per 1000 cases in the planned vaginal delivery group. Neonatal intensive care unit stay of >72 hours had a prevalence of 59.7 per 1000 cases in the planned cesarean delivery and 42.8 per 1000 cases in the planned vaginal delivery group.\nThis meta-analysis showed that trial of labor in monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies is successful in most cases and relatively safe, considering that neonatal and perinatal mortality and severe morbidity were comparable between the trial of labor and planned cesarean delivery groups. Therefore, the choice of planned delivery mode in twin gestations should not be made a priori.",

    "abstract": "Many theories in the social sciences assume that parenting affects child development. Previous research mostly supports the notion that parenting affects the skill development of children in early childhood. There are fewer studies testing whether parenting in early adolescence has such an influence. We estimate the effects of parenting on early adolescents' noncognitive skills using data from the German Twin Family Panel (TwinLife). Specifically, we look at the effects of parenting styles, parental activities, and extracurricular activities on the academic self-concept, motivation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and locus of control of 10 to 14 years old children. To control for unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality, we employ twin fixed-effects models combined with longitudinal information. In addition, MZ twin fixed effects models also control for genetic confounding. Our findings provide no support to the notion that parenting styles, parental activities, and extracurricular activities in early adolescence affect the development of children's noncognitive skills. We conclude that our results, in combination with the majority of evidence from previous research, are in line with a model according to which parenting has larger effects on the skill development of children in early childhood than in early adolescence.",

    "abstract": "In order to improve the library's ability of cross-platform information retrieval and data scheduling and distribution, a library cross-platform information retrieval system based on digital twin technology is designed. Using data warehouse decision support and data source structured query methods, the spectral characteristics of Library cross-platform information resources are extracted. Using the method of Hadoop data parallel loading, the library cross-platform operation data is divided into decision-making data, computing resource pool data, and Hadoop parallel loading data. A library cross-platform information digital twin parallel retrieval and information fusion feature matching model is established, and the retrieval channels are allocated through multiple complex and balanced task scheduling sequences. According to the queue configuration model of Library cross-platform information retrieval, the optimization design of Library cross-platform information retrieval system is realized. The simulation test results show that the designed system has good recall ability of cross-platform information retrieval data, and improves the utilization rate of cross-platform resources and the dynamic scheduling ability of online resources.",

    "abstract": "The differential impact of depression across different periods in life on mortality remains inconclusive. We aimed to examine the association of depression that occurs at different age with all-cause mortality, and to explore the roles of dementia, as well as genetic and early-life environmental factors, in this association.\nFrom the Swedish Twin Registry, 44,919 twin individuals were followed for up to 18 years. Depression was ascertained using the National Patient Registry and categorized as early-life (<45 years), midlife (45-64 years), and late-life (\u226565 years) depression according to the age of the first diagnosis. Deaths were identified through the Cause of Death Register. Generalized estimating equation, generalized structural equation, and conditional logistic regression were used for unmatched, mediation, and co-twin matched analyses, respectively.\nIn unmatched analyses, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality were 1.71 (1.46-2.00) for depression at any age, 1.72 (1.36-2.17) for early-life, 1.51 (1.19-1.90) for midlife, and 4.10 (2.02-8.34) for late-life depression. Mortality was significantly higher in individuals with late-life depression than those with earlier-life depression (\nDepression is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, and dementia mediates approximately 60% of the impact of depression on mortality in late life. Genetic and early-life environmental factors may not play a significant role in the depression-mortality association.",

    "abstract": "Weight discordance is among the major determinants of perinatal outcome in twin pregnancies. Weight discordance can occur in each trimester of pregnancy, though the clinical meaning of such finding and the association with adverse perinatal outcome can vary according to the gestational age (GA) at detection of growth discrepancy. Discrepancy in fetal size in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of anomalies, aneuploidy, and fetal loss, though the predictive accuracy of using discordance to predict perinatal outcome is low. Conversely, discordance in the third trimester of pregnancy can be associated with fetal growth restriction, perinatal mortality, and morbidity. In view of these associations, twin pregnancies should be monitored for the occurrence of growth discrepancy. The present review aims to provide an up-to-date critical appraisal of the diagnosis and clinical management of twin pregnancies complicated by growth discordance according to the trimester at presentation.",

    "abstract": "To explore the differences in DNA methylation associated with age-related hearing loss in a study of 57 twin pairs from China.\nMonozygotic twins were identified through the Qingdao Twin Registration system. The median age of participants was\u00a0>\u00a050\u00a0years. Their hearing thresholds were measured using a multilevel pure-tone audiometry assessment. The pure-tone audiometry was calculated at low frequencies (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0\u00a0kHz), speech frequencies (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0\u00a0kHz), and high frequencies (4.0 and 8\u00a0kHz). The CpG sites were tested using a linear mixed-effects model, and the function of the cis-regulatory regions and ontological enrichments were predicted using the online Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool. The differentially methylated regions were identified using a comb-p python library approach.\nIn each of the PTA categories (low-, speech-, high-frequency), age-related hearing loss was detected in 25.9%, 19.3%, and 52.8% of participants. In the low-, speech- and high-frequency categories we identified 18, 42, and 12 individual CpG sites and 6, 11, and 6 differentially methylated regions. The CpG site located near DUSP4 had the strongest association with low- and speech-frequency, while the strongest association with high-frequency was near C21orf58. We identified associations of ALG10 with high-frequency hearing, C3 and LCK with low- and speech-frequency hearing, and GBX2 with low-frequency hearing. Top pathways that may be related to hearing, such as the Notch signaling pathway, were also identified.\nOur study is the first of its kind to identify these genes and their associated with DNA methylation may play essential roles in the hearing process. The results of our epigenome-wide association study on twins clarify the complex mechanisms underlying age-related hearing loss.",

The transplant was performed because of diabetes mellitus type (DM1) related renal failure. Now in her sixties, the patient has had exceptional prolonged bi-graft function without immunosuppression. She is free from DM1 recurrence, does not take insulin, and her creatinine level has stayed with the normal limit.\nSimultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant can be performed successfully with excellent long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Classroom placement of twins is an ongoing issue for educational policy. Many educational jurisdictions have standard policy most commonly founded in the belief that separation supports individual identity, personal development and academic opportunity. This study examined the effects of classroom placement in a sample of 560 twin pairs whose behaviors were assessed from ages 5 to 12 years. We found no detrimental effect of classroom sharing on twins' social development. In contrast, this study provides evidence that educating twins together is associated with modest positive twins' behaviors and social functioning at school. Implications for educational policies are further discussed.",

Cephalothoracopagus is a rare type of conjoined twins, which is a rare monozygotic twinning resulting in imperfect fusion of the head, chest and upper abdomen. These twins have separated limbs and pelvis. The incidence of conjoined twins is 1 per 50,000 to 1 per 200,000 births. The cephalothoracopagus however is very rare variant seen in 1 in 3 million births. In literature approximately 200 cases have been reported till now. The cephalothoracopagus janiceps has two types: disymmetros and asymmetros. We present a case of cephalothoracopagus janiceps disymmetros in a 22-year-old gravida at 19 weeks gestation.",

    "abstract": "Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) play a vital role in the screening process for coeliac disease (CD). Levels above 30\u2009U/ml suggest a possible diagnosis of CD, prompting further investigation, usually by taking a duodenal biopsy. We report an unusual case of 39-year-old male twins, one presenting with iron deficiency anaemia and the other asymptomatic, with anti-tTG antibodies of >4,965.5\u2009U/ml, an extraordinary level. A duodenal biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of CD and following the adoption of a gluten-free diet, anti-tTG levels were found to decrease back to normal levels. This case demonstrates how CD can cause significant biochemical and histological pathology, but present with mild or no symptoms.",

    "abstract": "We explored the genetic and environmental inter-relationships among osteoporosis, fracture, arthritis, and bone mineral density concordance in monozygotic twins compared to those in dizygotic twins. This cross-sectional research assessed data of 1032 monozygotic and 242 dizygotic twin pairs aged >20 years included in the Healthy Twin Study data of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study between 2005 and 2014. Outcomes of interest included illness concordance and absolute differences in dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) T-scores. We found comparable concordances of osteoporosis, fractures, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis between monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Medical histories of osteoporosis, fractures caused by accident or falling, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis were not distinct between monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Accidental fracture occurrence in both monozygotic twins showed significantly lower odds than that in dizygotic twins. Genetic influence on liability to fracture risk might thus be maintained. DEXA T-scores for bone mineral density indicated more comparable tendencies within monozygotic twin pairs than within dizygotic ones, suggesting the relative importance of genetic contribution to bone mineral density. The relative importance of genetic factors in bone mineral density is sustained between monozygotic twins; overt disease expression of osteoporosis, fractures, or arthritis may be affected by environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a monogenic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Genotype\u2212phenotype relationships are complex, with variable penetrance even within the same family. The involvement of other modulating genetic and environmental factors is unknown. We aimed to analyze the HCM in monozygotic twins, carriers of the same founder pathogenic variant MYBPC3 p.G263*. The relationship was verified using the PowerPlex 16 HS System kit. Phenotypic differences and environmental differences (overloading conditions, coexistence and location, lifestyle, sport, and intensity) were analyzed. Three pairs of twins genetically identical for all markers and carriers of MYBPC3 G263* were identified. No environmental differences were identified. One of the 89-year-old twins had symptomatic severe obstructive HCM that required septal ablation, while her twin has remained asymptomatic with mild phenotype >80 years. A 49-year-old twin had a severe phenotype of obstructive HCM and pending myectomy, while his twin had a mild asymptomatic phenotype. In the last pair of twins, one presented a much larger left ventricular hypertrophy than his identical twin. In summary, we present three pairs of HCM twin patients sharing not only the genetic cause of the inherited disease but the entire genetic background. Despite identical genetic information and the absence of other known clinical, environmental, or lifestyle differences, the severity of the HCM phenotype is strikingly different. These unexplained differences should prompt the study of other unknown modulating factors, either epigenetic or environmental.",

    "abstract": "Fetal growth restriction contributes to the excess perinatal mortality and morbidity associated with twin pregnancies. Regular ultrasound monitoring for fetal growth restriction is an essential component of antenatal care of twin gestations. It is accepted that twins have divergent growth trajectories around 28-30 weeks' gestation and are born smaller compared to singletons. Despite this well-established difference in fetal growth, twin pregnancies have been traditionally managed using growth standards developed for singleton pregnancies. Numerous recent studies have demonstrated a strong case supporting the use of twin-specific growth standards, but clinical implementation has been lacking. In this paper, we will review the evidence on factors affecting fetal growth, the rationale for twin-specific reference charts, clinical evidence for their use, and future direction of research. Applying singleton growth standards to twin pregnancies inflates the abnormal growth rate, and recent clinical evidence from several studies suggests that they are too stringent for classification of twins. The association of adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes such as perinatal death, preterm birth, neonatal care unit admission, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and composite neonatal morbidity is stronger when classification is made using twin-specific standards compared to singletons.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to characterize a full-term conjoined twins' cadaver curated by Dr. Jacob Henle sometime between 1844 and 1852 and demonstrate digital distribution of an old and rare medical museum specimen using an extended reality (XR) model workflow.\nThe cadaver (Preparation 296) is in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology at the University of Heidelberg. An XR display workflow comprises image capture, segmentation, and visualization using CT/MR scans derived from the cadaver. Online radiology presentation to medical students focuses on diagnostic characteristics of anatomical systems depicted with XR models.\nDevelopmental defects in Preparation 296 include duplicated supradiaphragmatic structures and abnormal osteological features. Subdiaphragmatically, the gut is continuous on the right, but terminates at the distal esophagus on the left. One large liver occupies the abdomen with one spleen located on the left side. Observations suggest duplication of the primitive streak and separate notochords rostrally. Duplication occurs near the yolk sac and involves midgut formation while secondary midline fusion of the upper extremities and ribs likely results from the proximity of the embryos during development. Medical students access the model with device agnostic software during the curricular topic \"Human Body Plan\" that includes embryology concepts covering mechanisms of twinning.\nThe workflow enables ease-of-access XR visualizations of an old and rare museum specimen. This study also demonstrates digital distribution and utilization of XR models applicable to embryology education.",

    "abstract": "Crack initiation and propagation as well as abrupt occurrence of twinning are challenging fracture problems where the transient phase-field approach is proven to be useful. Early-stage twinning growth and interactions are in focus herein for a magnesium single crystal at the nanometer length-scale. We demonstrate a basic methodology in order to determine the mobility parameter that steers the kinetics of phase-field propagation. The concept is to use already existing molecular dynamics simulations and analytical solutions in order to set the mobility parameter correctly. In this way, we exercise the model for gaining new insights into growth of twin morphologies, temporally-evolving spatial distribution of the shear stress field in the vicinity of the nanotwin, multi-twin, and twin-defect interactions. Overall, this research addresses gaps in our fundamental understanding of twin growth, while providing motivation for future discoveries in twin evolution and their effect on next-generation material performance and design.",

To the best of our knowledge, we describe the first case report with regard to a transgender man with a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy obtained by artificial insemination using donor sperm as a monoparental family, presenting early fetal growth restriction of both twins. The patient is a 35-year-old transgender man who had previously received gender-affirming hormone therapy based on testosterone for five years and had a prior bilateral mastectomy as gender-affirming surgery. Whether assisted reproductive techniques have any influence on obstetrical outcomes among these patients and whether prior long-term intake of gender-affirming hormone therapy has an impact on pregnancy and obstetrical outcomes remain to be elucidated.",
