    "abstract": "The surgical management of conjoined twins has evolved to the point that elective operative separation can safely be performed in the majority. Cross-sectional imaging is invaluable to accurately delineate the site of union and configuration of shared organ systems prior to surgery. The use of three-dimensional modeling also dramatically improves the planning process and assists in intraoperative decision-making. We present a case of pygopagus conjoined twins who underwent successful operative separation at 19 months of age with the aid of such technology.\nA three-dimensional computer animation was created by Medical Modeling LLC (Golden, CO, USA) from representative cross-sectional CT and MR images. The complete animation is available at http//www.medicalmodeling.com/ahmed. A plasticized bony pelvic model, accurate to 1mm, was also created using similar technology.\nThe three-dimensional animation and pelvic model were utilized during both the planning and operative phases of the separation. The shared pelvic soft-tissue anatomy consisted of a conjoined penis with four corporal bodies, and a posteriorly conjoined urethra subtending two separate bladders and outlets. The rectum was conjoined approximately 2 cm proximal to the single anus. A blind-ending hindgut remnant was also documented by the animation. Following operative separation, both twins recovered uneventfully.\nThree-dimensional computer animation technology was extremely accurate intraoperatively and predicted exactly which shared organs would sequentially be encountered as the dissection commenced. It significantly reduced the overall operative time and provided critical intraoperative anatomic information. We recommend that this readily available technology be utilized for any patient requiring extensive reconstructive surgery.",

    "abstract": "The model of monozygotic twins has been repeatedly studied to control the genetic and age-specific effects on HIV disease. Focusing on this natural model, the expression of CD27/CD45RA differentiation markers and the distribution of the Vbeta TCR repertoire was analyzed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In our HIV-discordant monozygotic twins, a significant reduction of naive T cells and a parallel accumulation of effector/memory T cells was induced by HIV infection, as well as a skewing of T cell repertoire evidenced by VbetaTCR analysis. The block of HIV replication by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) restored most of the T cell maturation and selection process, with some exception among CTL differentiation and repertoire. Altogether, the model of HIV-discordant monozygotic twins is a valuable tool showing that HAART is not able to completely restore the CTL profile.",

    "abstract": "Various studies have demonstrated an increased risk for adult diseases in newborns born small-for-gestational-age (SGA). Adiponectin and resistin can be detected in cord blood and are suggested to affect insulin resistance (IR). This might represent a link between metabolic syndrome and SGA birth.\nWe investigated the relationship between the adipocytokines and inter-twin birth weight (BW) difference of 31 monozygotic twins with twin-twin transfusion syndrome; in 14 twin pairs BW difference was >15% (1 SGA twin, 1 appropriate-for-gestational-age, AGA, twin).\nBW and length of all patients were positively related to adiponectin (r = 0.57; p < 0.0001; r = 0.47; p < 0.0001) and to resistin (r = 0.31; p < 0.01; r = 0.35; p < 0.01). In 71% (10/14), the SGA twins showed lower adiponectin concentrations than their AGA co-twins (only 6/14 for resistin). To correct for gestational age we calculated the relationship between the intrapair differences (Delta) of BW and Delta of the hormones. We found Delta BW positively correlated with adiponectin (r = 0.55; p < 0.001) but not with resistin (r = 0.22; p = 0.2). Delta adiponectin was positively correlated with Delta resistin (r = 0.45; p < 0.01).\nThese data demonstrate that adiponectin and resistin levels are associated with BW with only adiponectin levels being reduced in SGA children independently of gestational age. Prenatally different metabolic status between the twins might predispose the SGA twin to develop IR later in life.",

Using a variety of fixed-effects models that exploit variations over time and between siblings and twins, the results indicate that drug use has a significant impact on the propensity to commit crime. We find that the median impact of cocaine use on the propensity to commit various types of crimes is 11 percentage points. The impact of using inhalants or other drugs is an increase in the propensity to commit crime by 7 percentage points, respectively.",

A-P and axial x-rays presented slippage of the left capital femoral epiphysis. Results. Reposition and Kirschner pin fixation were performed in both patients with good clinical outcome. The follow-up period was 4 years. Conclusions. When SCFE occurs in one of a pair of identical twins it is prudent to take the second child under careful observation.",

    "abstract": "All solid bodies emit electromagnetic radiation at temperatures above absolute zero. The radiation spectrum depends, among other factors, on temperature. Thermovision is a method in which an infrared camera is used to record infrared radiation (IR) emitted by human skin. It is widely used in medicine, for instance to diagnose inflammation of the skin, some types of neoplasms, collagenosis, and peripheral vascular disease. The literature, however, lacks reports on the variability in thermal emission by the skin of healthy individuals or twins. Interpretation of the results is based on simply analysing the subject individually or comparing symmetrical body sides. Hence, there is a need to study thermal emission using monozygotic twins as a model.\nAn attempt was made in the present study to determine the variability of thermal phenotypes of faces, backs, and hands in monozygotic twins (MZ), compare thermal emission in MZ and dizygotic twins (DZ), and establish the thermal norm. Using the ThermaCAM SC500 camera, 44 pairs of MZ and 15 pairs of DZ were studied. Descriptive statistics are given as means, standard deviation, and max. and min. values. The following tests were used for statistical analysis: Shapiro-Wilk's, Snedecor's, Brown-Forsythe's, Mann-Whitney's U, and Kruskal-Wallis. Data from the digital image analyser were tested using the cluster analysis methods, especially the k-means method.\nThe following conclusions were drawn: 1. Full genetic identity does not produce a thermal consistency within the range of isotherms tested, whether in relation to their values or distribution. 2. Differences in the thermal image may have their source in ontogenetic development during intra-uterine and postnatal stages and may be related to individual differences in adaptation to the environment. 3. These results are potentially useful to compare physiological states between individuals and to differentiate pathological changes. 4. The results of this study do not allow for any conclusions regarding the thermal norm. However, a basis has been created for further research in larger samples of the population.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the deep roots of closeness that twins share in their youngest age and their effect on their destiny at the adult age. Psychologists believe the bond between twins begins in utero and develops throughout the twins' lives. The four patterns of twinship described show that the twin bond is determined by the quality of parenting that twins receive in their infancy and early childhood. Common problems of adult twins bring about difficulties to adapt in a non-twin world. The nature versus nurture controversy has taken on new life focusing on inter-twin differences and the importance of parent-child interaction as fundamental to the growth and development of personality.",

    "abstract": "To assess the genetic and environmental influences on the somatotype of children and adolescents, and the effects of sex and age.\nThe components of somatotype were calculated by using Heather-Cater method in a total of 376 twin pairs of Han nationality, including 245 monozygotic (MZ) and 131 like-sex dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs aged 6 to 18 years. Model-fitting method by Mx package was performed to evaluate the proportion of variance components and to analyze the effects of sex and age on each component of somatotype using the adjusted data for other two somatotype components. The heritability of each component in different development periods divided by growth spurt was also evaluated.\nThe estimated heritabilities of endomorphic, mesomorphic and ectomorphic components were 0.45, 0.80, 0.44 in boys, 0.82, 0.79 and 0.81 in girls respectively after adjusting age. In boys, the heritability of endomorphic component during late puberty was significantly higher than that during pre-puberty (t = 4.99, P < 0.01) and puberty (t = 6.16, P < 0.01), while the heritability of ectomorphic component during late puberty was significantly lower than that during pre-puberty (t = 3.35, P < 0.01) and puberty (t = 4.12, P < 0.01). In girls, the heritability of endomorphic (t = 2.77, P < 0.01) or mesomorphic (t = 2.08, P < 0.05) component during pre-puberty was significantly higher than that in early puberty.\nThe genetic influence on somatotype of girls should be much more than that of boys, especially on the endomorphic and ectomorphic components. For boys, the mesomorphic component is mainly determined by genetic factors, but the other components are mainly affected by environmental ones. The effects of the development periods on the heritability of somatotype should be paid much attention to.",

The effects of the development periods on the heritability of somatotype should be paid much attention to.",

    "abstract": "The primary purpose was to characterize mean and individual-level patterns of change in physical functional performance over eight years (2 year intervals) in a community dwelling sample of Swedish twins (579 men and women aged 79-96 years at baseline).\nMixed linear models revealed linear rates of decline for handgrip strength (grip) and time to complete five chair stands, and accelerating decline for peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) for both sexes. Significant random effects were found for intercept and time for grip and PEFR tests, indicating differences between participants initially and over time. Individual differences in chair-stand performance were significant for initial status only. Age at baseline was predictive of initial status in grip, PEFR and chair performance (women only), but not rate of change. Measures of body size at baseline were predictive of individual variation in initial grip (height), PEFR (weight in men, height in women), and chair performance (height), but had less consistent associations with changes in test performance over time. In the deceased sub-sample (85% of participants), having been further from death was related to less steep declines in grip, but not PEFR or chair performance. Twins from the same pair were related in initial status (twin level variance ~30-70%), but they were not generally related in rate of change.\nThese results indicate that changes in physical functional performance in an elderly, community-dwelling population vary across individuals in a testand sex-dependent manner. Constitutional variables (age, sex, body size) are predictive of baseline performance, but explain little variance in change over time. Initial status and rate of change in grip strength had the strongest association with proximity from death, indicating that while PEFR and repeated chair stand time are useful tests to assess function, grip strength appears to be a particularly useful biomarker in the oldest-old.",

    "abstract": "The Duke Twins Study of Memory in Aging is an ongoing, longitudinal study of cognitive change and dementia in the population-based National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC) Twin Registry of World War II Male Veterans. The primary goal of this study has been to estimate the overall genetic and environmental contributions to dementia with a specific focus on Alzheimer's disease. An additional goal has been to examine specific genetic and environmental antecedents of cognitive decline and dementia. Since 1989, we have completed 4 waves of data collection. Each wave included a 2-phase telephone cognitive screening protocol, followed by an in-home standardized clinical assessment for those with suspected dementia. For many participants, we have obtained postmortem neuropathological confirmation of the diagnosis of dementia. In addition to data on cognition, we have also collected information on occupational history, medical history, medications and other lifetime experiences that may influence cognitive function in late life. We provide an overview of the study's methodology and describe the focus of recent research.",

Lowest response rates have occurred in studies among afflicted individuals, and in one with an unusual protocol. We have experienced some difficulty in locating original members of the cohort, despite efforts to trace individuals using a variety of sources of information. However, in most analyses, the participating sample of twins does not differ substantially from the underlying sample from the CTP. Future work will focus on improving methods of re-contacting cohort members.",

    "abstract": "The Swedish Young Male Twins Study is a population-based longitudinal twin study founded in 1997 through record-linkages of several national registers. Details on pregnancy and birth were obtained from the Swedish Medical Birth Register and used to identify 3566 male twins (1783 pairs) born in Sweden between 1973 and 1979 and resident in Sweden in 1997. A record-linkage was made between the Medical Birth Register and the Military Service Conscription Register for the years 1991 to 1999, providing information on body weight, height, blood pressure, muscle strength, cognitive ability of these twins at age 18 and 19 years. In 1998, 2002 and 2005 to 2006, the twins were surveyed on their zygosity, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors (such as eating habits, physical activity, smoking habits, use of alcohol etc), height and weight. In 2002, additional information was collected on perceived body shape and size, and eating behavior, according to the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. In 2003, DNA via buccal mucosa was collected from a subset of the twins. Recent research using the Swedish Young Male Twins datasets has explored the relationships between fetal growth, body size and blood pressure in young adulthood, genetic and environmental contributions to eating behavior and physical activity, and relationships between diet and physical activity patterns with longitudinal changes in body mass index and attained waist circumference.",

    "abstract": "In the late 1980s The Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) was established by recruiting young twins and multiples at birth and by approaching adolescent and young adult twins through city councils. The Adult NTR (ANTR) includes twins, their parents, siblings, spouses and their adult offspring. The number of participants in the ANTR who take part in survey and / or laboratory studies is over 22,000 subjects. A special group of participants consists of sisters who are mothers of twins. In the Young NTR (YNTR), data on more than 50,000 young twins have been collected. Currently we are extending the YNTR by including siblings of twins. Participants in YNTR and ANTR have been phenotyped every 2 to 3 years in longitudinal survey studies, since 1986 and 1991 for the YNTR and ANTR, respectively. The resulting large population-based datasets are used for genetic epidemiological studies and also, for example, to advance phenotyping through the development of new syndrome scales based on existing items from other inventories. New research developments further include brain imaging studies in selected and unselected groups, clinical assessment of psychopathology through interviews, and cross-referencing the NTR database to other national databases. A large biobank enterprise is ongoing in the ANTR in which blood and urine samples are collected for genotyping, expression analysis, and metabolomics studies. In this paper we give an update on the YNTR and ANTR phenotyping and on the ongoing ANTR biobank studies.",

A population-based twin registry was constructed by the KTP through the use of official residential records in the Tokyo area, and to date requests to participate in our research have generated 1040 pairs of twins and triplets of age 14 to 30, forming one of the largest twin registries in Asia. Our comprehensive datasets, obtained through questionnaires, performance tests, and physical measurements, cover a wide range of human traits: personality, psychiatry, mental health, sociality, cognition, and physical index. Demographic variables and environment of upbringing are also sought by twins and by some parents. This extensive information allows us to clarify the genetic and environmental overlap across multiple traits as well as specificities unique to single traits. Adding an evolutionary psychology perspective to the behavior genetics framework is currently being attempted in order to develop a grand theory of human genetics.",

    "abstract": "The Osaka University Aged Twin Registry (OUATR) is the largest adult twin registry in Japan. Since its establishment in 1974, the OUATR has conducted a number of studies with particular focus on the environmental contribution to physical-cognitive-mental aging, longevity and aging-dependent diseases in later adulthood. The registry consists of 12,000 pairs of Japanese twins born between 1900 and 1935. Two hundred and fifty pairs of twins have undergone comprehensive medical examination to date. Follow-up questionnaires have been mailed out on a regular basis, for the purpose of checking current vital statuses, health conditions, and so forth. The main objective of this longitudinal twin study is to contribute to the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases and the promotion of successful aging.",

    "abstract": "Our studies of the teeth and faces of Australian twins commenced at the School of Dentistry, The University of Adelaide in the early 1980s. There are now over 900 pairs of twins enrolled in our continuing investigations, together with 1200 relatives. There are 3 main cohorts of participants. The first cohort comprises around 300 pairs of teenage twins for whom various records have been collected, including dental casts, facial photographs, finger and palm prints and information on laterality, including handedness. The second cohort comprises around 300 pairs of twins who have been examined at 3 stages of dental development from approximately 4 years of age to about 14 years: at primary, mixed, and permanent dentition (excluding 3rd molars) stages. The most recent study of tooth emergence and oral health, for which we are currently recruiting twins, will provide a third cohort of around 500 twin pairs aged from around birth to 3 to 4 years of age. Our broad aim in these studies has been to improve our understanding of how genetic and environmental factors contribute to variation in dental and facial features, and to oral health. We have also used our data to investigate aspects of the determination of laterality, particularly the fascinating phenomenon of mirror imaging. We plan to maximize the use of the longitudinal data and DNA we have collected, and continue to collect, by performing genome-wide scans for putative genetic linkage peaks for a range of dental features, and then to test for association between a series of likely candidate genes and our phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Lifestyle and genetic factors dominate the etiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease. We investigated associations between lifestyle factors and gastroesophageal reflux (GER) symptoms, with and without controlling for genetic predisposition.\nIn 1967 and 1973, questionnaires including lifestyle exposures were mailed to twins in the Swedish Twin Registry, and data on GER symptoms were collected by telephone interview during 1998-2002. Two analytic methods were used: external control analysis (4083 twins with GER symptoms and 21,383 controls) and monozygotic co-twin control analysis (869 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for GER symptoms).\nIn the external control analysis, leanness (body mass index [BMI] <20), upper normal weight (BMI 22.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and obese (BMI > or =30) conferred -19%, 25%, 46%, and 59% increased risk of frequent GER symptoms compared with normal weight (BMI 20-22.4), respectively, among women, whereas no such associations were evident among men. When adjusted for genetic and nongenetic familial factors, these estimates were -28%, 44%, 187%, and 277%, respectively, among men. Frequent smoking rendered a 37% increased risk of frequent GER symptoms among women and 53% among men compared with nonsmokers. Physical activity at work was dose dependently associated with increased risk of frequent GER symptoms, and recreational physical activity decreased this risk.\nBMI, tobacco smoking, and physical activity at work appear to be risk factors for frequent GER symptoms, whereas recreational physical activity appears to be beneficial. Association between BMI and frequent GER symptoms among men seems to be attenuated by genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "We carried out two distinct types of genetic analysis with data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The first was a non-DNA twin analysis using monozygotic (identical) and same-sex dizygotic (fraternal) twins. The second analysis investigates the association between age at first sexual intercourse and the 48-bp repeat polymorphism in the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4). The twin analysis shows that MZ twins correlate their timing of first sex to a much greater extent than do the same-sex DZ twins. Our analysis of the polymorphisms in DRD4 indicates that those with an any-3R genotype experienced a risk of first sexual intercourse 23% (p = .016), 233% (p = .0001), 28% (p = .012), and 69% (p = .006) higher than those with an other/other (or any-4R) genotype in the all-ethnicities (n = 2,552), Asian, white, and Hispanic samples, respectively. The risk of first sex does not differ between the two genotypes in the African American sample. These results were obtained after adjusting the standard socioeconomic covariates, including gender, parental education, family structure, and community poverty in the regression model. Evidence from both twin and genetic-variant analyses points to a role of genes in the timing of first sexual intercourse.",

    "abstract": "Parenting anxiety has been highlighted recently because it tends to be a problem of mother-child relationships and a factor in child maltreatment. Compared to mothers of singletons, it is reported that mothers of twins experience a greater physical and mental burden of parenting. This study aims to investigate whether mothers of twins have more parenting anxiety than those of singletons and whether parenting anxiety affects child's mental development in both twin and singleton groups.\n218 mothers of 0 to 2-year-old twins were recruited at seventeen organizations for twin rearing in Kinki area, western Japan, from March to May 2005. Questionnaires were mailed or handed out to the mothers. In all, 124 mothers of twins (56.9%) returned the questionnaires. 5 data sets were excluded because of twins' cerebral paralysis or other reasons and 119 data sets (96.0%) were analyzed. A total of 348 mothers of singletons were collected at four preschools and two public health centers in the same area from March 2005 to March 2006. Questionnaires were mailed or handed out and were returned by 101 mothers (28.1%). 4 data sets were excluded because of the presence of twins or over age children and 97 data sets (96.0%) were analyzed. The core questionnaires included the JCFRI Child Rearing Support Questionnaire for measurement of parenting anxiety and the Tsumori-Inage Infant Developmental Scale.\n1. Compared to their counterparts with singletons, mothers of twins showed significantly higher scores for parenting anxiety, including general confusion of parenting and negative feelings toward their children. 2. On multiple logistic regression analysis, high parenting anxiety in mothers of 2-year-old twins, especially negative feelings were related to delay in the children's mental development. However, there was no significant relationship with twins aged 0 or 1 year and with singletons of 0 to 2 years of age.\nThe results suggest that negative feelings toward children influence mother-child interactions and complicate relationships. Parenting anxiety is a severe problem in mothers of twins not only because it causes mental problems in mothers but also because it has an impact on child mental development.",

    "abstract": "Pygopagus conjoined twins were born by caesarean section at 34 weeks of gestation. Initial evaluation revealed no other abnormalities apart from their attachment at lower back, buttocks and perineum. They had two separate anal and urogenital openings. Their investigations included roentgenograms, ultrasound, barium enema, cystourethrogram, CT scan and MRI. There were two separate spinal columns fused distally at the lower sacral level. Lower gastrointestinal studies showed two separate rectums and cystourethrogram showed normal and separate urinary tracts. MRI showed a single dural sac between two fused sacral bones with no other vertebral anomalies. They were successfully separated with primary skin closure using V-shaped flaps.",

    "abstract": "Blau syndrome is a hereditary granulomatous disease caused by mutations in the CARD15 gene that is diagnosed in children of young age with exanthema/erythema, arthritis/periarthritis and/or uveitis. We report two cases of Blau syndrome in Danish Caucasian monozygotic male twins, exhibiting a heterozygous de novo R334W mutation in codon 334 of CARD15. The patients were initially diagnosed as having sarcoidosis. In both twins, symptoms (exanthema, arthritis/periarthritis) started at 1 year of age, and were followed by uveitis at 7-10 years of age. There was no involvement of the lungs or other organs. An initial course of standard antituberculous treatment had no effect on the symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine and cyclosporine A were also ineffective, and the latter caused impaired renal function. Partial symptomatic relief was obtained with prednisolone and increased benefit was observed in combination with methotrexate. Subsequent introduction of the TNF-alpha inhibitor eternacept did not discernibly benefit the clinical condition, but was associated with recurrent infections. In contrast, a trial of infliximab therapy demonstrated clinical efficacy and eliminated all symptoms, restoring a high quality of life. At follow up at 20 years of age (after 2-5 years of infliximab treatment) the twins had an almost normal physical appearance and a normal psychomotoric development, indicating a favourable short-term prognosis of the disease. Blau syndrome has pathologic, clinical and therapeutic features in common with sarcoidosis, but rarely involves the lungs or other parenchymatous organs. In children, discrimination between early onset sarcoidosis and Blau syndrome should include a CARD15 mutation analysis.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining the maximal number of calves from each cow according to its natural genetic reproduction ability is the main condition of intensification of reproduction and increase of milk production. Twins rate in the black-and-white cattle population in Lithuania is 2.4%. Cows whose mothers have calved twins at least 1 time during reproductive life have twins in 5.6% of all calvings, the others--in 1.9%. Twins rate in separate bulls daughters range from 1% to 6.1%. Twins rate in cows range from 0.4% to 5% by separate bulls-getters. Productivity of 305 days lactation after having twins is better (551.2+/-68.1 kg of milk, 18.4 +/-2.9 kg of fat and 21.5+/-2.4 kg of protein, P < 0.001). The rate of twin births increases when lactation is increased. The influence of lactation on rate of twin births is 0.6% in total dispersion (P < 0.001). The influence of calving season on twins rate is statistically insignificant but the parts of twins by calving seasons are distributed differently.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective review of twin gestations was undertaken to evaluate whether routine cervical lengths (CLs) in such instances change pregnancy outcome. Data were collected from the ultrasound database and chart review. Exclusion criteria included twins reduced to singletons, twins not delivering at our institution, and incomplete information. Twin gestations with a CL were compared with those without a CL. Outcomes of interest included gestational age (GA) at delivery, preterm delivery (PTD), antepartum admissions, antepartum length of stay (LOS), cerclage placement, birthweight, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and neonatal LOS. Two hundred sixty-two patients met inclusion criteria. Of those, 184 had CLs and 78 did not. Comparing the CL to the no-CL group, there were no differences with respect to GA at delivery (34.8 versus 35.3 weeks; p=0.35), antepartum admissions (32.1 versus 23.1%; p=0.16), cerclage placement (7.1 versus 1.3%; p=0.06), or tocolysis use (28.6 versus 21.8%; p=0.26). There was no difference between the two groups with respect to preterm labor (26 versus 19%; p=0.25), PTD < 28 weeks (8.2 versus 3.9%; p=0.21), PTD < 34 weeks (26.1 versus 25.6%; p=0.94), or PTD < 37 weeks (76.1 versus 70.5%; p=0.34). The only significant difference was antepartum LOS (34.5 versus 31.3 days; p< 0.001). There were no differences in neonatal outcomes. Routine CL did not improve perinatal outcome but increased maternal antepartum LOS.",

    "abstract": "Gametic selection during fertilization or the effects of specific genotypes on the viability of embryos may cause a skewed transmission of chromosomes to surviving offspring. A recent analysis of transmission distortion in humans reported significant excess sharing among full siblings. Dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs are a special case of the simultaneous survival of two genotypes, and there have been reports of DZ pairs with excess allele sharing around the HLA locus, a candidate locus for embryo survival. We performed an allele-sharing study of 1,592 DZ twin pairs from two independent Australian cohorts, of which 1,561 pairs were informative for linkage on chromosome 6. We also analyzed allele sharing in 336 DZ twin pairs from The Netherlands. We found no evidence of excess allele sharing, either at the HLA locus or in the rest of the genome. In contrast, we found evidence of a small but significant (P=.003 for the Australian sample) genomewide deficit in the proportion of two alleles shared identical by descent among DZ twin pairs. We reconciled conflicting evidence in the literature for excess genomewide allele sharing by performing a simulation study that shows how undetected genotyping errors can lead to an apparent deficit or excess of allele sharing among sibling pairs, dependent on whether parental genotypes are known. Our results imply that gene-mapping studies based on affected sibling pairs that include DZ pairs will not suffer from false-positive results due to loci involved in embryo survival.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we examined the contamination levels of organochlorines and the patterns of gene expressions using umbilical cords of twins. The contamination levels of total PCBs, HCB and HCHs of intra-pair of twins were close to each other, but that of DDTs were not so as the others. It shows that the placental or fetal factor may influence the transfer or the accumulation of DDTs. The patterns of gene expressions of intra-pair of twins were similar to each other. It may because the environmental factor (sharing same mother), genetic factor or the both of twins are similar. This study gave us some information to understand the fetal exposure to organochlorines. Moreover, it showed the possibility that the pattern of gene expression in umbilical cord reflected the intra-uterine environment. However, the information from general pattern of the gene expression is limited. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to find new markers not only mRNA but also protein to estimate the effects of fetal exposure of multiple organochlorines.",

    "abstract": "Depression is associated with smoking, but the causality of the relationship is debated. The authors examine smoking behaviour as a predictor of depression among the Finnish adult twin population.\nBased on responses to surveys in 1975 and 1981, the authors characterized the subjects as never smokers, persistent former smokers, quitters, recurrent smokers and persistent smokers. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was applied in 1990 to measure depression (BDI score >9). Although the population consisted of twins, the authors first considered the subjects as individuals. Logistic regression models were computed for 4164 men and 4934 women. In order to control for family and genetic background, conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted among twin pairs discordant for depression. Bivariate genetic modelling was used to examine genetic and environmental components of the correlation between smoking and depression.\nAmong the men, persistent smoking (OR 1 x 42, 95% CI 1 x 07-1 x 89) and smoking in 1975 but quitting by 1981 (OR 1 x 68, 95% CI 1 x 17-2 x 42) was associated with a higher risk of depression, while among the women only the quitters had an elevated risk (OR 1 x 38, 96% CI 1 x 01-1 x 87). The gender x smoking interaction showed persistent smoking to be a stronger risk for men. When family and genetic background were controlled, smoking remained a predictor of depression. Genetic modelling among the men suggested a modest correlation (rg=0 x 25) between genetic components of smoking and depression.\nSmoking behaviour may be a gender-sensitive predictor of depression, the stronger association in men being partly accounted for by having underlying genes in common.",

    "abstract": "Previous work using quantified EEG has suggested that brain activity in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and normal persons differs. Our objective was to investigate if specific frequency band-pass regions and spatial locations are associated with CFS using low-resolution electromagnetic brain tomography (LORETA).\nWe conducted a co-twin control study of 17 pairs of monozygotic twins where 1 twin met criteria for CFS and the co-twin was healthy. Twins underwent an extensive battery of tests including a structured psychiatric interview and a quantified EEG. Eyes closed EEG frequency-domain analysis was computed and the entire brain volume was compared of the CFS and healthy twins using a multiple comparison procedure.\nCompared with their healthy co-twins, twins with CFS differed in current source density. The CFS twins had higher delta in the left uncus and parahippocampal gyrus and higher theta in the cingulate gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus.\nThese findings suggest that neurophysiological activity in specific areas of the brain may differentiate individuals with CFS from those in good health. The study corroborates that slowing of the deeper structures of the limbic system is associated with affect. It also supports the neurobiological model that the right forebrain is associated with sympathetic activity and the left forebrain with the effective management of energy. These preliminary findings await replication.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the relationship between the principle of double effect and justification for separation surgeries for conjoined twins. First, the principle of double effect is examined in light of its historical context. It is argued that it can only operate under an absolutist view of good and evil that is compatible with the Bible. Given this foundation for application, scenarios for separating conjoined twins are considered against the criteria for the principle of double effect. It is concluded that the principle of double effect cannot be applied to cases wherein one of the twins must be killed. However, it is noted that this does not leave decision makers without options.",

An autopsy revealed that the right coronary artery arose from the aorta in the left sinus of Valsalva. In order to determine whether the same anomaly was inherent in his brother--an identical twin--a complete cardiac medical examination was conducted. Multi-detector-row computed tomography (MDCT) coronary angiography showed no anomaly at the sinus of Valsalva, which indicates that the anomaly, in this case, was not hereditary. This case exemplifies instances where forensic medicine may intervene to prevent sudden deaths in surviving family members.",

We report a premature infant, the first-born twin, with the syndrome. The omphalocoele was large, and heart abnormalities included dextrocardia with atrial septal defect. The co-twin is normal.",

    "abstract": "Current biological psychiatric models assume that genetic and environmental risk factors for anxiety and depression act on the same brain structures.\nTo test this assumption, we assessed brain anatomy by using optimized voxel-based morphometry on magnetic resonance images obtained in monozygotic twin pairs who were discordant for the risk of anxiety and depression (n = 10 pairs) and in monozygotic twin pairs who were concordant for high (n = 7 pairs) or low (n = 15 pairs) risk for anxiety and depression.\nWe observed volume reductions in the temporal lobe, most notably in the left posterior hippocampal region in subjects at high risk for anxiety and depression, but exclusively in the intrapair comparison of discordant monozygotic twins. Because monozygotic twins are genetically identical, any discordance in their risk for anxiety and depression and hippocampal volume must arise from differential exposure to environmental influences. A group comparison between pairs concordant for low or high risk, which is more likely to reflect differences in genetic vulnerability, did not show reduced temporal-lobe and posterior hippocampal volumes in the pairs at high risk for anxiety and depression.\nThis pattern of results suggests that damage to temporal-lobe structures may be specific to an environmentally driven etiology of anxiety and depression.",

    "abstract": "The differences between right (RH) and left (LH) handers reported in the literature on fine motor tasks, has traditionally been interpreted relative to purported functioning of the cerebral hemispheres. However, conclusive evidence for performance differences which are intrinsic to handedness per se is difficult to obtain unless left and right handers are compared who are similar in their genetic and environmental background. The present study therefore, employed a monozygotic (MZ) twin design which minimizes differences in genetic variation between the two groups. Forty female monozygotic twins (20 pairs) were selected on the basis of discordance of writing hand. Their laterality preferences were assessed and they were tested for differences on hand performance tasks (dot filling, finger tapping, and peg moving). The results revealed that on the hand and foot preference inventories, the right-handers were more strongly lateralized than their left-handed sisters, and that the left-handers had greater variation in their laterality scores. There were substantial correlations between preference and performance scores. The analyses not only revealed the obvious strong main effects of writing hand on performance tasks, but interaction effects of handedness on the peg-moving task. The dot filling task differentiated the writing versus non-writing hand considerably better than either of the other two performance tasks. However, no evidence was found to indicate that twins who wrote with their left hands showed poorer performance than their right-handed twin sisters.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have examined the effect of in utero exposure to smoking and fecundity among the offspring but the findings are contradictory. We therefore studied the waiting time to first pregnancy (TTP) and exposure to smoking in utero and childhood among Danish twins born between 1931 and 1952. Information about TTP, exposure to mothers smoking in pregnancy, exposure to smoking in childhood and current smoking among the male twins and smoking in their own pregnancy among female twins was collected by interview. Fecundability odds ratio (FOR) estimating the odds of conception in a cycle among exposed compared to the unexposed were calculated separately for female and male twins. A total of 1653 female and 1598 male twins reported a TTP. Female twins, exposed in utero, had reduced fecundability after control for confounders (FOR = 0.81; 95% CI 0.67-0.99). A nonsignificant increase in fecundity among male twins exposed to smoking in utero was found (FOR = 1.12; 95% CI 0.89-1.40). Among dizygotic twins of opposite sex sharing the same in utero exposures, the future fecundity of the male twin was unaffected by in utero exposure (FOR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.60-1.55) whereas the female twin had reduced fecundity (FOR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.47-0.91). This study supports that smoking is hazardous to the female fetus not only in the short term but also affects her future ability to conceive and makes it even more important to advise pregnant women to stop smoking.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the presence of imprinted facial lines in identical twin sisters, one of whom had received botulinum toxin type A (Botox) treatment in the forehead and glabellar region regularly for 13 years and one of whom had not. Crow's feet were also compared.\nOne twin received Botox in the forehead and glabellar region (approximately 2 to 3 times each year over the past 13 years) and in the crow's feet (twice in past 2 years). Her twin received Botox only twice (in the forehead and glabellar region, 3 and 7 years ago).\nImprinted forehead and glabellar lines were not evident in the regularly treated twin but were evident in the minimally treated twin. Crow's feet were less noticeable when the regularly treated twin smiled (even at 7 months after treatment) than when the minimally treated twin smiled. Untreated facial areas (eg, nasolabial folds) showed comparable aging in both twins. Neither twin experienced adverse effects.\nLong-term treatment with Botox can prevent the development of imprinted facial lines that are visible at rest. Botox treatment can also reduce crow's feet. Treatment is well tolerated, with no adverse events reported during 13 years of regular treatment in this study.",

    "abstract": "Autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells directed against CNS autoantigens may play a role in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). Identical twins share the same genetic background but not the TCR repertoire that is shaped by the encounter with self or foreign antigens. To gain insights into the interplay between MS and T cell repertoire, peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and their CCR7+/CCR7- subsets from five pairs of identical twins (four discordant and one concordant for MS; none of which had taken disease-modifying therapy) were compared by TCR beta-chain (TCRB) complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3) spectratyping. CD4+ T cells generally showed a Gaussian distribution, whereas CD8+ T cells exhibited subject-specific, widely skewed TCR spectratypes. There was no correlation between CD8+ T cell oligoclonality and disease. Sequencing of predominant spectratype expansions revealed shared TCRB-CDR3 motifs when comparing inter- and/or intrapair twin members. In many cases, these sequences were homologous to published TCRs, specific for viruses implicated in MS pathogenesis, CNS autoantigens, or copaxone [glatiramer acetate (GA)], implying the occurrence of naturally GA-responding CD8+ T cells. It is notable that these expanded T cell clones with putative pathogenic or regulatory properties were present in the affected as well as in the healthy subject, thus suggesting the existence of a \"MS predisposing trait\" shared by co-twins discordant for MS.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of cross-gender behavior during childhood, to estimate the influence of genotype and environment on variation in cross-gender behavior, and to explore the association of cross-gender behavior with maternal ratings of behavior problems as indexed by the Internalizing and Externalizing scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Cross-gender behavior was assessed by two items from the CBCL: \"behaves like opposite sex\" and \"wishes to be of opposite sex.\" As part of an ongoing longitudinal study of the Netherlands Twin Registry, mothers were asked to complete the CBCL for their twins when they were 7 (n approximately 14,000 twins) and 10 years old (n approximately 8,500 twins). The prevalence of cross-gender behavior (as measured by maternal report of behaving like or wishing to be the opposite sex) was 3.2% and 5.2% for 7-year-old boys and girls, respectively, and decreased to 2.4% and 3.3% for 10-year-old boys and girls. Surprisingly, the prevalence rate of cross-gender behavior of girls with a male co-twin was lower than of girls with a female co-twin. At both ages, the similarity for cross-gender behavior was greater in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins pairs. Genetic structural equation modeling showed that 70% of the variance in the liability of cross-gender behavior could be explained by genetic factors, at both ages and for both sexes. Cross-gender behavior was associated with higher scores on Internalizing and Externalizing problems, both in boys and in girls.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic male twins, carrying the same number of trinucleotide repeats in the IT 15 Huntington disease (HD) gene, showed a different clinical course. Patient 1 presented with anxiety and chorea at the age of 40. Patient 2 showed persecution paranoia and motor impersistence at the age of 42. Both patients were monitored for 30 months using currently recommended motor and behaviour scales. No differences were observed in motor scoring besides small interevaluation fluctuations. However, on the cognitive and behaviour scales, patient 1 showed a significant worsening when compared with patient 2. Our cases support the belief that the motor symptoms and signs in HD are highly dependent on the trinucleotide expansion. However, the differences in the evolution of mental status in our patients suggest that other still unknown environmental factors are important in the phenotypic expression of Huntington's disease.",

    "abstract": "Combinations of molecular tags visible in light and electron microscopes become particularly advantageous in the analysis of dynamic cellular components like the Golgi apparatus. This organelle disassembles at the onset of mitosis and, after a sequence of poorly understood events, reassembles after cytokinesis. The precise location of Golgi membranes and resident proteins during mitosis remains unclear, partly due to limitations of molecular markers and the resolution of light microscopy. We generated a fusion consisting of the first 117 residues of alpha-mannosidase II tagged with a fluorescent protein and a tetracysteine motif. The mannosidase component guarantees docking into the Golgi membrane, with the tags exposed in the lumen. The fluorescent protein is optically visible without further treatment, whereas the tetracysteine tag can be reduced acutely with a membrane-permeant phosphine, labeled with ReAsH, monitored in the light microscope, and used to trigger the photoconversion of diaminobenzidine, allowing 4D optical recording on live cells and correlated ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy. These methods reveal that Golgi reassembly is preceded by the formation of four colinear clusters at telophase, two per daughter cell. Within each daughter, the smaller cluster near the midbody gradually migrates to rejoin the major cluster on the far side of the nucleus and asymmetrically reconstitutes a single Golgi apparatus, first in one daughter cell and then in the other. Our studies provide previously undescribed insights into Golgi disassociation and reassembly during mitosis and offer a powerful approach to follow recombinant protein distribution in 4D imaging and correlated high-resolution analysis.",

    "abstract": "Studies investigating the association between cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive decline report discrepant outcomes. The co-twin control method improves on traditional case-control approaches by controlling for within-twin pair similarities of genetic and early environmental influences.\nTo examine the association of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and elevated body mass index (BMI) (>30 kg/m(2)), individually and combined, with cognitive decline over a 12-year period in members of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council Twin Registry of World War II male veterans.\nModified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m) was administered four times at approximately 4-year intervals from 1990 to 2002 as part of an epidemiologic study of dementia. Self-report medical information was collected from 1996 to 2002. We examined the difference in cognitive decline within twin pairs discordant for the vascular risk factors while controlling for baseline TICS-m, education, smoking, and alcohol history.\nAmong twin pairs discordant for diabetes (n = 177), the diabetic twins declined an average of almost 1 point more than their nondiabetic co-twins (p = 0.018) at the last screening time point. Further analyses showed that this was in large part due to greater decline among older men (age 76 to 84 years). Cognitive change was not significantly different between members of pairs discordant for hypertension (n = 326), hypercholesterolemia (n = 282), or elevated BMI (n = 166).\nBased on this study of twin pairs who share similar genetic and early environmental risks for cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes is associated with greater cognitive decline, particularly among the oldest individuals.",

    "abstract": "Several functional neuroimaging studies have implicated the cerebellar vermis in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but there have been no structural neuroimaging studies of this brain structure in PTSD. We utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with manual tracing to quantify the volumes of three divisions of the mid-sagittal vermis, and their total, within an identical, co-twin control design that employed Vietnam veterans discordant for combat exposure in Vietnam. Each structure's volume was significantly correlated between twins, indicating a partial familial determination: for anterior superior vermis, r=0.73; for posterior superior vermis, r=0.47; for inferior posterior vermis, r=0.51; and for total vermis, r=0.57. There were no significant differences between the PTSD and non-PTSD veterans for any vermis volume, and no significant main effects or interactions when their non-combat-exposed co-twins were added to the analyses. Thus, the results do not support the structural abnormality of cerebellar vermis in combat-related PTSD.",

In order to clarify what neuroticism actually represents, we investigated the genetic association between neuroticism and cardiovascular measures.\nIn 125 female twin pairs (18-30 years), electrocardiogram and continuous finger blood pressure were assessed during two rest and two mental stress conditions. Mean values for baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate variability (HRV) and inter-beat interval (IBI) were calculated for each condition. Neuroticism was assessed by multiple questionnaires. Multivariate genetic model-fitting analyses were used to investigate the genetic correlation between latent neuroticism and the cardiovascular autonomic nervous system (ANS) measures.\nNeuroticism was negatively correlated to BRS and HRV. Neuroticism was not correlated to IBI. For BRS, this phenotypical relation was entirely determined by shared genetic influences. For HRV, the genetic contribution to the phenotypical correlation was not significant, but the proportions of explained covariance showed a trend of more genetic than environmental influences on the phenotypical relationship.\nHigh neuroticism is associated with a deregulated ANS. Pleiotropic genetic effects may be partly responsible for this effect.",

    "abstract": "Atopic traits often co-occur and this can potentially be caused by common aetiological relationships between traits, i.e. a common genetic or a common environmental background.\nTo estimate to what extent the same genetic and environmental factors influence wheeze, rhinitis, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR), and positive skin prick test (posSPT) in a sample of adult twins.\nWithin a sampling frame of 21,162 twin subjects, 20-49 years of age, from the Danish Twin Registry, a total of 575 subjects (256 intact pairs and 63 single twins), who either themselves and/or their co-twins reported a history of asthma at a nationwide questionnaire survey, were clinically examined. Symptoms of wheeze and rhinitis were obtained by interview; airway responsiveness and skin test reactivity were measured using standard techniques. Correlations in liability between the different traits were estimated and latent factor models of genetic and environmental effects were fitted to the observed data using maximum likelihood methods.\nThe various phenotypic correlations between wheeze, rhinitis, AHR and posSPT were all significant and ranged between 0.50 and 0.86. Traits that showed highest genetic correlations were wheeze-rhinitis (rho(A)=0.95), wheeze-AHR (rho(A)=0.85) and rhinitis-posSPT (rho(A)=0.92), whereas lower genetic correlations were observed for rhinitis-AHR (rho(A)=0.43) and AHR-posSPT (rho(A)=0.59).

The estimates were corrected for ascertainment and adjusted for age, sex, inhaled corticosteroids and smoking.\nDifferent atopic conditions share, to a large extent, a common genetic background. In particular, upper and lower respiratory symptoms seem to be different phenotypic expressions of a common set of genes. These results add new insight into the origins of clinical heterogeneity within atopy and should stimulate the search for pleiotropic genes of importance for these conditions.",

This illustrates the importance of an occupational history even in the molecular genetic era.",

    "abstract": "Elevated levels of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and airway hyperresponsiveness are intermediate phenotypes of asthma. Using population-based data collected from a sample of twins, the present authors estimated the relative contribution of genes, family environment and nonshared environmental influences to variations in eNO and airway responsiveness (AR). In addition, the genetic and environmental sources of covariation between these two asthma-related phenotypes were investigated. The study population comprised a random sample of 377 adult twins identified through the Norwegian Twin Registry. The main outcome variables were eNO and AR to methacholine. Genetic effects accounted for 60% of the variation in eNO. Family environment accounted for 30% of the variation in AR, while nonshared environmental influences explained the remaining variation for both measures. For both eNO and AR, there were significant regression effects for atopy and smoking. The small, but significant association between eNO and AR was primarily explained by genetic factors. Sub-analyses restricted to atopic and nonsmoking twins strengthened the observation. In conclusion, variations in exhaled nitric oxide and airway responsiveness appear to be explained by different genetic and environmental variance structures. Variation in exhaled nitric oxide is explained by genetic and nonshared environmental effects, whereas an environmental model best explains the variation in airway responsiveness. Common genetic effects explain the small but significant association between exhaled nitric oxide and airway responsiveness.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins represent a rare but fascinating congenital condition, the aetiology of which remains obscure. Over the past four decades, the paediatric surgeons at Red Cross Children's Hospital have been involved in the management of 46 pairs of conjoined twins, of which 33 have been symmetrical and 12 asymmetrical. Seventeen symmetrical twins have undergone separation with 22 children (65%) surviving; all of the live asymmetrical twins survived separation. We describe the important features of this unique cohort, outline our approach to management and present the results of this approach. We consider some of the ethical and moral dilemmas we have confronted, and discuss the prenatal diagnosis, obstetric implications and postnatal care of these children, including the relevant investigations and anaesthetic and surgical management. Specific aspects related to the cardiovascular system, hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal tracts, urogenital tract, central nervous system and musculoskeletal system are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "The use of cannabis and other illicit drugs (OIDs) and their co-morbid misuse are frequently reported in the literature. Correlated vulnerabilities and causal or gateway influences have been implicated in this association. We investigated the source of this co-morbidity between cannabis use (experimentation, early and repeated use, and problems) and OID experimentation and problems using genetic models proposed by Neale and Kendler (American Journal of Human Genetics 1995, 57, 935-953).\nIn a sample of 4152 same-sex male and female adult Australian twin individuals, we fit 13 genetically informative models of co-morbidity to data on experimentation, early use, repeated use of cannabis and co-morbid OID experimentation, and to abuse/dependence (A/D) problems with cannabis and OIDs.\nModel-fitting results suggest that common genetic, shared and unique environmental factors are responsible for the association between cannabis experimentation, early use, repeated use and A/D problems and OID experimentation or problems. The liability causation model, which is a reduced form of the correlated vulnerabilities model, also fit very well. In women, we found evidence for high-risk cannabis experimenters and repeated users to be at increased risk for OID experimentation, despite being below the risk threshold on the liability distribution for OID experimentation (extreme multiformity).\nCo-morbid cannabis and OID use and misuse are due partly to a common predisposition to substance use disorders. Putative causal effects could not be ruled out. These models warrant further research, so that features of the correlated vulnerabilities model and the gateway models can be studied jointly in a single series of adaptive nested models.",

    "abstract": "Flow-cytometric sorting of mammalian sperm for production of offspring with the desired sex is one of the most important new biotechnologies available for livestock industry. The objectives of this study were: (i) to sort the sperm into X- and Y-enriched populations and (ii) use the sorted sperm for in vitro fertilization (IVF) to produce sex-preselected embryo and offspring. The results revealed that the accuracy of sorted X- and Y-sperm was 94% and 89%, respectively. There was a decrease in blastocyst development rate in IVF with sorted sperm comparing to unsorted sperm, but the percentage of blastocysts on D6-D8 was not statistically different. Transplantation of the presumed X-embryos derived from IVF into a recipient resulted in the birth of female twins. These results indicated the feasibility of sperm sorting by flow cytometry and in vitro production of sex-preselected embryos and offspring in buffalo.",

    "abstract": "Supine weight-bearing exercise within lower body negative pressure (LBNP) alleviates some of the skeletal deconditioning induced by simulated weightlessness in men. We examined this potential beneficial effect in women. Because dietary acid load affected the degree of bone resorption in men during bed rest, we also investigated this variable in women. Subjects were 7 pairs of female identical twins assigned at random to 2 groups, sedentary bed rest (control) or bed rest with supine treadmill exercise within LBNP. Dietary intake was controlled and monitored. Urinary calcium and markers of bone resorption were measured before bed rest and on bed rest days 5/6, 12/13, 19/20, and 26/27. Bone mineral content was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before and after bed rest. Data were analyzed by repeated-measures two-way analysis of variance. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to define the relationships between diet and markers of bone metabolism and to estimate heritability of markers. During bed rest, all markers of bone resorption and urinary calcium and phosphorus increased (P<0.001); parathyroid hormone (P=0.06), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P=0.06), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (P=0.09) tended to decrease. LBNP exercise tended to mitigate bone density loss. The ratio of dietary animal protein to potassium was positively correlated with urinary calcium excretion for all weeks of bed rest in the control group, but only during weeks 1 and 3 in the exercise group. Pre-bed rest data suggested that many markers of bone metabolism have strong genetic determinants. Treadmill exercise within LBNP had less of a protective effect on bone resorption during bed rest in women than previously published results had shown for its effect in men, but the same trends were observed for both sexes. Dietary acid load of these female subjects was significantly correlated with calcium excretion but not with other bone resorption markers.",

    "abstract": "This case report describes Blau syndrome in monozygotic twins. The disease ran an identical course in both patients, starting with a maculopapulous exanthema at one year of age. Skin biopsies showed epithelioid cell granulomas with multinucleated giant cells. Shortly after arthritis and periarticular swelling developed and uveitis appeared at 8 years of age. Treatment consisted of prednisolone and methotrexate, and from 18 years of age of infliximab, with good effect. DNA analysis showed de novo R334W mutation in the CARD15 gene. The patients have now been followed for 19 years and are in good clinical condition.",

    "abstract": "In an effort to investigate the molecular basis of growth discordance in embryos that experience the same uterine environment, we compared telomerase activity and apoptosis in placental trophoblasts obtained from growth discordant twins. Between January 2003 and February 2005, placental tissue from twenty pairs of twins was obtained within thirty minutes of delivery. Eleven cases were classified as growth discordant, with birth weight discordance greater than 20%. Nine cases comprised the control group, with less than 20% discordance. Telomerase and apoptotic activities in placental trophoblasts were analyzed by ELISA and immunoblot. Statistical significance was analyzed by a paired t-test, chi- squared test, and ANOVA (SPSS ver 11.0). The average growth discordance was 26.8% in the growth discordant group and 14.4% in the control group. There were no significant differences in maternal age, week of gestation at delivery, parity, or chorionisity between the two groups. In the growth discordant group, the larger twin showed significantly higher telomerase activity (p < 0.01), whereas no significant difference was observed in the control group (p = 0.36). In addition, there was no definitive correlation between telomerase activity and the degree of growth discordance in the larger or smaller twins (R = -0.521 and -0.399, p = 0.15 and 0.25, respectively). The apoptosis proteins Bax and Bcl 2 were detected in both the larger and smaller twins in the growth discordant and control groups. There was no statistically significant difference in Bax expression between the larger and smaller twins (p = 0.25 and 0.92, respectively) for either the growth discordant or the control groups. Bcl 2 expression also showed no significant difference between groups. In conclusion, a tendency toward reduced telomerase activity and increased apoptosis was discovered in placental trophoblasts of the smaller growth- discordant twin, possibility resulting in delayed fetal growh.",

    "abstract": "Premature ovarian failure (POF) before 40 years of age from natural causes affects approximately 1% of adult women, with minor variations between ethnic groups. A recent case of ovarian transplantation between young monozygotic (MZ) twins in which one had undergone unexplained POF at 14 years has prompted a study of the prevalence of POF.\nMenopausal ages of 832 Australian and UK female twin-pairs were extracted from volunteer national twin registry databases containing medical, reproductive and lifestyle data surveyed by mail questionnaire. Surgical menopause was an exclusion criterion.\nThe prevalence of POF in both MZ and dizygotic (DZ) twins was similar in both registries and 3- to 5-fold greater than the general population at age thresholds 40 and 45 years. No specific factors were found to account for the higher risk of early menopause. Some twins of both zygosities were highly discordant for menopausal age (>or=10 years). Nevertheless, there was significant intra-twin dependence, especially for MZ twins, and the average age difference at last menses was greater in DZ twin-pairs.\nBoth MZ and DZ twins are at higher risk of POF. Despite some striking differences within MZ twin-pairs, menopausal ages were more concordant than for DZ twin-pairs, confirming that the timing of menopause has a heritable component.",

Based on factor analysis, occupational characteristics were interpreted as reflecting general intellectual demands (GI), human interaction and communication (HC), physical exertion (PE), and visual attention (VA).\nBased on regression analysis of TICS-m change that was dependent on twin pairing and additionally covarying for education, age at each testing event, medical conditions, and initial TICS-m score, higher GI was associated with a modest longitudinal improvement in TICS-m performance, whereas higher PE and VA were both associated with a modest decline. Subsequent analysis revealed that these significant effects were present among dizygotic twins, but not among monozygotic twins.\nPrevious findings of a relationship between occupational characteristics and cognitive performance in later life may be partially explained by genetic factors; however, until these genes are identified, occupational characteristics may be useful markers.",

    "abstract": "Exposure of the fetus to indomethacin by administration of the drug to the mother may cause many side effects, including premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Hypoxia is a predisposing factor for premature ductal closure and often occurs after maternal indomethacin therapy. We present two sets of monozygotic twins with twin-to-twin transfusion, where in utero ductal closure occurred in the donor twin while the recipient twin appeared unaffected. This selective closure of the ductus arteriosus suggests that the affected twin was predisposed to hypoxia and thus was more susceptible to ductal closure in response to indomethacin exposure.",

    "abstract": "Exercise is considered to be beneficial for free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism, although reports of the effects of increased physical activity on FFA uptake and oxidation in different tissues in vivo in humans have been inconsistent. To investigate the heredity-independent effects of physical activity and fitness on FFA uptake in skeletal muscle, the myocardium, and liver we used positron emission tomography (PET) in nine healthy young male monozygotic twin pairs discordant for physical activity and fitness. The cotwins with higher physical activity constituting the more active group had a similar body mass index but less body fat and 18 +/- 10% higher (P < 0.001) compared to the less active brothers with lower physical activity. Low-intensity knee-extension exercise increased skeletal muscle FFA and oxygen uptake six to 10 times compared to resting values but no differences were observed between the groups at rest or during exercise. At rest the more active group had lower hepatic FFA uptake compared to the less active group (5.5 +/- 4.3 versus 9.0 +/- 6.1 micromol (100 ml)(-1) min(-1), P = 0.04). Hepatic FFA uptake associated significantly with body fat percentage (P = 0.05). Myocardial FFA uptake was similar between the groups. In conclusion, in the absence of the confounding effects of genetic factors, moderately increased physical activity and aerobic fitness decrease body adiposity even in normal-weighted healthy young adult men. Further, increased physical activity together with decreased intra-abdominal adiposity seems to decrease hepatic FFA uptake but has no effects on skeletal muscle or myocardial FFA uptake.",

    "abstract": "Depressive personality disorder (DPD) was introduced in DSM-IV as a new category requiring further study. The aim of this study was to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to DPD in a population-based twin sample, and include data on criteria performance, prevalence and diagnostic overlap.\nAxis I and Axis II diagnoses were obtained by structured interviews in a population-based sample of 2794 young adult twins. Statistical analyses included correlation and factor analysis based on polychoric correlation coefficients, and diagnostic overlap applying adjusted odds ratios. Contributions from additive genetic and common and unique environmental influences to the liability to DPD were computed using structural equation modelling, applying a multiple threshold variable.\nLiability to DPD could best be explained by additive genetic and unique environmental factors, with heritability estimates of 49% (95% CI 0.41-0.57) in females and 25% (95% CI 0.12-0.40) in males. The best-fitting model indicated that some of the genes contributing to DPD differ between men and women. Chronbach's alpha was 0.87. 2.0% of participants fulfilled the criteria for DPD, and overlap was most pronounced for dysthymic disorder and avoidant personality disorder.\nLow prevalence rates and subsequent inclusion of subthreshold criteria could have influenced parameter estimates, especially in males.\nDPD was almost twice as heritable in females as in males, comparable to previous studies on major depression. The proposed criteria showed good measurement properties, and DPD was not completely subsumed within any other disorder.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of the prevalence of tooth grinding in children range considerably, reflecting different methods of recording. The main aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of tooth grinding in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs by assessing wear faceting on the primary canines, and to compare the faceting on the right and left to determine whether children have a side preference for grinding.\nThe sample consisted of 116 MZ twin pairs and 124 dizygous DZ twin pairs, all participants in an ongoing study of dento-facial development at the dental schools in Adelaide and Melbourne. Evidence of wear faceting on primary maxillary and mandibular canine tips was recorded from dental casts, and the side with the larger wear facet recorded. Types of occlusal relationship, handedness, zygosity and gender were also recorded, and associations between variables analysed statistically.\nCanine tip wear facets were found in 100 per cent of the sample, and grinding was lateralized in 59 per cent of children. MZ twin pairs showed a higher discordance for grinding side preference than DZ twin pairs (33.8 per cent compared with 16.8 per cent), providing evidence of a mirror-imaging effect for grinding side preference. There was no strong evidence that individuals had the same preference for grinding side and handedness, although right-handers (RH) showed a preference for a grinding side more often than non-right-handers (NRH) (63.6 per cent compared with 51.2 per cent), consistent with previous findings that RHs display more cerebral lateralization than NRHs.\nTooth grinding appears to be a universal phenomenon in children and is commonly expressed more on one side than the other. The significantly higher discordance for grinding side preference in MZ twin pairs compared with DZ twin pairs may reflect a mirror-imaging effect in the former. However, at present we have no evidence to suggest that handedness and preferred tooth grinding side are associated.",

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that the bone metabolism of a growth-restricted foetus is regulated by genetic, placental and/or foetal factors through leptin, we investigated the foetal bone turnover in monochorionic pregnancies complicated with or without twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).\nMaternal and cord bloods were collected from gestational-age-matched monochorionic twins with (n=15) and without (n=15) TTTS. The samples were assayed for leptin, cross-linked carboxyl terminal telo-peptide (ICTP, a marker of bone resorption) and pro-peptide (PICP, a marker of bone formation) of type I collagen by radioimmunoassay (RIA).\nIn the growth-restricted donor twin, the plasma concentration of leptin (P < 0.001), PICP (P < 0.001) was lower, while that of ICTP (P < 0.001) was higher than the recipient twin of the TTTS group. In contrast, leptin, PICP and ICTP were comparable in non-TTTS twins. In the recipient twin of TTTS and non-TTTS twins, leptin was positively associated with PICP (r=0.73; n=45, P < 0.001) and negatively with ICTP (r=-0.68; n=45; P < 0.001). No such association was found between leptin and bone marker in the growth-restricted donor twin of the TTTS group.\nOur data suggest that, in AGA twins, leptin maintains bone metabolism by inhibiting resorption and enhancing bone formation. In contrast, growth-restricted donor twins have high bone turnover and this does not seem to be due to leptin deficiency.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare maternal and neonatal outcome of twin births according to mode of delivery and to isolate the factors predicting a successful vaginal delivery and those predicting a failed trial of labor (TOL) leading to an emergent cesarean section. We reviewed all twin deliveries during the years 1995 to 2004. Parameters studied include maternal age, parity, gestational age, maternal antepartum complications and postpartum complications, fetal presentations, birthweight, mode of delivery of each twin, Apgar scores and cord pH. During the study period there were 40,710 deliveries of which 804 (1.9%) were twin deliveries. Of the 804 twins, 398 (49.5%) had planned cesarean sections (PCS) and 406 (50.5%) entered a TOL. Maternal age and parity were similar among the groups. Neonatal outcomes and postpartum complications did not differ between the groups. Of 406 women who had a TOL, 84.9% eventually delivered both twins vaginally. A significantly higher percentage of antepartum complications were noted among those who failed the TOL compared to those with successful TOL (8.2% vs. 1.7%, p = .01). The number of neonates with pH of less than 7.0 did not differ between the groups although more neonates (2.5% vs. 0.4%, p = .05) among the failed TOL had an Apgar score of less than 7.0 at 5 minutes compared to successful TOL. Vaginal delivery of both twins after TOL occurred in 91% of vertex/vertex compared with 71.8% of vertex/nonvertex presenting twins (p < .01). Neonatal outcomes did not differ between both groups. Our results indicate that both vaginal and PCS are comparable options for vertex presenting first twin regardless of second twin presentation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to present curves of estimated placental growth in twins and to evaluate the relative contribution of gestational age, zygosity, chorionicity, fusion of the placentas, sex of the individual and of the twin pair, site of the umbilical cord insertion, birth order, maternal age, and parity. Perinatal data and placental data were obtained from 6315 live-born twin pairs from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Of 4318 twin pairs, with no missing values, the placental weights of different gestational ages were analyzed using a nonlinear multivariate Gaussian regression. Two groups were distinguished: (1) twins with two separate placentas, and (2) twins with only one placental mass (one placenta in case of monochorionic twins or two fused placentas in case of dichorionic placentas). Overall, placental weight was influenced by gestational age, fusion of the placentas, and parity. In the case of one placental mass, monozygotic dichorionic twins had the lowest weights. If two separate placentas were present, birth order played a role in favor of the first-born twin. For parity and zygosity, the differences were most pronounced between 27 and 29 weeks, whereas the difference for birth order was most pronounced between 33 and 37 weeks. In conclusion, basic physiological characteristics, routinely examined at birth, influence placental weight. Taking these covariates into account allows a better evaluation of the placental weight given a gestational age, as an indicator of growth.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are becoming common as a result of increased assisted reproduction. Studies have shown that the smaller twin of a pair is at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Our aim was to determine if there is a relation between birth-weight discordancy and neonatal morbidity and mortality and to test the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in discordant twins. For 5 years all twins admitted to our intensive care unit were included in the study. Discordance was calculated as the difference between twins' weights divided by the heavier weight. Diagnosis of RDS was made by typical clinical and radiographic methods. Multiple logistic regression was performed with gender, weight order and birth order as the independent variables and RDS as the dependent variable. Two hundred and sixty-six twin pairs with a mean gestation of 33 weeks and a mean birth-weight of 1890 g were evaluated. Multiple logistic regression revealed that being the heavier twin was a more important risk factor for RDS (odds ratio 4.5; 95% confidence interval 2.2-9.2) than being the male or second-born twin. Based on neonatal outcomes a birth-weight discordance equal or greater than 20% in twin pairs was accepted as the discordance criterion. Discordant and concordant groups were statistically different in neonatal mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, polycytemia and hypoglycemia. Our data demonstrated that being the heavier twin is a risk factor for RDS and a birth-weight difference of 20% or more in twin pairs should be accepted as discordance.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to examine causes of individual differences in height, weight and body mass index (BMI) in 5-year-old children registered with the Netherlands Twin Register. In addition, we examine whether the results of twin studies can be expanded to the singleton population by comparing the data from twins to Dutch reference growth data and by looking at the twins' target height, which was derived from parental height. For 2996 5-year-old twin pairs, information on height and weight and on parental height was available. Univariate and bivariate genetic analyses of height and weight and univariate analyses of BMI were conducted. In order to compare the twins to the singleton population, standard deviation scores (SDS) for height, BMI and target height were calculated based on Dutch reference growth charts for the general population from 1997. Genetic influences were an important source of variation in height, weight and BMI and the main source of covariation between height and weight. Additive genetic factors accounted for 69% and 66% of the individual differences in height in boys and girls, respectively. For weight, heritability estimates were 59% in boys and 78% in girls and for BMI 34% and 74%. The influence of common environment on height was 25% and 27%, on weight 24% and 10% and on BMI 44% and 12% in boys and girls. The bivariate model showed a large overlap between the genes influencing height and weight. Genes explain 78% (in boys) and 76% (in girls) of the covariance between weight and height. At the age of 5 years, female twins were as tall as singleton children, while male twins were shorter than singletons. For both boys and girls, however, mean height SDS was 0.6 standard deviation scores below the mean target height. All twins had lower BMI than singletons. Twins grow fairly well compared to singletons, but they grow below their target height. This may be due to the above average height of twin parents.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has provided strong support for the existence of a familial risk for suicide, and efforts have been made to separate genetic from enviromental risk factors. Twin studies have played a major role in the identification of genetic factors, and the results indicate that the concordance rate for suicide is higher in identical than in fraternal twins (Baldessarini & Hennen, 2004). Moreover, Segal and Roy (1995) reported a significantly higher frequency of nonfatal suicidal attempts by monozygotic (MZ) than by dyzygotic (DZ) twins whose co-twins had committed suicide. However, doubts remain as to whether the increased risk of suicide in MZ twins is a response to the intense grief over the loss of a close relative, or whether a common genotype is associated with suicidal behavior. Sudden loss, which may carry a stigma in the case of a suicide, has been linked to increased persistent emotional stress and physiological changes (Epstein, 1993; Martin & Dean, 1993). A number of researchers have reported greater suicidal ideation among bereaved MZ twins as compared to DZ twins, suggesting that a loss due to suicide may increase the risk of suicidal behavior in the surviving co-twin (Segal & Bouchard, 1993; Segal & Roy, 1995; Segal et al., 1995). The aim of the present article is to address the issue of the intense grief experienced by twins after the co-twin suicide.",

    "abstract": "Hostility has been shown to be a vulnerability marker for various health problems. The present study examined genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in hostility in South Korean adolescent and young adult twins. Seven hundred and nineteen same- and opposite-sex twin pairs aged from 13 to 23 years completed a hostility scale. The scalar sex-limitation model was applied to the data. The best fitting model indicated that 34% of the total variation of hostility was attributable to genetic factors operating in a nonadditive manner. The remaining 66% of the variance was associated with nonshared environmental influences and measurement error. These findings were largely consistent with results from previous twin studies of personality based on Caucasian twins, rendering support for the pervasive influence of genetic nonadditivity on human personality traits and the generalization of the heritability of personality across human populations.",

The frequencies of subjects deficient in IgA (6%), IgD (33%) and IgG4 (12%), but not in IgG3, were higher in the twins than in controls. We postulate that this was because the MHC haplotypes (and possible non-MHC genes) that predispose to T1D also carry susceptibility genes for certain immunoglobulin deficiencies. Immunoglobulin deficiencies were not associated with T1D. Pairwise concordance for the deficiencies in the twins was 50% for IgA, 57% for IgD and 50% for IgG4. There were no significant associations among the specific immunoglobulin deficiencies except that all IgA-deficient subjects had IgD deficiency. Thus, intrinsic penetrance is a random process independently affecting different MHC susceptibility genes. Because multiple different external triggers would be required to explain the results, differential environmental determinants appear unlikely.",

    "abstract": "While behavioral research shows working memory impairments in schizophrenics and their relatives, functional neuroimaging studies of patients and healthy controls show conflicting findings of hypo- and hyperactivation, possibly indicating different relationships between physiological activity and performance. In a between-subjects regression analysis of fMRI activation and performance, low performance was associated with relatively lower activation in patients than controls, while higher performance was associated with higher activation in patients than controls in DLPFC and parietal cortex, but not occipital cortex, with unaffected twins of schizophrenics being intermediate between the groups. Accordingly, this supports the idea that both hyper and hypoactivation may be possible along a continuum of behavioral performance in a way consistent with a neural inefficiency model. Further, this study offers preliminary evidence that the relationship between behavior and physiology in schizophrenia may be heritable.",

    "abstract": "In this report we describe the case of identical twin sisters that developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These patients have in common major histocompatibility complex class I and class II alleles and identical red blood cell antigens, which is a clear indication of monozygotic twins. Both twins showed high titers of anti-dsDNA antibody. However, only one of them manifested signs of lupus psychosis and was positive for the LE test, rheumatoid factor, anti-Scl 70, anti-SSA, and antiribosomal P antibodies. Both sisters lived together; therefore, the environmental factors were considered to be the same. Interestingly, these patients expressed different types of autoantibodies and the manifestation of disease was also quite different. When one of the twins was diagnosed with SLE, we began to closely follow up signs of the disease in the other twin periodically. This enabled us to promptly diagnose the second twin with SLE and she was successfully treated without progression of the disease. It is important to mention that following up the subsequent history of an identical twin diagnosed with SLE allowed early detection of the disease in the other twin.",

    "abstract": "This article estimates the number of monozygotic twins raised apart (MZA) potentially available to Cyril Burt in his twin studies. It concludes that between 77,000 and 88,000 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs would have been born and survived to the age of ten in the relevant period in England and Wales, and that between 750 and 1,750 surviving pairs are likely to have been separated during childhood. Burt's claim to have collected 53 MZA pairs is therefore not inherently implausible. However, when all the other constraints on Burt's studies are taken into account, his numbers are problematic. There are also serious difficulties with his claim to have studied 12 pairs born to middle-class parents. It is highly improbable that Burt could have located a majority of these cases through personal contacts as he claimed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to establish a cohort of symptomatic twins with Scheuermann kyphosis to provide estimates of prevalence, concordance, odds ratio, and heritability. These estimates indicate to what extent genetic factors contribute to the etiology of this disease.\nThe Odense-based Danish Twin Registry is unique in that it contains data on all 73,000 twin pairs born in Denmark over the last 130 years. For the present study, all 46,418 twins born from 1931 through 1982 received a seventeen-page questionnaire, in which one question was \"Have you been diagnosed with Scheuermann disease by a doctor\"? The prevalence of self-reported Scheuermann disease was calculated, with the total number of answers used as the general population. Pairwise and probandwise concordance, odds ratio, tetrachoric correlations, and heritability were calculated.\nWe found that the overall prevalence of Scheuermann disease was 2.8%, with a prevalence of 2.1% among women and 3.6% among men (p < 0.0001). The pairwise concordance for monozygotic twins was 0.19 compared with 0.07 for dizygotic twins. The probandwise concordance was 0.31 for monozygotic twins and 0.13 for dizygotic twins. The odds ratios were 32.92 and 6.25 in the monozygotic and dizygotic twins, respectively. These differences were significant (p < 0.01). Heritability was 74%.\nIn a large cohort of twins that included almost 35,000 individuals, the self-reported overall prevalence of Scheuermann disease was 2.8% and the male-to-female ratio was close to 2:1. Because the pairwise and probandwise concordance and the odds ratio were two to three times higher in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins and the heritability was high, we concluded that there is a major genetic contribution to the etiology of Scheuermann disease.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that deficits in higher-order cognitive functions serve as intermediate phenotypic indicators of genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia. The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia postulates that insufficiency of dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex contributes to the cognitive deficits observed in patients with the disease, and there is robust empirical evidence for a central role of prefrontal cortex dopamine D(1) receptors in working memory functions.\nThe authors examined the genetic and nongenetic effects on D(1) receptor binding in schizophrenia by studying monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia as well as healthy comparison twins using positron emission tomography (PET) and the D(1) receptor antagonist ligand [(11)C]SCH 23390. Performance on neuropsychological tests sensitive to frontal lobe functioning was evaluated.\nHigh D(1) receptor density in the medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and heteromodal association cortex (angular gyrus) was associated with increasing genetic risk for schizophrenia (comparison twins < unaffected dizygotic co-twins < unaffected monozygotic co-twins). Medicated schizophrenia patients demonstrated a widespread reduction in D(1) receptor binding when compared with the unaffected co-twin, and higher doses of antipsychotics were associated with lower D(1) receptor binding in the frontotemporal regions.\nThis study demonstrated an association between genetic risk for schizophrenia and alterations in cortical D(1) receptor binding, an observation that has implications for future studies of the molecular genetics of schizophrenia. In addition, the data indicate a widespread reduction of D(1) receptor binding in medicated schizophrenia patients, supporting a link between antipsychotic drug action and dopamine D(1) receptor down-regulation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between genetic susceptibility to obesity, physical activity (PA), dietary fibre, sugar and fat intakes and 4-year changes in body mass index (BMI) and attained waist circumference (WC) in a cohort of 287 monozygotic and 189 dizygotic young adult male twin pairs. Increased knowledge about interactions between genes and environment may provide insight into why some individuals are more prone to obesity than others.\nInformation about PA, BMI, dietary habits, WC and potential confounders was collected by questionnaire in 1998 and 2002. The cohort data were analysed by mixed linear models.\nTwins with low PA attained larger WC than twins with high PA (difference 2.5 cm; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 3.6). The twins with the lowest fibre intake were found to have attained the highest WC and to have increased most in BMI (difference between highest and lowest fibre intakes: 1.6 cm, 95% CI 0.4, 2.9 and 0.45 kg m(-2), 95% CI 0.15, 0.76, respectively). Furthermore, our results suggested the presence of interactions so that twins with genetic susceptibility to obesity were more prone to have larger WC if sedentary than twins without genetic susceptibility.\nPA and a diet rich in fibre may be protective against weight gain among younger adult men. An interaction between PA, genes and attained WC is a novel finding which needs confirmation by other studies.",

    "abstract": "Early analysis into the role of genetics on cardiovascular regulation has been accomplished by comparing blood pressure and heart rate in homozygous twins during unstressed, resting physiological conditions. However, many variables, including cognitive and environmental factors, contribute to the regulation of cardiovascular hemodynamics. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the hemodynamic response of identical twins to an orthostatic stress, ranging from supine rest to presyncope. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, middle cerebral artery blood velocity, an index of cerebrovascular resistance, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and end-tidal carbon dioxide were measured in 16 healthy monozygotic twin pairs. Five minutes of supine resting baseline data were collected, followed by 5 min of 60 degrees head-up tilt. After 5 min of head-up tilt, lower body negative pressure was applied in increments of 10 mmHg every 3 min until the onset of presyncope, at which time the subject was returned to the supine position for a 5-min recovery period. The data indicate that cardiovascular regulation under orthostatic stress demonstrates a significant degree of variance between identical twins, despite similar orthostatic tolerance. As the level of stress increases, so does the difference in the cardiovascular response within a twin pair. The elevated variance with increasing stress may be due to an increase in the role of environmental factors, as the influential role of genetics nears a functional limit. Therefore, although orthostatic tolerance times were very similar between identical twins, the mechanism involved in sustaining cardiovascular function during increasing stress was different.",

    "abstract": "Both environmental and genetic factors may contribute to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nutrition in fetal life, an early environmental factor, seems to influence the development of chronic diseases later in life, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, and non-insulin diabetes. This population based twin study evaluated the association between intrauterine growth, measured by weight and gestational age, and IBS. Structural equation analyses were conducted to analyse genetic and environmental sources of variation in liability to IBS.\nA postal questionnaire was sent to 12 700 Norwegian twins born between 1967 and 1979. The questionnaire included a checklist of 31 illnesses and symptoms, including IBS. The influence of birth weight on developing IBS was tested in four weight groups. Disease discordant monozygotic (MZ) pairs were analysed to test the association between intrauterine growth and IBS.\nConcordance for IBS was significantly greater (p = 0.011) in monozygotic (22.4%) than in dizygotic (9.1%) twins. The heritability of IBS was estimated to be 48.4% among females. Birth weight below 1500 g (adjusted odds ratio 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1, 5.3)) contributed significantly to the development of IBS, which appeared 7.7 years earlier than in higher weight groups. In the MZ group with birth weights lower than 2500 g, twins with IBS were significantly lighter than twins without disease (190.6 g; p = 0.02).\nThe present study demonstrates that restricted fetal growth has a significant influence on the development of IBS later in life. Weight below 1500 g influences age at onset. Genetic contribution appears to be important for IBS among females.",

We report two cases of monochorionic twin pregnancy complicated by TTTS, in which the pregnancies were treated by serial aggressive amnioreduction. However, the recipient twin in each pregnancy developed 'ischemic damage' to a lower limb.",

    "abstract": "Increased perinatal mortality in monoamniotic twin pregnancies is attributed to cord accidents in utero and at delivery. We evaluated the following parameters in monoamniotic pregnancies: (1) the incidence of cord entanglement; (2) the effect of sulindac on amniotic fluid volume and stability of fetal lie; and (3) the perinatal outcome with our current management paradigm.\nThis is a retrospective review of monoamniotic pregnancies of >or=20 weeks' gestation managed with serial ultrasound surveillance, medical amnioreduction and elective Cesarean delivery at 32 weeks' gestation. Mean amniotic fluid index (AFI) and change in AFI in monoamniotic pregnancies managed with oral sulindac was compared with 40 gestation-matched monochorionic-diamniotic controls.\nAmong 44 monoamniotic pregnancies, 20 with two live structurally normal twins at 20 weeks' gestation satisfied the inclusion criteria. All fetuses survived to 28 days postnatally despite early prenatal cord entanglement in all but one case. Whereas AFI remained stable throughout gestation in the controls, the AFI fell in those patients on sulindac from a mean value of 21.0 cm (95% CI, 18.5-23.6 cm) at 20 weeks to a mean of 12.4 cm (95% CI, 10.1-14.6 cm) at 32 weeks (ANOVA P across gestation = 0.001) but mainly remained within normal limits. Fetal lie was stabilized in 11/20 cases in the monoamniotic group compared with 13/40 in the control group (P < 0.0001).\nCord entanglement appears unpreventable, as it typically occurs in early pregnancy. Sulindac therapy reduces AFI, leads to more stable fetal lie, and may prevent intrauterine death by diminishing the risk of constricting cords that are already entangled. Perinatal survival in monoamniotic pregnancies managed by a regime of sulindac from 20 weeks' gestation, close ultrasound surveillance and elective abdominal delivery at 32 weeks' gestation seems empirically higher than that in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of fetal loss in dichorionic (DC) and monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies stratified according to zygosity and method of conception.\nIn a prospective multicenter observational study women with a twin pregnancy had an ultrasound scan before 14 + 6 weeks' gestation in order to determine chorionicity. The fetal loss rate, the perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality rates and the frequency of very preterm labor were estimated for the different types of twin.\nAmong the 495 pregnancies (421 DC and 74 MC) 229 (46%) were conceived naturally and 266 (54%) by assisted reproduction (AR). Outcome data for 945 liveborn babies were obtained. The spontaneous miscarriage rate before 24 weeks' gestation was 10.9% (7/64) among naturally conceived MC compared to 3.0% (5/165) for naturally conceived DC twins (P < 0.05). For twins conceived by AR the corresponding figures were 0% (0/10) and 0.4% (1/256). The odds ratio (OR) for very preterm birth-before 28 weeks' gestation-was 4.2 for MC twins compared to DC twins. The relative risk of fetal loss or death among DC twins was 20% of the risk for MC twins.\nThe risk of fetal loss, very preterm delivery and neonatal/infant death is significantly higher among twins with MC compared to DC placentation. Twins conceived by AR have a much lower risk of MC placentation. The risk of losing one or both twins seems higher among naturally conceived twins compared to twins conceived by AR, despite the fact that the maternal age was higher among the mothers of the AR twins.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports of genetic influences on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms have suggested moderate heritability. Family history studies of co-morbidity have found familial aggregation with tics, especially for early-onset OCD, and familial aggregation with anxiety disorders.\nHeritability of OCD and familial aggregation of OCD, tics and anxiety disorders were investigated in a community sample of 6-year-old twins using a two-phase design in which 4662 twin pairs were sampled and 854 pairs were assessed in the second phase by maternal-informant diagnostic interview using DSM-IV criteria.\nIn the multivariate model combined additive genetic and common environmental effects were estimated as 47% for sub-threshold OCD, and the model was unable to distinguish these sources of familial aggregation. There were strong familial aggregations between sub-threshold OCD and tics and between sub-threshold OCD and other anxiety disorders (80% and 97% respectively), although again specific sources could not be distinguished.\nThe findings are consistent with the hypothesis of a tic-related early-onset OCD phenotype, but also with the hypothesis of an anxiety-related early-onset OCD phenotype.",

Results from twin studies implicate the role of genetics in the etiology of both ND and AD with substantial, yet incomplete, overlap. To test for specificity of transmission of AD and ND in an offspring of twins sample we analyzed data from a study of adolescent and adult offspring of twin fathers ascertained from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. This sample consists of 1213 twin fathers, 862 biologic or rearing mothers, and 1270 offspring. Offspring were allocated to one of four risk groups for AD based on twin fathers' zygosity and father's and cotwins AD history. Offspring DSM-IV AD and ND were measured by structured diagnostic interview. Paternal AD and ND were significantly associated with offspring AD and ND, respectively. Bivariate probit regression results suggest specificity for transmission of AD and ND. This remained constant after controlling for offspring demographics and psychopathology and maternal AD and ND. Despite the substantial genetic overlap between the two disorders, there is evidence for genetic effects specific for AD and ND.",

    "abstract": "The best practice for the delivery of a term breech in singleton and twin pregnancies is still controversial. We sought the opinions of obstetricians working in Ireland. A questionnaire was used to address the management of the obstetrician's \"own hypothetical pregnancy\" in three different scenarios. We also inquired about factors which might influence the decision on mode of delivery. The response rate was 104/174 (60%). In the scenario of a singleton fetus presenting by the breech in a nulliparous woman, 15/84 (18%) of obstetricians would chose a spontaneous vaginal delivery compared to 40/80 (50%) for a multiparous woman (p < 0.01). In the scenario of a second twin in breech presentation (nulliparous and multiparous), 75/93 (81%) would choose a spontaneous vaginal delivery. When asked about a singleton cephalic presentation, 85/91 (93%) would choose a spontaneous vaginal delivery. These decisions were influenced by concerns about perinatal morbidity [91/100 (91%)], published evidence [73/98 (75%)], the delivery doctor's inexperience [56/94 (60%)], but not by gender. Our study indicates that obstetricians in Ireland consider that there is a role for vaginal breech delivery in selected scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis. Skin abnormalities result from an inability to repair UV-damaged DNA. Clinically, XP presents with early onset cutaneous changes (severe photosensitivity, actinic keratoses, and telangiectasias) and an increase of developing cutaneous malignancies beginning in early childhood, but lentigo maligna and melanomas are relatively rare. Here we report on homozygote twins in whom there was no positive family history. They showed subnormal physical growth. On ophthalmological examination, both had photophobia and decreased visual acuity. Since birth, several excisions had been performed for skin neoplasms. In one of them a pigmented patch developed over the frontal area which proved to be lentigo maligna and she was referred to a dermato-oncology center. They have been given isotretinoin and physical sunscreen since then. The follow-up period was extended to 2 years and no serious complications occurred from the above treatment. This is an interesting report about XP in twins with the presentation of the rare neoplasm lentigo maligna.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are very rare congenital malformation. The aim of this study was to summarize our experiences of surgical separation on seven sets of conjoined twins, and improve the treatment of conjoined twins in the future. A retrospective review of surgical separation included data of prenatal diagnosis, associated malformation, timing of separation, intra- and postoperative management, and follow-up of six sets of conjoined twins at Shanghai Xin-Hua Hospital from 1980 to 2005 and one set at Shanghai Children's Hospital in 2002. Surgical separation was performed on seven sets of conjoined twins; six sets of thoracopagus-omphalapagus (including four sets of xipho-omphalopagus) and one set of ischiopagus. All sets presented varying degrees of severity of congenital cardiac malformations. Four sets were diagnosed prenatally by ultrasonography. Two sets of conjoined twins (case 2 and case 3) required emergent separation within 7 days after birth; both members of case 2 died within 2 days post operation, one member of case 3 died during operation while the other member survived. Five sets had scheduled separation undertaken more than 30 days after birth. One member of a set (case 6B) died 13 days after operation due to severe congenital cardiovascular anomalies. All other members of conjoined twins survived. Case 6A had a severe defect of the anterior thoracic cage and prosthesis of titanium alloy scaffold filled with silicone rubber was used to repair the defects successfully. Following up from 1980 to 2005, one member of a set (case 1A) died 4 years after operation due to pneumonia. Contact was lost to the surviving member of case 3 (ischiopagus). Other survivors of the separations had normal development. (1) Timing of operation and separation plan should be given according to the circumstances and the nature of the organ shared in each individual set of twins. (2) Prosthesis of titanium alloy scaffolds filled with silicone rubber may become one of viable methods for repairing severe defects of the thoracic cage.",

    "abstract": "Genes from the ovarian bone morphogenetic signaling pathway (GDF9 and BMP15) are critical for normal human fertility. We previously identified a deletion mutation in GDF9 in sisters with spontaneous dizygotic (DZ) twins, but the prevalence of rare GDF9 variants in twinning families is unknown.\nThe objective was to evaluate the frequency of rare variants in GDF9 in families with a history of DZ twinning.\nWe recruited 3450 individuals from 915 DZ twinning families (1693 mothers of twins) and 1512 controls of Caucasian origin. One mother of DZ twins was selected from 279 of the 915 families, and a DNA sample was screened for rare variants in GDF9 using denaturant HPLC. Variants were confirmed by DNA sequencing and genotyped in the entire sample by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.\nWe found two novel insertion/deletions (c.392-393insT, c.1268-1269delAA) and four missense alterations in the GDF9 sequence in mothers of twins. Two of the missense variants (c.307C > T, p.Pro103Ser and c.362C > T, p.Thr121Leu) were located in the pro-region of GDF9 and two (c.1121C > T, p.Pro374Leu and c.1360C > T, p.Arg454Cys) in the mature protein region. For each variant, the frequencies were higher in cases compared with controls. The proportion of mothers of DZ twins carrying any variant (4.12%) was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than the proportion of carriers in controls (2.29%).\nWe describe new variants in the GDF9 gene that are significantly more common in mothers of DZ twins than controls, suggesting that rare GDF9 variants contribute to the likelihood of DZ twinning.",

    "abstract": "A large number of articles have been published since neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) started in the 1970s. Surprisingly, little information on false negative results in these screenings has been reported.\nThyroid-stimulating hormone (THS) levels were determined in 360,651 newborn infants in Malaga until March 2005. One hundred and fifty-six CH cases were detected, of which 86 % were permanent and 14 % were transient. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed a group of 13 CH dizygotic twins in which only one of the twins had CH.\nThe first two patients were diagnosed late and data on whether they were included in neonatal screening were lacking. In seven of the 13 patients, TSH values were initially normal: five patients were diagnosed by a second test performed 14 days after birth and were treated before they were 1 month old, and two were diagnosed and treated late because a second test was not performed. In the remaining four patients, TSH values were initially elevated but were lower than confirmation test values.\nIt is now widely accepted that thyroid function could be compensated between two dizygotic twins if only one of the twins has CH, leading to a false negative result. The results of the present study indicate the need to repeat the test for CH 14 days after birth in all dizygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the relationship between IGF-I-IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-1 and leptin levels with type 1 collagen markers of bone turnover in dichorionic twins with or without discordant birth weight of 20% or greater.\nMaternal and cord bloods were collected from gestational age-matched dichorionic twins with (n = 16) or without (n = 16) discordant birth weight. The samples were assayed for cross-linked carboxyl terminal telopeptide (ICTP, a marker of bone resorption) and propeptide (PICP, a marker of bone formation) of type I collagen, leptin, IGF-I, and IGFBP-1 by RIA.\nThe intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) twins of the discordant group had higher fetal ICTP (P < 0.001) and IGFBP-1 (P < 0.001) levels, whereas PICP (P < 0.001), IGF-I (P < 0.001), and leptin (P < 0.001) were lower than the cotwins with normal weight (AGA). In contrast, concentrations of IGF-I, IGFBP-1, ICTP, PICP, and leptin were comparable between concordant twin pairs. Leptin levels were positively correlated with PICP (r = 0.61; P < 0.001) and negatively with ICTP (r = -0.57; P < 0.001) in concordant and AGA twins but not in IUGR twins. In IUGR twins, IGF-I had positive association with PICP (r = 0.76; P < 0.001) and negative association with ICTP (r= -0.76; P < 0.001), whereas IGFBP-1 was negatively correlated with PICP levels (r = -0.65; P < 0.01). No such association was found in concordant and AGA twins.\nThese data suggest that IUGR twins had high bone turnover, which is independent of maternal factors and perhaps may be due to altered IGF axis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess treatment responses to dental flossing in twins.\nThe study was a two-treatment, examiner-blind, randomized parallel group, controlled study. Fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of 1) tongue brushing and toothbrushing (TB) and 2) TB + flossing (TB + Fl). Clinical endpoints were gingival bleeding (papillary bleeding score [PBS]) and oral malodor (levels of volatile sulfur compounds [VSC]). Analysis of variance and covariance methodologies were employed to analyze the data.\nBaseline average PBS values were 1.352 and 1.345 for the TB + Fl and TB groups, respectively (P=0.937). After 2 weeks of treatment, the TB + Fl group had a statistically significant decrease in PBS values of 0.558 (41.5% versus baseline), whereas the TB group showed no improvement from baseline. The change from baseline for the TB + Fl group was superior to that for the TB group (P<0.001). Similar findings were observed for the number of baseline papillary bleeding sites. Baseline average intraoral halimeter values were 45.91 and 41.75 for the TB+Fl and TB groups, respectively (P=0.504). Both treatment regimens demonstrated highly statistically significant reductions in intraoral halimeter values versus baseline (all P<0.001) and the difference between treatment groups was not statistically significant (P=0.339). Similar findings were found for expired air.\nIn a well-matched twin cohort, tongue and toothbrushing plus flossing significantly decreased gingival bleeding after 2 weeks.",

    "abstract": "Many studies of quantitative and disease traits in human genetics rely upon self-reported measures. Such measures are based on questionnaires or interviews and are often cheaper and more readily available than alternatives. However, the precision and potential bias cannot usually be assessed. Here we report a detailed quantitative genetic analysis of stature. We characterise the degree of measurement error by utilising a large sample of Australian twin pairs (857 MZ, 815 DZ) with both clinical and self-reported measures of height. Self-report height measurements are shown to be more variable than clinical measures. This has led to lowered estimates of heritability in many previous studies of stature. In our twin sample the heritability estimate for clinical height exceeded 90%. Repeated measures analysis shows that 2-3 times as many self-report measures are required to recover heritability estimates similar to those obtained from clinical measures. Bivariate genetic repeated measures analysis of self-report and clinical height measures showed an additive genetic correlation >0.98. We show that the accuracy of self-report height is upwardly biased in older individuals and in individuals of short stature. By comparing clinical and self-report measures we also showed that there was a genetic component to females systematically reporting their height incorrectly; this phenomenon appeared to not be present in males. The results from the measurement error analysis were subsequently used to assess the effects of error on the power to detect linkage in a genome scan. Moderate reduction in error (through the use of accurate clinical or multiple self-report measures) increased the effective sample size by 22%; elimination of measurement error led to increases in effective sample size of 41%.",

    "abstract": "The objective was to determine whether the pattern of environmental and genetic influences on deviant personality scores differs from that observed for the normative range of personality, comparing results in adolescent and adult female twins.\nA sample of 2,796 female adolescent twins ascertained from birth records provided Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire data. The average age of the sample was 17.0 years (S.D. 2.3). Genetic analyses of continuous and extreme personality scores were conducted. Results were compared for 3,178 adult female twins.\nGenetic analysis of continuous traits in adolescent female twins were similar to findings in adult female twins, with genetic influences accounting for between 37% and 44% of the variance in Extraversion (Ex), Neuroticism (N), and Social Non-Conformity (SNC), with significant evidence of shared environmental influences (19%) found only for SNC in the adult female twins. Analyses of extreme personality characteristics, defined categorically, in the adolescent data and replicated in the adult female data, yielded estimates for high N and high SNC that deviated substantially (p < .05) from those obtained in the continuous trait analyses, and provided suggestive evidence that shared family environment may play a more important role in determining personality deviance than has been previously found when personality is viewed continuously. However, multiple-threshold models that assumed the same genetic and environmental determinants of both normative range variation and extreme scores gave acceptable fits for each personality dimension.\nThe hypothesis of differences in genetic or environmental factors responsible for N and SNC among female twins with scores in the extreme versus normative ranges was partially supported, but not for Ex.",

    "abstract": "An algorithm is presented to derive the twin laws in non-merohedric twins through the systematic search for quasi-perpendicular lattice planes/directions. The twin lattice, i.e. the sublattice common to the whole crystalline edifice built by the twinned individuals, is based on a supercell of the individual defined by a pair of quasi-perpendicular lattice elements (hkl)/[uvw]. Starting from a (real or supposed) twin element, (hkl) or [uvw], the set of quasi-perpendicular lattice elements with user-defined limits on the twin index and obliquity is explored. The degree of lattice quasi-restoration is commonly measured by the classical twin index but in some cases, especially for large supercells, this index represents only a first approximation of the degree of lattice quasi-restoration, because more than one pair (hkl)/[uvw] may exist, and more than one concurrent sublattices of nodes, based on the same twin element, may be quasi-restored, although within different obliquities. These twins, whose existence has been recently recognized, are termed hybrid twins. In hybrid twins, the degree of lattice quasi-restoration is measured by the effective twin index n(E), a generalization of the classical twin index: in the limiting case of only one (quasi-)restored sublattice, the effective twin index and the classical twin index coincide. A number of examples previously reported simply as 'non-Friedelian' twins (with a twin index higher than the empirical limit of 6 established by Friedel) are analysed and reinterpreted as hybrid twins. A Fortran program is made available, which derives the possible twin laws according to this algorithm and analyses the pseudosymmetry of the concurrent sublattices defined by each pair (hkl)/[uvw]. The occurrence of hybrid concurrent components in twinning does not affect the normal procedures of dealing with diffraction patterns of twinned crystals.",

In contrast, the underlying molecular genetic basis of several inherited vitreoretinal dystrophies is now well established, with also an increasing recognition of genetic factors in the development of myopia. We describe asymptomatic female monozygotic twins who were identified as having identical retinal holes. These cases represent the first evidence to our knowledge of a potential role of inherited factors in the causation of idiopathic peripheral retinal holes. This observation raises the need to examine the twin of any patient presenting with a retinal break(s).",

    "abstract": "Here we report a case of conjoined twins that were diagnosed antenatally by routine two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound examination at as early as the 9th week of gestational age. The fetuses were of the thoraco-omphalopagus type and were sharing the liver, as confirmed by color Doppler. There was a reversed flow in the single ductus venosus of the twins. Umbilical arterial and venous blood flow waveform did not show any abnormality for this gestational age. This case demonstrated the possibility of making an accurate diagnosis of conjoined twins in the first trimester by transvaginal two-dimensional ultrasound and color Doppler examination. Although conjoined twins were described at first trimester before, fetoplacental Doppler waveform findings at this gestational age have been described very rarely. This case demonstrated the possibility of making an accurate diagnosis of conjoined twins and delineating the extent of organ sharing in the first trimester, and early diagnosis can help the parents with the option for pregnancy termination. The importance of expert early vaginal sonography and color Doppler findings is emphasized.",

They both have suffered from generalized seizures since their early adulthood. Moreover, the patients showed some additional conditions only occurring in one individual or the other such as migraine, marked recurrent depressive disorder or polyarthrosis. The symptoms common to both twins appear to correspond to the Morgagni-Stewart-Morel syndrome and indicate a genetic basis of this disorder as these features occur in genetically identical patients.",

Questionnaires were mailed to Finnish twins born 1975-1979 at ages 16, 17, 18 1/2 and, on average, 25 years of age (N=2465 complete twin pairs). The data were analyzed using quantitative genetic methods for twin data by the Mx statistical package. Heritability of self-rated health was greatest at age 16 (63%, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 56-67%, men and women together) and declined steadily to age 25 (33%, 95% CI 25-41%). The residual variation was due to unshared environments. Health ratings at different ages were modestly correlated (r=0.33-0.61). These correlations were mainly due to genetic factors, but unshared environment also contributed to them. An important challenge for further research is to identify environmental influences contributing to self-rated health independently of, or in interaction with, genetic factors.",

However, until today, there is only controversial information about the contribution of genetic and environmental factors. Therefore, we performed an open prospective study in 108 monozygotic (MZ) and 60 same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs to analyse the genetic and environmental contributions to plasma CRP and IL-6 levels. Heritability of IL-6 was 0.61, indicating that plasma IL-6 levels are to a major part influenced by genetic determinants; however, for CRP, heritability was only 0.22, pointing to a moderate genetic influence. Plasma CRP levels were strongly influenced by female gender, older age and especially the body mass index. Our data underline the central role of IL-6 in low-grade inflammation contributing to atherosclerosis and CVD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to estimate the heritability of variation in testosterone levels in 12-year-old children, and to explore the overlap in genetic and environmental influences on circulating testosterone levels and androgen-dependent pubertal development. Midday salivary testosterone samples were collected on 2 consecutive days in a sample of 183 unselected twin pairs. Androgen-induced pubertal development was assessed using self-report Tanner scales of pubic hair development (boys and girls) and genital development (boys). A significant contribution of genetic effects to the variance in testosterone levels was found. Heritability was approximately 50% in both boys and girls. The remaining proportion of the variance in testosterone levels could be explained by nonshared environmental influences. The relatively high correlation between testosterone levels of opposite-sex dizygotic twins suggests that sex differences in genes influencing variation in testosterone levels have not yet developed in pre- and early puberty. Variance in pubertal development was explained by a large genetic component, moderate shared environmental influences, and a small nonshared environmental effect. Testosterone levels correlated moderately (r = .31) with pubertal development; the covariance between testosterone levels and pubertal development was entirely accounted for by genetic influences.",

One major confounder in such studies is that MZ twins may share postnatal environmental influences more so than do DZ twins. To avoid such confounding, twins separated at or soon after birth have been studied, but their scarcity often makes this approach impractical. Another method has been to measure the degree of contact twins have maintained over time, and adjust the observed correlations. Here, we remove confounding by utilizing the discrepancy between biological and self-perceived zygosity to separate environmental from genetic sources of twin similarity. We analyzed dietary patterns and physiologic traits in 350 female twin pairs of the 1988 Kaiser Permanente Twin Registry. Among twin pairs, 175 were MZ by self-report and genetic testing (MZC), 136 were DZ by self-report and genetic testing (DZC), 30 were MZ by genetic testing but not by self-report (MZW), and 9 were DZ by genetic testing but not by self-report (DZW) but were excluded due to small sample size. For healthy food patterns, MZC and MZW intraclass correlations were similar and greater than for DZC, yielding positive and significant heritability estimates. For unhealthy food patterns, the MZC, MZW and DZC correlations were similar with no significant heritability. For physiologic traits, MZC and MZW correlations were similar and higher than those for DZC, indicating significant heritability, except for insulin for which MZW and DZC were similar and which showed modest heritability. Twins of mistaken zygosity (TOMZ) provides a useful approach to robust determination of heritability.",

    "abstract": "Few long-term studies have yet described neuropsychological outcome in preterm twins. Our aim was to assess, by long-term evaluation, neuropsychological outcome in preterm twins in order to define a correct follow-up program. Our study was a cohort one, with an index and a comparison group. Neonatal medical records of all preterm newborns admitted to our centre between 1991 and 1997 were reviewed and selected patients were recalled. The sample population included two matched groups of children aged 6-12 years, 86 twins and 86 singletons, submitted to paediatric, neurological, psychological, and ophthalmological examinations. Inclusion criteria were twin pregnancy and gestational age 27-36 weeks for index group; same gestational age, but single pregnancy, for the comparison group. All children underwent paediatric and neuropsychiatric examinations, cognitive assessment, and psychological evaluation by standardized tests for screening of learning specific disorders and language difficulties, and finally, ophthalmological examination. In order to study their role in predicting neuropsychological outcome, we examined some perinatal prognostic factors by statistical analysis. Unfavourable neuropsychological outcome was observed in 55/172 (32%) children, with different prevalence in the two groups, 42/172 (24%) in twins and 13/172 (8%) in singletons. Statistical analysis performed for examined prognostic factors showed significant differences in neuropsychological outcome with regard only to gestational age < 32 weeks, low birth weight, intraventricular haemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia. The incidence of neuropsychological diseases in the two groups showed significant difference about language and learning difficulties. Our data suggest that preterm twins represent a particular high-risk category of premature babies, mostly regarding the risk of so-called \"minimal brain dysfunction\", so a careful follow-up is recommended.",

    "abstract": "A biological abnormality found to be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be, among other things, a pretrauma vulnerability factor, that is, it may have been present prior to the event's occurrence and increased the individual's likelihood of developing PTSD upon traumatic exposure. Alternately, it may be an acquired PTSD sign, that is, it may have developed after the traumatic exposure, along with the PTSD. We have studied pairs of Vietnam combat veterans and their noncombat-exposed, identical twins in an effort to resolve these competing origins. Combat veterans were diagnosed as current PTSD or non-PTSD (i.e., never had). Average heart rate responses (HRRs) to a series of sudden, loud-tone presentations were larger in Vietnam combat veteran twins with PTSD, but these larger responses were not shared by their noncombat-exposed cotwins, whose responses were similar to those of the non-PTSD combat veterans and their noncombat-exposed cotwins. These results suggest that larger HRRs to sudden, loud tones represent an acquired sign of PTSD. In contrast, increased neurological soft signs (NSSs), diminished hippocampal volume, and presence of abnormal cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) were found in Vietnam combat veteran twins with PTSD and their \"high-risk,\" unexposed cotwins compared to Vietnam combat veteran twins without PTSD and their \"low-risk,\" unexposed cotwins. These results support the conclusion that the latter abnormalities represent antecedent, familial vulnerability factors for developing chronic PTSD upon exposure to a traumatic event.",

Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-binomial regression were used to study the conditional and relative risk of astigmatism in twin pairs by sex and zygosity. Tetrachoric correlations and structural equation models were applied to estimate the genetic and environmental sources of variations in liability for astigmatism.\nAltogether 21.1% of males and 29.3% of females (p < 0.001) reported a positive history of astigmatism. Estimated incidence rates peaked in both sexes in the group aged 16-19 years and then decreased. Both conditional and relative risks of developing astigmatism were considerably higher in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins if a cotwin reported a positive history of astigmatism. The best-fitting biometrical model suggested that additive genetic, dominant genetic, and individual environmental effects explained 9% (95% CI: 0-40), 54% (95% CI: 20-69), and 38% (95% CI: 31-45) of the variation in the liability to astigmatism, respectively. No differences in heritability of astigmatism between the genders were found.\nThe prevalence of self-reported astigmatism in twins is comparable with previous findings from Norway. Our results suggest considerable genetic contribution to the development of astigmatism in young adult Norwegian twins mainly due to dominant genetic effects, which are similar in both males and females.",

    "abstract": "Drawing upon qualitative interviews with monozygotic (identical) twins sharing 100% of their genes, and with dizygotic (fraternal) twins and singletons as control groups, this paper explores what it means to be genetically identical. (The twins interviewed were from the TwinsUK register in London.) In the context of the ongoing debate on human reproductive cloning, it examines questions such as: To what extent do identical twins perceive their emotional and physical bond to be a result of their genetic makeup? What would they think if they had been deliberately created genetically identical? How would they feel about being genetically identical to a person who was born a few years earlier or later? First, our respondents ascribed no great significance to the role of genes in their understanding of what it means to be identical twins. Second, the opinion that human reproductive cloning would \"interfere with nature\", or \"contradict God's will\", was expressed by our respondents exclusively on the abstract level. The more our respondents were able to relate a particular invented cloning scenario to their own life-worlds, the lower the prevalence of the argument. Third, for all three groups of respondents, the scenario of having been born in one of the other groups was perceived as strange. Fourth, the aspect that our respondents disliked about cloning scenarios was the potential motives of the cloners. Without equating monozygotic twins directly with \"clones\", these results from \"naturally\" genetically identical individuals add a new dimension to what a future cloning situation could entail: The cloned person might possibly (a) perceive a close physical and emotional connection to the progenitor as a blessing; (b) suffer from preconceptions of people who regard physical likeness as a sign of incomplete individuality; and (c) perceive the idea of not having been born a clone of a particular person as unpleasant.",

    "abstract": "HbA(1c) (A1C) is substantially determined by genetic factors not shared in common with glucose. Fractions of the variance in A1C, the glycation gap (GG; previously called the glycosylation gap) and the hemoglobin glycosylation index, correlate with diabetes complications. We therefore tested whether GG (measured A1C - A1C predicted from glycated serum proteins [GSPs]) was genetically determined and whether it accounted for the heritability of A1C.\nWe conducted a classic twin study on A1C and GSP collected in 40 and 46 pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic healthy female twins, respectively. The predicted A1C was based on the regression line between A1C and GSP in a separate population spanning the pathophysiologic range.\nGG was more strongly correlated between monozygotic (r = 0.65) than dizygotic (r = 0.48) twins, adjusted for age and BMI. The best-fitting quantitative genetic model adjusted for age and BMI showed that 69% of population variance in GG is heritable, while the remaining 31% is due to unique environmental influences. In contrast, GSP was similarly correlated between monozygotic (r = 0.55) and dizygotic (r = 0.49) twins, hence not genetically determined. GG was strongly correlated to A1C (r = 0.48), attributable mostly to genetic factors. About one-third of the heritability of A1C is shared with GG; the remainder is specific to A1C.\nHeritability of the GG accounts for about one-third of the heritability of A1C. By implication, there are gene(s) that preferentially affect erythrocyte lifespan or glucose and/or nonenzymatic glycation or deglycation in the intracellular, rather than extracellular, compartment.",

Both twins had an equal amount of restriction in right and left abduction. Narrowing of the palpebral fissures and globe retraction in right and left adduction was also observed in both twins. To our knowledge this is the first case to report concordant bilateral DRS (type 1) in female MZ twins. The concordance for the presence of DRS and associated clinical signs observed in this MZ twin pair supports a genetic origin to DRS.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychological deficits have been reported among trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is often assumed that these cognitive difficulties are toxic consequences of trauma exposure. Alternatively, they may reflect preexisting characteristics that contribute to the likelihood of developing PTSD. To address this possibility, the authors evaluated cognitive performance in monozygotic twin pairs who were discordant for combat exposure. Pairs were grouped according to whether the combat-exposed brother developed PTSD. The combat-unexposed cotwins of combat veterans with PTSD largely displayed the same performance as their brothers, which was significantly lower than that of non-PTSD combat veterans and their brothers. The results support the notion that specific domains of cognitive function may serve as premorbid risk or protective factors in PTSD.",

    "abstract": "To help develop an evidence-based approach to the best management of twin pregnancies discordant for anencephaly.\nWe retrospectively examined the management and outcome of 18 pregnancies discordant for anencephaly diagnosed at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks of gestation in our center. We combined these data with those from other publications. In total, there were 44 dichorionic pregnancies that were managed expectantly (n = 35) or by selective feticide (n = 9) and 19 monochorionic pregnancies that were managed expectantly. We also reviewed the literature to ascertain the outcome of monochorionic twin pregnancies undergoing cord occlusion.\nIn the 35 dichorionic pregnancies that were managed expectantly, 20 (57.1%) developed polyhydramnios at 25-31 weeks; 13 were managed expectantly, five had amniodrainage and two had selective feticide. In 34 of the 35 cases the non-anencephalic twin was liveborn at a median gestation of 36 (range, 28-39) weeks and in six (17.6%) of these it was born before 33 weeks. In the dichorionic pregnancies that had selective feticide, there was one miscarriage and eight (88.9%) live births at a median gestation of 37 (range, 30-40) weeks and in one (12.5%) of these it was born before 33 weeks. In the monochorionic pregnancies, four (21.1%) anencephalic fetuses died at 20-32 weeks and in three of these the normal co-twin also died. In the 16 (84.2%) cases resulting in the live birth of the normal twin, delivery occurred at a median gestation of 33 (range, 27-39) weeks and in six (37.5%) of these it was before 33 weeks. Ultrasound-guided bipolar cord coagulation in 92 pregnancies, mostly complicated by twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence or severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, was associated with a survival rate of 77.2% and early preterm delivery rate of 31.0%.\nDichorionic twins discordant for anencephaly are best managed with serial ultrasound examinations for early diagnosis of polyhydramnios, which can then be treated either by amniodrainage or selective feticide. In monochorionic twins it is uncertain whether the best management is expectant or by cord occlusion.",

In the dichorionic pregnancies that had selective feticide, there was one miscarriage and eight (88.9%) live births at a median gestation of 37 (range, 30-40) weeks and in one (12.5%) of these it was born before 33 weeks. In the monochorionic pregnancies, four (21.1%) anencephalic fetuses died at 20-32 weeks and in three of these the normal co-twin also died. In the 16 (84.2%) cases resulting in the live birth of the normal twin, delivery occurred at a median gestation of 33 (range, 27-39) weeks and in six (37.5%) of these it was before 33 weeks. Ultrasound-guided bipolar cord coagulation in 92 pregnancies, mostly complicated by twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence or severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, was associated with a survival rate of 77.2% and early preterm delivery rate of 31.0%.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether acquired obesity or accompanying metabolic changes such as adiponectin deficiency, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, or visceral fat are associated, independent of genetic influences, with endothelial dysfunction by studying young adult monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for obesity.\nNine obesity-discordant (intra-pair difference in BMI, 3.8 to 10.1 kg/m(2)) and nine concordant (0 to 2.3 kg/m(2)) 24- to 27-year-old MZ twin pairs were identified from a population-based FinnTwin16-sample. Endothelial function was measured by blood flow responses to intrabrachial infusions of an endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and an endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilator. Whole body insulin sensitivity was measured using the euglycemic insulin clamp technique, and forearm and body composition were measured with magnetic resonance imaging and DXA. In addition, serum levels of adiponectin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lipids were determined.\nThe heavier co-twins of the discordant pairs had significantly lower whole body insulin sensitivity than the leaner co-twins. Blood flows/muscle volume during infusions of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were not altered by obesity. However, intra-pair differences in serum adiponectin, intra-abdominal fat, and C-reactive protein were significantly correlated with those in endothelial function. Only the relationship between intra-pair differences in adiponectin and endothelial function persisted in multiple linear regression analysis. Obesity-concordant co-twins had comparable insulin sensitivity and endothelial function.\nIn young adult MZ twins discordant for obesity, acquired adiponectin deficiency rather than obesity per se is an independent correlate of endothelial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Using an offspring-of-twins design, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to paternal alcoholism during the child's first 12 years will increase offspring risk for subsequent alcohol-use disorders (AUD).\nStructured psychiatric interviews assessed history of psychiatric and substance-use disorders in Vietnam Era Twin Registry fathers (n = 512), their offspring (n = 877), and mothers of the offspring (n = 507). Exposure was defined as the fathers' endorsement of any Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fourth Edition, AUD symptom, according to the Lifetime Drinking History assessment (administered in 1999), at any time between off- spring ages 0-12 years; all fathers had satisfied DSM, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R), criteria for alcohol dependence in a 1992 diagnostic interview. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to predict time to first symptom of abuse/dependence in offspring.\nOff- spring exposed to paternal alcoholism were significantly more likely to develop an AUD when compared with offspring of nonalcoholic fathers (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-2.07). Although offspring unexposed to paternal alcoholism did not significantly differ from control offspring (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 0.93-2.41), the magnitude of association was similar to that in the exposed offspring. There were no significant differences in AUD between offspring of alcoholics who were exposed and those who were not exposed to paternal alcoholism, as long as fathers had satisfied DSM-III-R criteria for alcohol dependence at some point in their lives.\nThere does not appear to be a relationship between exposure to paternal alcoholism during childhood and development of an AUD in offspring. Genetic and high-risk environmental factors that are correlated with lifetime paternal alcoholism may be stronger predictors of offspring AUD than fathers' problem drinking. Future research should be encouraged, using more comprehensive analyses, to examine the role of family genetic influences and other family environmental influences on offspring alcohol outcomes.",

    "abstract": "China has the world's largest concentration of smokers (350 million) and rising alcohol consumption, yet little is known about tobacco and alcohol use aetiology. In 2000, the Chinese National Twin Registry was established to provide a genetically informative resource for investigation of health behaviour including tobacco and alcohol use.\nUsing standard twin methodology, this study aimed to examine the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences on cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking in a sample of adult Chinese twins (n = 1010 individual twins). More than half of the male twins were smokers (58%), and 32.5% reported alcohol consumption. Among male smokers, 46.4% smoked 20 or more cigarettes per day (heavy smokers) and among drinkers, 32.8% consumed one or more drinks per day. Nearly all female twins were non-smokers (99.2%) and non-drinkers (98.7%); therefore, genetic analysis was limited to male data.\nIn men, current smoking was significantly heritable [75.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 56.7-87.5] with no evidence for a significant contribution of shared environmental effects. Heavy smoking was more strongly influenced by genes (66.2%, 95% CI 0-88.4) than shared environment (8.7%, 95% CI 0-71.0). Similarly, current drinking was more strongly influenced by genetic effects (59.5%, 95% CI 0-87.8) than by shared environmental effects (15.3%, 95% CI 0-72.1). Amount of alcohol consumed was influenced to a similar degree by genetic (42.4%, 95% CI 0-91.8) and shared environmental factors (39.2%, 95% CI 0-82.7).\nThese results support findings from twins of Western origin on the aetiology of tobacco and alcohol use and encourage further work in Chinese twins.",

    "abstract": "The Bamana and Maninka of Mali greatly value twins, and have elaborated a range of cultural beliefs and practices to assure their survival. Rates of twinning among these two ethnic groups average from 15.2/1000 to 17.9/1000 births compared to 10.5/1000 births (without assisted reproduction) in the United States and Great Britain. Twins (flaniw) are regarded as extraordinary beings with unusual powers, and as a gift from the supreme deity. A small altar (sinzin) is maintained in the home of twins, and periodic sacrifices of chicken blood, kola nuts, millet paste and millet beer regularly made to assure their protection. Albinos (y\u00e9fegu\u00e9w) and true and pseudo-hermaphrodites (ty\u00e9t\u00e9nousot\u00e9w) are also considered twin beings. However, they are believed to be the result of aberrant parental social behavior. The Bamana and Maninka believe that all four groups (twins, albinos, hermaphrodites, and pseudo-harmaphrodites) are closely linked to Faro, an androgynous supernatural being who provides equilibrium in the world. Faro is the original albino and hermaphrodite who gave birth to the first pair of twins after self-impregnation. Whenever a twin dies, a small wooden statue is sculpted called a flanitok\u00e9l\u00e9 (twin that remains). This commemorative figure is kept close to the surviving twin, reflecting a belief in the inseparability of twins. Eventually, the surviving twin takes responsibility for the figure. When a surviving twin marries, another figure is often sculpted in the opposite sex from the deceased twin, and placed with the original sculpture. Such commemorative sculptures are not created upon the death of those who are albinos, hermaphrodites, or pseudo-hermaphrodites. In recent years, transformational belief patterns have evolved as increasing numbers of Bamana and Maninka embrace Islam. Traditional beliefs are often given Islamic myths of origin. However, even in this Islamic context, many practices that assure twin survival are maintained.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate genetic analysis was used to examine the genetic and environmental aetiology of the interrelationships of diverse linguistic skills. This study used data from a large sample of 4 1/2-year-old twins who were tested on measures assessing articulation, phonology, grammar, vocabulary, and verbal memory. Phenotypic analysis suggested two latent factors: articulation (2 measures) and general language (the remaining 7), and a genetic model incorporating these factors provided a good fit to the data. Almost all genetic and shared environmental influences on the 9 measures acted through the two latent factors. There was also substantial aetiological overlap between the two latent factors, with a genetic correlation of 0.64 and shared environment correlation of 1.00. We conclude that to a large extent, the same genetic and environmental factors underlie the development of individual differences in a wide range of linguistic skills.",

    "abstract": "Twin gestations are associated with disturbed fetal growth. The aim of this study was to compare body composition measurements of twins to those of singletons.\nAnthropometric and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements were performed in twins and in matched singleton neonates. There were 48 pairs of twins in which 76 infants were appropriate for gestational age (AGA) with birth weights between the 10th and 90th percentile and 20 were small for gestational age (SGA) with birth weights <10th percentiles. Each AGA twin was matched as closely as possible for birth weight to an AGA singleton. Each SGA twin was matched with two cohorts of AGA singletons: one with similar birth weight and one with similar gestation.\nFor AGA twins and their singleton cohort matched for birth weights, profile analysis using repeated measure analysis of variance showed that there were no significant differences in bone, fat and lean mass either as absolute values or as percentage of total weight. This was also the case for body composition of SGA twins compared to singletons matched for birth weight. In contrast, SGA twins have significantly lower absolute amounts of lean with tendency to lower fat and bone mass.\nFor clinically normally grown neonates, with comparable weight, the body composition with respect to bone, fat and lean mass components are similar regardless whether they are products of singleton or twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis is a physiological form of cell death important in normal processes such as morphogenesis and the functioning of the immune system. In addition, defects in the apoptotic process play a major role in a number of important areas of disease, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer. DNA-damage-induced apoptosis plays a vital role in the maintenance of genomic stability by the removal of damaged cells. Previous studies of the apoptotic response (AR) to radiation-induced DNA damage of lymphoid cells from individuals carrying germline TP53 mutations have demonstrated a defective AR compared with normal controls. We have also previously demonstrated that AR is reduced as individuals age. Results from the current study on 108 twins aged 18-80 years confirm these earlier findings that the AR of lymphoid cells to DNA damage is significantly reduced with increasing age. In addition this twin study shows, for the first time, that DNA-damage-induced AR has a strong degree of heritability of 81% (95% confidence interval 67-89%). The vital role of DNA-damage-induced apoptosis in maintaining genetic stability, its relationship with age and its strong heritability underline the importance of this area of biology and suggest areas for further study.",

    "abstract": "Though behavioral genetic studies of aggression have implicated heritable and environmental factors, there is limited understanding of how these factors influence aggression across different settings and over time. Ratings for 732 twins were collected from parents and teachers during middle childhood and early adolescence. Total aggression scores on the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher Report Form (TRF) were examined at each age, across both settings, and developmentally. In this sample, aggressive behavior was moderately to largely heritable at each age within the home (.76-.84) and school (.42-.61). Across each age, ratings by parents and teachers were moderately correlated (.19-.36). Genetic and environmental effects that were limited to a particular setting were important etiological factors for aggressive behavior consistently within each setting, while only genetic factors influenced levels of aggression across both settings. Stability during these ages was due to genetic effects common to each age and the persistence of child-specific environmental experiences within each setting. These results suggest that genetic and environmental influences on children's aggressive behavior are largely setting specific. Levels of aggression seen consistently across both settings are due to genetic influences. Developmentally stable levels of aggressive behavior result from genetic influences common to all ages and individual environmental influences whose effects persist across ages.",

In this study, the International Classification of Diseases- 9th edition code searches and medical record review were used to identify all children with arterial ischemic stroke examined in a pediatric stroke clinic over a 2-year period. Four of the 35 children (11.4%) with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke were twins; none had co-twin demise. No co-twin had any clinical evidence of perinatal stroke. The most common findings on prothrombotic evaluation were elevated antiphospholipid antibodies (2), elevated lipoprotein a (2), and elevated Factor VIIIc (2). Twin gestation without co-twin demise may be a risk factor for perinatal stroke, and might help explain the higher incidence of cerebral palsy in twins.",

    "abstract": "To identify disease-specific gene expression profiles in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), using complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analyses on lymphoblastoid B cell lines (LCLs) derived from RA-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins.\nThe cDNA was prepared from LCLs derived from the peripheral blood of 11 pairs of RA-discordant MZ twins. The RA twin cDNA was labeled with cy5 fluorescent dye, and the cDNA of the healthy co-twin was labeled with cy3. To determine relative expression profiles, cDNA from each twin pair was combined and hybridized on 20,000-element microarray chips. Immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the expression of selected gene products in synovial tissue from patients with RA compared with patients with osteoarthritis and normal healthy controls.\nIn RA twin LCLs compared with healthy co-twin LCLs, 1,163 transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, 747 were overexpressed and 416 were underexpressed. Gene ontology analysis revealed many genes known to play a role in apoptosis, angiogenesis, proteolysis, and signaling. The 3 most significantly overexpressed genes were laeverin (a novel enzyme with sequence homology to CD13), 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (a steroid pathway enzyme), and cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer 61 (a known angiogenic factor). The products of these genes, heretofore uncharacterized in RA, were all abundantly expressed in RA synovial tissues.\nMicroarray cDNA analysis of peripheral blood-derived LCLs from well-controlled patient populations is a useful tool to detect RA-relevant genes and could help in identifying novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Insecure mental representations of attachment, a nearly invariant feature of cluster B personality disorders, have never previously been studied in twins. We conducted the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) on 33 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) female twins reared together as an initial exploration of causal influences on mental representations of attachment. As predicted by attachment theory, we observed substantial twin-twin concordance for attachment security (odds ratio 13.8; P = 0.001), a similar level of concordance between twins and their non-twin siblings, and an inverse relationship between attachment security and current level of aggression (P = 0.01). These data indicate that there are minimal effects of non-shared environmental influences (or measurement error) on attachment classifications derived from the AAI. In this sample of twins with and without histories of Conduct Disorder, mental representations of attachment appear to be highly familial, i.e., strongly influenced by either shared environmental factors, genetic factors, or both.",

    "abstract": "Results of twin studies clearly demonstrate that genetic factors play an important role in the rate of language acquisition and linguistic proficiency attained by normal and impaired children and adults [see Stromswold, K. (2001). The heritability of language: A review and meta-analysis of twin, adoption and linkage studies. Language, 77, 647-723.]. That said, twin-based heritability estimates for language rarely exceed .6 and monozygotic (MZ) twins (who are usually assumed to have identical genetic and environmental endowments) sometimes have very different linguistic profiles. In addition, twins are more likely to suffer linguistic delays and impairments than singletons. Postnatal factors, such as differences in linguistic input twins receive, are usually assumed to be the major reason for these findings. This paper discusses how genetic, epigenetic, and perinatal environmental factors can lower heritability estimates for language, cause MZ twins to be linguistically discordant, and increase the risk of language impairments in twins. We present results from our ongoing Perinatal Environment and Genetic Interaction (PEGI) study that suggest that perinatal environmental factors affect linguistic development more than postnatal factors, and that postnatal factors affect cognitive development more than perinatal factors. Because perinatal factors are overwhelming biological, whereas postnatal factors tend to be psychosocial (e.g., how and how much parents speak to their children), these results support nativist/biological theories of language and language development and call into question empiricist/emergentist theories. These results are also consistent with modularist theories of language. We end by suggesting new methods that can be used to tease apart the effects of prenatal and postnatal environment and to investigate how these factors interact with genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Accurate transmission of chromosomes from parent to progeny cell requires assembly of a bipolar spindle. Centrosomes (spindle pole body in yeast) are critical for the biogenesis of this complex mitotic apparatus since they confer bipolarity on the spindle and serve as the site of microtubule polymerization. In each division cycle, the centrosome is duplicated and the sister-centrosomes move away from each other, forming the two poles of the spindle. While the structure and the duplication of centrosomes have been investigated extensively, the understanding of the control of their segregation remains scant. Recent findings are beginning to yield insights into the regulation of centrosome segregation in yeast and its link to the mitotic kinase.",

    "abstract": "Population-based studies in twins have been of insufficient size to explore the relationship between risk of cerebral palsy and intrauterine growth. Earlier studies in singletons have suggested an optimum size at birth for minimum cerebral palsy risk between the 75th and 90th percentiles of weight for gestational age. We aggregated data from nine European cerebral palsy registers for 1976 to 1990. Using sex-specific fetal growth standards for twins, a z score of weight-for-gestation was derived for each of the 373 twin cases. The rates of cerebral palsy in each z-score band were compared to the rate in the a priori reference band of 0.67 to less than 1.28 (equivalent to the 75th to less than 90th percentiles). In twins born at 32 weeks' gestation or more (92% of all twins), cerebral palsy rates were higher for both light and heavy-for-gestation babies compared to an optimum (i.e., minimum risk) in the reference band. However, the rate ratio for heavy babies (90th percentile or greater) did not reach conventional (95% confidence intervals [CI]) statistical significance (rate ratios = 1.76; 90% CI 1.02-3.03). For twins born at less than 32 weeks, the significantly higher risk for cerebral palsy was observed consistently in all z-score bands less than average compared to the reference band. This multi-center study demonstrates that for twins born at 32 weeks' gestation or more, an increased risk of cerebral palsy is associated with deviations from optimal intrauterine growth at about 1 standard deviation above mean weight, as was earlier reported for singletons. For twins born at less than 32 weeks' gestation, this pattern is only demonstrable for babies weighing below the optimum weight-for-gestation.",

    "abstract": "We report monozygotic twins with congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis, whose lesions initially presented as hemorrhagic bullae at birth with rapid progression into crusted papules the following day. Physical examination disclosed crusted papules on the right side of the neck of twin 1 and a similar solitary lesion on the lateral side of the right thumb of twin 2. Excisional biopsy specimen findings of the neck and thumb lesions were consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which was further confirmed by positive CD1a staining. The lesions resolved completely by 2 months with no evidence of recurrence or systemic involvement. Congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis is a rare, self-limited form of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Although familial clustering in Langerhans cell histiocytosis was previously reported, to the best of our knowledge there is no report suggesting familial clustering in congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis. Our patients are interesting in terms of raising the question of whether the presence of congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis in monozygotic twins is implicative of a genetic role in its pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "To determine the effects of genetic versus environmental influences on smoking initiation (SI) and smoking persistence (SP).\nNative California twins (32,359 pairs), who completed a questionnaire in 1992 or 1998 to 2001, were studied. Standard epidemiologic and genetic analyses were conducted using multiple logistic regression and biometric models to determine factors related to smoking phenotype.\nThe strongest influence on SI was having a co-twin who ever smoked; the adjusted odds ratio was 9.7 [95% confidence limits (CL), 8.8-10.6] among monozygotic twins and 5.7 (95% CL, 5.2-6.2) among dizygotic like-sex pairs. The risk of SP was also increased if the co-twin currently smoked [adjusted odds ratios, 3.5 (95% CL, 3.0-4.1) for monozygotic twins and 2.3 (95% CL, 2.0-2.7) for like-sex dizygotic pairs]. The proportions of variance due to genetic effects, shared environment, and individual environment for SI were 31.6% (24.2-39.1), 47.5% (41.1-53.7), and 20.9% (18.8-23.1) for females, and 71.2% (66.7-75.4), 12.0% (8.7-15.7), and 16.7% (15.0-18.7) for males. For SP, estimates were identical by gender: 54.6% (43.6-65.5), 8.6% (0-17.1), and 36.8% (32.9-40.9). Modification of SI by closeness between twins was found, but little difference was seen for SP by closeness, birth cohort, or age.\nGender differences in the pattern of genetic and environmental determinants of SI indicate that gender-specific approaches may be needed for smoking prevention efforts. Modification of genetic effects by closeness between twins and birth cohort suggests that environmental interventions could reduce a heritable propensity to smoke. However, the apparently heritable tendency to continue smoking is unaffected by gender, age, birth cohort, or closeness between twins.",

Multivariate genetic model fitting revealed that common additive genetic effects comprised 12.8% of the phenotypic correlation between insomnia and sleepiness (p < .01) and 10% of the phenotypic correlation between insomnia and obesity (p < .01). The phenotypic correlation between sleepiness and obesity was not due to common additive genetic effects.\nInsomnia, sleepiness, and obesity are under strong genetic influence. Common genetic effects were observed between insomnia and both sleepiness and obesity, suggesting shared genetic contributions to these phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the present study is to examine genetic and environmental influences on maternal and teacher ratings of Attention Problems (AP) in 7-year-old children. Teachers completed the Teacher Report Form (N=2259 pairs), and mothers the Child Behavior Checklist (N=2057 pairs). Higher correlations were found in twins rated by the same teacher than in twins rated by different teachers. This can be explained by rater bias or by a greater environmental sharing in twins, who are in the same classroom. We further found that 41% of the variation in maternal and teacher ratings is explained by a common factor. The heritability of this common factor is 78%. The heritabilities of the rater specific factors of mothers and teachers are 76% and 39%, respectively. Because Attention Problems that are persistent over situations may indicate more serious behavior problems than context dependent Attention Problems, we believe that gene finding strategies should focus on this common phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The super-sensitivity of the neurohormone melatonin to light in patients with bipolar disorder provides evidence of the circadian nature of the disorder. This response has been proposed as an endophenotype for identifying people at risk of the disorder and guiding investigations of molecular genetic targets. However, before this response is used as an endophenotypic marker, the heritable nature of melatonin sensitivity in the normal population must be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the heritability of nocturnal melatonin secretion and sensitivity to light in monozygotic and dizygotic twins with no psychiatric history. This study investigated overall melatonin levels (between 2000 and 2400 h) and suppression by 500 lx of light (between 2400 and 0100 h) in 20 pairs of twins (nine monozygotic, 11 dizygotic). The results indicate that melatonin secretion is highly heritable with secretion in one twin being a significant predictor of secretion in their twin in both monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. In relation to light sensitivity, genetic loading appears to play a significant role with the greatest concordance between monozygotic twins, followed by dizygotic twins and finally low concordance in unrelated individuals. This provides additional support for the usefulness of melatonin sensitivity to light as a potential endophenotypic marker of bipolar affective disorder.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to compare uterine contraction frequency in twins versus singletons and to determine if contraction frequency can be an efficient predictor of spontaneous preterm birth in twin gestations.\nFifty-nine twin and 306 singleton gestations were enrolled between 22 and 24 weeks at 11 centers. Contraction frequency was recorded with a home uterine activity monitor (HUAM) 2 or more times per day on 2 or more days per week until delivery or 36-6/7 weeks. Masked HUAM data were interpreted according to standard protocol. Repeated measures analyses were used to determine whether mean or maximum uterine contraction frequency per hour differed between singleton and twin gestations across gestational age, by time of day, and by delivery before 35 weeks or beyond. Uterine contraction frequency was also evaluated by logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves as tests to predict spontaneous preterm birth.\nThere were 34,908 hours of HUAM data recorded by the 306 singleton gestations and 5,427 hours by the 59 women with twins. Uterine contraction frequency was significantly greater in twins (P = .002) compared with singletons, regardless of gestational age. Contraction frequency in twins increased significantly with gestational age and time of day (1600-0359 hours); but was not associated with spontaneous preterm birth. Maximum uterine contraction frequency was associated with preterm birth less than 35 weeks but only in the morning (am) recording (0400-1559) and at the 29- to 30-week gestational age interval. This relationship was modest (odds ratio 1-2) and not consistent across gestational age or between the am and afternoon/evening (pm) monitoring sessions. ROC analysis revealed no contraction frequency that efficiently identified twins who delivered prematurely at any 2-week gestational age interval.\nMean uterine contraction frequency was significantly higher for twin gestations than singletons throughout the latter half of pregnancy and between 1600 and 0359 hours but was not higher among twins who delivered less than 35 weeks' gestation. Neither maximum am or pm contraction frequency predicted spontaneous preterm birth less than 35 weeks' gestation in twin pregnancies.",

Contraction frequency in twins increased significantly with gestational age and time of day (1600-0359 hours); but was not associated with spontaneous preterm birth. Maximum uterine contraction frequency was associated with preterm birth less than 35 weeks but only in the morning (am) recording (0400-1559) and at the 29- to 30-week gestational age interval. This relationship was modest (odds ratio 1-2) and not consistent across gestational age or between the am and afternoon/evening (pm) monitoring sessions. ROC analysis revealed no contraction frequency that efficiently identified twins who delivered prematurely at any 2-week gestational age interval.",

    "abstract": "Girls who grow up in households with an unrelated adult male reach menarche earlier than peers, a finding hypothesized to be an evolutionary strategy for families under stress. The authors tested the alternative hypothesis that nonrandom selection into stepfathering due to shared environmental and/or genetic predispositions creates a spurious relation between stepfathering and early menarche. Using the unique controls for genetic and shared environmental experiences offered by the children-of-twins design, the authors found that cousins discordant for stepfathering did not differ in age of menarche. Moreover, controlling for mother's age of menarche eliminated differences in menarcheal age associated with stepfathering in unrelated girls. These findings strongly suggest selection, and not causation, accounts for the relationship between stepfathering and early menarche.",

Wave 1 took place in 1994 when the twins were 8 years old and wave 2 in 1999 when the children were 13 years old. In wave 1 and 2 the parents completed questionnaires regarding ADHD-symptoms about their children. In wave 2 the twins completed a questionnaire about self-esteem and Youth Self Report (YSR).

In the cotwin control method controlling for YSR internalizing problem, paired comparisons within the twin pairs revealed that a high score of ADHD-symptoms at age 8 was related to significantly lower scores at age 13 in the self-esteem.\nThe long-term relationships between ADHD-symptoms and a low self-esteem in a population-based sample were confirmed by the co-twin analyses.",

Forty-nine sets of twins were enrolled in the study and 41 sets were ultimately analyzed. There were 21 twin sets (42 infants) in the experimental group and 20 sets (40 infants) in the control group.\nA prospective randomized design was used.\nParents of twins in a level III NICU were approached for consent to participate in the study. Twins were randomized using sealed envelopes that designated placement in either the control or experimental group. Twin sets who were randomized to the control group received routine care in separate beds. Twin sets in the experimental group received routine care in the same bed. Guidelines for positioning of cobedded twins were utilized. Treatment and data collection started when infants met the inclusion criteria for the study.\nMeasurements of weekly weight gain and episodes of apnea/bradycardia/desaturation (A/B/D) were collected for each group.\nAfter adjusting for baseline weight in an analysis of covariance model, the cobedded group demonstrated a significantly higher mean weight compared to the control group at week 1 (1,644 vs. 1,572 grams, respectively, F = 11.6, P = 0.001) and at week 2 (1,755 vs. 1,693 grams, respectively, F = 5.7, P = 0.02). There was no difference in the median number of total combined A/B/D episodes between the 2 groups.\nA greater increase in mean weight gain was noted in the cobedded group compared to the control group.",

    "abstract": "We examined whether there are genetic influences on nicotine withdrawal, and whether there are genetic factors specific to nicotine withdrawal, after controlling for factors responsible for risk of progression beyond experimentation with cigarettes and for quantity smoked (average number of cigarettes per day at peak lifetime use).\nEpidemiologic and genetic analyses were conducted using telephone diagnostic interview data from young adult Australian twins reporting any cigarette use (3026 women, 2553 men; mean age 30 years).\nGenetic analysis of the eight symptoms of DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal suggests heritability is intermediate for most symptoms (26-43%), and similar in men and women. The exceptions were depressed mood upon withdrawal, which had stronger additive genetic influences in men (53%) compared to women (29%), and decreased heart rate, which had low heritability (9%). Although prevalence rates were substantially lower for DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal syndrome (15.9%), which requires impairment, than for the DSM-IV nicotine dependence withdrawal criterion (43.6%), heritability was similar for both measures: as high as 47%. Genetic modeling of smoking more than 1 or 2 cigarettes lifetime ('progression'), quantity smoked and nicotine withdrawal found significant genetic overlap across all three components of nicotine use/dependence (genetic correlations = 0.53-0.76). Controlling for factors associated with risk of cigarette smoking beyond experimentation and quantity smoked, evidence for genetic influences specific to nicotine withdrawal (up to 23% of total variance) remained.\nOur results suggest that at least some individuals become 'hooked' or progress in the smoking habit, in part, because of a vulnerability to nicotine withdrawal.",

The exceptions were depressed mood upon withdrawal, which had stronger additive genetic influences in men (53%) compared to women (29%), and decreased heart rate, which had low heritability (9%). Although prevalence rates were substantially lower for DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal syndrome (15.9%), which requires impairment, than for the DSM-IV nicotine dependence withdrawal criterion (43.6%), heritability was similar for both measures: as high as 47%. Genetic modeling of smoking more than 1 or 2 cigarettes lifetime ('progression'), quantity smoked and nicotine withdrawal found significant genetic overlap across all three components of nicotine use/dependence (genetic correlations = 0.53-0.76). Controlling for factors associated with risk of cigarette smoking beyond experimentation and quantity smoked, evidence for genetic influences specific to nicotine withdrawal (up to 23% of total variance) remained.",

    "abstract": "Intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia remain significant causes of morbidity and mortality in preterm newborns.\nOur goal was to assess the familial and genetic susceptibility to intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\nMixed-effects logistic-regression and latent variable probit model analysis were used to assess the contribution of several covariates in a multicenter retrospective study of 450 twin pairs born at < or =32 weeks of gestation. To determine the genetic contribution, concordance rates in a subset of 252 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs were compared.\nThe study population had a mean gestational age of 29 weeks and birth weight of 1286 g. After controlling for effects of covariates, the twin data showed that 41.3%, 51.9%, and 65.2%, respectively, of the variances in liability for intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia could be accounted for by genetic and shared environmental factors. Among the 63 monozygotic twin pairs, the observed concordance for bronchopulmonary dysplasia was significantly higher than the expected concordance; 12 of 18 monozygotic twin pairs with > or =1 affected member had both members affected versus 3.69 expected. After controlling for covariates, genetic factors accounted for 53% of the variance in liability for bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\nTwin analyses show that intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia are familial in origin. These data demonstrate, for the first time, the significant genetic susceptibility for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in the etiology of normal cognitive functioning in aging remain largely unexplored. We conducted an investigation of genetic and environmental contributions to sex differences in level of cognitive performance and rate of decline in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) (Finkel & Pedersen, 2004) data set. Behavioral genetic parameterizations of a latent growth curve model were fit to longitudinal data on 11 cognitive measures. Seven hundred and ninety-eight non-demented individuals had cognitive data across four waves of measurement covering 13 years. Participants ranged in age from 44 to 88 at first testing wave; 60% were female. Results indicated sex differences in mean performance for five cognitive measures and in rates of decline for Information and Card Rotations. Only Synonyms demonstrated sex differences in genetic and environmental contributions to mean performance: heritability was higher in men than women. Despite differential longevity and susceptibility to disease, there are no consistent indications that men and women show different patterns of cognitive aging.",

    "abstract": "There is a dose-response positive relationship between type A behavior (TABP) and cardiovascular disease-related symptoms. Estimates of heritability for TABP from previous studies vary; this might be explained by limitations in the sizes and compositions of the samples.\nThis study combines a large sample size, twin and parental, data from males and females, two generations of young adults and older adults, and the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) and full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation. To assess TABP, the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS) was collected from MZ and DZ twins and their parents (n = 1670 twin families). Structural equation modeling is used to evaluate and estimate the effects of additive and nonadditive genetic effects, nonshared environmental effects, and competitive sibling interaction.\nForty-five percent of the variance in TABP was the result of genetic factors (28% were additive and 17% were nonadditive). The remaining 55% of the variance was explained by environmental factors not shared by the members of the same family. Competitive sibling interaction effects were not significant. There was no evidence of sex differences either in variances or means.\nUnderstanding the sources of variance on TABP is important for therapy and prevention. According to the present results, the relevant environmental factors for the development of TABP are not shared by the members of the same family. The genetic portion of the variance is also worth considering for therapeutic purposes. Although the genetic code cannot be altered, its effects on behavior may be modifiable through the treatment of the biological mediators.",

The stability of the CBCL-JBD phenotype is high, with correlations between .66 and .77 across ages 7, 10, and 12 years. Genetic factors account for the majority of the stability of this phenotype. There were no sex differences in genetic architecture.\nRoughly 80% of the stability in childhood CBCL-JBD is a result of additive genetic effects.",

Cognitive performance of 203 High-Risk and Low-Risk twins was compared.\nHealthy twins discordant for unipolar disorder showed lower performance on almost all measures of cognitive function: selective and sustained attention, executive function, language processing and working and declarative memory, and also after adjustment for demographic variables, subclinical symptoms and minor psychopathology. Healthy twins discordant for bipolar disorder showed lower performance on tests measuring episodic and working memory, also after adjustment for the above-mentioned covariables. The discrete cognitive impairment found seemed to be related to genetic liability, as the MZ High-Risk twins showed significant impairment on selective and sustained attention, executive function, language processing and working and declarative memory, whereas the DZ High-Risk twins presented with significantly lower scores only on language processing and episodic memory.\nThe hypothesis that discrete cognitive impairment is present before the onset of the affective disorder and is genetically transmitted was supported.

    "abstract": "Children of alcoholics are significantly more likely to experience high-risk environmental exposures, including prenatal substance exposure, and are more likely to exhibit externalizing problems [e.g. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]. While there is evidence that genetic influences and prenatal nicotine and/or alcohol exposure play separate roles in determining risk of ADHD, little has been done on determining the joint roles that genetic risk associated with maternal alcohol use disorder (AUD) and prenatal risk factors play in determining risk of ADHD.\nUsing a children-of-twins design, diagnostic telephone interview data from high-risk families (female monozygotic and dizygotic twins concordant or discordant for AUD as parents) and control families targeted from a large Australian twin cohort were analyzed using logistic regression models.\nOffspring of twins with a history of AUD, as well as offspring of non-AUD monozygotic twins whose co-twin had AUD, were significantly more likely to exhibit ADHD than offspring of controls. This pattern is consistent with a genetic explanation for the association between maternal AUD and increased offspring risk of ADHD. Adjustment for prenatal smoking, which remained significantly predictive, did not remove the significant genetic association between maternal AUD and offspring ADHD.\nWhile maternal smoking during pregnancy probably contributes to the association between maternal AUD and offspring ADHD risk, the evidence for a significant genetic correlation suggests: (i) pleiotropic genetic effects, with some genes that influence risk of AUD also influencing vulnerability to ADHD; or (ii) ADHD is a direct risk-factor for AUD.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are used extensively to decompose the variance of a trait, mainly to estimate the heritability of the trait. A second purpose of such studies is to estimate to what extent the non-genetic variance is shared or specific to individuals. To a lesser extent the twin studies have been used in bivariate or multivariate analysis to elucidate common genetic factors to two or more traits.\nIn the present study the variances of traits related to lipid metabolism is decomposed in a relatively large Danish twin population, including bivariate analysis to detect possible common genetic factors of the traits.\nThe heritabilities of apolipoprotein B and E, cholesterol, LDL, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) were significant in the general population, although gender-specific levels and significance were detected. Heritabilities of apolipoprotein A1, triglycerides, and very low density protein (VLDL) were only significant when the population was stratified according to gender.",

    "abstract": "Asplenia syndrome is one of the heterotaxy syndromes, which many familial and animal studies suggest are caused by the loss of adequate genetic control of normal left-right asymmetry development. Moreover, there has not been any environmental factor documented to cause these syndromes. Asplenia syndrome occurring in a pair of monozygotic twins is reported. In view of the negative family history, a new germline mutant gene might be the aetiology of our patients. Both twins are associated with some degree of discordant complex heart defects within the context of a high degree of \"mirror-image\" of the unpaired thoracoabdominal organs.\nThis report implies that sporadic asplenia syndrome might associate with new mutations and further genetic study may be indicated. These monozygotic twins' discordant phenotypes imply that some unidentified factors play an important role in their ultimate development of the same genetically determined abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Head injury is an inconsistently reported risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Many related variables might confound this association, such as differences in childhood and adolescent lifestyles or genetically determined risk-taking behaviors. Twin studies circumvent some of these problems, because twins are genetically and environmentally much more similar than typical cases and control subjects.\nWe conducted a case-control study in 93 twin pairs discordant for PD ascertained from the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council World War II Veteran Twins Cohort.\nA prior head injury with amnesia or loss of consciousness was associated with an increased risk for PD (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-11; p = 0.014). Truncating observations 10 years before PD onset enhanced the association. Though less precise, the association was somewhat stronger in monozygotic than in dizygotic pairs. Risk increased further with a subsequent head injury (p trend = 0.022) and with head injuries requiring hospitalization. Duration of unconsciousness was not associated. In a subanalysis of 18 pairs concordant for PD, the twin with younger onset PD was more likely to have sustained a head injury, although numbers were small.\nOur results suggest that mild-to-moderate closed head injury may increase PD risk decades later.",

In the present study, we reanalyze DSM-III-R diagnostic data on middle-aged male twin pairs from the VETR study using latent class methods. We identify four subtypes based on 15 diagnostic categories. We then show that these subtypes are strongly associated with differential rates of transitions in drug use histories, with increased risks in relatives for depression, alcohol, drug and ASPD, as well as with a variety of non-normative and deviant behaviors in youth and in adulthood. We use the result of these analyses to show how the use of a particular drug disorder phenotype for selecting cases could impact final sample composition.",

    "abstract": "Non-random mating affects population variation for substance use and dependence. Developmentally, mate selection leading to positive spousal correlations for genetic similarity may result in increased risk for substance use and misuse in offspring. Mate selection varies by cohort and thus, assortative mating in one generation may produce marked changes in rates of substance use in the next. We aim to clarify the mechanisms contributing to spousal similarity for cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption.\nUsing data from female twins and their male spouses, we fit univariate and bivariate twin models to examine the contribution of primary assortative mating and reciprocal marital interaction to spousal resemblance for regular cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence, and for regular alcohol use and alcohol dependence.\nWe found that assortative mating significantly influenced regular smoking, regular alcohol use, nicotine dependence and alcohol dependence. The bivariate models for cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption also highlighted the importance of primary assortative mating on all stages of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, with additional evidence for assortative mating across the two stages of alcohol consumption.\nWomen who regularly used, and subsequently were dependent on cigarettes or alcohol were more likely to marry men with similar behaviors. After mate selection had occurred, one partner's cigarette or alcohol involvement did not significantly modify the other partner's involvement with these psychoactive substances.",

    "abstract": "The autism spectrum encompasses a set of complex multigenic developmental disorders that severely impact the development of language, non-verbal communication, and social skills, and are associated with odd, stereotyped, repetitive behavior and restricted interests. To date, diagnosis of these neurologically based disorders relies predominantly upon behavioral observations often prompted by delayed speech or aberrant behavior, and there are no known genes that can serve as definitive biomarkers for the disorders.\nHere we demonstrate, for the first time, that lymphoblastoid cell lines from monozygotic twins discordant with respect to severity of autism and/or language impairment exhibit differential gene expression patterns on DNA microarrays. Furthermore, we show that genes important to the development, structure, and/or function of the nervous system are among the most differentially expressed genes, and that many of these genes map closely in silico to chromosomal regions containing previously reported autism candidate genes or quantitative trait loci.\nOur results provide evidence that novel candidate genes for autism may be differentially expressed in lymphoid cell lines from individuals with autism spectrum disorders. This finding further suggests the possibility of developing a molecular screen for autism based on expressed biomarkers in peripheral blood lymphocytes, an easily accessible tissue. In addition, gene networks are identified that may play a role in the pathophysiology of autism.",

    "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that not only genetic but also environmental factors contribute to the onset of schizophrenia. We therefore conducted psychophysiological studies on a pair of identical twins discordant for schizophrenia, to differentiate non-genetic from genetic indexes possibly associated with this disease. The affected and unaffected twins were 28 year-old females. The affected twin was diagnosed as having schizophrenia based on the Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition revised (DMS-III-R), whereas the unaffected twin had no psychiatric disorders. The brain potentials evoked by visual stimulation (visual event-related potential [visual ERP]) were recorded. The components of the visual ERP, which are believed to reflect pattern cognition, semantic processing and the failure to use preceding word information, were compared with normal subjects. Both twins showed abnormal semantic processing and similar failure to use preceding word information. Abnormality of semantic processing was marked in the affected twin. These results indicate that failure to use preceding word information might reflect only genetic factors, whereas abnormal semantic processing might reflect both genetic and non-genetic factors because the affected twin was considered to show accelerated deterioration after the disease onset. However, only the affected twin showed abnormal pattern cognition, which might be attributable to non-genetic factors such as an acquired vulnerability to schizophrenia. We suggest that the impairment of pattern cognition evaluated by visual ERP may be a critical index for the onset of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of our previously published and prospectively validated institution-specific singleton transcerebellar diameter (TCD) nomogram in the prediction of gestational age (GA) in twin pregnancies. We further evaluated whether the prediction of GA in twin gestations using the singleton TCD nomogram differs between monochorionic and dichorionic twins.\nIn our previously published studies, we retrospectively constructed a cross-sectional nomogram using TCD measurements in 24,026 well-dated, singleton fetuses, and prospectively validated the nomogram using 2,597 singleton fetuses. The current study comprised of 1,278 well-dated twins (19.6% monochorionic) seen in our ultrasound unit between August 1994 and May 2003, and the singleton TCD nomogram was validated in these twin gestations. The actual GA was subtracted from the GA predicted by the TCD nomogram and the concordance between actual and predicted GAs was assessed on the basis of the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). This was performed separately for monochorionic and dichorionic twins.\nConcordance between the actual and predicted twin TCD measurements based on our previously published singleton TCD nomogram was high (Pearson's correlation, r = 0.95, P < .0001). Between 16 and 23 weeks' gestation, the predicted mean GA was within 6 days of actual GA. Between 24 and 30 weeks, the predicted mean GA was within 3 days, and at 32 weeks or more, the predicted mean GA was within 5 days of the actual GA. Prediction of GA based on the singleton TCD nomogram was equally accurate in both monochorionic and dichorionic twin gestations (P = .686).\nThis study demonstrates that our previously validated singleton TCD nomogram is reliable and accurate in twins irrespective of placental chorionicity.",

The serum anti-PRP antibody concentration of 43 monozygotic (MZ) and 147 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs in the Gambia was measured using a standardised Hib ELISA. Intrapair correlations for MZ and DZ twin pairs were compared and heritability in antibody responses to Hib conjugate vaccine was estimated to be 51% (95% CI: 32-66%), indicating a significant genetic contribution in the response. We conclude that genetic factors may be involved in the variation in immune response to Hib vaccine observed in different populations and may contribute to cases of vaccine failure.",

    "abstract": "Lower urinary tract symptoms, which are common in older men, are thought to be determined genetically and by modifiable environmental risk factors. We examined the contribution of these 2 etiologic components in a cohort of U.S. twins.\nIn 1998, a questionnaire that assessed lower urinary tract symptoms, weight, height, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and physical activity was sent out to members of the National Academy of Science-National Research Council Twins Registry. We analyzed 1,723 complete twin pairs with information on lower urinary tract symptoms and zygosity and who did not have a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer. We calculated concordance rates of categories of the International Prostate Symptom Score in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. Generalized estimating equations were used to calculate the odds ratio of having high-moderate/severe lower urinary tract symptoms.\nConcordance rates were higher in MZ than in DZ twins with concordance rate ratios of 2.2 and 6.9 depending on the specificity of definition of symptoms. Genetic factors contributed 72% to the risk of high-moderate/severe lower urinary tract symptoms. Taking into account correlated individuals, we observed high odds of lower urinary tract symptoms in obese men compared with lean men (odds ratio = 1.91; 95% confidence interval = 1.16-3.15 comparing first versus fourth quartile). Cigarette smoking was not associated with lower urinary tract symptoms, but alcohol consumption was positively associated. Men who were more physically active tended to have lower odds of lower urinary tract symptoms compared with less active men (0.62; 0.36-1.08).\nThe findings indicate a strong genetic component of lower urinary tract symptoms, but also support previous studies that modifiable environmental risk factors are associated with this condition.",

    "abstract": "Twin birth weight discordance is associated with poor perinatal outcome. Three cases of severe discordant twins were serially assessed by ultrasound biometry and the Doppler ultrasonography of both the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA) to measure pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), and the systolic and diastolic ratio (S/D ratio). The birth weight discrepancies in three cases are 38%, 69% and 68%, respectively. Doppler velocimetry revealed a discrepancy in the S/D ratio of MCA and UA more than 15%. Absent end-diastolic flow, or the brain sparing effect, was noted in three small twins. Cerebral-umbilical S/D ratio (CUR) (MCA/UA) of the twins was above 1 in large ones and below 1 in small ones. The small twin in case 3 expired after delivery. In conclusion, if the CUR of the S/D ratio of the fetus is below 1, the prognosis might be poor and fetal weight discordancy might be progressively larger.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative measurements of urinary parameters are valuable clinical tools for predicting the risk of nephrolithiasis. To our knowledge no previous studies have evaluated the heritability of urinary stone risk in identical twins. Because these individuals share identical genetics, the R defined by their phenotypic data are theoretically equal to the entire population H2.\nA total of 12 sets of healthy homozygous twins, including 4 males and 8 females for a total of 24 individuals, with a mean age of 25.9 years (range 21 to 36) volunteered for this study. All subjects provided informed written consent before assessment. Urinary stone risk profiles were done elsewhere on 2 consecutive days after 5 days of a standardized diet (170 mEq Na and 2500 kcal). Linear regression was performed on the data to determine R. Because identical twins were used, R was theoretically an estimate of H2.\nCertain urinary stone risk markers were highly heritable, including urinary calcium (94%), oxalate (94%), citrate (95%), uric acid (96%) and brushite supersaturation (90%), as determined by genotype (H2 90% or greater). Uric acid supersaturation (58%) and urinary sodium (64%) had low degrees of heritability.\nH2 is a measure of how much of the total variance in phenotype results from differences in genotype, as opposed to environmental differences. For example, an H2 of 95% for citrate suggests that genetic differences account for 95% of the variation in urinary citrate and environmental differences account for the remaining 5%. Therefore urinary calcium, oxalate and citrate are primarily determined by genotype, while environmental factors, particularly those that impact urine pH and urinary volume, may be increasingly important for determining uric acid supersaturation.",

    "abstract": "To analyse baby-feeding information needs and seeking described by Canadian women pregnant with twins.\nQualitative; data were collected by in-depth semi-structured interviews. Transcripts provided the data for discourse analysis of the use of two interpretative repertoires.\nOntario, Canada.\n19 women pregnant with twins.\nThe first interpretative repertoire represented caring for twins as fundamentally distinct from caring for singly born babies, and therefore emphasised the commonality of mothers of twins regardless of their background or situation. The second highlighted the uniqueness and individuality of each person. These repertoires intersect with discourses of baby feeding and good mothering, resulting in a complex discursive interplay of similarity and difference, commonality and individuality, information seeking, baby feeding and good mothering. Participants used the two interpretative repertoires to (1) frame information needs; (2) construct complex accounts of the biomedical, experiential and personalised authority of information sources; (3) describe the helpfulness of information sources independent of their authority; and (4) describe the barriers encountered in the finding appropriate sources of baby-feeding information in pregnancy.\nUnderstanding and respecting the discursive constructions of pregnancy and mothering can help practitioners understand the complex discursive interplay underlying participants' baby-feeding decisions, and may facilitate more sensitive support for women's individual needs and understandings.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies have had a key role in the evaluation of heritability, a population-based estimate of the genetic contribution to phenotypic variation. These studies have led to the revelation that most normal and disease phenotypes are to some extent heritable. Recently, interest has shifted from phenomenological heritability to the identification of trait-specific genes. The era of twin studies, however, is not over: recent epigenetic and global gene expression studies suggest that the most interesting findings in twin-based research are still to come. The increasing realization of the influence of epigenetics in phenotypic outcomes means that the molecular mechanisms behind phenotypic differences in genetically identical organisms can be explored. Analyses of epigenetic twin differences and similarities might yet challenge the fundamental principles of complex biology, primarily the dogma that complex phenotypes result from DNA sequence variants interacting with the environment.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of assisted reproduction has resulted in a growing number of multiple births. These infants and their parents experience increased, and sometimes unique, medical and psychological risks when compared to singletons. Rates of maternal morbidity, fetal and infant mortality are increased in multiple pregnancies. Twins have a death rate four times higher than singletons and this figure is six times higher for triplets. The main reason is preterm and very preterm birth in multiples, resulting in low and very low birth weight children. Perinatal mortality and morbidity are also more elevated in monozygotic (MZ) twins as compared to dizygotic (DZ) twins. In addition to an increased risk of mortality, multiples have higher rates of morbidity, specifically cerebral palsy and mental subnormality. Language and speech delays are more pronounced in multiples, as are cognitive delays, motor development, behavioural problems and difficulties in parent-child interactions. Depression among parents of multiples is reported to be higher than those of singletons. This paper aims to critically appraise the literature regarding the aforementioned topics, including a comparison between the outcomes for iatrogenic and spontaneously conceived twins and to suggest areas for further research.",

    "abstract": "Selective mutism is a rare social anxiety disorder characterized by a total lack of speech in certain specific situations despite the ability to speak in others. Both genetic and psychosocial factors are thought to be involved in its presentation, persistence, and response to treatment. This case report describes a case of young female monozygotic twins who presented with selective mutism and their treatment spanning a 2-year period. It highlights the strong genetic association along with environmental factors such as social isolation and consequences of maternal social phobia, all contributing to treatment resistance, despite an intensive multimodal biopsychosocial approach. General issues related to the difficulties in treating monozygotic twins are also addressed.",

    "abstract": "The susceptibility to develop hay fever is putatively the result both of genetic and environmental causes. We estimated the significance and magnitude of genetic and environmental contributions to hay fever among young adult twins.\nFrom the birth cohorts 1953-82 of The Danish Twin Registry 11,750 twin pairs were identified through a nationwide questionnaire survey. Subjects were regarded hay fever cases when responding affirmatively to the question 'Do you have, or have you ever had hay fever?' Latent factor models of genetic and environmental effects were fitted to the observed data using maximum likelihood methods.\nThe overall cumulative prevalence of hay fever was 12.6%. Identical twins were significantly more likely to be concordant for hay fever than were fraternal twins (P<0.001). Additive genetic effects accounted for 71% and non-shared environmental effects accounted for 29% of the individual susceptibility to hay fever. The same genes contributed to the susceptibility to hay fever both in males and in females. In families with asthma, the susceptibility to develop hay fever was, in addition to genes, to a great extent ascribable to family environment, whereas the aetiology of 'sporadic' hay fever was mainly genetic.\nThe susceptibility to develop hay fever is attributable to major genetic influences. However, effects of family environment and upbringing are also of importance in families where asthma is present. These results indicate that different sub-forms of hay fever may have different aetiologies.",

    "abstract": "Prior population-based twin studies from two Anglophonic countries with relatively high rates of drug use - the USA and Australia - suggest that genetic factors contribute substantially to individual differences in the use, abuse and dependence of illicit psychoactive substances. Would these results replicate in Norway, a Nordic country with a low prevalence of illicit drug use?\nLifetime use, abuse and dependence of five illicit drug categories (cannabis, stimulants, opiates, cocaine and psychedelics) were assessed at personal interview in 1386 complete young adult twin pairs ascertained from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health Twin Panel. Twin model fitting was performed using the Mx statistical package on three phenotypes: any lifetime use, endorsement of at least one DSM-IV symptom of abuse or dependence, and meeting DSM-IV criteria for abuse or dependence.\nSignificant lifetime use of illicit substances (defined as use 10 or more times) was reported by only 6.4% of the sample. Meaningful analyses were possible for use of any substance and each of the five substances individually, but for symptoms or a diagnosis of abuse/dependence meaningful analyses were possible only for any substance and cannabis. Full twin models uniformly found twin resemblance to be due largely or entirely to genetic factors. Best-fit models for all analyses included only genetic and individual-specific environmental effects with heritability estimates ranging from 58% to 81%.\nIn accord with prior results from the USA and Australia, genetic factors appear to play an important role in the etiology of use and abuse/dependence of illicit drugs in Norway.",

    "abstract": "Authors present the long-term development of two monozygotic twin sisters. One of them was detected by newborn screening as athyreotic (gemelus A) and healthy gemelus B sister. Therapy in athyreotic girl started at 4 weeks after birth and was monitored in order to maintain serum thyroxine and TSH in normal range. Both sisters spent their chilhood and adolescence together in the same family, school and work together as tailors in the same factory. Their development was very similar. In order to detect subclinical difference of their development, the school achievements were tested using their school certificates. Studies were divided to testing mechanical memory, logical thinking and skills. The evaluation of all classes of school attendance (13 years) reveals subtle differences - deficit of patient at approximately 6-15% level, mainly in studies demanding skills. However, dynamic evaluation after years reveals that the worse results of the patient (gemelus A) occurred during the first years of basic school whereas during adolescence having attended the special school tailor, she attained better results than her healthy sister. It seems that mental deficit in early treated hypothyroid patient is not severe and varies even during the life. Problem of the fetal hypothyroidism is probably more related to the iodine deficiency, which assures necessity of thyroid hormones for athyreotic child from mother's or twin's normally supplemented thyroid glands.",

This pathology starts in the second trimester and has a chronic course. Acute per-partum feto-fetal transfusion seems to be less frequent and has not been studied. In the study, we described two cases of acute per-partum feto-fetal transfusion. The outcomes of the pregnancies were as follows: following a successful delivery, the first set of twins presented hypovolemic shock at birth due to an acute anemia. The second set of twins was polyglobulic, but otherwise healthy at birth. The risk of hypovolemic shock seems to be unpredictable, even if the pregnancy is monitored. Obstetricians and pediatricians must keep this pathology in mind when dealing with this kind of pregnancy. Moreover, it would be interesting to obtain systematically a full blood count of each set of twins of monochorionic pregnancies, in order to detect every case of feto-oetal transfusion.",

    "abstract": "As opposed to biochemical markers of Down syndrome, nuchal translucency (NT) was once thought to be a more reliable screening marker for high order multiple pregnancies and pregnancies conceived after assisted conception. Recent data suggested that NT in singleton fetuses from assisted reproduction technology (ART) was thicker than those from singleton pregnancies. The present study compared the thickness of NT in dichorionic twins from natural conception and assisted reproduction.\nA retrospective analysis for comparison of NT thickness on 3319 spontaneous singletons, 19 pairs of spontaneous twins and 27 pairs of assisted reproduction twins was performed.\nThe median NT multiple of median (MoM) of spontaneous singletons was 1.00. For twins, the median NT MoM for pregnancies after assisted reproduction and natural conception were 1.02 and 1.07 respectively. There was no statistical difference in the NT thickness among the three pregnancy groups.\nContrary to the observed increase in NT in singleton pregnancies from assisted reproduction, the NT in dichorionic twins was comparable to the spontaneous ones. The mode of conception appears to impose differential influence on singletons and twins.",

    "abstract": "The tryptophan to arginine change in position 64 (Trp64Arg) polymorphism of the beta3-adrenergic receptor (beta3AR) gene has been associated with an increased prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In this, decreased rates of energy expenditure and impaired insulin secretion could play a role.\nIn 10 male twin pairs discordant for the Trp64Arg polymorphism, we examined insulin response to glucose by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT), body composition by the bioimpedance method, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning and energy expenditure by indirect and direct calorimetry.\nTwins heterozygous for the Trp64Arg polymorphism showed significantly lower fat mass independent of the method used, and significantly lower fasting insulin and glucose concentrations compared with their homozygous wild-type co-twins. Correspondingly, insulin resistance and insulin secretion determined by homeostasis model assessment were significantly lower in twins carrying the Trp64Arg polymorphism. However, there were no significant differences in adiponectin levels, insulinogenic index assessed by OGTT, or insulin sensitivity, acute insulin response to glucose, glucose effectiveness or insulin disposition index assessed by minimal modelling of the FSIGT. Furthermore, there were no differences in sleeping, resting or post-prandial energy expenditure.\nIn male twins with a high similarity in genetic and environmental background, the Trp64Arg polymorphism of the beta3AR gene is associated with lower fat mass, fasting insulin levels and an appropriate insulin response to glucose. Thus, heterozygosity for the Trp64Arg variant is unlikely to increase the risk of obesity, insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the hypothesis that low birth weight is associated with changes in regional lipid deposition as well as insulin sensitivity in adult twins. Eleven adult female twin pairs were studied by magnetic resonance to determine regional adiposity. Their insulin sensitivity was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment. There were significant associations between birth weight and current homeostasis model assessment value (r=-0.528, P=.012), abdominal visceral (r=-0.581, P=.005), and subcutaneous fat volumes (r=-0.638, P=.001) if the group of 22 subjects were analyzed as individuals. There were no significant associations of the intratwin pair difference in birth weight and differences between adult twins in these same variables possibly because of limited patient numbers. Reduced birth weight does confer an increased risk of abdominal adiposity as well as insulin resistance in twin populations as it does in the general population.",

In this analysis, the findings of the epidemiologic studies were translated from odds ratio into the number of cesarean deliveries that would be required to prevent an adverse outcome for the second twin.\nFor gestations of > or = 36 weeks, 97 cesarean deliveries would need to be performed to prevent a single serious morbidity or mortality in a second twin.

In this paper the imaging of conjoined twins both antenatally and postnatally is reviewed, in particular taking into consideration recent advances with multidetector CT. Accurate counselling of parents regarding the likely outcome of the pregnancy and the likelihood of successful separation is dependent on good prenatal imaging with ultrasound and MRI. Planning of postnatal surgical separation is aided by accurate preoperative imaging which, depending on the conjoined area, will encompass many imaging modalities, but often relies heavily on CT scanning.",

    "abstract": "Kangaroo Care has been shown to keep a singleton preterm infant warm by body heat generated in maternal breasts that is conducted to the infant. No studies have examined whether twins simultaneously receiving Kangaroo Care, called Shared Kangaroo Care, are sufficiently warm and how the breasts respond to twin presence. Two case studies were done to determine the temperatures of twins being simultaneously kangarooed and the temperatures of maternal breasts during Shared Kangaroo Care. Two sets of premature twins were held in Shared Kangaroo Care for 1.5 hours. Infant temperatures were recorded from incubators; breast temperatures were recorded from thermistors. Infant temperatures remained warm and increased during Kangaroo Care, and each breast appeared to respond to the thermal needs of the infant on that breast. Physiological explanations for thermal synchrony exist. These data suggest that twins can be simultaneously held in Kangaroo Care without thermal compromise because each breast responds individually to the infant's thermal needs.",

    "abstract": "In 1:50 000 to 1:100 000 births, conjoined twins occur, caused by incomplete division of the embryonic disc more than 13 days after fertilisation. We present a case of cephalothoracopagus janiceps, a very rare form of conjoined twins, which was diagnosed at 13 weeks of gestation. Three-dimensional and colour Doppler ultrasound enabled precise prenatal visualisation of the fusion of the foetal head and chest up to the umbilicus. We could demonstrate the presence of two foetal hearts connected by an arterio-arterial shunt as well as two pairs of upper and lower extremities. After the clear 3-D presentation of the anomaly, making the poor prognosis visible, the mother decided to have the pregnancy terminated. Autopsy confirmed the prenatal diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to determine the rates of breastfeeding among singletons, twins and triplets in Japan, and identify factors associated with the decision to breastfeed or bottle-feed. We analyzed a database of medical check-up of infants aged 3 to 6 months between April 2001 and July 2004 in Nishinomiya City in Japan. This medical check-up is given to almost 100% of infants in Japan and the data of 15,262 infants were analyzed. Among these, 14,963 (98.0%) were singletons, 290 (1.9%) were twins and 9 (0.1%) were triplets. Exclusive breast-feeding was chosen by 6680 (43.8%) mothers, mixed-feeding by 4645 (30.4%) mothers, and bottle-feeding with formula milk only by 3900 (25.6%) mothers. The rate of exclusive breastfeeding among twins or triplets was significantly lower than among singleton babies: 4.1% among twins or triplets, and 44.7% among singletons. Moreover, twins and triplets were independently associated with a higher rate of bottle-feeding: the odds ratio indicated that mothers who had twins or triplets were 2.44 times more likely to choose bottle-feeding with formula milk only than those who had singletons. Sucking ability at birth was associated with a higher rate of bottle-feeding: the odds ratio indicated that mothers who had infants with poor sucking ability at birth were 1.56 times more likely to choose bottle-feeding as those who had infants with normal sucking ability.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of birthweight discordance among twins, to determine the risk cut-off point for birthweight discordance, and to clarify whether perinatal deaths are aggravated by birthweight discordance or by low birthweight itself. A population-based analysis of all twins born between 1995 and 1999 in Japan was conducted using data collected from national birth, death and stillbirth certificates. Birthweight discordance was determined as: higher birthweight minus lower birthweight divided by higher birthweight multiplied by 100. Among twins with a birthweight discordance of more than 15%, the fetal and perinatal mortality rate was higher than that of twins with a discordance of less than 15%. Ninety per cent of the relative cumulative frequency of twin live-births were within 25% of the birthweight discordance. Logistic regression analysis showed that the stillbirth of at least one of the twins is associated with the birthweight of the larger twin and birthweight discordance. It also showed that the stillbirth of both twins in the twin pair is associated with the birth-weight of larger twins and the gestational weeks. It was clarified that birthweight discordance was associated with the stillbirth of only one twin in the twin pair, and the stillbirth of both twins in the twin pair was associated with low birthweight itself.",

    "abstract": "Chorion type is an important variable that can affect the prenatal environment of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs, leading to differences in growth and development. In particular, vascular anastomoses between monochorionic (MC) MZ twin pairs can lead to an imbalance in nutrition between co-twins. One objective of this study was to determine whether maternal reports, hospital records or birthweight discordances found in MZ co-twins provide reliable indications of monochorionicity. The other objective was to test the hypotheses that in MZ twin pairs of known chorion type, MC twin pairs would show greater birthweight differences and greater within-pair variability in permanent tooth size than dichorionic (DC) twin pairs, reflecting greater differences in intrauterine environment between MC MZ pairs. Birthweights and tooth size data were recorded for 170 pairs of MZ Australian twins enrolled in an ongoing study of dentofacial growth and development. Chorion type based on maternal reports was compared with that based on hospital records for a subsample of 68 pairs of these MZ twins. Maternal reports were found to be unreliable for determining chorion type and hospital records often did not provide enough information to be certain about chorionicity. For 27 twin pairs with confirmed chorion type, associations were tested between birthweight discordances in MZ twin pairs and chorion type, and also between intrapair variances for tooth size and chorion type. A significant association was noted between birthweight discordance and chorion type (p < .05), with greater discordances occurring more often in MC twin pairs. Although significant heterogeneity of intrapair variances for tooth size was found in only 5 of 48 comparisons, intrapair variances for crown dimensions were greater significantly more often in MC pairs than DC pairs (p < .05). Our findings indicated that neither maternal reports nor often hospital records can be relied upon for information on chorion type. However, when analyses were performed on data for MZ twin pairs of known chorion type, we found evidence of a significant association between intrapair birthweight differences and chorion type and also between intrapair variances of dental crown measurements and chorion type. Consistent with our hypotheses, large birthweight discordances were found to occur more often in MC twin pairs than DC twin pairs, and intrapair variances for tooth size in MC twin pairs exceeded those in DC twin pairs more often than expected due to chance.",

We analyzed these variables among 199 women who delivered a registerable twin birth compared with 1773 women who delivered a naturally conceived twin birth in a population-based obstetric cohort drawn from around Oxford, England. Treatment was restricted to conceptions involving simple ovulation induction only. Treated mothers were of significantly higher social class and older, more likely to deliver girls and to be delivered by cesarean section, and significantly less likely to be smokers at the time of antenatal booking and to have delivered previous pregnancies. Pregnancy outcome was similar between the two groups for most measures, with the exception of birthweight which was lower in treated twins, though not significantly so. Overall the results are reassuring with respect to outcome in twin pregnancies following simple ovulation induction.",

A Japanese version of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA) was administered in 24 twin pairs (aged 3 to 4 years) at their own homes. The overall language abilities of the twins were in the normal range (based on ITPA normative data: mean scale score 36.0 +/- 6.0 points), and for the ITPA subtests only, Auditory Reception fell within the range of language disorder (mean scale score 24.9 +/- 5.1 points). The findings suggest that in 3- to 4-year-old Japanese twins, overall language abilities are not delayed. However, there may be specific difficulties with auditory reception skills.",

The twins themselves responded to 8 questionnaire items, 4 items on twin similarity, and 4 items on the frequency of mistaking one twin for another by parents, relatives, teachers and strangers when they were 6 to 13 years old. Research assistants responded to 20 items regarding twins' physical features at the moment of interview. A parsimonious model established using stepwise logistic regression analysis of the 28 items showed that the total accuracy of zygosity diagnosis was 90.1%. The accuracy was 89.2% when using only the items dealing with the confusion of twins and 85.4% using only similarity. In the questionnaire, 'facial appearance', 'mistaken by teachers' and 'mistaken by strangers' had stronger discriminating power between MZ and DZ twins. Two physical features--'eyelid' and 'middigital hair'--were informative to some extent. There was no statistically significant sex and area difference in the validity of such questionnaire and physical features comparison-based classification. In conclusion, questionnaire-based zygosity assessment in this Chinese adult twin sample could still be regarded as a valid and valuable classification method. Physical features comparison, however, could only provide limited information for zygosity determination.",

    "abstract": "The temporal variation in the stillbirth rates (SBR), measured as the number of stillborn per 1000 total births, among singletons, twins and triplets was studied on Swedish birth data for the period 1869 to 2001 and comparisons with data from other populations were made. Among both single and multiple births there were marked, almost monotonously decreasing trends in the stillbirth rates. Among singletons the stillbirth rate decreased from 29.5 per 1000 in the period 1869 to 1878 to 3.4 in the period 1991 to 2001. Among twins the stillbirth rate decreased from 94 per 1000 in 1869 to 1878 to a minimum of 8.2 in 1991 to 2001 and among triplets from 166 per 1000 to a minimum of 19.8. The relative declining pattern in the SBRs was almost the same, being 88% among singletons, 91% among twins and 88% among triplets. In the 1980s and 1990s the definition of the stillbirth rate was changed in many countries, including Finland, but no changes in the definition of stillbirths have been made in Sweden. The effect of the artificial reproduction techniques, including in vitro fertilization, on the rates of multiple maternities is also discussed. It was noted especially that they had a more marked effect on the triplet than on the twinning rate.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed depressive and psychosomatic symptoms in relation to parental preference in 419 twins at the age of 22 to 30 years. Depressiveness was elicited with Children's Depression Inventory and reported as a total score and three subscales (low self-confidence, anhedonia and sadness) based on factor analysis as reported in a previous epidemiological study conducted in Finland. Items assessing nervous complaints and somatic symptoms were adapted from Finnish studies of juvenile health habits. Twins reported the preference in two directions: experienced parental preference towards either twin, and twin's own preference towards either parent. About half of the twins were from pairs where both twins experienced having been equally close to both parents, while about 30% were from 'equal and mother's' pair, where one twin evaluated having been preferred by the mother and the co-twin evaluated having been equally close to both parents. According to the twins' own preference, about one third of the twin pairs were 'both equal', one third 'both mother's' and one third 'equal and mother's'. Those male twins who were equally close to both parents (experienced parental preference) had least total depressiveness, while females in the intermediate situation had the highest self-confidence and least anhedonia and nervousness. According to twins' own preference, twins who felt equally close to both parents had the least depressiveness and anhedonia. The intermediate position seems to be the best alternative, as these twins had the least symptoms.",

The purpose of the present study was to compare self-concept in twins and singletons matched in parental level of education. The 6 cluster scales of the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (P-H) were administered to 630 singleton children and 635 twins aged 7 to 12 years. Model-fitting analyses yielded two conclusions. First, self-concept was generally similar between first- and second-born twins and between monozygotic and dizygotic twins across the 6 cluster scales of the P-H. Second, twins consistently exceeded singletons for all 6 cluster scales of the P-H. However, the effect sizes of differences between twins and singletons were small except for one scale, Physical Appearance and Attributes.",

    "abstract": "In Australian twins participating in three different studies (1979-1996), the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to variation in resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was studied. The sample consisted of 368 monozygotic and 335 dizygotic twin pairs with measurements for both individuals. Blood pressure measurements in two studies were available for 115 complete twin pairs, and 49 twin pairs had measurements in three studies. This allowed assessment of blood pressure tracking over an average period of 12 years in the age range of 23 to 45 years. Multivariate analyses showed significant heritability (h2) of blood pressure in all studies (SBP h2 = 19%-56%, DBP h2 = 37%-52%). In addition, the analyses showed that the blood pressure tracking was explained by the same set of genetic factors. These results replicate an earlier finding in Dutch twins that also showed stability of the contribution of genetic factors to blood pressure tracking.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the influence of twin status (monozygotic [MZ], dizygotic same-sex [DZss] and dizygotic opposite-sex [DZos]) on friendship patterns. It examined the friendships of 60 children from 30 twin pairs, mean age 8 years, 4 months. The study sought to establish how number of friendships and degree to which these are shared vary according to twin status. Additionally, it sought to assess the children's meaning of shared friendship and to examine whether there were group differences according to twin status. Results indicated that, while number of friends did not vary, the degree to which friendships were shared was significantly associated with twin status. MZ children shared approximately 50% of their friends, DZss 25% and DZos 5%. Group patterns emerged from interviews with the children concerning shared friendships. MZ twins were characteristically positive or accepting about shared friends; DZos pairs shared fewer friends and were, therefore, less challenged by the twin situation in negotiating friendships; and DZss pairs were more diverse in their reaction with some expressing ambivalent or negative views about the twin situation and sharing of friendship. The results are presented in the light of their implications for twin children's developmental and scholastic progress.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral problems in young children can be assessed by asking their parents or teachers to rate their behaviors. Genetic analyses of parental ratings show relatively large heritabilities for emotional and behavioral problems in young children, but data from teachers for this age group are scarce. Sources of variation in the Teacher's Report Form (TRF) problem scales were examined. The TRF was completed for 211 Dutch 5-year-old twin pairs and 4 single twins. Twins rated by different teachers had higher means and variances than twins rated by the same teacher, in addition twin correlations were lower in this group. In both groups monozygotic (MZ) correlations were generally higher than dizygotic (DZ) correlations. A model for twin resemblance was tested that allowed for these effects. For 5 problem scales (Withdrawn, Social Problems, Aggressive Behavior, Rule Breaking Behavior and Attention Problems) a model with genetic and unique environmental sources of variation fitted best to the data. For 3 problem scales (Anxious/Depressed, Thought Problems and Somatic Complaints) there were familial influences but it was not possible to distinguish between common environmental influences or genetic influences. Heritability was 63% for Attention problems, around 45% for Withdrawn, Social Problems, Aggressive Behavior and Rule Breaking Behavior, and around 30% for Anxious/Depressed, Thought Problems and Somatic Complaints.",

    "abstract": "This project sought to examine 2 competing hypotheses: first, that twins are likely to be more prosocial by virtue of growing up with another same-age peer in the home, or second, that they are less prosocial because they have become more comfortable interacting with a same-age peer who is both genetically and environmentally similar to themselves and therefore they are less comfortable with other children who are dissimilar. Two studies were conducted to compare twins to singletons on measures of prosocial and aggressive behaviors. In Study 1, 5-year-olds (N = 91 twins and N = 152 singletons) engaged in a peer play situation with an unfamiliar, same-age, same-sex peer, and they were rated on items assessing prosocial and aggressive behaviors. Results showed that twins were less prosocial but not more aggressive than were singletons. In Study 2, which was a supplemented follow-up study of twins in Study 1, 10- to 15-year-old twins (N = 98) and singletons (N = 84) were rated by their parents on prosocial and aggressive behaviors. No significant differences were found between the groups on prosocial behavior, but twins were rated as more aggressive than singletons. Thus, in early childhood twins appear to exhibit fewer prosocial behaviors with unfamiliar peers, but this prosocial deficit was not aligned with parent-reported prosocial behaviors in adolescence. In adolescence, twins were rated by parents as more aggressive. These studies suggest that twins may be at risk for poorer social interactions in early and middle childhood.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this prospective cohort study of twins and triplets was to evaluate perinatal and early childhood outcomes through 18 months of age. The study population included 141 twin pregnancies (282 twin children) and 8 triplet pregnancies (24 triplet children) recruited between May, 1996 and June, 2001. Mothers of triplets versus twins were significantly more likely to have infertility treatments, to be overweight or obese before conception, to be admitted antenatally, and to deliver by cesarean section. Length of gestation for triplets was significantly shorter (-2.31 weeks, p < .0001), and more likely to be less than 35 weeks (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 9.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.22-27.29). Average birthweight for triplets was significantly lighter (-495 grams, p < .0001), and more likely to be low birthweight (AOR 11.38, 95% CI 3.11-41.61). Triplets were also more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care (AOR 7.97, 95% CI 2.13-29.77), to require mechanical ventilation (AOR 5.67, 95% CI 2.05-15.65), to develop respiratory distress syndrome (AOR 12.50, 95% CI 3.89-40.20), or a major morbidity (retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, ventilator support, or grade III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage, AOR 5.67, 95% CI 2.05-15.65). Weight, length, and head circumference was significantly smaller at birth for triplets compared to twins, and these differences remained through 18 months of age, along with lower mental developmental scores at the oldest age. Compared to twins, triplets have greater neonatal morbidity, and through 18 months of age lower mental and motor scores, slower postnatal growth and more residual stunting, particularly of length and head circumference.",

    "abstract": "Both genetic and environmental factors affect smoking initiation and maintenance, but less is known about the genetic architecture of various other smoking-related behaviors. The aim of this study is to examine the genetic architecture of smoking behavior in a large twin cohort. Questionnaires with an extensive smoking history section were mailed to same-sex adult twins of the Finnish twin cohort. The final study population included 2923 monozygotic and 6018 dizygotic twin pairs aged 24 to 88 years. Two-stage bivariate genetic modeling of age at initiation with amount smoked (less than 20 cigarettes per day vs. 20 or more) and age at initiation with smoking cessation was done by using the Mx statistical package. For men the heritability estimate for age at initiation was .59 (95% confidence interval [CI] .49-.69), for amount smoked .54 (95% CI .45-.62) and for smoking cessation .58 (95% CI .50-.65). For women the heritability estimates were .36 (95% CI .28-.43), .61 (95% CI .46-.70) and .50 (95% CI .39-.60), respectively. The genetic correlations between age at initiation and amount smoked or smoking cessation were at most .22 in magnitude, indicating that genetic influences in age at initiation accounted for at most about 4% of the genetic factors in amount smoked or in cessation. Genetic factors are important in amount smoked and smoking cessation and they are largely independent of genetic influences on age at initiation. This has implications for defining phenotypes in searches for genes underlying smoking behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous analysis of handedness data from 35 samples of twins (with a combined sample size of 21,127 twin pairs) found a small but significant additive genetic effect accounting for 25.47% of the variance (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.69-29.51%). No common environmental influences were detected (C = 0.00; 95% CI 0.00-7.67%), with the majority of the variance, 74.53%, explained by factors unique to the individual (95% CI 70.49-78.67%). No significant heterogeneity was observed within studies that used similar methods to assess handedness, or across studies that used different methods. At an individual level the majority of studies had insufficient power to reject a purely unique environmental model due to insufficient power to detect familial aggregation. This lack of power is seldom mentioned within studies, and has contributed to the misconception that twin studies of handedness are not informative.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to estimate the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences to variation in adolescent neuroticism as a function of age and sex. Neuroticism was assessed using the Amsterdamse Biografische Vragenlijst (ABV): a self-report personality instrument similar in content to the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Genetic modeling procedures, including age as modifier, were fitted to the total sample of 3301 Dutch adolescent twins aged 12 to 17 years (mean age 15.5). Significant influences of additive genetic factors (.59, 95% confidence intervals [CI] .54-.63) and unshared environmental factors (.41, 95% CI .37-.45) were found. Our data did not support a role of shared environment. Results showed that different genes may influence variation in neuroticism between girls and boys. No interaction was found between the variance components and age. Results generally support prior findings in adults and young children that neuroticism is influenced principally by additive genetic and unique environmental factors. The magnitude of the genetic component appears higher in the present sample of adolescents than in most studies of adults. The present study suggests that, in adolescence, different genes are expressed in boys and girls.",

    "abstract": "Both acquired and genetic factors regulate adipose tissue function.\nWe determined whether adipose tissue mRNA expression is regulated by obesity, independently of genetic effects, by studying monozygotic (MZ) twins.\nSeventeen healthy pairs of MZ twins aged 24-27 yr (body mass index 20.0-33.9 kg/m(2), intrapair differences in body weight 0.1-24.7 kg), were identified from the population-based FinnTwin16 cohort. Body fat percent was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, sc and intraabdominal fat by magnetic resonance imaging, liver fat by proton spectroscopy, and insulin sensitivity by using the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. Adipocyte cell size and expression of 10 genes (real-time PCR) were determined in sc adipose tissue biopsies. Serum levels of some of the genes were measured using ELISA.\nWithin MZ twin pairs, acquired obesity was significantly related to increased adipocyte size and increased adipose tissue mRNA expressions of leptin, TNFalpha and the macrophage marker CD68, and decreased mRNA expressions of adiponectin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. Intrapair differences in liver fat correlated directly with those in leptin and CD68 expression. CD68 expression and serum TNFalpha concentrations were correlated with insulin resistance.\nAcquired obesity independent of genetic influences is able to increase expression of macrophage and inflammatory markers and decrease adiponectin expression in adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "We sought to evaluate whether early (24 to 28 weeks gestation) hospitalization of monoamniotic twins, with close fetal surveillance, and delivery at 32 to 34 weeks gestation, would significantly improve the perinatal morbidity and mortality compared with an outpatient management strategy. A multicenter, retrospective record review was undertaken. Records of all monoamniotic twins were collected for a 10-year period. Monoamniotic twins were identified using intensive care nursery, ultrasound, and pathology records. Data were collected on inpatient versus outpatient management strategies and the perinatal/maternal outcomes and complications. Twenty-three sets of monoamniotic twins were included in the study. Eleven sets were managed using an inpatient strategy and 12 sets were managed using an outpatient strategy. There were no fetal deaths in the inpatient group and there were three fetal deaths in the outpatient group. Inpatient management of monoamniotic twins should be considered.",

    "abstract": "The Rho/Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway is implicated in experimental hypertension. We, therefore, explored the role of ROCK2 genetic variation in human blood pressure (BP) regulation, exploiting the advantages of a human twin sample to probe heritability. The focus of this work is the common nonsynonymous variant at ROCK2: Thr431Asn. Cardiovascular and autonomic traits displayed substantial heritability (from approximately 33% to 71%; P<0.05). The Asn/Asn genotype (compared with Asn/Thr or Thr/Thr) was associated with greater resting systolic (P<0.001), diastolic (P<0.0001), and mean BP (P<0.0001); allelic variation at ROCK2 accounted for up to approximately 5% of BP variation (P<0.0001). Systemic vascular resistance was higher in Asn/Asn individuals (P=0.049), whereas cardiac output, large artery compliance, and vasoactive hormone secretion were not different. Coupling of the renin-angiotensin system to systemic resistance and BP was diminished in Asn/Asn homozygotes, suggesting genetic pleiotropy of Thr431Asn, confirmed by bivariate genetic analyses. The Asn/Asn genotype also predicted higher BP after environmental (cold) stress. The rise in heart rate after cold was less pronounced in Asn/Asn individuals, consistent with intact baroreceptor function, and baroreceptor slope was not influenced by genotype. Common genetic variation (Thr431Asn) at ROCK2 predicts increased BP, systemic vascular resistance (although not large artery compliance), and resistance in response to the endogenous renin-angiotensin system, indicating a resistance vessel-based effect on elevated BP. The results suggest that common variation in ROCK2 exerts systemic resistance-mediated changes in BP, documenting a novel mechanism for human circulatory control, and suggesting new possibilities for diagnostic profiling and treatment of subjects at risk of developing hypertension.",

A summary of the early assessment and course is provided and findings from follow-up assessments of the cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal functioning of each child is analysed. Follow-up measures, chosen to capture social-cognitive processing of these children from an attachment perspective, are highlighted.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify the gestational age with the lowest morbidity and mortality rates for twin pregnancies that reach term.\nA retrospective cohort study carried out with 60,443 twin pairs from the United States (1995-1997). Analysis was restricted to pregnancies that had reached at least 37 weeks of gestation; groups were created on the basis of the gestational ages of 37, 38, 39, and > or = 40 weeks. The incidence of death and morbidity were calculated; multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate the independent effect of gestational age for twin A and B.\nThe neonatal mortality rate increased significantly after 40 weeks of gestation (twin A: odds ratio, 3.47 [95% CI, 2.29, 5.38]; twin B, odds ratio, 2.52 [95% CI, 1.75, 3.67]). There was also an increased risk of neonatal morbidity in the > or = 40 weeks of gestation group for twin A and B (Apgar score, < or = 3; odds ratio, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.18, 3.02], 1.74 [95% CI, 1.21, 2.52], respectively). There was a decreased risk of assisted ventilation in the 38 and 39 weeks of gestation group for twin A (odds ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77, 0.97], odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.72, 0.95], respectively) and a decreased risk in the 39 and > or = 40 weeks of gestation groups for twin B (assisted ventilation: odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.73, 0.93], odds ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.72, 0.92], respectively).\nThis study suggests that the optimal date of delivery for twins should be <40 weeks of gestation; there was no compelling evidence for delivering at <38 weeks of gestation.",

The caesarean section rates for MCDA were similar to those for DCDA twins (56.6 versus 53.6%, P > 0.1). Although the number of babies with 5-minute Apgar score of <7 was significantly higher for vaginally delivered MCDA twins compared with that of DCDA twins (12 versus 3.5%, P < 0.001), the umbilical artery pH of <7.2 was similar (20 versus 13%, P > 0.05). Admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and neonatal mortality were also similar in both groups. Delivery by caesarean section was associated with increased admission to the NICU and neonatal mortality for MCDA twins when compared with vaginal delivery group. From this retrospective cohort study, we can conclude that vaginal delivery for MCDA twins appeared to be a reasonable management option when similar selection criteria for vaginal delivery of DCDA twins were applied.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to test nongenetic factors that might explain discordance for dementia in monozygotic twin pairs. Risk factors included education, engaged lifestyle in midlife, and early life circumstances indexed by tooth loss, short adult height, and parental social class.\nData are from the HARMONY study, including members of the Swedish Twin Registry age 65 and older and alive in 1998, who were screened and assessed clinically for dementia. Analyses included a case-control design to evaluate the risk factors and a co-twin control design that permits testing nongenetic risk factors while controlling for genetic influences. Case-control analyses included 310 dementia cases and 3,063 nondemented controls. There were 106 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for dementia. Risk factors were assessed independently by the Swedish Twin Registry three decades previously.\nCase-control findings showed that history of tooth loss before age 35 and low educational attainment were significant risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, with short adult height also contributing to risk for total dementia. In co-twin control analyses, only history of tooth loss before age 35 was a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, whereas low educational attainment also contributed to risk for total dementia and lack of physical exercise to risk for non-Alzheimer's dementias.\nPotentially modifiable risk factors from early and midlife, with a cumulative detrimental effect on the brain, contribute to risk of dementia. Based on the association with tooth loss, further investigation of inflammatory load as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is warranted.",

    "abstract": "An increased risk for intrauterine growth restriction in the affected member of like-sex twin pairs discordant for hypospadias has been reported. The purpose of this study was to document patterns of birth weight disparities in like-sex twins discordant for a variety of structural defects in order to determine if this is a general phenomenon seen in twins who are discordant for any malformation, is seen only in pairs discordant for certain specific malformations, or is unique to hypospadias.\nData were extracted from the Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECLAMC). Between 1967 and 1999, all like-sex twin pairs discordant for hypospadias or any other isolated defect that met the criteria of at least 5 discordant pairs for which birth weight was available on both twins were selected. All nonmalformed like-sex twin pairs in the ECLAMC data base collected over the same study years were selected as controls.\nA total of 216 discordant malformed like-sex twin pairs in 13 defect categories and 328 nonmalformed like-sex twin pairs met the criteria for inclusion. The proportion of affected infants who were > or =20% smaller than their co-twin was statistically significantly different from controls for hypospadias, heart defects, anencephaly, and esophageal atresia.\nIntrauterine growth restriction seen in the affected member of like-sex twin pairs discordant for hypospadias is not unique, but occurs as well in at least 3 additional structural malformations.",

    "abstract": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an overgrowth syndrome demonstrating heterogeneous molecular alterations of two imprinted domains on chromosome 11p15. The most common molecular alterations include loss of methylation at the proximal imprinting center, IC2, paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 11p15 and hypermethylation at the distal imprinting center, IC1. An increased incidence of female monozygotic twins discordant for BWS has been reported. The molecular basis for eleven such female twin pairs has been demonstrated to be a loss of methylation at IC2, whereas only one male monozygotic twin pair has been reported with this molecular defect. We report here two new pairs of male monozygotic twins. One pair is discordant for BWS; the affected twin exhibits paternal UPD for chromosome 11p15 whereas the unaffected twin does not. The second male twin pair is concordant for BWS and both twins of the pair demonstrate hypermethylation at IC1. Thus, this report expands the known molecular etiologies for BWS twins. Interestingly, these findings demonstrate a new epigenotype-phenotype correlation in BWS twins. That is, while female monozygotic twins with BWS are likely to show loss of imprinting at IC2, male monozygotic twins with BWS reflect the molecular heterogeneity seen in BWS singletons. These data underscore the need for molecular testing in BWS twins, especially in view of the known differences among 11p15 epigenotypes with respect to tumor risk.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in animal models indicate a role for natural killer (NK) cells in the protection against type 1 diabetes. In humans, a reduction of NK cell numbers has been reported in identical twins discordant for type 1 diabetes, irrespective of whether they have the disease. Here we have tested whether the activation and expansion of human NK cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reveals differences between these twins.\nProportions of CD56(+) NK cells and T-cells and Va24Vb11(+) NK-T cells from diabetic and non-diabetic twins was assessed before and after activation using flow cytometry. NK receptor usage was monitored by PCR and flow cytometry.\nThe profile of the expressed Killer Cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) repertoire (using mRNA) in freshly isolated NK cells was identical in pairs of identical twins, despite marked variation among individual twins as well as controls. Basal numbers of CD56(+) and CD94(+) (CD3(-) and CD3(+)) cells and Valpha24(+)Vbeta11(+) NK-T cells were similarly strongly correlated between identical twins (p < 0.006 for all correlations). Following LPS stimulation, the pattern of KIR mRNA expression remained unaltered in twins and the proportion of NK cells and Valpha24(+)Vbeta11(+) NK-T cells remained correlated between pairs of twins. However, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of CD56(+) cells and CD94(+) cells (whether defined as CD3(-) or CD3(+)) responding to LPS in the diabetic compared to the non-diabetic twin (p = 0.031 and 0.025, respectively).\nThis reduction in NK cell expansion in response to LPS in patients with type 1 diabetes is consistent with a non-genetically determined alteration in the innate immune response either predisposing to or resulting from the disease.",

Eight monochorionic twin pairs and 11 dichorionic twin pairs served as control groups. The following Doppler parameters were assessed: umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI), middle cerebral artery (MCA) PI, cerebroplacental ratio, delta PI between the umbilical artery and MCA, and peak systolic velocity (PSV) in the MCA.\nSignificant variations in PSV in the MCA and cerebral indices were found in the study group of monochorionic twins with TTTS. Periods of high PSV with low PI in the MCA were followed by lower PSV in the same fetus. Repeated measurements in the comparison groups were stable without significant variations. The delta cerebroplacental ratio was significantly higher in the study group (0.38 versus 0.09 and 0.19 in the comparison groups; P < .02).\nSignificant changes in Doppler flow velocity and indices suggest instability of cerebral blood flow with episodes of \"hyperperfusion\" in monochorionic twins with TTTS.

    "abstract": "The importance of renal function as both a marker of and risk factor for cardiovascular disease is increasingly recognized. This link is apparent even in the earliest stages of renal dysfunction, at levels that are conventionally considered \"normal.\" These findings are of considerable importance, given the prevalence of high-normal levels of albuminuria (i.e., 10 to 20 mg/L) in the general population. There is also a close link between the progression of albuminuria and the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, such that kidney disease--far from being simply a consequence of the metabolic syndrome--may be considered a component of it. It may be hypothesized that minor derangements of renal function, such as microalbuminuria or reduced glomerular filtration rate, can lead to dysfunction of the endothelium, with the consequence of sensitizing the vasculature to the injurious effects of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other risk factors. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is highly activated in patients with the metabolic syndrome, and this presumably is also true for the intrarenal RAS systems. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are known to reduce the progression of renal damage. Still to be resolved, however, is the optimal dosage; several recent studies indicate that the dosage required for maximal blood pressure reduction is insufficient to provide maximal renoprotection.",

    "abstract": "The most potent risk factor for affective disorders is a family history of affective disorder but the specific factors that are transmitted in families are unknown. It is possible to investigate the relation between risk factors and affective disorder by using a high-risk design e.g.: a study of the healthy relatives of patients with affective disorders.\nTo compare psychopathology and socio-economic status between twins with a co-twin history of affective disorder and twins without.\nIn a cross-sectional high-risk case-control study, healthy monozygotic and dizygotic twins with (High-Risk twins) and without (Low-Risk twins) a co-twin history of affective disorder were identified through nation-wide registers. Participants were assessed using semi-structured psychiatric interviews and self-rating of psychopathology.\nHigh-Risk twins had a lower education level, a lower work position and tendency towards being more often unemployed and early retired than the Low-Risk twins. Furthermore, they presented higher rates of subclinical affective symptoms and were more likely to experience a minor psychiatric diagnosis.\nHealthy twins with a high genetic liability to affective disorder seem to present lower socio-economic status, higher rates of subclinical affective symptoms and more often experience a minor psychiatric diagnosis than twins with no familial history of affective disorder. It is not possible from the present cross-sectional data to determine the causality of these findings, thus genetic liability to affective disorder, socio-economic status and minor psychopathology seem to have a complex interrelation.",

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder characterized by accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues. Phenotypic manifestations are wide-ranging from neuropsychiatric disorders, to severe liver disease requiring liver transplantation. Clinical presentation is not often related to the genetic defect and siblings may have different type of disease. Liver transplantation is indicated for all patients with Wilson's disease and decompensated liver cirrhosis unresponsive to medical therapy, but its efficacy in resolving the neurological symptoms is still controversial, because as far now, very different outcomes have been reported. We describe here on the exceptional case of two homozygotic twins, both with liver cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease, one of them with severe neuropsychiatric involvement, who both underwent liver transplantation and subsequently had very different outcome despite same genetic background. The presence of neurological clinical manifestations in Wilson's disease should recommend caution indicating liver transplantation, because irreversible brain damage may exist.",

    "abstract": "A 5-year follow-up study of exposure of discordant monozygotic twin pairs with repeated interviews and spine imaging.\nThe primary goals were to record changes in the degenerative signs over a 5-year interval and to estimate the effects of familial influences and suspected environmental risk factors on the speed of lumbar degeneration.\nTraditionally, disc degeneration has been attributed to aging and environmental exposures; recently, a dominant effect of genetics has been revealed. Yet the etiopathogenesis of disc degeneration remains poorly understood and controversial despite being a primary target of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.\nAmong 116 monozygotic twin pairs, which had been examined 5 years earlier, 75 pairs (150 men) were reexamined. They were imaged using the same MRI scanner and examination protocol as at baseline. The data were analyzed using statistical methods for longitudinal studies.\nProgression in disc height narrowing, disc bulging, osteophytosis, and fatty degeneration in the lumbar spine was seen in about 7% to 13% of the discs in 7% to 46% of subjects during 5-year follow-up. Few degenerative findings appear to reverse; few disc height measures increased, some anular tears were no longer visible, and bulging/herniation diminished. New anular tears (in axial view) were detected in 1.5%, disappeared in 2%, and were unchanged in 5.3% of discs; in the sagittal view, new high intensity zones findings were identified in 0.5%, were no longer apparent in 1.6%, and were unchanged in 7.1% of discs. There were no clear changes in upper endplates: in 2.1% of discs, the irregularity score increased and in 1.8% it decreased. Familial aggregation, reflecting genetic, and shared environmental influences, explained 47% to 66% of the variance in progression of degenerative signs on lumbar MRI, and resistance training and occupational physical loading together explained 2% to 10% of the progression in the degenerative signs in lumbar MRIs.\nProgression of disc height narrowing, bulging, osteophytes, and fatty degeneration was detected in about 10% or less of the T12-S1 discs. Development and disappearance of anular lesions were rarer. No clear changes were seen in endplate irregularities. The results also confirm that hereditary effects have a dominant role in the progression of disc degeneration and suggest that occupational lifting and leisure time resistance training have modest additional effects.",

    "abstract": "With more than half of the population experiencing low back pain (LBP) before the age of 20, research must focus on young populations. Lifestyle-factors might be important elements of prevention, since they are modifiable in nature. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to investigate the association between smoking, alcohol consumption and overweight in adolescence and 1) present LBP (cross-sectionally) and 2) the risk of future LBP (longitudinally).\nData from 9,600 twins, aged 12-22, were analysed cross-sectionally with respect to associations between the above-mentioned lifestyle-factors and LBP. Eight years later, a follow-up survey (n = 6,554) was conducted and LBP at follow-up was correlated to the lifestyle-factors at baseline. Finally, the associations found to be significant were tested in a twin-control study design.\nOur cross-sectional study demonstrated small, but statistically significant, positive associations between all three investigated life-style factors and LBP. In the longitudinal study, smoking at baseline showed a monotonic dose-response relationship with LBP at follow-up (OR up to 4.0 for those smoking >20 cig./day). There was also evidence of temporality (smoking preceding LBP). Adult LBP was negatively associated with adolescent alcohol consumption. We found no evidence of a dose-response relationship or temporality. There were no associations detected between adolescent overweight and adult LBP. In the twin-control study, the directions of associations were the same, but none of these associations attained statistical significance.\nSeveral of the Bradford Hill criteria for causality were fulfilled for smoking whereas the crucial aspect of temporality was missing for alcohol consumption and overweight. The twin-control study failed to confirm a statistically significant link between smoking and LBP.",

    "abstract": "The predictability of virus-host interactions and disease progression in rapidly evolving human viral infections has been difficult to assess because of host and genetic viral diversity. Here we examined adaptive HIV-specific cellular and humoral immune responses and viral evolution in adult monozygotic twins simultaneously infected with the same virus. CD4 T cell counts and viral loads followed similar trajectories over three years of follow up. The initial CD8 T cell response targeted 17 epitopes, 15 of which were identical in each twin, including two immunodominant responses. By 36 months after infection, 14 of 15 initial responses were still detectable in both, whereas all new responses were subdominant and remained so. Of four responses that declined in both twins, three demonstrated mutations at the same residue. In addition, the evolving antibody responses cross-neutralized the other twin's virus, with similar changes in the pattern of evolution in the envelope gene. These results reveal considerable concordance of adaptive cellular and humoral immune responses and HIV evolution in the same genetic environment, suggesting constraints on mutational pathways to HIV immune escape.",

    "abstract": "To report on a pair of monozygotic female twins discordant for Goldenhar syndrome.\nThe affected twin was a girl, who was delivered by caesarean section at 35 weeks' gestation. Her birth weight was 2,170 g, length 42.5 cm, head circumference 30 cm and her Apgar scores were 3/7. After birth the child developed severe respiratory distress and had to be moved to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU). The other twin was a girl, born weighing 3,200 g with a length of 49 cm, head circumference of 34 cm and Apgar scores of 8/10. She was transferred to the mother-baby unit soon after birth and was discharged two days later. There was no consanguinity between the twins' parents, who were young and healthy at the time of their conception. The affected child's dysmorphic features included left hemifacial microsomia, severe micrognathia, abnormal ears, bilateral preauricular tags and epibulbar dermoid in the right eye. She developed obstructive apnea due to micrognathia and required tracheostomy. Abdominal and cranial ultrasound findings were normal, as was an ophthalmological assessment. Spine x-ray showed hemivertebra at T9 and T10. An echocardiogram showed Tetralogy of Fallot. GTG-banded karyotyping was performed on peripheral blood cells and revealed 46,XX. Zygosity testing established the pair of twins to be monozygotic with a probability greater than 99:1.\nGoldenhar syndrome was diagnosed in one of the twins described here. There are several reports of twins discordant for this disorder and therefore non-genetic factors may also play an important role, for instance vascular disruption during morphogenesis.",

The specified category of drugs produces anabolic, androgenic and psycho-active effects including elevated aggressive, hostile, violent and anti social behavior.\nThe objective of this case report observational study was to evaluate the possible psychological consequences of AS use in the twin user of each pair, compared with the non-user twin.\nWe studied two pairs of male monozygotic twins: one pair 24 years old and the other 31 years old, with absolute genome and phenotype similarity. One of the twins of each pair used AAS while the other did not. Both pairs lived in Hellenic provincial towns and followed a common training and nutrition regime. The psychometric instruments used were the Symptoms Check List-90 (SCL-90) and the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire (HDHQ). The psychometric evaluations took place within a time interval of 6 months.\nThe study found high levels of aggressiveness, hostility, anxiety and paranoid ideation in the twins who used AS. The non-user twins showed no deviation from their initial status.\nThe use of AAS induced several important psychiatric changes in monozygotic twins which were not present in the twin who did not use AAS.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy and safety of oral misoprostol for labor induction of twins is unknown. We conducted a retrospective case-control study to evaluate the use of oral misoprostol in near term (> or =35 weeks) twin pregnancies in nulliparas. Eligible cases were given 100 mcg oral misoprostol, which was repeated after 6 h if labor did not start. Either a third dose or diluted oxytocin infusion were given in intractable cases. Diluted oxytocin infusion was used for augmentation. Controls were nulliparas delivered at > or =35 weeks by elective cesarean section. The two groups were comparable in most aspects, except for fetal malpresentation, which was the major reason for avoiding induction. Of the 69 patients in whom labor was induced, 53 (76.8%) had a vaginal birth, 3 (4.3%) had a combined twin delivery, and 13 (18.8%) had a cesarean during labor. The mean length of stay of the neonates was significantly shorter among study cases, without significant difference in the frequency of delayed discharges as an overall proxy for neonatal complications. Labor induction with oral misoprostol could be offered to patients in whom near term vaginal twin delivery is unequivocally permitted and wish to deliver by the vaginal route.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the 1-year-period prevalence of tension-type headache in a large population based sample. The study population included 33,764 twins aged 12-41 years old from the population based new Danish Twin Registry. They received a posted headache questionnaire and the response rate was 83.5%. The self-reported 1-year-period prevalence of tension-type headache was 86.0%; 78.9% among men and 92.5% among women. The 1-year-period prevalence of infrequent episodic, frequent episodic and chronic tension-type headache was 63.5, 21.6 and 0.9%, respectively. Frequent episodic and chronic tension-type headache was significantly more frequent in women than men. The prevalence of frequent episodic tension-type headache increased slightly in men until age 39 then it declined, while it increased about 20% point in women from age 12 years to age 20-39 years old and then it declined. Congruently, the prevalence of chronic tension-type headache increased until age 39 and declined thereafter in both sexes. Chronic tension-type headache is rare in persons 12-14 years old. These effects were confirmed by age trends of the different subtypes of tension-type headache using a regression model. The prevalence of migraine varied from 7.0 to 16.8% in men and from 8.2 to 31.0% in women. It increased from age 12 to 34 years and then declined. The risk and frequency of tension-type headache was significantly higher in those with migraine than those who had never had migraine. Future large longitudinal follow-up studies are required.",

    "abstract": "Twins can be used to investigate the biological basis for observed associations between birth weight and later disease risk, as they experience in utero growth restriction compared with singletons, which can differ in magnitude within twin pairs despite partial or total genetic identity. In the present study, sixty monozygotic and seventy-one dizygotic same-sex twin pairs aged 19-50 years and eighty-nine singleton controls matched for age, gestational age, sex, maternal age and parity were recruited from an obstetric database. Associations between fasting lipid levels and birth weight were assessed by linear regression with adjustment for possible confounding factors. Twins were significantly lighter at birth but were not significantly different in adult height, weight or lipid levels from the singleton controls. There was a significant inverse association between birth weight and both total and LDL-cholesterol levels among singleton controls (-0.53 mmol/l per kg (95 % CI -0.97, -0.09), P = 0.02 and -0.39 mmol/l per kg (95 % CI -0.76, -0.02), P = 0.04, respectively), but there was no significant association between birth weight and lipid levels in either unpaired or within-pair analysis of twins. The results suggest that the in utero growth restriction and early catch-up growth experienced by twins does not increase the risk of an atherogenic lipid profile in adult life.",

Thirty-six sets of twins (14 with discordant growth, birth weight difference >15%) who had been treated for severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) by laser coagulation were studied. Cord blood samples were collected at birth and analyzed for IGF-I and leptin. Inter-twin differences (delta) of birth weight and head circumference were correlated to delta hormone levels.\nAn inter-twin correlation for leptin (r = 0.69; p <0.0001) and delta IGF-I (r = 0.49; p <0.0001) was found. delta birth weight correlated significantly with delta IGF-I (r = 0.67; p <0.0001) but not with delta leptin (r = 0.23; p = 0.19). delta IGF-I concentrations did not correlate with delta leptin (r = 0.18). delta head circumference correlated significantly with delta leptin (r = 0.47; p <0.01) and with delta IGF-I (r = 0.46; p <0.01). Using a multiple regression model with head circumference as dependent variable, adjusted for gestational age, head circumference remained significantly associated with higher leptin concentrations in all patients (p = 0.03).\nIGF-I is a good indicator for fetal growth and brain development. Leptin seems to be mainly genetically determined but may play a role in fetal brain development and is not only an index for fetal fat mass.",

    "abstract": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is recognized as one of the most important independent predictors of adverse cardiovascular outcome. The aetiology of LVH includes a number of well-recognized causes but there is considerable interest in the genetics of cardiac muscle hypertrophy. We used a large prospective twin database in order to establish the heritability of left ventricular mass (LVM).\nNormotensive twins were prospectively recruited. Demographic data were collected. The LVM was determined using the Penn formulae derived from data collected from echocardiography.\nA total of 376 Caucasian twin pairs (182 monozygotic and 194 dizygotic) aged 25-79 years were recruited. All subjects were normotensive with no significant differences in blood pressure (mean blood pressure: monozygotic twins, 132/83 mmHg; dizygotic twins, 131/82 mmHg) or body mass index between the monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The mean LVM for monozygotic twins was 140.9 g, compared with 140.2 g for dizygotic twins. Heritability estimates suggest that the genetic variance of LVM is 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.67). No common shared environmental effects were identified under this model.\nOur data from the largest set of twin pairs studied to date show that LVM has a sizeable genetic basis that is probably polygenic. This result has important implications for the understanding of normal and abnormal cardiac morphology at the molecular level.",

All subjects were normotensive with no significant differences in blood pressure (mean blood pressure: monozygotic twins, 132/83 mmHg; dizygotic twins, 131/82 mmHg) or body mass index between the monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The mean LVM for monozygotic twins was 140.9 g, compared with 140.2 g for dizygotic twins. Heritability estimates suggest that the genetic variance of LVM is 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.67).

    "abstract": "Children with language impairments have limitations of phonological short-term memory (STM) and have distinctive problems with certain aspects of grammar. Both deficits have been proposed as phenotypic markers of heritable language impairment. We studied 173 twin pairs, selected to be over-representative of children with risk of developmental language impairment, using a battery of standardized language and intelligence tests, a test of nonword repetition to index phonological STM and two elicitation tasks to assess use of verb tense marking. As predicted, the phonological STM and the verb tense measures both discriminated children with risk of language impairment from low risk children, and DeFries-Fulker analysis showed that impairments on both tasks were significantly heritable. However, there was minimal phenotypic and etiological overlap between the two deficits, suggesting that different genes are implicated in causing these two kinds of language difficulty. From an evolutionary perspective, these data are consistent with the view that language is a complex function that depends on multiple underlying skills with distinct genetic origins.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a study of the variation in the appearance of earprints from six pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins, applying different methods with varying degrees of objectivity. By analyzing prints of MZ twins, we purposely select pairs of individuals for whom the degree of interindividual variation is low. We first provide an account of the corresponding characteristics and the differences that occur between prints from the individual members. We evaluate differences in both content (i.e., presence, shape, and intensity of imprinted features) and geometry (i.e., position of imprinted features). Differences are visualized by way of digital overlays. Differences in geometry are further evaluated by performing a hierarchical cluster analysis using variables derived from the position of seemingly corresponding features. As a next step, we explore a method to fully automatically analyze prints. In this approach, image regions are selected and matched automatically. A suggestion on how to apply this method to calculate the evidential value of an earprint is provided. To our knowledge, this is the first time that any method capable of fully automated earprint comparisons has been presented in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Twins tend to lag behind singletons in their motor development, though the causes of this appear to be complicated and are not yet fully understood. The present study was performed to clarify the factors associated with the motor development of twins.\nThe twins in the first group consisted of school applicants, including 1131 twin pairs, and the second group consisted of children of members of several maternal associations, and included 951 pairs. All data were gathered by questionnaire survey, and six gross-motor development milestones were analyzed in individuals or pairs.\nRelative to general population norms in Japan, twins tended to be delayed in reaching several motor development milestones. Stepwise regression analysis showed that of all the variables measured, gestational age was the most influential on all six milestones. Birthweight was also influential on most milestones. Other factors affecting motor development milestones were parity for 'sitting without support,' 'pulling up to a standing position,' and 'walking without support,' and zygosity for 'walking without support.' In these cases, longer gestational age, heavier birthweighf, primiparity, and dizygosity showed a tendency toward earlier attainment of development. Motor development within pairs was more similar in monozygotic pairs compared with dizygotic pairs regarding each item, suggesting genetic contributions.\nThe results of the present study showed specific and nonspecific factors that affect motor development of twins. These findings should prove useful in understanding the motor development of twin children and help clinicians to refine maternal and child health care for multiple-birth children.",

    "abstract": "Since genetic alterations influencing susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), are as yet poorly understood, the purpose of this study was to identify genes responsible for MS by studying monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for MS.\nIn order to identify genes involved in MS development, the gene expression profiles in blood mononuclear cells obtained from eight MZ twin pairs discordant for MS were analyzed by cDNA microarray technology detecting the expression of 8 300 genes. The twins were collected from the Finnish Twin Cohort Study and both affected subjects and their healthy siblings underwent neurological evaluation and cerebral and spinal magnetic resonance imaging. Gene expressions were confirmed by relative quantitative reverse transcription PCR.\nIt appeared that 25 genes were at least two-fold up-regulated and 15 genes down-regulated in 25% (2/8) of twins with MS when compared to their healthy siblings. Moreover, 6/25 genes were up-regulated in 40% of MS twins and one gene, interferon alpha-inducible protein (clone IFI-6-16) (G1P3), in 50% of them. The six most constantly expressed genes are (1) G1P3, (2) POU domain, class 3, transcription factor 1, (3) myxovirus resistance 2, (4) lysosomal-associated multispanning membrane protein-5, (5) hemoglobin alpha 2 and (6) hemoglobin beta.\nOver two-fold up-regulation of these six genes in almost half of MZ twins with MS suggests their role in MS pathogenesis. Studies using MZ MS twins obtained from genetically homogeneous population offer a unique opportunity to explore the genetic nature of MS.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this study were to examine the genetic contribution on physical activity (PA) within a nationwide population of young adult male twin pairs from Sweden and to investigate the equal environment assumption (EEA) in relation to PA. Information on PA was collected by questionnaires in 1998 and 2002 and the impact of genetic factors was estimated by structural equation modeling (SEM). The study included 1,022 pairs of twins and the best fitting SEM-model gave a heritability of 49% (95% CI, 40-56%) for total PA and all PA dimensions showed genetic contributions between 40% and 65%. Non-shared environmental factors were also important, whereas shared environmental factors did not contribute to PA behaviors. The EEA was investigated with a linear regression model, examining if the twins contact frequency predicted within-pair differences in PA, and further by a simulation study. We found no support for violation of the EEA.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation, illness and higher incidence of newborns during labour. They are noticed to have been more frequent in Poland in recent years. Based on the hospital records we reviewed the most common facial anomaly in twins--the cleft lip and palate. The frequency of this malformation occurrence in Poland is 1:502 in newborns. The etiopathogenesis of this malformation, in 17-20%, results from genetic factors. Researches on the occurrence of cleft lip and palate in twins strongly confirm the heredity of the malformation.\nThe analysis of the occurrence frequency of the cleft lip and/or palate in cleft-twins was the main objective in our study.\nIn the study of 21 sets of cleft-twins, 6 of them were monozygotic and 15 were dizygotic. It was assessed on the basis of data that was received from parents, same-sex twins and physical likeness. Twin-siblings who had cleft anomalies, always had cleft lip and palate or an isolated cleft palate.\nThe outcome showed that twins were not a subject to increased or decreased risk of cleft anomalies. Moreover, clefts did not increase the risk of twin-siblings labour. The hypothesis that a monozygotic twin pregnancy is a factor of increased risk of cleft anomaly was not confirmed. Presented data can be used in genetic counseling. In all likelihood, in the nearest future there will be chances for working out the cleft prophylaxis.\nTwin pregnancy does not changes risk of cleft anomaly and its occurrence does not increase of twin-siblings labor.",

    "abstract": "Global gray matter brain tissue volume decreases in schizophrenia have been associated to disease-related (possibly nongenetic) factors. Global white matter brain tissue volume decreases were related to genetic risk factors for the disease. However, which focal gray and white matter brain regions best reflect the genetic and environmental risk factors in the brains of patients with schizophrenia remains unresolved. 1.5-T MRI brain scans of 11 monozygotic and 11 same-sex dizygotic twin-pairs discordant for schizophrenia were compared to 11 monozygotic and 11 same-sex dizygotic healthy control twin-pairs using voxel-based morphometry. Linear regression analysis was done in each voxel for the average and difference in gray and white matter density separately, in each twin-pair, with group (discordant, healthy) and zygosity (monozygotic, dizygotic) as between subject variables, and age, sex and handedness as covariates. The t-maps (critical threshold value mid R:tmid R: > 6.0, P < 0.05) revealed a focal decrease in gray matter density accompanied by a focal increase in white matter density in the left medial orbitofrontal gyrus and a focal decrease in white matter density in the left sensory motor gyrus in twin-pairs discordant for schizophrenia as compared to healthy twin-pairs. Focal changes in left medial (orbito)frontal and left sensory motor gyri may reflect the increased genetic risk to develop schizophrenia. Focal changes in the left anterior hemisphere may therefore be particularly relevant as endophenotype in genetic studies of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Previous twin studies have demonstrated high heritability of specific language impairment (SLI) when the diagnosis is based on psychometric testing. The current study measured the effectiveness of parent and teacher ratings of communication skills in identifying heritable language impairment. The Children's Communication Checklist was completed by parents and teachers of 6-year-old twins recruited from a general population sample. One hundred and thirty twin pairs (65 MZ) were selected because at least one twin had low language skills at 4 years of age; a further 66 pairs (37 MZ) were a low risk group with no indication of language difficulties at 4 years. Internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and validity in identifying language impairment were assessed for all CCC scales. CCC scales, especially those assessing structural language skills, were highly effective in identifying cases of language impairment, but agreement between parent and teacher ratings was modest. Genetic analysis revealed negligible environmental influence and substantial genetic influence on most scales. A rater-specific effects model was fit to the data to assess how far parents and teachers assess a common genetic factor on the CCC. Ratings of parents and teachers were influenced to some extent by the same child characteristics, but rater-specific effects were also evident, especially on scales measuring pragmatic aspects of communication. This study shows that there are strong genetic influences on both structural and pragmatic language impairments in children, and these can be detected using a simple checklist completed by parents or teachers.",

    "abstract": "Prospective study with 8-year follow-up.\nTo describe the evolution of low back pain from adolescence into adulthood.\nHigh prevalence rates of low back pain among children and adolescents have been demonstrated in several studies, and it has been theorized that low back pain in childhood may have important consequences for future low back pain. It is important to understand the nature of such a link if effective preventive programs are to be established.\nAlmost 10,000 Danish twins born between 1972 and 1982 were surveyed by means of postal questionnaires in 1994 and again in 2002. The questionnaires dealt with various aspects of general health, including the prevalence of low back pain, classified according to number of days affected (0, 1-7, 8-30, >30).\nLow back pain in adolescence was found to be a significant risk factor for low back pain in adulthood with odds ratios as high as four. We also demonstrated a dose-response association: the more days with low back pain at baseline, the higher the risk of future low back pain. Twenty-six percent of those with low back pain for more than 30 days during the baseline year also had more than 30 days with low back pain during the follow-up year. This was true for only 9% of the rest of the sample.\nOur study clearly demonstrates correlations between low back pain in childhood/adolescence and low back pain in adulthood. This should lead to a change in focus from the adult to the young population in relation to research, prevention, and treatment.",

Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome affected three sets of twins. Five twin sets delivered before 31, 19 sets at 31 to 32 and 12 sets at 33 to 34 weeks. Six of 71 (8%) twins died (four malformations, one TTS and one 26 weeks premature). Head ultrasounds in 59 of 65 survivors showed two (3%) periventricular leukomalacia, five (9%) Grade I-II intraventricular hemorrhage and 52 (88%) normal.\nMonochorionic monoamniotic twins remain a group at risk for cord entanglement, congenital malformations, TTS and prematurity.

Prevalence statistics for past year and lifetime reports confirm differences between genders for CD, GAD, SAD, and MDD, and a lack of differences between twins and their non-twin siblings. Biometrical modeling was conducted to ascertain the relative influences of genes, and shared and non-shared environments contributing to these disorders. A more robust estimate of these parameters was obtained by including non-twin siblings. Age-specific thresholds were integrated into the analyses to appropriately model the developmental patterns of behavior. We found evidence for both genetic and non-shared environmental influences for all disorders. Shared environmental influences also seem to be important for MDD and lifetime GAD.",

    "abstract": "Previous chromatographic analysis of colonic mucins from monozygotic twins with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggested a genetic mucin alteration in ulcerative colitis (UC). This study explores this further by assessing mucosal expression of the oncofetal carbohydrate antigen TF (galactose beta1, 3 N-acetylgalactosamine alpha-), among the same IBD twins.\nFormalin fixed paraffin embedded rectal biopsies were studied from 22 monozygotic twin pairs with IBD. These included eight UC twin pairs and 14 Crohn's disease (CD) twin pairs, with six pairs concordant for disease and 16 unaffected twin siblings. Closely adjacent sections were assessed by peanut lectin histochemistry for TF expression and immunohistochemically for nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) activation with investigators blinded to the diagnosis.\nUnaffected twins were almost all TF positive (15/16) compared with 5/29 histologically normal controls (p<0.0001). Unaffected UC (7/8) and CD twins (8/8) were similarly TF positive. TF positivity was confined mainly to the superficial epithelium and absent from the stem cell compartment of the lower crypts, suggesting that glycosylation changes are acquired rather than genetically determined. Activated NFkappaB was present in the surface epithelium of mucosal biopsies from 13/14 unaffected IBD twins but in only 6/22 histologically normal controls (p=0.0004). All 22 affected IBD twins were TF positive and 18 were positive for activated NFkappaB.\nAltered mucosal glycosylation in unaffected identical twins of IBD patients was confirmed in this study. This occurred in both UC and CD twins. The changes are probably acquired rather than congenital and may reflect \"preinflammatory\" NFkappaB activation.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4) is involved in activity of dopamine receptors in renal proximal tubules and thus mediates sodium reabsorption and blood pressure (BP) regulation. The present study evaluated the impact of the GRK4 gene variants on BP levels in normotensive adolescents and young adults.\nThree functional polymorphisms of R65L, A142V, and A486V were genotyped in 934 white and African American (44.2%) twin subjects (17.4 +/- 3.4 years of age). A number of association approaches including single-locus analyses, haplotype trend regression analyses, and sib-pair transmission disequilibrium tests were carried out.\nSingle-locus analyses revealed a significant interaction between R65L and age for SBP (P = .019) with an obvious gene-dose effect. In L65L homozygotes SBP showed the steepest increase with age (beta = 0.85, P = .003), R65L heterozygotes showed the next steepest increase (beta = 0.54, P < .001), and the effect of age on SBP was absent in R65R homozygotes. Stratified analyses showed that the SBP increasing effect of the 65L allele was significant only in the older group of subjects (114.1 +/- 11.1 mm Hg v 110.1 +/- 9.6 mm Hg, P = .024). Sib-pair transmission disequilibrium tests analyses in 72 informative dizygotic twin pairs confirmed the significant effect of the 65L on SBP; carriers of the 65L allele had a higher SBP compared with noncarriers (110.3 +/- 8.2 v 107.3 +/- 7.8 mm Hg, P = .047). Haplotype analyses uncovered an interaction between haplotype 65L-142V-486A and age for SBP (P = .017); individuals who were homozygous for haplotype 65L-142V-A486 showed a 1.05-mm Hg steeper increase in SBP per year increase in age compared with those homozygous for the most common R65-A142-A486 haplotype.\nOur data indicate that the R65L polymorphism of the GRK4 gene plays a role in BP regulation in adolescents and young adults.",

    "abstract": "A pair of monozygotic twins discordant for symptoms of Asperger syndrome was evaluated at the age of 13.45 years using psychometric, morphometric, behavioural, and functional imaging methods. The lower-functioning twin had a smaller brain overall, a smaller right cerebellum, and a disproportionately large left frontal lobe, and manifested almost no differential activation between distractors of high and low-congruence with target visual stimuli. The higher-functioning twin manifested a typically autistic pattern of anterior deactivation and posterior hyperactivation in response to incongruent distractors, overlaid with a typically normal pattern of activation of superior frontal cortex. The morphometric results are consistent with known correlations between brain structure and behaviour in autism, and the physiological results suggest correspondences between structure and function.",

Good preparation and advice before the babies are born, as described in Part 1 of this article (Journal of Family Health Care 2005; 15151: 143-146) is essential. After the birth, parents need continuing support and access to care from professionals who understand their different and special needs.

    "abstract": "Hemolytic uremic syndrome not associated with diarrhea (diarrhea negative, atypical) is less common than the diarrhea-positive typical form, but frequently results in end-stage renal failure. Although there are anecdotal cases of successful treatment with fresh frozen plasma alone, the value of this treatment compared with plasma exchange (PE) is difficult to assess. We describe monozygotic female twins who presented at 5 years of age with factor H-related (c.3572 > T; Ser1191Leu) atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome within months of each other. In the first twin to present, 10 sessions of PE with fresh frozen plasma replacement (40 mL/kg) resulted in resolution of hemolysis and improvement in plasma creatinine level (1.9 to 1.5 mg/dL [166 to 137 micromol/L]). Subsequently, 17 infusions of fresh frozen plasma were administered during a 4-month period for recurrent thrombocytopenia. However, within 4 months, plasma creatinine level increased to 5.1 mg/dL (450 micromol/L), necessitating peritoneal dialysis. When the second twin presented with the same disease, an extended PE regimen was instituted. After 10 daily sessions, PE was continued once every 2 weeks. Two recurrences were treated successfully with daily PE for 7 days. After 44 months of follow-up, kidney function is normal (plasma creatinine, 0.6 mg/dL [53 micromol/L]; creatinine clearance, 119 mL/min/1.73 m2 [1.98 mL/s/1.73 m2]) on maintenance PE therapy. In conclusion, the response to treatment of these monozygotic twins suggests that long-term PE may have benefits over plasma infusion alone.",

    "abstract": "Indirect estimates of obesity such as BMI seem to be strongly influenced by genetic factors in twins. Precise measurements of total and regional fat as determined by direct techniques such as DXA scan have only been applied in a few twin studies. The aim of the present study was to estimate the heritability (h(2)) of total and regional fat distribution in young and elderly Danish twins.\nMonozygotic (108) and dizygotic (88) twins in two age groups (25 to 32 and 58 to 66 years) underwent anthropometric measurements and DXA scans. Intraclass correlations and etiologic components of variance were estimated for total and regional fat percentages using biometric modeling.\nThe intraclass correlations demonstrated higher correlations for all fat percentages among monozygotic twins as compared with dizygotic twins. The biometric modeling revealed a major genetic component (h(2)) of total (h(2)(young) = 0.83, h(2)(elderly) = 0.86) and regional fat percentages (trunk, h(2)(young) = 0.82, h(2)(elderly) = 0.85; lower body, h(2)(young) = 0.83, h(2)(elderly) = 0.81; and trunk/lower body, h(2)(young) = 0.83, h(2)(elderly) = 0.71) in both the young and elderly twins.\nThe h(2) estimates emphasize that body fat and distribution as determined by DXA scan are under extensive genetic control.",

    "abstract": "Gestational and genetic factors can contribute to autism during infancy and early childhood through their effects on fetal brain development. Previous twin studies have shown strong genetic components for the development of autism, a disorder that can have multiple causes. We investigated the effects of prenatal overstimulation of the beta2-adrenergic receptor in dizygotic twins who were exposed to terbutaline, a selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist used to treat premature labor, as a gestational factor. As a possible genetic mechanism, we studied two beta2-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms in twins from whom DNA was available: glycine substitution at codon 16 (16G) and glutamic acid substitution at codon 27 (27E), which show diminished desensitization in vivo compared with the wild-type receptor. Continuous terbutaline exposure for 2 weeks or longer was associated with increased concordance for autism spectrum disorders in dizygotic twins (relative risk = 2.0), with a further increase in the risk for male twins with no other affected siblings (relative risk = 4.4). A significant association was found between the presence of 16G and 27E polymorphisms in autistic patients compared with population controls (P = .006). Prenatal overstimulation of the beta2-adrenergic receptor by terbutaline or by increased signaling of genetic polymorphisms of the beta2-adrenergic receptor that have diminished desensitization can affect cellular responses and developmental programs in the fetal brain, leading to autism.",

All suspected cases, based on discordant ultrasound findings, underwent amniocentesis of both sacs. Two cases also had chorionic villous sampling (CVS). Dual amniocentesis was superior to CVS in diagnosing heterokaryotypic monochorionic twins. In four cases, the X-chromosome was involved and autosomal aneuploidy was noted in the others. In five cases, the anomalous twin was selectively reduced by cord coagulation. All pregnancies ended with a phenotypically normal liveborn and all children are developing normally at 1-7 years of age.",

    "abstract": "Single-embryo transfer (SET) and more specifically elective SET (eSET) have taken their place in good clinical IVF/ICSI practice. After the initial cautious search for the characteristics of the twin-prone patient and of the selection of the embryo with the highest implantation potential many centres have embarked on the (progressive) implementation of SET, either by conviction or forced by legislation or both. It was only because the ongoing pregnancy rates remained largely unaffected that SET was accepted. Generally speaking, it can be said that the twinning rate after IVF/ICSI has dropped by at least 50% simply by transferring only one good-quality embryo in the first and second fresh IVF/ICSI cycles in young women, without decrease in the overall pregnancy rate. Preventing 'the second half' of IVF/ICSI twins constitutes another and probably tougher challenge because the target group is a heterogeneous mix consisting of patients in very different clinical situations. Can we expand our experience for further twin prevention to women of older age and to cycles of higher rank without a significant drop in pregnancy rates? Can we extend it to more cryopreservation cycles? To have an idea of future target groups for increased application of SET, we analysed the remaining twins after double-embryo transfer (DET), and from these data we suggest expanding the eSET policy to women <38 years of age until the third cycle and to cryopreservation cycles.",

    "abstract": "One possible explanation of the commonly reported associations between early onset cannabis use and elevated risks of other illicit drug use is that early onset cannabis use increases access and availability to other drugs. It was this argument that in part motivated policy changes in the Netherlands that led to the de facto legalization of cannabis there. This study examines, using a co-twin control design, whether previously observed associations between early onset cannabis use and elevated lifetime rates of other illicit drug use would also be observed in a sample of 219 same sex Dutch twin pairs discordant for cannabis use before age 18. After adjustment for covariates, rates of lifetime party drug use (OR=7.4, 95% CI=2.3-23.4), hard drug use (OR=16.5, 95% CI=2.4-111.3), but not regular cannabis use (OR=1.3, 95% CI=0.3-5.1) were significantly elevated in individuals who reported early onset cannabis use, relative to their co-twin who had not used cannabis by age 18. The elevated odds of subsequent illicit drug use in early cannabis users relative to their non early using co-twins suggests that this association could not be explained by common familial risk factors, either genetic or environmental, for which our co-twin methodology provided rigorous control.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twin sisters, with nonhematologic symptoms of Fanconi anemia (FA), were discovered to be somatic mosaics for mutations in the FANCA gene. Skin fibroblasts, but not lymphocytes or committed hematopoietic progenitors, were sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents. Molecular analysis revealed, in skin cells of both twins, a frameshift causing deletion in exon 27 (2555deltaT) and an exon 28 missense mutation (2670G>A/R880Q). The latter resulted in primarily cytoplasmic expression and reduced function of the mutant FANCA (R880Q) protein. Surprisingly, the same acquired exon 30 missense change (2927G>A/E966K) was detected in the hematopoietic cells of both sisters, but not in their fibroblasts, nor in either parent. This compensatory mutation existed in cis with the maternal exon 28 mutation, and it restored function and nuclear localization of the resulting protein. Both sisters have been free of hematologic symptoms for more than 2 decades, suggesting that this de novo mutation occurred prenatally in a single hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) in one twin and that descendants of this functionally corrected HSC, via intra-uterine circulation, repopulated the blood lineages of both sisters. This finding suggests that treating FA patients with gene therapy might require transduction of only a few hematopoietic stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Ring the last decades, numerous genes for general cognitive ability were identified on human X-chromosome. They were discovered primarily because of X-linked mutations causing nonspecific mental retardation in males. Evidence for imprinted loci on the X chromosome affecting neurodevelopment was found in studies on 45,X females. Investigation of transmission of X-linked traits in normal individuals might further contribute to problem of shaping human being's mind ability. We suggest monozygous female twins discordant for a parent-of-origin of the X chromosome inactivation to be a proper subject for such explorations.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we correlated cardiac malformations in the various types of conjoined twins with the proposed site of embryologic union and evaluated the possibility of survival after surgical separation. We conclude that surgical separation is only very rarely successful in twins with united hearts, whereas survival in twins with separate hearts is more dependent on the malformations of other viscera. This report deals primarily with conjoined twins in whom anomalies of the heart are the major factor in deciding whether surgical separation is feasible.",

    "abstract": "Twins in developing countries may be disadvantaged due to their small size at birth, compromised nutrition and high infection risk. Although twinning is common in Africa, there are few longitudinal studies of growth and morbidity in this high-risk group. The aim of the present paper was to describe growth and morbidity of Malawian twins compared to singletons.\nMorbidity episodes were recorded at 4 weekly intervals and at extra visits made to health centres for illness. Weight, length, head and arm circumference were recorded at birth and weight, length and MUAC at 4 weekly intervals to 52 weeks of age.\nTwins showed reduced fetal growth compared to singletons, with increasing fall-off in percentiles from 33 weeks gestation. Infant growth percentiles for twins were below those for singletons at all ages, but showed no fall-off from singleton percentile values. There were no differences in morbidity incidence during infancy between twins and singletons.\nMalawian twins showed no catch-up growth during infancy, their smaller size was not associated with higher morbidity incidence compared to singletons.",

    "abstract": "Clinical evidence and experimental evidence suggest that anti-Ro/La autoantibodies are necessary but not sufficient for the development of congenital complete heart block (CCHB). Maternal, fetal, and environmental factors may also contribute to heart damage in CCHB. The aim of our study was to investigate polymorphisms of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) genes in twins and triplets discordant for CCHB whose mothers are anti-Ro/La positive.\nWe studied 2 families in which 1 of the mothers gave birth to triplets and the other gave birth to twins. Only 1 child in each family was affected by CCHB, although 1 of the triplets had incomplete heart block. We analyzed TNFalpha and TGFbeta1 polymorphisms in the 2 babies with CCHB and their siblings. TNFalpha polymorphisms at the promoter region and TGFbeta1 polymorphisms at codons 10 and 25 were determined using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In addition, the production of TGFbeta1 and TNFalpha by resting or mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in cell culture supernatants was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nThe profibrotic TGFbeta1 genotype was detected in the twin with CCHB but not in the healthy twin, while all of the triplets displayed the same TGFbeta1 genotype at codon 10. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the children with CCHB displayed higher spontaneous and mitogen-stimulated TGFbeta1 secretion than was observed in their siblings. No differences regarding TNFalpha polymorphisms and secretion of TNFalpha were observed.\nThe results of this study suggest that, besides anti-Ro/La autoantibodies, a fetal profibrotic response might contribute to the development of CCHB, but additional pathogenic mechanism(s) are also likely to play a role.",

    "abstract": "Twins represent a powerful resource for revealing multifactorial mechanisms in human diseases. Few reports are available on nephrotic syndrome in twins, and most furnish only a partial description of genetic identity based on human leukocyte antigens (HLA) analysis. We describe two pairs of mono and dizygotic twins with nephrotic syndrome who presented discordant outcomes in terms of length and required therapies. In one case, evolution to focal glomerulosclerosis was also documented. The basic molecular work-up included analysis of concordance based on 10 polymorphic markers (D3S1358, vVA, FGA, amelogenin, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, D7S820) and exclusion of the major slit-diaphragm gene mutation (NPHS2, CD2AP, WT1) causing nephrotic syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first description of long-term outcome in mono- and dizygotic twins with proven genetic concordance. Discordant outcomes indicate a major influence of environmental and/or epigenetic multifactorial mechanisms on persistence and evolution of the disease to focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "In euthyroid individuals, autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOab) and thyroglobulin (Tgab) are regarded as early markers of thyroid autoimmunity. Family and twin studies suggest that development of thyroid autoantibodies in first-degree relatives of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease is under genetic influence. We aimed to estimate the relative importance of genetic and environmental effects for the presence of thyroid autoantibodies in euthyroid subjects.\nA representative sample of healthy twin pairs was identified through the Danish Twin Registry; 1372 individuals, divided into 283 monozygotic (MZ), 285 dizygotic same sex (DZ), and 118 opposite sex twin pairs were investigated. Serum TPOab and serum Tgab were measured. Proband-wise concordance and intraclass correlations were calculated, and quantitative genetic modelling was performed.\nProbandwise concordance and intraclass correlations were consistently higher for MZ than for DZ twin pairs indicating genetic influence. Genetic components (with 95% confidence intervals) accounted for 73% (46-89%) of the liability of being thyroid antibody positive. Adjusting for covariates (age, TSH and others), the estimate for genetic influence on serum TPOab concentrations was 61% (49-70%) in males and 72% (64-79%) in females. For serum Tgab concentrations, the estimates were 39% (24-51%) and 75% (66-81%) respectively.\nEarly markers of thyroid autoimmunity appear to be under strong genetic influence. The analyses suggest that it is the same set of genes that operate in males and females. However, complex mechanisms such as dominance and/or epistasis may be involved.",

    "abstract": "To report on the rare simultaneous occurrence of Graves' disease (GD) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) in monozygotic twins.\nWe compared the pattern of thyroid tissue-derived cDNAs to gain insight into previous and ongoing immune destruction and reconstruction processes using microarrays. The results were confirmed by immunohistology and real-time PCR.\nDestruction of thyroid tissue in HT reduced levels of thyrocyte-related cDNAs and cDNAs encoding extracellular matrix components, but increased levels of proteases involved in extracellular matrix degradation compared with GD. Lymphocytic infiltrates forming ectopic follicles replaced the thyroid tissue almost completely in HT. Thus, lymphocyte-related cDNA levels were higher in HT than in GD. The same was true for many chemokines and their receptors, which not only enable migration towards the thyroid but also maintain the lymphocytic infiltrate. HT also showed increased levels of cDNAs encoding molecules related to apoptosis than did GD. Surprisingly, the Th1- and Th2-specific cytokine profiles suggested for HT and GD respectively could not be confirmed. cDNAs encoding factors and receptors involved in angiogenesis were increased in GD compared with HT.\nComparison of gene expression reflects the cellular differences between the two types of autoimmune thyroid disease in twins with identical genetic and similar environmental background.",

    "results": "Destruction of thyroid tissue in HT reduced levels of thyrocyte-related cDNAs and cDNAs encoding extracellular matrix components, but increased levels of proteases involved in extracellular matrix degradation compared with GD. Lymphocytic infiltrates forming ectopic follicles replaced the thyroid tissue almost completely in HT. Thus, lymphocyte-related cDNA levels were higher in HT than in GD. The same was true for many chemokines and their receptors, which not only enable migration towards the thyroid but also maintain the lymphocytic infiltrate. HT also showed increased levels of cDNAs encoding molecules related to apoptosis than did GD. Surprisingly, the Th1- and Th2-specific cytokine profiles suggested for HT and GD respectively could not be confirmed. cDNAs encoding factors and receptors involved in angiogenesis were increased in GD compared with HT.",

In the fetus, the prenatal recognition of PUV is feasible. However, it has been repeatedly reported in singletons but never in monochorionic twins. We describe two cases of early prenatal diagnosis of concordant PUVs in monochorionic twins. In one of the sets, the expression of the disease was different for each twin.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the association and linkage between the S447X polymorphism of LPL gene and serum lipids, blood pressures in the general population-based twin cohort of China.\nThe twin subjects were collected based on the twin registry system of China. All twins were investigated by a standard questionnaire and physical examinations. PCR-RFLP method was used to detect the genotypes of S447X. Stratified by gender, the associations of S447X polymorphism with the serum lipids (TG, HDL), blood pressures (SBP, DBP) and their abnormalities were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods. The Halesman-Elston regression based nonjparameter linkage analysis was applied in the DZ twins.\nA total of 962 adult twin pairs were analyzed and the frequency of 447X allele was 8.6%. The heritabilities of TG, HDL, SBP and DBP were 57%, 68%, 46% and 44%, respectively. In female twins, univariate and multivariate association analyses showed that the 447X allele was associated with the 12.9% decrease of TG and 2.7 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa) decrease of SBP, 1.8 mm Hg decrease of DBP. Also in female twins, 447X allele was associated with the lower risks of high TG dyslipidaemia, low HDL dyslipidaemia and hypertension, with the odds ratios 0.38 (95%CI: 0.20-0.76), 0.49 (95%CI: 0.29-0.81) and 0.47(95%CI: 0.25-0.86), respectively.\nThis study showed significant associations between the S447X polymorphism of LPL gene and the improved serum lipids, decreased blood pressures in the female twins. But no associations were observed in male twins, and no linkage evidences were found between the locus site of S447X polymorphism and the trait loci of serum lipids, blood pressures. So the associations maybe caused by the other functional SNPs within or near LPL gene, which might be in significant linkage disequilibrium with 447X mutation.",

    "abstract": "We studied the impact of genetic versus pre- and postnatal environmental factors on the plasma levels of IL6, TNF and the soluble TNF receptor superfamily, member 1A (TNFRSF1A, previously known as TNF receptor type1 [TNFR1]).\nUsing the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, we assessed the association between cytokine levels and both peripheral insulin sensitivity and hepatic glucose production. Fasting plasma IL6, TNF and soluble TNFRSF1A levels were measured using ELISA in 55 young and 43 elderly twin pairs.\nPlasma IL6 and TNF were influenced by genetic factors in young and elderly twins respectively, while no significant impact of genetics was found for soluble TNFRSF1A. Significant intra-twin pair correlations between birthweight and both IL6 and soluble TNFRSF1A levels were found. In addition to the effect of birthweight on IL6, age and fat % also significantly influenced IL6 levels, whereas soluble TNFRSF1A levels were significantly influenced by zygosity, age, fat % and sex. Plasma soluble TNFRSF1A was associated with higher plasma NEFA and to some extent with reduced insulin sensitivity. Plasma IL6 was associated positively with basal NEFA. TNF level was not associated with in vivo glucose or fat metabolism after correction for known confounders.\nPlasma IL6 and soluble TNFRSF1A are influenced by the intrauterine environment. We found some evidence of a genetic component for TNF and IL6 in young and elderly twins respectively. Plasma IL6 may influence basal lipolysis, but neither plasma TNF nor IL6 levels are independently associated with hepatic or peripheral insulin action. Nevertheless, plasma soluble TNFRSF1A may play some role in the control of insulin action.",

    "abstract": "Deterioration in stratum corneum reticular patterning (skin pattern or skin wrinkling) has been associated with increased rates of solar keratoses and skin cancer. A previous analysis of data from the twin sample used in this investigation has shown that 86% of the variation in skin pattern is genetic at age 12 and 62% in an adult sample (mean age = 47.5). Variation due to genetic influences is likely to be influenced by more than one locus. Here, we present results of a genome-wide linkage scan of skin pattern in adolescent twins and siblings from 428 nuclear twin families. Sib-pair linkage analysis was performed on skin pattern data collected from twins at age 12 (378 informative families) and 14 (316 families). Suggestive linkage was found at marker D12S397 (12p13.31, logarithm of the odds (lod) 1.94), when the effect of the trait locus was modelled to influence the skin pattern equally at both ages 12 and 14. In the same analysis, a peak was seen at 4q23 with a lod score of 1.55. A possible candidate for the peak at 12p13.31 is the protease inhibitor, alpha-2-macroglobulin.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are the rarest type of monozygotic, monochorionic, monoamniotic twins--incidence about 1:50000 - 1:100000. A conjoined twin pregnancy is a very special pathology in obstetrics and usually ends prematurely. 40% of twins are stillborn, while 35% die within 24 hours after delivery. The development of ultrasonography and in the last years also MRI, allows earlier detection and diagnosis of fetal malformation and enables precise evaluation of the anatomy, type of malformation and how the twins are conjoined. Chances of survival and way of delivery depends on the degree of fusion of the organs and possibilities of surgical separation. Obstetric care for a women with conjoined twins does not differ from that in a normal twin pregnancy, but the newborns require special medical care after delivery. We would like to stress the diagnostic problems and the difficult decisions that we encountered. The degree of conjoinment in this case excluded surgical separation of the twins. A multidisciplinary team of experts decided to end the pregnancy at 31 wks by cesarean section. Delivery at a later term could increase the risk of uterine rupture and surgical complications.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia postulates that a dysfunctional dopaminergic system is a major pathophysiological mechanism in the disease. Most studies have focused on striatal dopamine D2 receptors, but a disturbed link between dopamine D1 and D2 receptors has also been proposed. Schizophrenia is highly heritable, and recent evidence suggests that alterations in the dopaminergic system confer susceptibility for schizophrenia instead of being solely related to the to overt expression of the disease. To explore the impact of genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia on the balance of striatal dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, we studied monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) unaffected co-twins from twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia as well as healthy control twins using positron emission tomography (PET). Both [(11)C]SCH 23390 and [(11)C]raclopride were used to quantitate D1 and D2 receptor binding, respectively, in the same individuals during the same day. The association between D1 and D2 receptor binding was analyzed using conventional region of interests as well as voxel-wise D1/D2 ratio maps. All levels of analyses failed to show any differences in D1/D2 ratio between the unaffected MZ or DZ co-twins and control twins. We noted rostrocaudally declining and dorsoventrally increasing gradients in D1/D2 ratio in the striatum, with no differences between groups in these gradients. In this sample, we did not find evidence for an association between increased genetic risk for schizophrenia and altered D1/D2 receptor balance in the striatum.",

    "abstract": "We adopted the twin method to disentangle the genetic and environmental components of susceptibility to coeliac disease (CD). We estimated disease concordance rate by zygosity and HLA genotypes, discordance times, progression rates to disease, and heritability.\nWe crosslinked the Italian Twin Registry with the membership lists of the Italian Coeliac Disease Association and recruited 23 monozygotic (MZ) and 50 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs with at least one affected member. Zygosity was assigned by DNA fingerprinting, and HLA-DQ and DR alleles were genotyped. Disease status was ascertained by antiendomysial, anti-human tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and bowel biopsy.\nConcordance was significantly higher in MZ (83.3% probandwise, 71.4% pairwise) than in DZ (16.7% probandwise, 9.1% pairwise) pairs. Concordance was not affected by sex or HLA genotype of the co-twin and being MZ was significantly associated with the occurrence of CD (Cox adjusted hazard ratio 14.3 (95% confidence interval 4.0-50.3)). In 90% of concordant pairs the discordance time was <or=2 years. MZ and DZ co-twins had 70% and 9% cumulative probability of having symptomatic or silent forms of CD, respectively, within five years. Under ACE (additive genetic, common, and unshared environmental factors) models, with CD population prevalences of 1/91 and 1/1000, heritability estimates were 87% and 57%, respectively.\nMZ pairs have a high probability of being concordant, regardless of sex or HLA genotype.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate familial influences and their dependence on sex for panic disorder and/or agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder and major depression. Data from Australian (N = 2287) and Dutch (N = 1185) twins and siblings who were selected for a linkage study and participated in clinical interviews to obtain lifetime Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) diagnoses were used. In a liability model, tetrachoric correlations were estimated in sibling pairs and sex differences between sibling correlations were tested. For each diagnosis, the sibling correlations could be constrained to be equal across the Australian and Dutch samples. With the exception of panic disorder and/or agoraphobia, all sibling correlations were the same for brother, sister and opposite-sex sibling pairs and were around .20. For panic disorder and/or agoraphobia, the correlation was .23 in brother and sister pairs, but absent in opposite-sex sibling pairs. From these results it can be concluded that upper heritability estimates, based on twice the correlations in the sibling pairs, vary between 36% (major depression) and 50% (social phobia). Furthermore, different genetic risk factors appear to contribute to the vulnerability for panic disorder and/or agoraphobia in men and women. No other sex differences were found.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol abuse and dependence are among the most common psychiatric conditions identified in epidemiological surveys of the general population. The aim of this article is to examine the psychometric properties of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria for alcohol abuse and dependence using latent class analysis (LCA). Six thousand two hundred and sixty-five young Australian twins (median age 30 years) were interviewed by telephone between 1996 and 2000 using a modified version of the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA). DSM-IV symptoms of alcohol abuse and dependence were collected by structured diagnostic interview and analyzed using methods of LCA. LCA revealed a 4-class solution for women that classified individuals according to the severity of their alcohol-related problems: no/few problems (66.5%), heavy drinking (23.9%), moderate dependence (7.6%) and severe dependence (2.0%). Among men the preferred solution included 5 classes corresponding to no/few problems (46.4%), heavy drinking (34.3%), moderate dependence (12.2%), severe dependence (3.0%) and abuse (4.0%). Evidence of a male-specific class of alcohol-related problems corresponding to abuse partially supports the DSM conceptualization of alcohol use disorders but suggests that this conceptualization--and measurement--may need to be refined for women. Identification of a male-specific abuse class also has important implications for interventions and treatment as these individuals experienced significant alcohol-related problems and comprised approximately 21% of all men classified with an alcohol use disorder.",

    "abstract": "Apert syndrome, or acrocephalosyndactyly, is characterized by craniosynostosis and early epiphyseal closure resulting in various deformities of the skull, hands, and feet. Typically a sporadic condition, autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance has been known to occur. Most adolescents with the disorder are prone to the development of severe pustular facial and truncal acne, with extension to the upper arms and forearm. We report twin brothers with Apert syndrome who, after 2 years of standard management by their pediatrician, were referred for management of complicated acne. In our patients there were a constellation of findings consistent with the disorder and, of importance to this report, significant dermatological manifestations. On presentation, each brother was found to have acne vulgaris of a different stage. Our patients were refractory to conventional treatment for acne but one required and had a significant response to isotretinoin. The risk/benefit ratio in treating acne lesions with isotretinoin in a teenager with Apert syndrome is reviewed.",

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that low birth weight twins have a higher risk of osteoportotic fracture in later life, we investigated the association between fetal IGF axis and type-1 collagen markers of bone turnover in monochorionic (MC) twins with or without discordant birth weight of >or=20%.\nMaternal and cord bloods were collected from gestational age matched MC twins of discordant (n = 16) and concordant birth weights (n = 16). The samples were assayed for cross linked carboxyl terminal telopeptide (ICTP, a marker of bone resorption) and pro-peptide (PICP, a marker of bone formation) of type I collagen, IGF-1, and IGFBP-1 by radio-immunoassay.\nThe growth-restricted twins (IUGR) of discordant group had higher fetal IGFBP-1 and ICTP (P < 0.001) levels, while PICP (P < 0.001) was lower than the co-twins with normal weight (AGA). In contrast, cord blood levels of IGF-1, IGFBP-1, ICTP, and PICP in concordant twin pairs were comparable to AGA twins. The concordant and AGA twins had a positive correlation between ICTP and PICP levels (y = 23x - 711; r = 0.84; P < 0.001; n = 48) but no such association was found in IUGR twins. Instead, IGFBP-1 levels in IUGR twins had a negative association with PICP (r = 0.81; P < 0.001; n = 16) and a positive correlation with ICTP (r- = 0.51; P < 0.05; n = 16). No such association was found in concordant and AGA twins.\nThese data suggest that growth-restricted twins had high bone turnover, due to elevated IGFBP-1.

    "abstract": "Asthma and obesity are common conditions that are strongly associated. This association might be due to shared genetic or environmental causes.\nWe sought to determine whether a shared genetic cause is responsible for the association between asthma and obesity and to estimate the magnitude of shared genetic cause.\nThe analyses were performed with 1001 monozygotic and 383 dizygotic same-sex twin pairs within the University of Washington Twin Registry. The presence of asthma was determined by self-report of a physician diagnosis of asthma, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated by using self-reported height and weight. Obesity was defined as a BMI of 30 or greater. The association between asthma and BMI was assessed by means of mixed-effects ordinal regression. Twin correlations examined the association of asthma and obesity. Univariate and bivariate structural equation models estimated the components of variance attributable to genetic and environmental effects.\nA strong association between asthma and BMI was identified in the sample population (P < .001). Substantial heritability was detected for asthma (53%) and obesity (77%), which is indicative of additive genetic influences on each disorder. The best-fitting model of shared components of variance indicated that 8% of the genetic component of obesity is shared with asthma.\nThe covariation between obesity and asthma is predominantly caused by shared genetic risk factors for both conditions.",

They both have had discrete leukoderma regions in the axillae, inguinal region and lower abdomen since birth. The size and the shape did not change until at least the age of nine. Development of both patients was otherwise normal. The split-DOPA reaction revealed no DOPA-positive melanocytes in the hypomelanotic skin, but electron microscopy revealed melanocytes that were regular but decreased in number. Cytogenetic analysis of the peripheral leukocytes revealed normal female karyotype in both cases. Considering the unique pattern of the leukoderma lesions which occurred in both monozygotic twins, this might be a new clinical entity.",

    "abstract": "The reduced contribution of physical activity (PA) to daily energy expenditure contributes to the increased prevalence of obesity. A genetic control of activity-induced energy expenditure (AEE) may contribute to a genetic susceptibility to obesity.\nOur aim was to investigate the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the variation and covariation in AEE and PA.\nTwelve monozygotic and 8 same-sex dizygotic (including 2 same-sex sibling pairs; age differences: 2 and 2.5 y) twin pairs aged between 18 and 39 y participated. AEE was measured in a respiration chamber for 24 h and with doubly labeled water in daily life for 2 wk. PA was recorded simultaneously with a triaxial accelerometer. Structural equation modeling was used to separate and quantify the observed variance into sex-adjusted additive genetic and common and unique environmental contributions.\nIn the respiration chamber, common and unique environmental factors explained the variance in AEE and PA, and no genetic contribution was found. In daily life, genetic factors explained 72% of the variance in AEE and 78% of the variance in PA. Unique environmental factors explained the remaining variance. The same additive genetic factors explained 67% of the covariance in AEE and PA in daily life.\nIn the present exploratory study that used gold standard measurements for AEE and PA but a limited sample size, genetic influence explained a large part of the variation in AEE and PA in daily life, whereas both AEE and PA were influenced by environment only within the confined area of the respiration chamber.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to determine the association between unmarried status and infant mortality among twins born to teenagers.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study on twin live births to teenagers in the United States from 1995 through 1998 using the Vital Records assembled by the National Center for Health Statistics. We compared mortality estimates among twins of single to those of married mothers using the generalized estimating equation framework, which also adjusted for intracluster correlations.\nAnalysis involved 28592 individual twins of teenager mothers, with both cluster members being live-born. Out of these, 21.8% (n = 6238) were born to married and 78.2% (n = 22,354) to single mothers. Infant and postneonatal mortality was 17% and 36% higher among twins of single teenager mothers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.40) and (OR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.01-1.87), respectively. However, neonatal mortality was comparable (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 0.92-1.34). Twins of single mothers were also more likely to be of low birth weight, very low birth weight, preterm and very preterm (p < 0.0001) but had the same risk level for smallness for gestational age as compared to twins of married teenagers.\nSingle motherhood was associated with increased infant mortality among twins born to teenagers. The critical time of elevated risk was the postneonatal period and the survival disadvantage of twins of single mothers was as a result of the higher-than-expected level of preterm rather than small for gestational age births. These findings have potential clinical and public health relevance.",

    "abstract": "A female spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth belzebuth) that gave birth to twins was studied during 13 months, and her activity budget and diet were compared to those of females with single offspring and females with no offspring to assess selective pressures that could influence litter size. We recorded qualitative information on the development and social interactions of the twins and three other single infants. Emi, the female that had the twins, had the highest proportion of resting time and the lowest proportion of feeding and moving time compared to other adult females and males. Emi also had the lowest average daily travel distance and relied more heavily on flowers and leaves than other group members who included a higher proportion of fruits in their diets. These results suggest that twins are energetically costly to spider monkeys because of the direct energy allocated into raising and carrying the twins and, also, because these costs have direct effects in the ability of a mother to obtain high-quality resources (e.g., fruits). The twins had a slower rate of physical and social development as well as a smaller body size compared to same-aged singletons by the end of the study. Thus, the extended periods of maternal care and the costs associated with rearing and carrying offspring are some of the factors that influence the evolution and maintenance of a litter size of one in most anthropoid primates.",

    "abstract": "This study explored the factorial structure of the Italian version of the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders questionnaire (SCARED), and investigated the contributions of genetic and environmental influences of individual variation of anxiety dimensions as reported in the SCARED. Three hundred and seventy-eight twin pairs aged 8-17 from the Italian Twin Registry filled in the SCARED through a mail survey. Four, distinct empirical factors, that corresponded closely to the original SCARED subscales of Generalized Anxiety (GAD), Panic (PD), Social Phobia (SP), and Separation Anxiety (SAD) disorder emerged from Exploratory Factor Analysis. The empirically derived scores were analyzed by structural equation modeling; moderate-to-high heritability, without age or sex differences, emerged for all dimensions with the exception of GAD, for which an age effect was found. The DSM-IV anxiety dimensions identified by the SCARED have a psychometric structure that can be replicated in the Italian culture, and are influenced at different extents by genetic and nonshared environmental determinants.",

According to the frequent sites of CpG islands (-CGCG- and -CCGG-), three groups of isochizomers with distinct methylation sensitivity (Sma I-Xma I, Hpa II-Msp I and BssH II-Pau I/BseP I) were used to modify the AIMS method. The modified AIMS method combined with Personal Molecular Imager FX system analysis and radioautographic analysis was used to make the global detection of the methylome of CpG islands. Multiple anonymous bands were compared between the twins with the Quantity One bio-soft. The different bands were cloned into T vectors and positive clones were sequenced. BLAST analysis of positive clone sequences was conducted to give the clues for the differential methylated genes between monozygotic twins with discordant phenotype of HBV infection.\nNearly the same bands were found between one pair of twins with concordant phenotype of HBV infection. Different methylated bands were found not only between monozygotic twins with concordant phenotype but also between those with disconcordant phenotype. More differential methylated bands were found in the latter groups. By BLAST analysis with sequences of differential methylated bands, four possible genes were got.

    "abstract": "To assess the relative contribution of genetic factors in antipsychotic-induced weight gain, we explored the similarity in body mass index (BMI) (kg/m(2)) change under clozapine only (clozapine DeltaBMI) and upon additional inclusion of BMI change under prior antipsychotic medication (total DeltaBMI) of five monozygotic twins in comparison with seven same-sex sibs. Twin and sib pairs were identified by a telephone screening of 786 office-based psychiatrists. Measured data on weight and other clinical variables were obtained cross-sectionally and retrospectively from medical records. We found greater similarity in total DeltaBMI in monozygotic twins (intrapair difference 2.78+/-3.41 kg/m(2)) than in same-sex sibs (5.55+/-4.35 kg/m(2)), resulting in heritability estimates of h(2)=0.8 and A=0.45 (ACE twin model). However, intrapair differences in clozapine DeltaBMI were similar between twins (4.18+/-4.27 kg/m(2)) and sibs (4.68+/-4.88 kg/m(2)). We hypothesize that the weight plateau achieved under clozapine is influenced by genetic factors. The weight gain achieved during pretreatment with other antipsychotics seems to limit clozapine-induced weight gain, thus presumably explaining why heritability/similarity in monozygotic twins in comparison with same-sex sibs is greater for total DeltaBMI than for clozapine DeltaBMI. An important caveat is that, owing to the sample size, the heritability estimates have a large standard error and thus have to be interpreted with caution.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolves in vivo under selective pressure from CD8+ T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses, which are in turn determined by host and viral genetic factors, such as restricting major histocompatibility complex molecules and the available viral epitope sequences. However, CTL are derived stochastically through the random gene rearrangements to produce T-cell receptors (TCR), and the relative impact of genetic versus stochastic processes on CTL targeting of HIV and immune-driven viral evolution is unclear. Here we evaluate identical twins infected with HIV-1 as neonates from a common blood transfusion, with subsequently similar environmental exposures, thereby allowing controlled comparisons of CTL targeting and viral evolution. Seventeen years after infection, their CTL targeting of HIV-1 was remarkably similar. In contrast, their overall TCR profiles were highly dissimilar, and a dominant epitope was recognized by distinctly different TCR in each twin. Furthermore, their viral epitopes had diverged, and there was ongoing viral phylogenetic divergence between the twins between 12 and 17 years after infection. These results indicate that while CTL targeting is predominately genetically determined, stochastic influences render the interaction of HIV-1 and host immunity, and therefore viral escape and CTL efficacy, unpredictable.",

Nondemented co-twins included 23 monozygotic and 62 dizygotic twins; there were 27 normal control twins. Both monozygotic and dizygotic nondemented co-twins of dementia cases scored significantly lower than normal control twins on 5 of 10 cognitive tests. Moreover, monozygotic co-twins of dementia cases had a generally lower score profile than dizygotic co-twins of dementia cases did. These findings show that being at greater genetic risk for dementia is reflected in cognitive performance even in the absence of a diagnosis of dementia.",

    "abstract": "The main purpose of this study was to determine the vocal quality characteristics among the 45 monozygotic cotwins (MT). As the performance of the voice is related to several genetically determined anatomical and physiological factors, the authors hypothesized that the vocal characteristics and the overall vocal quality by means of the Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI) will be identical in MT. An additional objective of this study was to determine whether sex and age influence vocal similarities in MT and to compare the voice characteristics of MT with the normative data of unrelated peers. As more environmental factors influence the aging of the voice, age-related differences were expected. No sex-related differences were expected. Subjective and objective assessment techniques determined the vocal quality. No significant differences were obtained, and most comparisons resulted in significant correlation coefficients. For the acoustic parameters jitter and shimmer only, no significant correlation coefficients could be obtained. It is clear that the perceptual voice characteristics, the laryngeal aerodynamic measurements of maximum phonation time (MPT), the vocal performances, and the overall vocal quality by means of the DSI are similar in MT. These vocal characteristics are not influenced either by the subjects' age or sex and are situated within the normative range of unrelated peers. To what extent other aspects (environment, anxiety, tension, etc) might play a role in the acoustical dimensions regarding frequency and amplitude perturbation, which were in the normal range, is a subject of further research.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal hemochromatosis (NH) is a rare disease of gestation that results in fetal liver injury and extrahepatic siderosis. The etiology of NH is not fully understood. However, the rate of recurrence of NH in the pregnancy after an affected one is approximately 80%. A spectrum of liver disease has been recognized, spanning from liver failure in the fetus or neonate to infants that survive with medical therapy. Here we report on 2 sets of fraternal twins, each set with a gross disparity in the severity of presentation: 1 infant with liver failure and the other nearly unaffected. These findings suggest a need to look carefully for subclinical disease in the siblings of patients with NH by using sensitive tests such as those for ferritin and alpha-fetoprotein. They also suggest that affected infants may be missed when using routine clinical testing, which would lead to the apparent rate of recurrence, understating the actual recurrence rate.",

    "abstract": "Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is mediated through translocation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. Thus, skeletal muscle GLUT4 content plays an important role in whole-body insulin sensitivity.\nThe objectives of this study were 1) to examine the relative impact of genetic vs. environmental factors on skeletal muscle GLUT4 mRNA expression using biometric modeling, and 2) to identify factors influencing the expression of GLUT4 and insulin-stimulated whole-body metabolism.\nWe measured GLUT4 mRNA expression in biopsies from young and elderly monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins before and during a 2-h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp including 3-(3)H-tritiated glucose and indirect calorimetry.\nA random sample of young (22-31 yr; n = 89) and elderly (57-66 yr; n = 69) same sex MZ and DZ twin pairs identified through the Danish Twin Register were studied.\nWe found a major genetic component in the control of basal and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 mRNA expression in young and elderly twins. GLUT4 gene expression increased upon insulin stimulation in both young and elderly twins. Multiple regression analysis revealed that both basal and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 mRNA expressions were positively related to birth weight and total body aerobic capacity and were higher in MZ vs. DZ twins as well as in males vs. females. Both basal and insulin-stimulated expressions of GLUT4 were independently and significantly related to whole-body in vivo insulin action, nonoxidative glucose metabolism, and glucose oxidation.\nWe show that skeletal muscle GLUT4 gene expression in twins is significantly and independently related to glucose metabolism and is determined by both genetic and nongenetic factors, including zygosity and birth weight.",

    "abstract": "Prevalence of childhood anxiety disorders at specific ages and genetic etiological influences on anxiety disorders in young children have been little studied. The present study reports prevalence estimates in a community sample of 6-year-old twins, and patterns of genetic and environmental influences on these early-onset anxiety disorders.\nUsing a two-phase design 4,662 twin-pairs were sampled and 854 pairs were assessed in the second phase by maternal-informant diagnostic interview using DSM-IV criteria.\nThe most common conditions were separation anxiety disorder (SAD) [2.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.8, for current disorder] and specific phobia (10.8%, 95% CI 8.4-13.6, for current disorder). Behavioral genetic modeling was feasible for these two conditions, applied to two phenotypes: symptom syndrome (regardless of impairment) and the narrower one of diagnostic status (symptom syndrome with associated impairment). The heritability estimate for SAD diagnostic status was high, 73%, with remaining variance attributed to non-shared environment. The heritability estimates for specific phobia were also high, 80% for the symptom syndrome and 60% for diagnostic status, with remaining variance attributed in both cases to non-shared environment.\nCompared with previous epidemiological surveys of children and adolescents in wide age-bands, the current estimates suggest that rates of anxiety disorders assessed in young childhood are generally at least as high and perhaps higher compared with those found in older children. The heritability estimates suggest that the genetic effects on these early-onset anxiety disorders are substantial and more significant than environmental effects, whether shared or non-shared.",

    "abstract": "A 34-year-old woman was referred to our hospital complaining of sore throat and arthralgia. She had low-grade fever, tachycardia, and goiter with tenderness. Laboratory data revealed thyrotoxicosis and tests for acute inflammatory markers were positive. Thyroidal radioactive iodine uptake was below normal. Ultrasonography of thyroid revealed mild thyroid enlargement and hypoechogenic areas consistent with tenderness. Subacute thyroiditis was diagnosed and prednisone was administered. Two years later, her identical twin sister, who lives separately, was referred to our hospital because of neck pain, low-grade fever, and palpitation. She exhibited the same clinical picture as her twin sister, and was also diagnosed as having subacute thyroiditis. Although the cause of subacute thyroiditis remains unclear, viral infection has been implicated in the onset of subacute thyroiditis in genetically predisposed individuals. We could not identify the viruses, but heterozygotes for HLA-B35, which has been reported to be linked with subacute thyroiditis, were found in the twins. This supports the suspicion that genetic factors, including this HLA haplotype, play a critical role in the onset of subacute thyroiditis.",

    "abstract": "We examined the impact of cigarette smoking on fetal growth among twins by analyzing matched twin live births in the United States from 1995 through 1998. The outcomes of interest were low and very low birthweight, preterm and very preterm birth, and small for gestational age. Out of a total of 163,901 mothers, 19,234 reported active smoking during pregnancy (11.7%). Twins born to smokers weighed an average of 182 g less than their counterparts born to nonsmokers (p<0.001). The risk for fetal growth inhibition was greater among twins of smokers: low birthweight (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.84; 95% confidence Interval [CI], 1.79 to 1.89), very low birthweight (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.32), preterm (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.16), very preterm (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.23), and small for gestational age (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.84 to 1.98). In conclusion, prenatal smoking significantly inhibits fetal growth among twins, and small for gestational age appeared more affected than shortened gestation.",

    "abstract": "A Danish cohort of twins with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), has previously been collected. The aim of the present study was to reassess this cohort in order to compare clinical characteristics in concordant versus discordant twin pairs, test twin zygosity genetically, follow-up on disease concordance, and examine NOD2/CARD15 genetic status.\nThe Danish cohort is one of two population-based cohorts worldwide and consists of 103 twin pairs. After median 13 yr of follow-up, all twins were contacted and hospital files were scrutinized to reassess disease concordance and obtain phenotype data. DNA was obtained from 123 twins for analysis of zygosity and prevalence of the three common NOD2/CARD15 mutations.\nZygosity tested genetically was consistent with the former assessment based on questionnaires. The proband concordance for CD remained fairly stable: 63.6% among monozygotic (MZ) twins and 3.6% among dizygotic (DZ) twins. Clinical characteristics were similar in twins from concordant versus discordant pairs. Forty-four percent of patients with CD were positive for >or=1 mutant allele of NOD2/CARD15 compared to 2% of UC patients (p < 0.001) and 19% of healthy twins (p= 0.02). The allele mutation frequency was 43% among the healthy twins to patients with CD versus 9% among twins to UC patients (p= 0.01).\nPrevious questionnaire assessment of twin zygosity was confirmed by genetic test. Concordance for CD remained quite stable and was significantly higher among MZ than DZ twins. A high NOD2/CARD15 mutation frequency was observed both among CD twins and their healthy siblings.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the role of measured risk factors and the influence of genetic and environmental factors on regular cigarette smoking. Design Members of monozygotic and dizygotic, including unlike-sex twin pairs (n = 6257) from a young adult cohort from the Australian Twin Registry.\nCox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether putative risk factors were significantly associated with regular cigarette smoking. Risk factors were classified into four tiers: tier 1 (parental history, including parental education, alcoholism and cigarette smoking), tier 2 (early home and family influences), tier 3 (early life events, e.g. trauma) and tier 4 (psychiatric symptoms/disorders with onset prior to 14 years), after controlling for gender, zygosity and their interactions. Genetic models were fitted to examine the heritability of smoking behavior before and after controlling for significant covariates from the four tiers.\nParental history of cigarette smoking and alcoholism, parental closeness and home environment, as well as incidence of childhood sexual abuse or other trauma, a history of early onset panic attacks and conduct problems were associated with regular cigarette smoking. Important age interactions were found, particularly for family background risk factors. Regular cigarette smoking was moderately heritable, even after accounting for significant covariates.\nSeveral measured risk factors are associated with regular smoking. While some of the genetic influences on regular smoking may be shared with these risk factors, a significant proportion of the genetic vulnerability to regular smoking is phenotype-specific.",

    "abstract": "Sex reversal is characterized by discordance between genetic and phenotypic sex. Most XX males result from an unequal interchange between X and Y chromosomes during paternal meiosis, therefore transferring SRY to the X chromosome, which explains the male development in the presence of an otherwise normal female karyotype. We present here the case of sex reversed SRY+ male twins with several cell lines. They consulted for infertility. The presence of SRY on an X chromosome was demonstrated by FISH. Their respective karyotypes were: 46,X,der(X)t(X;Y)(p22.3;p11.2)[249]/45,X [12]/45,der(X)t(X;Y)(p22.3;p11.2)[11]/47,XX,der(X)t(X;Y) (p22.3;p11.2)[1]/47,X,der(X)t(X;Y)(p22.3;p11.2)x2[1]/50, XX,der(X)t(X;Y)(p22.3;p11.2)x4[1]/46,XX[1] for the first twin (SH-1) and 46,X,der(X)t(X;Y)(p22.3;p11.2)[108]/45,X [3]/47,XX,der(X)t(X;Y)(p22.3;p11.2)[2]/45,der(X)t(X;Y) (p22.3;p11.2)[1]/47,X,der(X)t(X;Y)(p22.3;p11.2)x2[1] for the second twin (SH-2). There are three different types of XX males: 1) with normal genitalia, 2) with genital ambiguity, and 3) XX true hermaphrodites. The phenotype of the twins presented in this report is consistent with what is generally seen in XX SRY+ males: they have normal genitalia.",

    "abstract": "The origins of both sagittal synostosis (scaphocephaly) and metopic synostosis (trigonocephaly) remain unclear. Genetic and environmental factors probably play a role. Twin and family data of patients with these conditions are presented.\nRecords of 860 patients with scaphocephaly and 394 with trigonocephaly were examined for prevalence of twin birth and family history. Concordance rates of disease in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins were compared. A family history of disease was present in 5.7% of children with scaphocephaly and in 6.8% with trigonocephaly. The frequency of twins was 4.2% in sagittal synostosis and 6.8% in metopic synostosis, which is higher than in the normal population. Twenty-eight of 38 twin pairs with a scaphocephalic proband were identified to be DZ and 10 were confirmed to be MZ (MZ/DZ ratio 0.36). Twenty of 27 twin pairs with trigonocephaly were DZ and seven were MZ (MZ/DZ ratio 0.35). Concordance rates were higher in the MZ group, 30% for scaphocephaly and 43% for trigonocephaly (chi2 = 14.4091, p = 0.0001). There was a strong prevalence of boys, with a frequency of 79.1% with scaphocephaly and 75.8% with trigonocephaly. Twinning was more frequent among affected boys in both groups.\nA midline craniosynostosis is more likely to develop in twins compared with singletons. A genetic component is supported by the higher risk in MZ twins. The presence of an environmental component is reinforced by the high rate of twinning, the normal MZ/DZ ratio, and a less than 100% concordance rate in MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in structural birth defects are often confounded by environmental risk factors. Opposite-sex twins provide a unique model for detecting sex differences in birth defects while maximally controlling environmental risk factors in a natural setting.\nPopulation data from the Florida Birth Defects Registry were analyzed. A total of 4,768 pairs of twins who were discordant for sex and born between 1996 and 2001 were analyzed. The McNemar test was used to compare the differences between a male twin and his twin sister for the risk of developing specific defects and organ-system defects.\nOf 4,768 twin pairs, 225 males (4.72%) and 175 females (3.67%) had birth defects. Among opposite-sex twin pairs, males had a 29% higher risk for birth defects than their twin sisters. Compared to their twin sisters, males had a 5.4 times higher risk for pyloric stenosis and a 2.4 times higher risk for obstructive genitourinary defect, but only one-tenth the risk for congenital hip dislocation.\nSex differences in birth defects exist between opposite-sex twins.",

A single, small, randomized trial has been identified comparing elective birth at 37 weeks' gestation with continued expectant management. However, there is currently insufficient information available from randomized controlled trials to indicate whether the benefits of elective birth outweigh the potential harms for both women and their infants.\nWhereas elective birth at 37 weeks' gestation may be a safe and effective way to reduce the perinatal mortality and morbidity in twins, further information is required from randomized controlled trials to answer the question of whether we should deliver twins electively at 37 weeks' gestation.",

    "abstract": "It would be of benefit to have a better understanding of the relative effects of genetics and environmental factors on craniofacial parameters when undertaking orthodontic therapy and treatment planning. However, there is a lack of such information in pre-adolescents. The aim of this study was to verify the degree of genetic and environmental contribution to the growth of the facial skeleton in twins aged 6 to 12 years. The material comprised the lateral cephalograms of 89 pairs of female twins in Beijing, China, of whom 61 pairs were diagnosed by DNA analysis as monozygotic (MZ) and 28 pairs as dizygotic (DZ). Four main groups (with a starting age of 6, 7, 9 and 11 years) were studied in a semi-longitudinal manner, with a sub-group further investigated for 2-4 consecutive years. The total sample therefore consisted of 183 pairs (MZ 110, DZ 73) aged from 6 to 12 years. The depths of the cranial base, mid and lower face were measured, as well as anterior and posterior face height. A two-tailed t-test showed significant environmental effects on lower face depth (P < 0.01), whilst genetic effects on face height were also significant (P < 0.01). The results suggest that early orthodontic intervention would have a greater influence on the antero-posterior rather than on the vertical plane of growth.",

    "abstract": "Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome (HIDS) is a recessively inherited recurrent fever syndrome. We describe a family of 2 monozygotic twins and their mother with characteristic symptoms of HIDS, but normal levels of IgD and IgA, and with a dominant inheritance pattern. Mevalonate kinase (MK) activity was deficient in both children, and analysis of the MVK gene revealed compound heterozygosity for 2 new mutations, G25G and R277H. Being positioned adjacent to a donor splice site, the G25G mutation was shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses to cause aberrant splicing of the MVK messenger RNA, thus being disease-relevant. The mother, who was also symptomatic during her childhood and adolescence, was a compound heterozygote for I268T and R277H. Our findings expand the genetic and ethnic spectrum of HIDS and show that the possible presence of this disease cannot be excluded based solely on inheritance patterns. In each case in which HIDS is clinically suspected, analysis of MK activity and/or the MVK gene (especially exons 9 and 11) should be performed.",

We present a case in which prenatal sonography at 26 weeks' gestation depicted a monochorionic diamniotic twin gestation with concordant fetal growth and findings suggestive of a true knot of the umbilical cord. At Cesarean delivery at 34 weeks' gestation, spontaneous antepartum septostomy with entanglement of the two separate umbilical cords was noted.

    "abstract": "Human spontaneous chimerism, with one body built from cells of both twins of a dizygotic (DZ) pair, is supposed to be extremely rare, arising from the exchange of blood cells through placental anastomoses. Mosaicism is supposed to be far more common, arising from single zygotes by embryonic mutation. Because typical diagnosis of mosaicism can neither identify nor exclude chimerism, 'mosaicism' may often be chimerism undiscovered. Evidence shows chimerism arises primarily from DZ embryo fusion and is not rare, although it has negligible probability under the hypothesis of independent double ovulation and independent embryogenesis. If, instead, DZ twin embryos begin development as a single cell mass, chimerism is likely. This would be consistent with observations that DZ twins develop as differently from singletons as monozygotic twins do with regard to embryogenic establishment of asymmetries of midline neural-crest-driven structures of brain, face and heart. Chimerism is a significant component of human embryonic development that deserves closer attention as a mechanism of developmental variation. The 'common knowledge' understanding of twinning mechanisms is at best inadequate. The importance of the difference lies in what we can learn from chimerism about human embryogenesis and the cellular origins of structures and functions basic to the business of becoming human.",

    "abstract": "Grapheme-color synaesthesia, a condition in which achromatic graphemes elicit vivid experiences of color is believed to be a genetically determined trait. We describe a study of 10-year-old twin brothers who are physically identical in appearance but who have considerably different conscious experiences. A phenotypic analysis that measured the consistency of grapheme-color pairings over test-retest confirmed that one twin has grapheme-color synaesthesia and the other twin does not. A genotypic analysis using sixteen microsatellite loci confirmed that the twins are monozygotic. These findings are problematic for previous suggestions that synaesthesia is an X-linked dominant trait. At the very least, the findings show that the penetrance of the genotype for synaesthesia is incomplete and that any view suggesting that synaesthesia is simply an X-linked dominant trait is therefore also incomplete and possibly even incorrect. The findings also negate a previous suggestion, based on a study of female monozygotic twins, that discordance of synaesthesia in identical twins is due to X-inactivation. In general, the findings raise serious questions regarding whether it is possible at this time to establish the genetic contribution to synaesthesia.",

The rate of twin growth depends on the material system, but there are no crystallographic models to understand the mechanisms of slow twin growth. The physics of twin growth is presented for bcc-Ti alloys where it is shown that octahedral interstitial sites are not conserved at the twin-matrix interface where oxygen resides. The predicted activation energy for twin growth correlated well with experimental values for the diffusion of oxygen. These models will have a broad application in understanding the twinning process and designing advanced materials.",

    "abstract": "Both genetic and common environmental influences contribute to twin associations for substance use; however, twin concordance rates may vary by environmental setting, indicating the presence of genetic-environmental interactions. The present study examined whether measures of family adaptability and cohesion may moderate the genetic influence on risk for alcohol use among female adolescents.\nWe examined such interactions through the application of log-linear models using data from the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development, a longitudinal study with extensive home interviews of adolescent (8-17 year old) female twins (386 monozygotic [MZ] pairs, 185 dizygotic [DZ] pairs) and their parents.\nTwin concordance for alcohol use varied by average twin/parent reports of parental closeness. Differences between MZ-DZ correlations for alcohol use in families with low parental closeness, for example, were 0.97 and 0.67 (p < .001), respectively, compared with 0.79 and 0.73 (p = .24) for high parental closeness families. In addition, differences in twin concordance regardless of zygosity were found with greater twin similarities for alcohol use in strict families compared with leniently disciplined families, suggesting that the twin association interacts with common environmental influences on alcohol use.\nThese results indicate that the genetic effects on adolescent alcohol use interact with the measured family environment and that the heritability of alcohol use may vary according to quality of the parental relationship. If confirmed, prevention programs may benefit from this knowledge, tailoring their intervention to quality of parental relationship.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge about the balance between heritable and nonheritable risk in multiple sclerosis (MS) is based on twin studies in high-prevalence areas. In a study that avoided ascertainment limitations and directly compared continental Italy (medium-prevalence) and Sardinia (high-prevalence), we ascertained 216 pairs from 34,549 patients. This gives a twinning rate of 0.62% among MS patients, significantly less than that of the general population. In continental Italy, probandwise concordance was 14.5% (95% confidence interval, 5.1-23.8) for monozygotic and 4.0% (95% confidence interval, 0.8-7.1) for dizygotic twins. Results in Sardinia resemble those in northern populations but in limited numbers. Monozygotic concordance was 22.2% (95% confidence interval, 0-49.3) probandwise, but no concordant dizygotic pairs were identified. A questionnaire on 80 items possibly related to disease cause was administered to 70 twin pairs, 135 sporadic patients, and 135 healthy volunteers. Variables positively (7) or negatively (2) associated with predisposition and concordance in twins largely overlapped and were mainly linked to infection. If compared with previous studies, our data demonstrate that penetrance in twins appears to correlate with MS prevalence. They highlight the relevance of nonheritable variables in Mediterranean areas. The apparent underrepresentation of MS among Italian twins draws attention to protective factors, shared by twins, that may influence susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) remains unclear. Since a genetic cause for HLHS has not been obvious, it is generally considered to be inherited in a multifactorial manner. Studies of twins are valuable in elucidating the genetic contribution to a birth defect such as HLHS. We report a case of monochorionic twins in whom one has HLHS and the other has a bicuspid aortic valve. Predisposing genetic and environmental influences on individuals with identical genotypes, such as twins, may result in discordance of left-sided flow lesions.",

    "abstract": "The Israeli Ministry of Health reported an increased rate of twin pregnancies among all cases locally diagnosed as having open neural tube defects. The current study aimed to evaluate whether the etiology of this phenomenon could be attributed either to the twinning or to the mode of conception.\nWomen admitted to our hospital between January 1997 and July 2004 for termination of pregnancy because of severe fetal abnormality enrolled into this retrospective case series study. They were further subdivided according to mode of conception (spontaneous, in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI) pregnancies).\nThree-hundred and eighty consecutive pregnancies, of which 340 (89%) were singletons, participated in our study. Anencephaly was diagnosed in 26 cases: 19 singletons and 7 twins. In the entire twin population, they were all dichorionic twins and only one co-twin was affected. Five of the twins were conceived by IVF-ICSI. All the anencephalic IVF-ICSI twins had normal karyotypes. All IVF-ICSI study women had taken folic acid 400 mcg/day 3 months before conception and throughout the first trimester of pregnancy. In order to find out the cause of the high rate of anencephaly found in IVF-ICSI pregnancies (33.3%), either the twinning or the IVF-ICSI process, a logistic regression analysis was used. A significant correlation was found only between anencephaly and twinning (p = 0.001, CI = 1.86-12.63), with a risk ratio of 4.85.\nOur case series data suggest a comparatively higher rate of anencephaly in IVF-ICSI pregnancy secondary to twinning and not because of the assisted reproductive technology. It is suggested that larger epidemiologic studies are conducted to validate our preliminary results.",

However, little has been documented regarding teen twin pregnancy outcome.\nTo characterize the risk of very preterm birth among teens having twins.\nCross-sectional analysis of the US 1995-2000 Matched Multiple Birth Data Set.\nWe calculated the risk of very preterm birth (<33 weeks' gestation) for teen and young adult mothers of twins (< or =16 years, 17-18 years, 19-20 years), compared to 21-24 year olds, stratified by race/ethnicity. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated controlling for marital status and entry into prenatal care.\nOdds of very preterm birth decreased significantly with increasing age. Odds ratios ranged from 2.07 (1.73,2.48) to 1.20 (1.11,1.29) according to maternal age for White teen mothers, from 1.76 (1.48,2.09) to 1.13 (1.03,1.24) for Black teen mothers, and from 2.19 (1.77,2.72) to 1.15 (1.02,1.31) for Hispanic teen mothers. Odds of very preterm birth among teen mothers of twins were about the same as those for teen mothers of singletons.\nTeens having twins have higher odds of very preterm birth than young adult mothers.

    "abstract": "We sought to examine the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors for the MOS SF-36; a widely used, valid, and reliable measure of health-related quality of life and to discuss incorporating genetic influences into health services research.\nData are from a nationally distributed, nonclinical cohort of 2928 middle age, middle-class, male-male twin members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry.\nThis was a secondary data analysis, classic twin heritability analysis.\nA telephone survey was used to collect information on alcohol-related problems and health services use, including the SF-36.\nVariance component analyses indicated that additive genetic factors accounted for 17% to 33% of the variance for each of the 8 domains of the SF-36. Shared environment accounted for 0% to 12% of the variance for each domain, with the majority of variance for each domain accounted for by nonshared, or unique environment and error. Physical and mental health summary measures indicated that approximately one-third of the variance was accounted for by additive genetic factors and the remainder accounted for by nonshared environment and error. Clinical condition, history of alcohol dependence, had a small-but-significant influence for all domains. Including condition proved to be a better-fitting model. However, confidence intervals temper uniform statistical significance for genetic factors.\nThis study assessed the heritability of the SF-36 in a nonclinical, community sample of middle age, middle-class all-male twins. The moderate genetic effects on SF-36 domain and summary measures are new findings and thus may affect interpretations of SF-36 as a measure of health-related quality of life. Ideally, trait-based measures should identify genetic sources of variation and thus help understand any bias of the true effects of SF-36. Still the majority of variance is accounted for by nonshared or unique environmental factors and error. By extension, increased understanding of the importance of genetic and environmental factors that influence either predictors or outcomes of interest will expand the level of scientific debate in health services research and improve predictability.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of twin studies towards unraveling the complex mechanisms of multifactorial diseases is increasingly recognized. Recent twin studies using infant vaccination as a model for infectious diseases have confirmed the importance of host genetic factors as major regulators of the immune response. A combination of twin-based family studies and population-based association studies should lead to the identification of the specific genes involved. These genes and their products have the potential to be developed as targets for novel therapeutic and prophylactic agents against infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) is a rare and lethal form of skeletal disorder. A MEDLINE search for 1965-2003 yielded only 3 reports of multiple pregnancies discordant for TD. This is the first case report of selective twin reduction for this diagnosis.\nA young woman was seen in consultation at 20 weeks' gestation. Ultrasound examination revealed a twin pregnancy, with ultrasound markers consistent with thanatophoric dysplasia, type II, in twin A. A thick dividing membrane and separated placentas were noted. After counseling, the patient opted for selective termination of twin A. Termination was performed by intracardiac injection of potassium chloride. The pregnancy continued uneventfully until 33 weeks, when spontaneous labor resulted in vaginal delivery of a vigorous female infant, and a mummified, macerated fetus.\nSelective termination for discordant lethal anomalies can be safely performed when the presence of the anomalous twin increases the risk of a poor perinatal outcome for the apparently normal cotwin.",

    "abstract": "The concomitant occurrence of Wilms tumor (WT) was observed in two monozygotic twin sisters without evidence of congenital malformations. Twin 1 was diagnosed with a stage I WT at 11 months of age, whereas twin 2 developed a bilateral (stage V) WT at 13 months of age. In both cases pathologic examination showed a nonanaplastic stromal type WT, with marked rhabdomyomatous elements. Cytogenetic analyses performed on blood samples and on tumor specimens revealed no karyotypic abnormality. No alteration of the WT1 and POU6F2 genes was identified in constitutional and tumor DNA of both sisters, and no anomaly in WT1 expression was evidenced in the normal kidney of one of them. However, loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 11p, involving the alleles of maternal origin, was detected both in the single tumor of twin 1 and in the two distinct tumors of twin 2, thus suggesting a common etiology of the diseases. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report describing at both the clinical and genetic level a couple of monozygotic twins concordant for WT development.",

    "abstract": "The main indications for implanting a cardiac pacemaker are either acquired atrio-ventricular block (AVB) or sick sinus syndrome (SSS). In general, the exact aetiology of these conditions is unknown. Genetic factors may play a role. Untreated AVB is associated with increased mortality but SSS seems to have a good prognosis. The present study was designed to assess whether first-degree relatives of these patients have an increased mortality risk.\nWe investigated the survival pattern of the co-twins of twins who have had a cardiac pacemaker implanted, by linking two nationwide registries in Denmark: the Danish Pacemaker Register and the Danish Twin Registry. For each \"pacemaker-twin\" four control-twins matched with respect to age, sex, and zygosity were selected among the twins who were alive at the time of the pacemaker implantation. A total of 159 twins with a pacemaker treated bradycardia of unknown aetiology were identified of which 73 had AVB and 64 had SSS. A total of 622 matched control-twins could be identified. The survival from age six of the co-twins of the \"pacemaker-twins\" was compared with that of the co-twins of the control-twins. The follow-up period ended January 1st, 2000.\nThe survival curves for the co-twins of the \"pacemaker-twins\" were virtually identical to those of the co-twins of the control-twins. This finding was consistent for both AVB and SSS and for monozygotic as well as dizygotic twins.\nNo increased mortality risk could be demonstrated for first-degree relatives--including monozygotic twins--of patients with a cardiac pacemaker implanted due to either acquired AVB or SSS.",

    "abstract": "While preterm birth and restricted fetal growth are strongly associated with infant mortality, the extent to which these associations are modified by placental abruption remains unknown. A retrospective cohort study was carried out to examine the risk of infant mortality among twins in relation to abruption, and explore the independent contributions of preterm birth and restricted fetal growth to these associations. The study was restricted to women who had delivered twins at 22 weeks' gestation or more and fetuses weighing 500 grams or more in the United States (1989-2000). Risks of preterm birth (less than 37 weeks' gestation), fetal growth restriction and infant mortality, in relation to placental abruption, were evaluated. All analyses were adjusted for potential sociodemographic confounding factors. The association between restricted twin fetal growth and abruption was the strongest among the most severely growth-restricted babies (i.e., less than 1 centile), with the strength of association diminishing with increasing birthweight centiles. The risk of preterm birth among pregnancies with and without abruption were 80.1% and 51.9%, respectively (relative risk [RR] 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-1.6). The risk of small-for-gestational-age (SGA; birthweight of less than the 10th centile for gestational age) among abruption and nonabruption births was 11.7% and 9.2%, respectively (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.4). Compared with twins of the appropriate growth delivered at term, the relative risks for infant mortality in the presence of abruption were 9.9 (95% CI 5.4-18.2) for term-SGA, 25.0 (95% CI 22.3-28.1) for preterm-non-SGA, and 36.2 (95% CI 28.4-46.1) for preterm-SGA births. The association between infant mortality and abruption among twins appears largely mediated through preterm birth, and to a lesser extent, through SGA. The association between fetal growth and abruption is strongest among the severely growth-restricted babies, suggesting that the origins of placental abruption may develop in early pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "A few twin studies on cancer have addressed questions on the possible carcinogenic or protective effects of twining by comparing the occurrence of cancer in twins and singletons. The nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database of 10.2 million individuals and 69,654 0- to 70-year-old twin pairs were used to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all main cancers compared to singletons. The overall risk of cancer in same- or different-sex twins was at the same level as the risk for singletons. Testicular cancer, particularly seminoma, was increased among same-sex twins (1.54) and all twins to an SIR of 1.38. Among other tumors, neurinomas and non-thyroid endocrine gland tumors were increased. Colorectal cancers and leukemia were decreased among all twins. Melanoma and squamous cell skin cancer were decreased in male same-sex twins. The data on this unselected population of twins suggest that twinning per se is not a risk factor of cancer. In utero hormonal exposures or postnatal growth stimulation may be related to the risk of testicular cancer and pituitary tumors. Protective effects against colorectal cancer may be related to a beneficial diet, and in melanoma and skin cancer, to socioeconomic factors. The study involved multiple comparisons, and internal consistency between the results was one of the main factors considered for their plausibility. The results should encourage others working on twin and singleton populations to examine the specific associations and emerging hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies of lipids have almost exclusively involved Caucasians. People of African descent are known to show a healthier lipid profile, but relatively little is known about ethnic differences in genetic and environmental influences on lipids. One hundred and six African American (AA) and 106 European American (EA) twins (30 singletons and 91 complete pairs: 49 monozygotic, 21 dizygotic and 21 opposite-sex) from the south-eastern United States were studied (mean age 17.9 +/- 3.2 years; 79% fasting). Lipids were assayed with the Cholestech LDX system. Analyses were adjusted for fasting status. Generalized estimating equations were used to test for the effects of sex and ethnicity on means, controlling for the dependence within twin pairs. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate genetic and environmental effects on each lipid variable. Females showed higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) values than males (p < .001) and AAs showed higher HDL values than EAs (p < .001). EA males had higher triglyceride values than other groups (p = .02). All parameter estimates could be set equal across sex. Parameter estimates for total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL could be set equal across ethnicity. The best fitting model for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) showed higher heritability in AAs (.92) than EAs (.69). Heritabilities ranged from 69% to 92%, with remaining variation explained by nonshared environmental effects. Adjustment for body mass index had virtually no effect on the heritability estimates. In this first twin study on lipids to include AAs, no ethnic differences in heritability were found except for LDL, where AAs exhibited higher estimates.",

    "abstract": "Anomalies occur with a greater frequency in twin gestations. Due to its multifactorial inheritance, twins are usually discordant for encephalocele. We present a case of monoamniotic twins concordant for occipital encephalocele and discordant for lung and cord anomalies. Ultrasonographic examination at 17 weeks' gestation revealed occipital encephalocele in both fetuses. The maternal serum level of alpha-fetoprotein was increased. Fetal autopsy revealed occipital encepaholocele in both twins and right pulmonary hypoplasia and one umbilical artery in one sibling. Monoamniotic twins concordant for encephalocele occur with extreme rarity. To the best of our knowledge, monoamniotic twins concordant for this neural tube defect have not been previously reported.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to determine whether slow fetal growth rates and twin growth patterns from 20 weeks' gestation to delivery are associated with very preterm delivery.\nAvailable charts were reviewed for twin pregnancies, delivered between 1979 and 2002, at 4 U.S. medical centers. The sample of 1612 pregnancies delivered at 28 week's gestation or greater and had at least 2 ultrasound evaluations of fetal size from 20 to 28 weeks or from 28 weeks to delivery for estimation of fetal growth rates (grams per week). Slow fetal growth (below the 10th percentile) was defined as less than 90 grams per week at 20-28 weeks and 168 g/week from 28 weeks to delivery. The main outcome measure was the timing of delivery.\nOf the women delivering twins, 5.3% delivered extremely preterm (28-30 weeks), 8.5% very preterm (31-32 weeks), and 40.1% preterm (33-36 weeks). Patterns of growth for the pair were highly associated with very preterm delivery. Compared with neither growing slowly (1.7%), 4.9% delivered very preterm if only 1 twin grew slowly. Very preterm was 14.6% (adjusted odds ratio 9.81; 95% confidence interval, 3.50-27.48) with both growing slowly from 28 weeks on and 20.0% (adjusted odds ratio 15.04; 95% confidence interval 5.13-44.11) with both growing slowly over both intervals. Survival analyses indicated that twins with normal growth in both intervals remained undelivered for a significantly longer number of days (P < .0001) than pairs in which one or both twins were growing slowly.\nVery preterm delivery of twins seems to be preceded by slowed or compromised fetal growth for the pair.",

    "abstract": "Fewer than 5% of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs are clinically concordant for systemic sclerosis (SSc), yet the majority of MZ twins are concordant for antinuclear antibodies. To discover genetic versus nongenetic molecular pathways important to the pathogenesis of SSc, we compared global gene expression patterns in twins discordant for SSc.\nTotal RNA from dermal fibroblasts of 15 discordant twin pairs (10 MZ and 5 DZ) and 5 normal controls were used in microarray analysis. Aberrantly expressed genes were confirmed using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.\nLesional and nonlesional fibroblasts from SSc patients showed no significant differences in gene expression, while SSc patients had gene profiles that were significantly different from those of unaffected DZ twins and normal controls. Unaffected MZ twins, however, were not significantly different from SSc patients. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering segregated the fibroblast samples as originating from 2 major groups. Group A contained 5 discordant MZ twin pairs, 3 affected MZ twins, and 3 affected DZ twins. Group B contained all 5 normal population controls, all 5 healthy DZ twins, 2 discordant MZ twins, and 2 discordant DZ twin pairs. Normal fibroblasts incubated with serum from an SSc-affected patient or with serum from her unaffected MZ twin sister developed the increased expression of COL1A2, SPARC, and CTGF typically seen in SSc fibroblasts.\nThese results demonstrate that dermal fibroblasts from SSc patients and from 40-50% of their genetically identical but clinically unaffected MZ twins exhibit a similar gene expression pattern which can be induced in normal fibroblasts by sera from both. Thus, a stronger genetic predisposition to SSc (than can be detected clinically) is apparent at the molecular level in skin fibroblasts.",

    "abstract": "We examined whether the presence of a spouse and the frequency of interaction with children, relatives, and friends significantly influence the risk of dying in late life. We assessed these effects separately by gender, controlling for self-reported health. In addition, we examined whether interaction with the co-twin has a different impact on mortality for identical and fraternal twins.\nThe data set consists of 2,147 Danish twins aged 75 years and older, who were followed prospectively from 1995 to 2001. We modeled the effect of social ties on mortality by using event history analysis.\nSurvival is extended by having a spouse and close ties with friends and the co-twin. However, contact frequency with friends and the co-twin is significant, respectively, only for women and identical twins.\nInvestigating social relations sheds light on the life span of individuals older than 75 years of age. We stress the importance of social relations beyond the presence of the spouse for survival even at very old ages.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of multiple sclerosis (MS) in twins has not previously been studied in complete nationwide data sets. The existence of almost complete MS and twin registries in Denmark ensures that essentially unbiased samples of MS cases among twins can be obtained. In this population-based study, virtually all Danish MS cases among twins born before 1983 with onset of MS after 1948 and diagnosis before I January 1997 were identified. Of 13 286 MS cases, 178 were twins and, of these 164 twin pairs were discordant and seven were concordant. We found significantly higher proband-wise concordance among monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins, with estimated proband-wise concordances of 24% (95% confidence interval (CI): 5-39%) for monozygotic and 3% (95% CI: 0-8%) for dizygotic twins. Thus, a monozygotic twin whose co-twin has MS has a 24% risk of developing the disease, while the corresponding risk for a dizygotic twin is only 3%. Our results largely confirm previously published concordance estimates and indicate that genetic factors are of importance in susceptibility to MS.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the risks of twins for multiple sclerosis (MS). Our data are linked registers of all Danish twins and of all Danes born between 1920 and 1970 in whom MS was diagnosed before 1997. We compared differences in the risks for MS by Cox regression and standardized incidence ratios. Our analyses suggest that dizygotic twins have an approximately 60% lower risk for MS than monozygotic twins and a 20% lower risk than singletons. Monozygotic twins appear to have a somewhat higher risk for MS than singletons albeit not statistically significant. We offer no biological explanation for our findings, but suggest that either sharing fetal life with a genotypically different individual is beneficial for the immune system or that there is a linkage between the genes that influence dizygotic twinning and other genes that protect against MS.",

Some mutations have been found to cause this disorder. Genetic counseling and informing patients about inheritance is crucial.

    "abstract": "African Americans have a particularly high prevalence of excessive body fat and high blood pressure. Genetic and environmental influences may be implicated for both of these risk factors. We investigated the potential for common genetic and environmental influences on body fat (waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI)) and blood pressure measures (systolic and diastolic pressure (SBP, DBP)) among African-American male and female subjects.\nMeasurements were taken as part of the Carolina African-American Twin Study of Aging (CAATSA). The CAATSA sample contains 217 same-sex African-American male and female twins with average age of 47 years. This analysis included 39 monozygotic male pairs (MZ), 43 dizygotic male pairs (DZ); 63 MZ female pairs, and 72 DZ female pairs. Maximum likelihood quantitative genetic analyses were used.\nThe total genetic variance for SBP was 22% in male subjects and 40.1% in female subjects. Of this total variance, 3.1% was in common with BMI in male subjects and 6% was in common with BMI in female subjects. After controlling for the effects of BMI, WC had less than 1% of its variance in common with SBP in male and female subjects. For DBP, the total genetic variance was 16.9% in male and 38.7% in female subjects. Of this total variance 6.1% was in common with BMI in male subjects and 3.7% was in common in female subjects. Again, WC had less than 1% of its genetic variance in common with DBP in both male and female subjects. The environmental variance common among these measures was also very small. The remaining variance was primarily accounted for by genetic and environmental effects unique to each measure as well as age.\nBased on the very small common genetic variance for BMI, SBP, and DBP as well as WC and the blood pressure measures, our results suggest that searching for common genes among these measures may be inconclusive.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the genetic and environmental influences on tea consumption and their commonalities with coffee consumption; and to further examine the genetic and environmental aetiology of preference for tea/coffee.\nA classical twin design was used in which the similarity of identical and non-identical twins is compared, enabling estimates of genetic, common environmental and unique environmental influence on the trait.\nAn Australian population-based sample of 1796 identical (i.e. monozygotic) and 2013 non-identical (i.e. dizygotic) twin pairs aged 16-87 years was studied, roughly three-fifths of whom were female. The sample represented approximately 70% of those approached for study participation.\nAs part of a Health and Lifestyle Questionnaire, respondents were asked how many cups of each tea and coffee they consumed per day. Additional measures of 'total tea and coffee consumption' and 'preference for coffee' were calculated.\nAge was positively associated with tea consumption but negatively associated with coffee preference; women consumed more beverages than men, but showed a lower preference for coffee. An inverse relation between tea and coffee consumption--larger in females (-0.41) than males (-0.34)--was supported. This association was mediated entirely by the unique environment in males, and by both the unique environment (68.3%) and genes (31.7%) in females. Tea and coffee drinking were shown to have similar heritabilities (0.46) in males, but tea consumption was influenced by common environmental factors whereas coffee consumption was not. Coffee preference was shown to be influenced by genes (0.42) and the unique environment (0.58).\nAs the patterns of genetic and environmental variation were shown to differ for tea and coffee consumption it may be more informative to retain them as separate measures of caffeine intake in future studies of stimulant use and taste perception.",

The Scottish Mental Surveys of 1st June 1932 (SMS1932) and 4th June 1947 (SMS1947), respectively, administered the same validated verbal reasoning test to almost everyone born in 1921 or 1936 and attending school in Scotland. There were 572 twin pairs from the SMS1932, and 517 pairs from the SMS1947. Information on zygosity was unavailable. A novel application of a mixture distribution was used to estimate genetic and environmental components of verbal reasoning variation by maximum likelihood. We found consistent heritability (approximately 0.70) and shared environment (approximately 0.21) estimates. The estimates did not change substantially when additional quantitative traits (height and weight) were added in a multivariate analysis. More generally for studies in genetics, the methodological innovation developed here implies that large (national) data collections can provide sufficient information on twin pairs to estimate genetic parameters, even without zygosity.",

    "abstract": "In this cohort study, data on the observed reduced incidence of malignant melanoma (MM) of the skin in twins compared with a control group were related to tumour characteristics and all-cause mortality. The twin cohort consisted of 20 926 individuals and the control group included individuals picked at random and matched to the twin cohort with respect to age, sex and place of birth. The cohorts were linked to the Cancer Registry of Norway and all cases of MM diagnosed from 1960 to 1999 were followed until October 2003. The mean observation time from diagnosis to death or censoring was 10.9 years (SD, +/-8.5 years). The relative risk of MM for the twins was 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55, 0.83]. No statistically significant difference was found in the distribution of histopathological subtypes or pathological stage between the cohorts. The crude all-cause mortality risk for the twin cases was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.07). Stratified analysis indicated effect modification by gender on all-cause mortality risk (Breslow-Day test of homogeneity P=0.02). Multivariate analysis was performed separately for men and women. The adjusted mortality risk ratio for male twin cases was 1.11 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.65) and for female twin cases 1.05 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.8). The twins had a lower relative risk of MM compared with the control group, but similar tumour characteristics and all-cause mortality.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study is to determine the prevalence and age of onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and latent class-derived attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) subtypes in a population-based twin sample of boys and girls. Missouri birth records identified families with a twin pair 7 to 18 years of age. Telephone screening interviews for ADHD symptoms were completed for 5007 families. Diagnostic assessments were administered to 564 families with at least one twin meeting screening criteria, plus 183 control families. Prevalence and age of onset for both ADHD nosologies were calculated by sex and zygosity from parent report data. The prevalence of any DSM-IV ADHD was 6.2% overall, 7.4% in boys and 3.9% in girls. The inattentive subtype was most common in boys; the combined subtype was most common in girls. The mean age of onset of symptoms in children with any DSM-IV ADHD was 3.5 years, with no significant differences between boys and girls. Prevalences of latent class defined ADHD subtypes also varied by sex with the severe inattentive and combined classes more common in boys than girls. The age of onset of symptoms did not differ between boys and girls but were higher than in the DSM-IV subtypes. Findings in this twin sample showed that clinically significant ADHD, defined by either DSM-IV or latent class criterion, has an early age of onset and is more common in boys than girls. As clinical samples are most commonly composed of male combined subtypes, the inattentive subtype of both sexes in the general population is an under-treated segment of the general population.",

    "abstract": "The rate of multiple births is substantially elevated in women who have had assisted reproduction treatment (ART; approximately 26%) compared to the general population ( approximately 1%), and these offspring are usually included in twin studies. Several studies have attempted to identify possible consequences of undergoing ART on the subsequent offspring. However, most studies have only included singleton births. We first examined whether twins born by ART differed from other twins on measures of childhood psychopathology, putative risk factors and correlates, and secondly tested for differences in the degree of twin similarity for available outcome measures. From a population-based twin sample, 101 families with dizygotic (DZ) twins conceived via ART were identified and compared with 1073 naturally conceived (NC) control DZ twin pairs. Analyses performed were (1) univariate and multivariate comparisons of between-group mean differences; and (2) comparison of twin 1-twin 2 correlations between the groups. The groups differed significantly on demographic factors (parental age, family size and social class) and pregnancy variables (smoking during pregnancy and birthweight) but did not differ on family conflict scores or in the frequency of obstetric complications. Family cohesion was higher in the ART group but this was accounted for by demographic factors. For child psychopathology there was a difference between the groups only for teacher-rated ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Differences were also found between groups for twin correlations. The differences found between ART and NC twins on group means and twin correlations suggest that researchers should be aware that including ART twins may influence results from twin studies.",

The goal of the present study is to compare the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors to explain individual differences in various dimensions of self-concept in female preadolescents of Minnesota in the United States and Seoul in South Korea. Two hundred and eighteen monozygotic (MZ) and 137 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the Minnesota Twin Family Study (MTFS) and 74 MZ and 42 DZ twin pairs from the Seoul Twin Family Study (STFS) completed the 6 cluster scales of the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (P-H). The 6 cluster scales of the P-H include Popularity, Physical Appearance and Attributes, Behavior, Intellectual Competence and School Status, Anxiety, and Happiness and Satisfaction. Univariate model-fitting analyses were performed. In both samples, a model incorporating shared and nonshared environmental influences fitted the data best for Popularity, Anxiety, and Intellectual Competence and School Status, whereas a model including additive genetic and nonshared environmental factors provided the best fit for Physical Appearance and Attributes, and Behavior. The univariate model did not yield an adequate fit for Happiness and Satisfaction. For Physical Appearance and Attributes, and Intellectual Competence and School Status, estimates of additive genetic and environmental factors were significantly different between the MTFS and the STFS samples. For Popularity, Anxiety, and Behavior, however, the genetic and environmental estimates were comparable between the two samples.",

    "abstract": "The children of twins (COT) design has been proposed as an alternative to the adoption study to resolve the direct effects of parental treatment from secondary parent-child association due to genetic factors. The basic analytical approach compares the parent-offspring correlation with the correlation between children and the monozygotic (MZ) twins of their parents. We show that a significant difference between these correlations does not imply direct environmental causality when the measured parental treatment in question is dyadic, that is, influenced by both parents even when mating is random. Nongenetic causal effects yield very similar patterns of correlation to secondary genetic effects on dyadic treatment variables. The fact that many candidate environments, such as parental divorce, are dyadic gives reason to question the interpretation of their correlations with behavior in the children of twins.",

    "abstract": "We studied the developmental potential of single blastomeres from early cleavage mouse embryos. Eight- and sixteen-cell diploid mouse embryos were disaggregated and single blastomeres from eight-cell embryos or pairs of sister blastomeres from sixteen-cell embryos were aggregated with 4, 5 or 6 tetraploid blastomeres from 4-cell embryos. Each diploid donor embryo gave eight sister aggregates, which later were manipulated together as one group (set). The aggregates were cultured in vitro until the blastocyst stage, when they were transferred (in sets) to the oviducts of pseudopregnant recipients. Eighteen live foetuses or pups were obtained from the transfer (11.0% of transferred blastocysts) and out of those, eleven developed into fertile adults (one triplet, one pair of twins and four singletons). In all surviving adults, pups and living foetuses, only diploid cells were detected in their organs and tissues as shown by analysis of coat pigmentation and distribution of glucose phosphate isomerase isoforms. In order to explain the observed high rate of mortality of transferred blastocysts, in an accompanying experiment, the diploid and tetraploid blastomeres were labelled with different fluorochromes and then aggregated. These experiments showed the diploid cells to be present not only in the inner cell mass (ICM) but also in the trophectoderm. The low number of diploid cells and the predominance of tetraploid cells in the ICM of chimaeric blastocysts might have been responsible for high postimplantation mortality of our experimental embryos.",

    "abstract": "Small for gestational age (SGA) is one of the major determinants of perinatal mortality and morbidity, and may relate in adult diseases. Early prediction of SGA could be helpful for health care providers and public health workers in guiding antenatal management and prevention. The reported methods of SGA prediction are not satisfactory because the diagnostic performance is poor and the interval between prediction and delivery is too short.\nTo establish a SGA prediction model for twin pregnancies based on variables obtainable in early gestation.\nWe used a large twin registry United States data (1995-1997). The study subjects were randomly divided into two groups: group 1 to establish the prediction model by logistic regression and group 2 to validate the prediction model. SGA was defined as birth weight for gestational age z scores less than 10th percentiles. Pair of twin was the unit of analysis. Two sets of multiple logistic regression analyses with different outcome measures - one or both twins SGAs and both twins SGAs - were used to establish the prediction model.\nThe sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were 52.3, 62.5, and 21.5%, respectively, at the cutoff value 0.16 in a SGA prediction model based on maternal race, education, marital status, parity, prenatal care visit initiation, cigarette smoking, and paternal race.\nA prediction model based on determinants that can be obtained at early gestation might be useful in the management of pregnancies with high risk of SGA in twins.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of monochorionic diamniotic twin gestation confirmed by ultrasound visualization of the thin intertwin-dividing membrane at 32 weeks' gestation. Ultrasound at 36 weeks failed to demonstrate the thin dividing membrane. The pregnancy ended a few days later with spontaneous vaginal delivery of the first twin. The second twin was in transverse lie with no membranes that could be felt around. Severe fetal heart rate deceleration developed, prompting delivery by emergency caesarean section. Cord entanglement was noted at the time of delivery, which resulted in severe perinatal morbidity of the second twin. The antepartum rupture of the dividing membrane must have happened some time between 32 and 36 weeks. The etiology for this intrauterine disruption is unknown. A review of the literature about the antepartum rupture of the intertwin-dividing membrane is described, along with its possible causes and complications. In addition, we discuss possible causes of incorrect amnionicity determination, and thus how to minimize these pitfalls. We conclude that antepartum disruption of the intertwin-dividing membrane is more common than previously thought. Moreover, prenatal ultrasonographic visualization of a dividing membrane in a diamniotic twin pregnancy does not rule out future change in this environment to a monoamniotic one, with all its perinatal morbidity and mortality complications, which result mainly from cord entanglement. This suggests a modification in the method and frequency of the prenatal fetal well-being follow-up, as well as the time and mode of delivery.",

    "abstract": "An excess of structural anomalies is observed in twins compared to singletons. Approximately 1-2% of twin pregnancies may face the dilemma of expectant management versus selective termination following diagnosis of an anomaly affecting only one fetus. If the option of selective fetocide is considered, the main variable determining the technique to achieve this aim is chorionicity. In a dichorionic pregnancy, passage of substances from one twin into the circulation of the co-twin is unlikely due to the lack of placental anastomoses, hence KCl can be injected safely into the circulation of the affected twin to produce fetal asystole. In monochorionic twin pregnancies, selective termination needs to be performed by ensuring complete and permanent occlusion of both the arterial and venous flows in the umbilical cord of the affected twin, in order to avoid acute haemorrhage from the co-twin into the dying fetus, which may lead to death or organ damage. Bipolar cord coagulation under ultrasound guidance is associated with approximately 70-80% survival rates.",

    "abstract": "Discordant growth in twins contributes significantly to rates of perinatal morbidity and mortality. These rates vary according to chorionicity, timing of onset and severity. We have reviewed English language literature in Medline since 1980. It is clear that diagnosis of discordant growth has improved due to the use of serial ultrasound examination. Following the detection of differences in fetal size, diagnosis is facilitated by umbilical artery and fetal Doppler studies. Management options vary according to chorionicity, timing of onset and umbilical-fetal Doppler studies. The mode of delivery in discordant twins remains controversial. We conclude that ultrasound surveillance of twin gestations, combining serial biometry and selective Doppler studies, is effective in the recognition of significant intrauterine growth restriction in co-twins. Differences in etiology and management underscore the importance of establishing chorionicity routinely as soon as twin gestation is diagnosed.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare and complex complication of monozygotic twinning, which is associated with high perinatal mortality. Early prenatal diagnosis of conjoined twins allows better counselling of the parents regarding the management options, including continuation of pregnancy with post-natal surgery, termination of pregnancy or selective fetocide in case of a triplet pregnancy. With the introduction of high-resolution and transvaginal ultrasound imaging, accurate prenatal diagnosis of conjoined twins is possible early in pregnancy. We have reviewed the medical literature on the early prenatal diagnosis of suspected conjoined twins using a MEDLINE search. Although first-trimester diagnosis of conjoined twins is feasible, false-positive cases are common before 10 weeks because, earlier in gestation, fetal movements are limited and monoamniotic twins may appear conjoined. As most parents opt for immediate termination of pregnancy at confirmation of the diagnosis, there are limited data on the prenatal follow-up of conjoined twins. When the parents opt for conservative management, half of the fetuses die in utero and another 44% will die during the neonatal period. A detailed analysis of case reports where 3D imaging was used indicates that this modality does not improve on the diagnosis made by 2D ultrasound. Overall, very early prenatal diagnosis and first-trimester 3D imaging provide very little additional practical medical information compared to the 11-14 weeks' ultrasound examination.",

    "abstract": "To establish the nature and extent of difficulties in parenting and child development in families with twins conceived by assisted reproduction.\nComparisons were carried out between a representative sample of 344 families with 2- to 5-year-old twins conceived by IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and a matched comparison group of 344 families with singletons from IVF/ICSI. One twin was randomly selected for data analysis to avoid the bias associated with nonindependence of measures.\nA general population sample of IVF/ICSI families.\nMothers and children.\nMothers completed a questionnaire booklet.\nStandardized measures of the mother's psychological well-being (parenting stress, depression, and quality of marriage) and standardized measures of the child's psychological development (emotional/behavioral problems and cognitive development).\nMothers of twins showed significantly higher levels of parenting stress and depression than mothers of singletons and were significantly more likely to find parenting difficult and significantly less likely to obtain pleasure from their child. Regarding the children, there was no difference in the level of emotional or behavioral problems between twins and singletons. However, twins showed significantly lower levels of cognitive functioning.\nGreater difficulties in parenting and child development were experienced by IVF/ICSI families with twins than by IVF/ICSI families with singletons.",

    "abstract": "There is currently considerable interest in biometric approaches using human odor as a marker of disease or genetic individuality. Body odor is also thought to be used during mate choice to select genetically compatible mates. The idea that body odor reveals information about both genetic identity and genetic similarity is most readily tested by examining odor in twin pairs. However, although this idea can be traced back 130 years to Francis Galton in 1875, most studies using dogs fail to control for shared environmental effects associated with cohabitation. Here we show that odors of identical twins (but not dizygotic twins) can be matched by human sniffers at rates better than chance, even when the twins are living apart. In addition, matching frequencies for identical twin odors were not significantly different from those for duplicate odors from the same individual. These results indicate an important genetic influence on body odor and the potential for developing technologies for human odor printing in relation to underlying genotype.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of Twin-block appliance on maxillofacial growth by using monozygotic twins.\n6 pairs of non-high angle monozygotic twins aged 12.2 with class II division 1 malocclusion were selected from 32 pairs of twins. In the first year Twin A of each pair was functionally treated using Twin-block appliance; meanwhile, Twin B underwent non-extracted fixed treatment without any treatment procedure which might cause changes like functional appliances such as Class II elastics. The difference of the cephalometric changes of maxilla and mandible before and after treatment between Twin A and Twin B was compared using paired-t test.\nCompared with those of Twin A after one year treatment, SNA, Cd-A and Cd-Go of Twin B had little chang (P>0.05), but Cd-S' reduced (P<0.05), Cd-Gn and SNB increased (P=0.01), (Cd-Gn)-(Cd-A) and ANB increased (P<0.05) significantly.\nTwin-block appliance can stimulate forward mandibular growth and cause forward mandibular displacement, but has little effect on ramus height and maxillary growth.",

We found a significant positive correlation between birth weight and expression of both Ang1 and Ang2 (p<0.009, p<0.011, respectively). In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between skin fold, BMI and Ang1 expression (p<0.0001 and p<0.01, respectively).\nA positive correlation between twin birth weight and placental angiogenesis was found.

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis involves endothelial cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and cord formation, which lead to tubulogenesis to form vessels. One group of growth factor receptors implicated in angiogenesis is the VEGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases. VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are closely related receptor tyrosine kinases and have both common and specific ligands. VEGFR-1 is a kinase-impaired RTK whereas VEGFR-2 is a highly active kinase. Despite their differential kinase activation potentials, both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are required for normal development and angiogenesis. VEGFR-1 regulates angiogenesis by mechanisms that involve ligand-trapping, receptor homo- and heterodimerization. VEGFR-2 stimulates variety of signaling pathways and broad biological responses in vitro. The mechanisms that govern VEGFR-2 activation, its ability to recruit signaling proteins and to undergo downregulation are highly regulated by its carboxyl terminus. This review highlights recent insights into the mechanism of activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, and focuses on the signaling pathways employed by VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 that regulate angiogenesis.",

A 20-year-old primigravida spontaneously delivered at 22 weeks gestation a normal 425-gram male newborn followed by a delivery of a 525 grams pygopagus conjoined male twins. One twin had omphalocele, missing ears, cleft palate and dysmorphic figures while the other had imperforated anus and dysmorphic figures. The Apgar scores were 2/0. The placenta was monochorionic/diamniotic with single umbilical artery supplying both conjoined twins. Conjoined twin in a triplet pregnancy may be diagnosed by ultrasound as early as the first trimester. Failure in diagnosis of the condition resulted in early delivery of three premature infants. All three infants died after delivery.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence and significance of intertwin growth discrepancy in the first trimester of pregnancy are controversial. The aim of this study was to refine the incidence and outcome of this discrepancy in relation to dating of the pregnancy and other biometric parameters.\nThis prospective study of twin pregnancies initially evaluated at 11-14 weeks' gestation was conducted between 2001 and 2004. Differences in crown-rump length (CRL) and estimated gestational age (GA) were calculated for each twin pair and their distribution was analyzed according to chorionicity and mode of conception (spontaneous or following assisted reproductive technologies). CRL-based GA and actual GA were compared. Other biometric parameters were also compared for each twin pair. The distribution of discrepancies was analyzed according to pregnancy outcome.\nA total of 182 twin pregnancies was included. The mean+/-SD discrepancy in CRL was 3.4+/-3.18 mm or 5.1+/-4.69% and the 95th centile was 9.8 mm or 14.3%. There was no influence of chorionicity (P=0.44), mode of conception (P=0.18) and no relation with outcome (P=0.54). In conceptions resulting from assisted technology, the measured CRL of the smaller twin was closer to the actual GA. Cephalic and abdominal biometric measurements were significantly greater in the twin with the smaller CRL (P<0.05). The two cases with a discrepancy>15 mm were affected by trisomy 18 and triploidy, respectively.\nCRL discrepancy in twin pregnancies in the first trimester is a frequent finding. Discrepancy>95th centile indicates major growth delay of one twin, which could indicate the presence of aneuploidy. For milder degrees of discordance the CRL of the smaller fetus is a more accurate estimate of the actual GA.",

    "abstract": "Finger-length ratio (second to fourth finger; 2D:4D) has been associated with various measures thought to be related to prenatal androgens. In addition, hormone-transfer theory posits that hormones can transfer between twins. We examined 2D:4D in same-sex (SS) and opposite-sex (OS) dizygotic twins to test both propositions. Results show that 2D:4D is masculinized in OS females compared to SS females. This provides strong evidence that 2D:4D is laid down prenatally, and that hormones (likely androgens) can transfer from male to female fetuses. Implications for developmental timeframes for both hormone-transfer and 2D:4D are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in rates of cerebral palsy (CP) between singletons and twins by considering factors that may be predictive of CP. Data were taken from the Scottish Register of Children with a Motor Deficit of Central Origin and the Scottish Morbidity Record series. All children born in Scotland between 1984 and 1990 inclusive comprised the cohort. There were 646 children with CP (370 males, 276 females) of whom 57 were from twin pregnancies. Prevalence of CP was higher in twins than in singletons. Also, for singleton and twin births, the prevalence of CP was higher for infants who had low birthweight for gestational age (GA), were preterm, and who were male. Prevalence of CP by GA followed a different pattern for twins than for singletons, being lower for twins in the middle range of GAs than for singletons. After allowing for GA and birthweight, twins appeared to be at increased risk for CP compared with singletons. The type of CP in singletons and twins also differed with 64.9% of twins having spastic bilateral CP compared with 48.5% for singletons. The aetiology of CP in twins and singletons may differ.",

    "abstract": "Mathematics performance at 7 years as assessed by teachers using UK national curriculum criteria has been found to be highly heritable. For almost 3000 pairs of 7-year-old same-sex twins, we used multivariate genetic analysis to investigate the extent to which these genetic effects on mathematics performance overlap with genetic effects on reading and general intelligence (g) as predicted by the 'generalist genes' hypothesis. We found substantial genetic overlap between mathematics and reading (genetic correlation=0.74) and between mathematics and g (0.67). These findings support the 'generalist genes' hypothesis that most of the genes that contribute to individual differences in mathematics are the same genes that affect reading and g. Nonetheless, the genetic correlations are less than unity and about a third of the genetic variance on mathematics is independent of reading and g, suggesting that there are also some genes whose effects are specific to mathematics.",

The study included 10,079 members of the population-based Swedish Twin Registry who were participants in the HARMONY study. We diagnosed dementia by means of a two-stage procedure--cognitive impairment screening followed by full clinical evaluation. We analyzed data with case-control and cotwin control designs. The cotwin control design provides control over genetic and familial factors. In the case-control study, controlling for age, gender, and level of education, we found that more complex work with people was associated with reduced risk of AD. Greater complexity of work with people and data was protective in twin pairs discordant for AD. Findings suggest that greater complexity of work, and particularly complex work with people, may reduce the risk of AD.",

Successful surgical separation of conjoined twins is a major undertaking requiring careful planning by a multidisciplinary team. Reports of seperation of joined twins in developing countries like Nigeria are rare. Ten cases of conjoined twins were separated between 1936 and January 2003 (including the authors two new cases). There were five omphalopagus, two pygopagus, two heterpagus and one ishiopagus twins. Three underwent emergency separation with 83.3% mortality while seven underwent elective seperation with 64.3% survival. The overall mortality rate was 50%. Despite the absence of advanced technological resource selected group of conjoined twins can be successfully separated in a developing country like Nigeria.

    "abstract": "Identical twins were noted to have a soft asymptomatic neck mass, each on the opposite side, at 1 week of age. The mass took a dramatic course 1 week later to present as a neck abscess, yet without systemic symptoms. Ultrasonography was highly suggestive of an infected lymphatic malformation (cystic hygroma). Intravenous antibiotics and drainage (aspiration/incision and drainage) resulted in resolution of the mass and no recurrence at 18 months follow-up. The concept of spontaneous involution of lymphatic malformation (cystic hygroma) is discussed as well as the management of neck abscesses in infancy.",

    "abstract": "CHARGE syndrome has an estimated prevalence of 1/10,000. Most cases are sporadic which led to hypotheses of a non-genetic aetiology. However, there was also evidence for a genetic cause with reports of multiplex families with presumed autosomal dominant, possible autosomal recessive inheritance and concordant twin pairs. We identified a monozygotic twin pair with CHARGE syndrome and a de novo balanced chromosome rearrangement t(8;13)(q11.2;q22).\nFluorescence in situ hybridisation was performed with BAC and PAC probes to characterise the translocation breakpoints. The breakpoint on chromosome 8 was further refined using 10 kb probes we designed and produced using sequence data for clone RP11 33I11, the Primer3 website, and a long range PCR kit.\nBAC and PAC probe hybridisation redefined the breakpoints to 8q12.2 and 13q31.1. Probe RP11 33I11 spanned the breakpoint on chromosome 8. Using our 10 kb probes we demonstrated that the chromodomain gene CHD7 was disrupted by the translocation between exons 3 and 8.\nIdentifying that the translocation breakpoint in our patients occurred between exons 3 and 8 of CHD7 suggests that disruption of this gene is the cause of CHARGE syndrome in the twins and independently confirms the role of CHD7 in CHARGE syndrome.",

    "abstract": "To determine the accuracy of prenatal and postnatal echocardiography in delineating the degree of cardiac fusion, intracardiac anatomy (ICA), and ventricular function of 23 sets of conjoined twins with thoracic level fusion presenting to a single centre over a 20 year period.\n13 thoracopagus, 5 thoraco-omphalopagus, and 5 parapagus pairs presenting to the authors' institution between 1985 and 2004 inclusive were assessed. Echocardiographic data were analysed together with operative intervention and outcome. Twins were classified according to the degree of cardiac fusion: separate hearts and pericardium (group A, n = 5), separate hearts and common pericardium (group B, n = 7), fused atria and separate ventricles (group C, n = 2), and fused atria and ventricles (group D, n = 9).\nThe degree of cardiac fusion was correctly diagnosed in all but one set. ICA was correctly diagnosed in all cases, although the antenatal diagnosis was revised postnatally in three cases. Abnormal ICA was found in one twin only in two group A pairs, one group B pair, and both group C pairs. All group D twins had abnormal anatomy. Ventricular function was good in all twins scanned prenatally, and postnatally function correlated well with clinical condition. Thirteen sets of twins in groups A-C were surgically separated; 16 of 26 survived. None from groups C or D survived.\nPrenatal and postnatal echocardiography accurately delineates cardiac fusion, ICA, and ventricular function in the majority of twins with thoracic level fusion. It is integral in assessing feasibility of separation. The outcome in twins with fused hearts remains dismal.",

As the rate of twin births increases among older women, it is important to understand how parity may influence the relationship between maternal age and adverse birth outcomes. The NCHS Matched Multiple Birth Data Set, which contains all twin births in the USA from 1995 to 1998, was analysed. Parity was grouped into two levels (primiparous--no prior live births, and multiparous--at least one prior live birth), and maternal age was divided into the following groups: 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and 40 years or more. Very preterm birth was defined as births occurring before 33 weeks. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) to estimate the risk of very preterm birth, and to determine the relationships between parity, maternal age, and very preterm birth. Among primiparae, women 40 years and older had a reduced risk of very preterm birth compared with women of 25-29 years (OR 0.74 [95% CI=0.66, 0.84]). Among multiparae, women 40 years and older had the same risk of very preterm birth compared with women of 25-29 years (OR 1.00 [95% CI=0.90, 1.12]). However, stratification by education revealed that the age gradient was limited to women with >12 years education among primiparae. The effect of maternal age on very preterm birth of twins differs according to parity. To some extent, that effect is further modified by education. Therefore, future analyses of maternal age and twin birth outcomes should account for measures of obstetric history and other factors, which may influence these results.",

    "abstract": "OEIS complex refers to a combination of defects consisting of omphalocoele, exstrophy of the cloaca, imperforate anus, and spinal defects. The incidence of the OEIS complex is very rare, estimated to occur in 1 of 200,000-400,000 pregnancies. The aetiology of the OEIS complex is still unclear, single defects in blastogenesis and mutations in homeobox genes, such as HLXB9, have been suggested to be responsible for the development of the OEIS complex. Moreover, higher incidence of OEIS in monozygotic twins suggests a possible genetic contribution to the occurrence of this multisystem defect. We here report the peculiar case of OEIS complex in a dizygotic twin pregnancy. Prenatal diagnosis of OEIS by ultrasound examination is possible but difficult. Sonographic detection of an omphalocoele in the presence of an open neural tube defect should prompt a search of OEIS-associated defects. Accurate prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound and/or diagnosis of the OEIS complex at autopsy are important for detailed counselling of the parents and perinatal management.",

    "abstract": "This study used content analysis to examine reasons for cessation of breastfeeding of twins by 2 time points: 9.4 weeks and 28.3 weeks of age. From a convenience sample of 123 mothers, 110 initiated breastfeeding for their twins. Thirty women had stopped breastfeeding by time 1, with an additional 37 women stopping by time 2. Three major themes were identified regarding weaning: factors related to breastfeeding process, to mother's role and health, and to infant behavior and health. Subcategories were identified for each theme, with additional subcategories emerging at time 2. Cited reasons are similar to those given by singleton mothers; however, mothers of twins identified unique issues related to infants' behaviors, challenges presented by growth and development, and time commitments that interfered with breastfeeding continuation. Implications of the study suggest the need for continued lactation support as the twins grow and develop and new breastfeeding issues arise.",

    "abstract": "Family studies are in conflict as to whether schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have independent genetic etiologies. Given the relatively low prevalence (approximately 1%) of these disorders, the use of quantitative endophenotypic markers of genetic liability might provide a more sensitive strategy for evaluating their genetic overlap. We have previously demonstrated that spatial working memory deficits increase in a dose-dependent fashion with increasing genetic proximity to a proband among the unaffected co-twins of schizophrenic patients. Here, we evaluated whether such deficits might also mark genetic susceptibility to bipolar disorder.\nThe Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Visual Memory Span and Digit Span subtests were administered to 46 schizophrenic patients, 32 of their unaffected co-twins, 22 bipolar patients, 16 of their unaffected co-twins, and 100 control twins, representing unselectively nationwide twin samples.\nSchizophrenic patients and their unaffected co-twins performed significantly worse than control subjects on the spatial working memory task, whereas only the schizophrenic patients performed significantly below the control subjects on the verbal working memory task. Neither bipolar patients nor their unaffected co-twins differed from control subjects on these measures.\nOur findings support the hypothesis that impairment in spatial working memory might effectively reflect an expression of genetic liability to schizophrenia but less clearly to bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "A population-based twin study is a useful design for quantification of the effects of genes and environmental factors in disease etiology. We used data from 10,000 Swedish twin pairs to quantify genetic and environmental contributions to tooth loss and periodontal health. Oral health information was obtained from telephone interviews. Structural equation models measured the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors contributed to 14% of variation in tooth loss among women, and 39% among men. Non-shared environmental factors accounted for one-quarter of risk; environmental factors shared by twins comprised the remainder. Heritability estimates of periodontal disease were 39% and 33% for women and men, respectively, while non-shared environmental factors accounted for the remaining variation. Heritability for both conditions varied as a function of age and smoking status. Analysis of data from this large, population-based study demonstrates a moderate role of genetic factors in oral diseases, and suggests potential gene-environment interactions.",

    "abstract": "Male migrants from Finland to Sweden have been found to have a reduced risk of coronary heart disease after several years in Sweden. Changes in smoking habits may contribute to this reduced risk.\nA study was undertaken to compare smoking habits in Finnish migrants to Sweden and subjects always living in Finland and to analyse whether the migration may have influenced smoking.\nThe study population consisted of same-sex twin pairs born in Finland younger than 76 years with at least one twin that had migrated to Sweden (n = 1,083 pairs). Smoking habits obtained by mailed questionnaire were compared in migration-discordant twin pairs to take into account early childhood and genetic factors.\nImmigrants and returnees with a history of smoking had predominantly started to smoke before the migration. Among women, immigrants to Sweden smoked more than never migrants in Finland, odds ratio (OR) 2.1 for current smokers (95% confidence interval CI 1.4-3.3) but this difference was already present before migration. In men there were essentially no differences in smoking prevalence between immigrants and never migrants but heavy smoking was less common among immigrants than among never migrant smokers, OR 0.5 (95% CI 0.2-0.9) and migration was associated with a greater propensity to cease smoking.\nMigration from Finland to Sweden does not seem to have had a strong influence on smoking among migrants. A favourable trend in smoking habits after migration may in part have contributed to reduced mortality and incidence of coronary heart disease in male Finnish migrants after several years in Sweden.",

    "abstract": "We present the clinical, radiological, and pathological findings of open lung biopsies from monozygotic prematurely born male twins with respiratory distress at ages 6 and 8 weeks postnatally. Radiological examination showed a reticular nodular interstitial pattern on chest radiography. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) revealed ground-glass opacification and thickened interstitial septae in both infants. Lung biopsies showed a similar histology. There was diffuse interstitial thickening of the alveolar septa by mesenchymal cells, without prominent hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes, and without airspace exudates. Sections were periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive within the cytoplasm of interstitial cells, indicating the presence of glycogen. Thus the diagnosis of pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis was made. Both infants were treated with glucocorticoids and had a favorable outcome. We speculate that pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis could be a histopathological form of chronic lung disease (CLD) of infancy.",

    "abstract": "D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA) is a very rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that has recently been associated with mutations in the D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase gene. The biochemical phenotype of D-2-HGA is defined by the accumulation of abnormal amounts of D-2-hydroxyglutarate in cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine while the clinical phenotype can vary from a severe epileptic encephalopathy to normal. The basis for this phenotypic variation is not well-defined. We report a set of 412-year-old monozygotic (MZ) female twins with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria who are shown to be compound heterozygotes for c.326-327dupTC, p.Glu110ArgfsX19, and c.1123G-->T, p.Asp375Tyr mutations in the D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase gene, but who have remarkably different clinical phenotypes. One twin presented with multiple congenital anomalies, severe developmental delay, and abnormal neuroradiological findings, while the other had normal neurocognitive and neuroradiological phenotypes, without concomitant congenital abnormalities. Monozygosity of these twins implies that the differences in the clinical phenotype arise from postzygotic genetic changes, epigenetic differences, or environmental factors that influence the phenotypic response to biochemical perturbation rather than allelic or locus heterogeneity. Though the mechanistic role of these factors in D-2-HGA is far from apparent, the discordance in the phenotypes of these siblings establishes that these factors are at least as important as the nature of the mutant alleles in influencing the progression of the disorder.",

    "abstract": "Twin concordance studies help evaluate the contribution of genetic factors in childhood cancers, but previous reports have primarily focused on leukemia because of the rarity of other malignancies. In the current report, a large cohort of childhood cancer survivors was used to: (1) describe twin concordance patterns for a range of cancers, (2) calculate the standardized incidence rates of cancers in twins, and (3) describe clinical features and outcomes of concordant twins.\nCancer family history was obtained on the 211 twins participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) (14,352 participants surviving > or =5 years after a malignancy diagnosed at <21 years during January 1, 1970-December 31, 1986) to calculate probandwise twin concordance rates and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results data.\nSeven monozygotic twin pairs were concordant for cancer (six for leukemia, one for non-Hodgkin lymphoma), yielding probandwise concordance rates of 9.5%, 20.7%, and 20.0% for all cancer, leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), respectively. No concordance was observed among dizygotic twins or for dissimilar cancers. The SIR in monozygotic twins was 23.3 (95% CI = 11.1-48.9) for all cancer, 112.4 (95% CI = 50.5-250.1) for leukemia, and 40.5 (5.7-287.5) for NHL. Concordant twins were similar in age at diagnosis and vital status.\nTwin concordance for cancer is largely restricted to monozygotic twins and hematological malignancies, consistent with in utero malignancy transmission demonstrated by others. Our data support clinical monitoring of the twins of cases with hematological malignancies, and does not contribute evidence for genetic factors in other cancers.",

Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis occurs in approximately 1 in 2,100 live births; the incidence of twinning in patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis has been reported to be higher than the rate of 2.5% of live births in the general population. No definitive explanation for this increased risk is known. The incidence of twinning in patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis may range between 2.5 and 19 in 210,000 live births. Syndromic craniosynostosis occurs in between 1 per 10,000 live births (Muenke's syndrome) to 1 per 80,000 live births (Apert's syndrome). Because of the these low occurrences, the actual incidence of twinning in syndromic craniosynostosis is difficult to predict. A theoretical incidence between 2.5 per million live births in Muenke's syndrome and 2.5 per 8 million live births in Apert's syndrome can be estimated.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to identify subsets of women undergoing two-embryo transfer in in vitro fertilization (IVF) who are prone to give birth to twins.\nDuring 1990 to 2002 4580 day 2 or day 3 two-embryo transfers were conducted and these constituted the study population.\nBy selecting combinations of factors, some subsets of patients where single-embryo transfer might be conducted would reduce the estimated twin rate by 60%, but requiring single-embryo transfer in only approximately one third of the patients. Examples of such selected groups were patients less than 33 years of age with two top quality embryos, patients less than 39 years of age with two top quality embryos and conducting their first IVF cycle, and patients less than 39 years of age with two top quality embryos and two optimal cleavage cells.\nBy combining factors, subsets of patients with both a high birth and twin rate that could be recommended single embryo transfer were identified.",

    "abstract": "To determine the risk of perinatal death among twins born at term in relation to mode of delivery.\nRetrospective cohort study.\nScotland 1985-2001.\nAll twin births at or after 36 weeks of gestation, excluding antepartum stillbirths and perinatal deaths due to congenital abnormality (n= 8073).\nThe outcome of first and second twins was compared using McNemar's test and the outcome of twin pairs in relation to mode of delivery was compared using exact logistic regression.\nIntrapartum stillbirth or neonatal death of either twin.\nOverall, there were six deaths of first twins and 30 deaths of second twins (OR for second twin 5.00, 95% CI 2.00-14.70). The odds ratio for death of the second twin due to intrapartum anoxia was 21 (95% CI 3.4-868.5). The associations were similar for twins delivered following induction of labour and for sex discordant twins. However, there was no association between birth order and the risk of death among 1472 deliveries by planned caesarean section. There was death of either twin among 2 of 1472 (0.14%) deliveries by planned caesarean section and 34 of 6601 (0.52%) deliveries by other means (P= 0.05, odds ratio for planned caesarean section 0.26 [95% CI 0.03-1.03]). The association was similar when adjusted for potential confounders. Assuming causality, we estimate that 264 caesarean deliveries (95% CI 158-808) would be required to prevent each death.\nPlanned caesarean section may reduce the risk of perinatal death of twins at term by approximately 75% compared with attempting vaginal birth. This is principally due to reducing the risk of death of the second twin due to intrapartum anoxia.",

    "abstract": "Monoamniotic twin pregnancy discordant for anencephaly (MATDA) is a rare occurrence with only seven prior reported cases. Selective termination has been advocated in managing discordant monoamniotic twins. We report two cases managed expectantly with good outcomes and review other previously reported cases. The first case was a primigravid woman diagnosed with MATDA at 18 weeks. She was managed expectantly until 32 + 5 weeks when a Cesarean section was performed for preterm labor. The surviving female infant weighed 1610 g. The second case was a multigravid woman who was diagnosed with MATDA at 17 + 5 weeks and was managed as an outpatient. An emergency Cesarean section was performed at 31 weeks for non-reassuring monitoring and the surviving male infant weighed 1790 g. In both cases, the survivors were discharged home in good condition. A review of these two cases and those in the literature suggests that expectant management should be considered among management options for this rare condition.",
