    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects more than cognition, having a temporal relationship with neuroinflammatory pathways of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although this association is supported by epidemiological and clinical studies, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Microglia and astrocytes play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of both MDD and PD. In PD, these cells can be activated by misfolded forms of the protein \u03b1-synuclein to release cytokines that can interact with multiple different physiological processes to produce depressive symptoms, including monoamine transport and availability, the hypothalamus-pituitary axis, and neurogenesis. In MDD, glial cell activation can be induced by peripheral inflammatory agents that cross the blood-brain barrier and/or c-Fos signalling from neurons. The resulting neuroinflammation can cause neurodegeneration due to oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity, contributing to PD pathology. Astrocytes are another major link due to their recognized role in the glymphatic clearance mechanism. Research suggesting that MDD causes astrocytic destruction or structural atrophy highlights the possibility that accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in the brain is facilitated as the brain cannot adequately clear the protein aggregates. This review examines research into the overlapping pathophysiology of MDD and PD with particular focus on the roles of glial cells and neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Safinamide is a new add-on drug to levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with motor fluctuations. Due to the recent incorporation of safinamide into routine clinical practice, no post-authorisation phase IV studies on the safety of safinamide have been conducted to date. This study provides clinical management guidelines for safinamide based on the opinion of a group of experts in movement disorders. This project was developed in 2 phases: 16 local meetings in phase 1 and a national meeting in phase 2. The meetings followed a pre-established agenda. The present clinical practice guidelines are based on the main conclusions reached during the national meeting. The group concluded that safinamide is effective in reducing motor and non-motor fluctuations. PD patients with mild-to-moderate fluctuations benefit most from treatment, although the drug may also improve the clinical status of patients with advanced PD. The dose of other dopaminergic drugs may be reduced after introducing safinamide, which would contribute to reducing such adverse reactions as impulse control disorder. At doses higher than those usually prescribed, safinamide may also improve dyskinesia. The experts agreed that safinamide is well tolerated and causes few adverse reactions when compared with placebo.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder in which environmental (lifestyle, dietary, infectious disease) factors as well as genetic make-up play a role. Metabolomics, an evolving research field combining biomarker discovery and pathogenetics, is particularly useful in studying complex pathophysiology in general and Parkinson's disease (PD) specifically. PD, the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of intraneural inclusions of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates. Although considered a predominantly movement disorder, PD is also associated with number of non-motor features. Metabolomics has provided useful information regarding this neurodegenerative process with the aim of identifying a disease-specific fingerprint. Unfortunately, many disease variables such as clinical presentation, motor system involvement, disease stage and duration substantially affect biomarker relevance. As such, metabolomics provides a unique approach to studying this multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric drugs are used for a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This article aims to analyze the trend and determinants of public expenditure of these medicines in Minas Gerais, from 2010 to 2017. Data from the Integrated Materials and Services Administration System (SIAD) database were used to estimate volumes of acquisition and expenditure. A breakdown analysis was performed, and the list of purchased drugs was reviewed, and the Drug Utilization technique (DU90%) applied concerning anti-Parkinson drugs. Annual expenditure dropped by 36%, from R$ 111.7 million in 2010 to R$ 40.9 million in 2017, and the determinant factors were the falling prices and volume, associated with changes in the drug mix, which favored the acquisition, on average, of more expensive products. Higher levels of expenditure for anti-Parkinson drugs stand out, however, with a significant change in the list purchased. This study contributed to a better understanding of public spending on neuropsychiatric drugs. A reduced volume can increase the risk of shortages. Regarding anti-Parkinson drugs, there is no evidence to suggest an increased supply to the population.\nMedicamentos neuropsiqui\u00e1tricos s\u00e3o utilizados para variadas condi\u00e7\u00f5es neurol\u00f3gicas e psiqui\u00e1tricas.

    "abstract": "We propose to investigate brain electrophysiological alterations associated with Parkinson's disease through a novel adaptive dynamical model of the network of the basal ganglia, the cortex and the thalamus. The model uniquely unifies the influence of dopamine in the regulation of the activity of all basal ganglia nuclei, the self-organised neuronal interdependent activity of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits and the generation of subcortical background oscillations. Variations in the amount of dopamine produced in the neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta are key both in the onset of Parkinson's disease and in the basal ganglia action selection. We model these dopamine-induced relationships, and Parkinsonian states are interpreted as spontaneous emergent behaviours associated with different rhythms of oscillatory activity patterns of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network. These results are significant because: (1) the neural populations are built upon single-neuron models that have been robustly designed to have eletrophysiologically-realistic responses, and (2) our model distinctively links changes in the oscillatory activity in subcortical structures, dopamine levels in the basal ganglia and pathological synchronisation neuronal patterns compatible with Parkinsonian states, this still remains an open problem and is crucial to better understand the progression of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease (PD) are usually attributed to medications and dysfunction in higher order sensory processing as the disease progresses. However deficits in visual processing, including colour discrimination, have been reported in early, untreated PD and it is unclear how these, along with co-morbid conditions affecting vision, could contribute to hallucinations. This case describes a 66-year-old otherwise fully independent woman with early, mild PD who presented with discrete episodes of unusual vivid hallucinations centred on colour. She was later found to have a subclinical colour deficiency in excess of her PD and, after reporting a lifelong history of poor vision in her father, tested positive for autosomal dominant optic atrophy. This case illustrates how a lifelong extrinsic deficiency in colour vision can interact with the effects of visual changes in early stage PD and medication to provoke colour hallucinations. It therefore emphasises the importance of full ophthalmological work up in similar cases where hallucinations are atypical and unexpected for the severity and stage of PD.",

    "abstract": "Table tennis is a popular sport worldwide. However, no study has examined whether it is an effective exercise for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The efficacy and safety of table tennis exercise for PD patients was examined.\nThis 6-month prospective study investigated if our table tennis exercise program could improve parkinsonian motor symptoms, cognition and psychiatric symptoms. Twelve PD patients with Hoehn & Yahr stage \u22644 were recruited. Patients participated in a 6-hour exercise session once weekly. All patients were assessed with the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) parts I-IV, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS) at baseline, 3\u00a0months, and 6\u00a0months.\nNine of 12 PD patients were analyzed, except for three patients for which data was missing. MDS-UPDRS parts II and III were improved at 3\u00a0months (median -4.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012 and median -10.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012) and 6\u00a0months (median -7.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.015 and median -12.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), whereas MDS-UPDRS total parts I scores and total IV scores, MoCA, FAB, SDS, and SAS were unchanged. Adverse events included fall and backache in one patient each.\nA table tennis exercise program is relatively safe and may improve activities of daily living and motor symptoms in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) abnormalities are commonly seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). Both reduced speed and saccades seen during SPEM, also known as saccadic pursuit (SP), have been studied in PD. A comprehensive literature review analyzed 26 studies of SPEM and PD. It appears that a greater proportion of PD patients have SPEM abnormalities consisting of reduced SPEM gain and/or SP compared to the normal population. It is not clear whether SPEM abnormalities are present early in the disease or begin sometime during disease progression. SPEM abnormalities may be correlated with disease severity but do not fluctuate or respond to dopaminergic medication in the same manner as other motor symptoms in PD. SPEM in PD is composed of normal SPEM interspersed with SP composed of both catch up and anticipatory saccades. This differs from other neurodegenerative disorders and may be related to an inability to inhibit extraneous saccades or to increased distraction reflecting executive dysfunction. Because the basal ganglia are involved in SPEM physiology, degeneration of the SNr neurons in PD may explain abnormal SPEM in this disorder. Since dementia, aging and medication effects influence SPEM, they should be controlled for in future studies of SPEM in PD. SP is easily detected on clinical exam and may be a biomarker for the disease or for disease progression. Oculomotor testing can be an important part of the Parkinson's exam.",

Results from Australia are presented. Participants included consecutive adults with PD attending routine clinical visits, or inpatients, who could speak English. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients diagnosed with APD via physician judgement.\n100 patients were recruited in Australia: 61.0% (95% CI 51.4-70.6%) diagnosed with APD by physician judgement. Patients were 66.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.5\u202fyears, 65% were male, were living at home (97%), and diagnosed with PD for median 10.7\u202fyears (0-30.5\u202fyears). Motor fluctuations were present in 68%. For those with APD, referral was predominantly to enable access to device assisted therapies (DAT) (49%), while for non-APD, referral was largely for diagnostic purposes (41%). Patients had a median follow-up at the movement disorder clinic of 4.8\u202fyears for those with APD, or 3.6\u202fyears for non-APD. While 62% were eligible for DAT, only two-thirds of these received them. The most commonly used DAT was deep brain stimulation (64.3%). There was fair agreement between physician's judgement and the APD criteria by Delphi method (Cohen's kappa) 0.325 (95% CI 0.150-0.500) in the Australian subset.\nThe definition of APD requires refinement in order to facilitate greater agreement among movement disorder specialists. A third of APD patients eligible for DAT remain untreated. Better referral and education of patients with APD is needed.",

    "abstract": "Tube-related adverse events (AEs) occur frequently in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) receiving levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel therapy. Endoscopy has become evasive since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate methods that use the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-jejunostomy (PEG-J) tubes without endoscopy.\nWe included 19 patients in this study. The contrast agent was injected into the PEG-J tube to clarify the AEs related to the use of the tube. When the kink of the PEG-J tube was found, it was pulled approximately 5-10\u00a0cm. When placing or replacing the PEG-J tube, the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was pushed into the gastrostomy hole to bring its tip closer to the pylorus before a new PEG-J tube was inserted into it.\nThe mean patient age was 63.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.9\u00a0years, while the mean duration of PD was 16.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.3\u00a0years. Tube-related AEs included PEG-J tube kinks (32 events), connector failures (20 events), and PEG-J tube entanglements without/with bezoars (9 events/5 events). All PEG-J tube kinks were resolved by tube manipulation with a fluoroscopic guide. In 66 of 85 events (77.6%), the PEG-J tube was placed or replaced without endoscopy. We believe that the use of the antispasmodic agent just before PEG-J operation reduced this rate.\nOur methods were able to resolve most AEs associated with PEG-J tube use without endoscopy.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) are at higher risk of complications when admitted to the hospital. Delays in PD medications and use of contraindicated medications contribute to the increased risk and prolong their lengths of stay (LOS). Using a hospital-wide PD protocol, we aimed to ensure PD medications were placed with \"custom\" timing to resemble the home schedules, and also to avoid ordering or administering contraindicated medications.\n569 patients admitted in 2017 and 2018, were reviewed retrospectively. Mean age was 76.5 (SD 10.6), 332 were males and 237 were females. Charts were reviewed to assess if A) PD medications were ordered with custom timing, B) if not, were the orders changed to custom timed C) if contraindicated medications were ordered, and D) if they were administered. We also assessed the actual/expected length of stay during this time period. Chi Square and post hoc analyses were done to compare time points. Poisson regression analysis was done to assess relative improvement of variables.\nThere was a 2.7 fold increase in orders placed with custom timing in 2018 compared to 2017 (RR\u202f=\u202f2.651, 95%CI: 1.860-3.780, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), and a 3.2 fold increase in correction of non-custom orders in the same time period (RR\u202f=\u202f3.246, 95%CI: 1.875-1.619, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). We also observed a decrease in the actual/expected LOS ratio from 1.54\u202f to 1.32\u202f (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).\nBy utilizing an established platform for quality improvement, we were able to improve adherence to the home medication regimen timing in admitted PD patients. Our findings also suggests that adherence to a strict medication regimen protocol may decrease LOS for this patient population.",

    "abstract": "The ability of people with Parkinson's Disease (PWPD) to perceive and identify impairments related to communication and swallowing is often impaired. This impairment prolongs the time to diagnosis of dysphonia and dysphagia, and can delay implementation of speech or swallowing therapy. We have limited knowledge of how different motor phenotypes of PD impact speech, voice and swallowing, nor how PWPD perceive these impacts. The purpose of this study was to identify how perceptions of speech and voice impairments predict dysphagia in PD, and how those perceptions differ between motor phenotypes.\n38 PWPD completed clinical surveys including V-RQOL, DHI, and a speech, voice, and swallow symptom questionnaire. Participants were categorized as either tremor dominant (TD) or non-tremor dominant (NTD) phenotypes. Multiple regression and MANOVA were utilized to identify predictors of dysphagia perceptions, and for differentiating between motor phenotype based on perceptual severity.\nPerceptions of speech and voice impairment predicted perceptions of swallow impairment regardless of phenotype (\nThe use of a noninvasive and cost-efficient survey battery may be useful in predicting patient perceived swallow impairment in PWPD. Speech, voice, and swallow impairments based on survey responses were found to differ between motor phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have found that patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) showed impairments in certain aspects of spatial orientation. The current study aimed to systematically investigate whether these impairments extend to wayfinding abilities in patients with PD. Wayfinding refers to the ability to navigate to an unseen location in the environment and is essential to one's everyday functioning.\nA total of 24 patients with PD, 20 ability matched controls, 21 college students participated in a series of experimental behavioral tasks and a self-report of environmental abilities. In the route learning task, participants learned and then recalled routes. In the survey learning task, participants were asked to form configurational or survey knowledge. In the map tracing tack, participants were asked to trace the turning directions of a route on a map.\nPatients with PD showed no impairments in the behavioral measures of wayfinding relative to ability matched controls. Both groups performed worse than college students, who had higher cognitive levels. Patients with PD, however, reported a higher competency in environmental abilities than college students.\nAlthough wayfinding abilities may decrease as cognitive abilities decline, they do not appear as a unique impairment for patients with PD relative to their cognitive level.",

    "abstract": "Living a life with Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a challenge for both patients and spouses. Patients have to cope with an increasing limitation in all domains of their daily life and spouses need to adjust to these changes. The focus of this study is on exploring, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the psychosocial needs of both patients with PD and spouses.\nAn online survey with 11 themes, related to dealing with a chronic disease, was sent by an email to patients and spouses and two focus groups were planned, one with patients and one with spouses. Data from the survey were quantitatively analysed and audiotapes from the focus groups were transcribed verbatim and combined with notes.\nPercentages of relevance are higher than 50% for all the themes, whereas those of the need for and received support are all lower than 50%. Focus groups revealed a negative image of psychosocial therapy and associations with failure, but also difficulties in signalling problems by professionals, little attention for spouses and limited access to specialized psychosocial care.\nBased on this exploration, there appears to be a threshold to ask for psychosocial support on the one hand and to find the right professional on the other hand. A permanent position for psychosocial health professionals in the multidisciplinary Parkinson teams and networks may close the gap between 'supply and demand'.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients commonly experience episodic memory impairments, which are associated with an increased risk of dementia. The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) is a well-validated test to investigate episodic memory changes in healthy aging and in neurodegenerative diseases but has not been studied in PD patients.\nIn the MST task, participants respond during a testing phase whether visualized images are \"repeat\", \"similar\", or \"new\", compared to images previously shown during an encoding phase. We tested 17 PD without cognitive impairment (level-II criteria), both off (PD-OFF) and on (PD-ON) dopaminergic medications; and compared PD-OFF with 17 age- and education-matched healthy controls (HC).\nWe found no influence of dopaminergic medications nor of disease on MST reaction time for any responses (\"repeat\", \"similar\", and \"new\") during the test phase. However, response probabilities showed that the MST is sensitive to subtle PD-related memory impairments. Specifically, PD-OFF responded more frequently with 'repeat', instead of 'similar' during lure trials, compared to HC (\nPD patients perform the MST without interference from bradykinesia or other PD-related motor symptoms. Our findings suggest that PD patients who do not meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment can have subtle recall or recognition impairments, which can be identified using the MST. We propose the MST as a well-tolerated and sensitive cognitive task in future studies of episodic memory impairment and progressive memory dysfunction in people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are known to suffer from subtle cognitive and balance deficits from the early stages although they usually manifest in advanced stages. Postural instability (PI) has been correlated with slower information processing speed. Simple reaction time (SRT) tasks can be used to measure the speed of information processing. The main objective of this study was to examine the usefulness of SRT as a valid predictor of balance in PD, thus providing a simple and complementary assessment method.\nThis cross-sectional study included 52 PD patients without dementia who were evaluated for balance using the pull test (PT) maneuver and Biodex\u00ae limits of stability (LOS). In addition, a reaction time task was used to measure processing speed. Correlation and linear regression analyses were performed.\nThe performance of SRT tasks was correlated with the evaluation of LOS% and PT, suggesting that the SRT may be a predictor of balance performance. Longer reaction time and poorer postural stability were also associated with disease duration but not with age.\nPoor performance in a simple reaction task can predict altered PI and can complement staging and evaluation in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a rare disease that can cause various patterns of tachyarrhythmias. The main goal of anaesthesiologists for the perioperative anaesthetic management of WPW patients must be to avoid sympathetic stimulation and prevent tachyarrhythmias.\nA 9-year-old male patient with a diagnosis of WPW syndrome, who underwent emergency surgery for supracondylar humerus fracture, is presented. General anaesthesia in combination with infraclavicular brachial plexus (ICBP) block was performed successfully without any complications. For the reversal of neuromuscular block, sugammadex was uneventfully used. Intraoperative sympathetic discharge due to surgical intervention was prevented with ICBP block. The ICBP block has also provided good postoperative analgesia.\nSugammadex is a good alternative for the reversal of neuromuscular blocks to avoid the undesirable effects of cholinergic drugs. Peripheral regional blocks that require relatively large doses of local anaesthetics can be safely performed with utmost attention in paediatric WPW patients.",

    "abstract": "The spontaneous activity of the brain is dynamic even at rest and the deviation from this normal pattern of dynamics can lead to different pathological states. EEG microstate analysis of resting-state neuronal activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) could provide insight into altered brain dynamics of patients exhibiting dementia. Resting-state EEG microstate maps were derived from 128 channel EEG data in 20 PD without dementia (PDND), 18 PD with dementia (PDD) and 20 Healthy controls (CON) using Cartool and sLORETA softwares. Microstate map parameters including global explained variance, mean duration, frequency of occurrence (TF) and time coverage were compared statistically among the groups. Eight maps that explained 72% of the topographic variance were identified and only three maps differed significantly across the groups. TF of Map1 was lower in both PDND and PDD (",

    "abstract": "The complexity of motor and non-motor symptoms seen in Parkinson's, with their variability and progressive nature, have a significant and potentially detrimental effect on mobility and subsequent quality of life for those with the condition. A considerable body of evidence now exists advocating the positive value of physical activity and exercise on both the motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's, whilst limiting the impact and effects of the secondary complications. The literature is signposting to early adoption of higher intensity exercise, with reported benefits at a neurophysiological level, and a potential to influence a diminution in the rate of progression of the condition. It lacks clarity about structure of activity throughout the course of Parkinson's, and occasionally raises conflicting information about the differences in physical activity and 'best' exercise. This report describes the method for development of two Parkinson's exercise resources for professionals co-ordinated through the charity Parkinson's UK. The process uses the six-step Analytic Hierarchy Process to understand how the growing number of questions asked by people with Parkinson's, and by professionals about physical activity and exercise has informed: a) An Exercise Framework resource, which provides an understanding of what style of exercise might be beneficial, and just as significantly, takes into account the individual's changing needs and abilities over the course of Parkinson's, and b) An adaptable teaching template (PowerPoint Presentation) containing the supporting evidence for use by the exercise prescribing community.",

    "abstract": "Several studies suggests that the provision of auditory cues with music could be beneficial for people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of music-based physical therapy on the international Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) components: disability, cognition, muscle strength, balance, and functional mobility.\nThis was a controlled, non-randomized clinical trial involving 13 individuals with PD assessed at three times: baseline, period 1 (treatment), and period 2 (no treatment). The variables analyzed were: disability by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y), cognitive function by Trail Making Test, muscle strength by Medical Research Council (MRC) and sitting-rising (SR) test, balance and functional mobility by Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Timed up and Go (TUG). ANOVA with post-hoc multiple comparison was used to determine statistical differences between the baseline, period 1 and 2.\nthere was statistically significant difference among the period 1 and 2 for the cognitive function; there was a statistically significant difference between the period 1 and 2 in SR test; in the balance evaluation by BBS, an increase was observed between the baseline and the period 1, followed by a decrease in period 2; in the TUG, there was an increase between the period 1 and 2.\nthe music-based physical therapy, according to the ICF construct, was able to improve balance and functional mobility in individuals with PD. The functional gains were not maintained when the therapy was discontinued.",

    "abstract": "One of the common impairments in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is disturbance of gait initiation. A light touch cue improves postural stability in patients with PD. Little is known about the effects of a light touch cue on gait initiation. This study investigated the effects of a light touch on gait initiation in patients with PD.\nThis study was a cross-sectional study design. Sixteen patients with PD (Hoehn & Yahr stage 2-3) participated in the study and were evaluated two gait conditions (no touch (NT) and light touch (LT) conditions). Gait initiation was divided into 5 events including event A, B, C, D, and E. Outcome measures included maximum center of pressure (COP) displacement and velocity in anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions, and the first step time.\nParticipants with LT had greater COP displacement compared with the NT condition in all events of gait initiation except COP-AP displacement in event D. Additionally, the COP velocity in LT condition was faster than the NT condition in COP-ML velocity in event A, COP-AP velocity in event B, COP-AP velocity and COP-ML velocity in event C. Moreover, participants with LT presented significantly shorter the first step time than the NT condition.\nThese findings demonstrated that a light touch cue improved gait initiation in patients with PD by increased weight shifting to initial stance limb, increased postural stability of stance limb, increased velocity of weight transfer toward stance limb, and a shortened first step time.",

    "abstract": "Environmental enrichment during physical exercise was found beneficial in neurological disorders. Application of dance in a structured way could effectively enhance the environment of physical rehabilitation. Therefore, dance therapy can be an alternative exercise program with potential benefit in affect, cognition and social integration in various neurological disorders.\nThis pre-post experimental study without control was designed to assess the impact of dance movement therapy on cognition, quality of life and motor symptoms in PD patients.\nA group of 10 mild-moderate PD patients from Movement Disorders Clinic; I-NK, participated in group sessions for a period of 2 months (twice a week). Each session involved verbal communication followed by warming up movements and concluded with target oriented physical activities, focused on physical symptoms, emotional and cognitive aspects. All the patients were assessed before and after the intervention using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS part III), Hoehn and Yahr Scale (H and Y), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA).\nWe observed a change in median MOCA score from 19.00 to 22.00 (p .027). PDQ 39 also showed change in median score from 59.50 to 30.00 (p .027). The change in UPDRS III (0.08) and H and Y (0.157) failed to reach significant limit.\nDance Movement Therapy was found beneficial in overall cognition and quality of life in patients with mild-moderate PD.

    "abstract": "Quantify the value of functional status (FS) improvements consistent in magnitude with improvements due to levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) treatment, among the advanced Parkinson's disease (APD) population.\nThe Health Economic Medical Innovation Simulation (THEMIS), a microsimulation that estimates future health conditions and medical spending, was used to quantify the health and cost burden of disability among the APD population, and the value of quality-adjusted life-years gained from FS improvement due to LCIG treatment compared to standard of care (SoC). A US-representative Parkinson's disease (PD)-comparable cohort was constructed in THEMIS based on observed PD patient characteristics in a nationally representative dataset. APD was defined from the literature and clinical expert input. The PD and APD cohorts were followed from 2010 over their remaining lifetimes. All individuals were ages 65 and over at the start of the simulation. To estimate the value of FS improvement due to LCIG treatment, decreases in activities of daily living (ADL) limitations caused by LCIG treatment were calculated using data from a randomized, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trial and applied to the APD population in THEMIS.\nTotal burden of disability associated with APD was $17.7 billion (B). From clinical trial data, LCIG treatment versus SoC lowers the odds of difficulties in walking, dressing, and bathing by 76%, 42% and 39%, respectively. Among the APD population, these reductions generated $2.6B in value to patients and cost savings to payers. The added value was 15% of the burden of disability associated with APD and offsets 15% of the cost of LCIG treatment.\nFS improvements, consistent with improvements due to LCIG treatment, in the APD population created health benefits and reduced healthcare costs in the US.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients require frequent office visits where they are assessed for health state changes using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Inertial wearable sensor devices present a unique opportunity to supplement these assessments with continuous monitoring. In this work, we analyze kinematic features from sensor devices located on feet, wrists, lumbar and sternum for 35 PD subjects as they performed walk trials in two clinical visits, one for each of their self-reported ON and OFF motor states. Our results show that a few features related to subject's whole-body turns and pronation-supination motor events can accurately infer cardinal features of PD like bradykinesia and posture instability and gait disorder (PIGD). In addition, these features can be measured from only two sensors, one located on the affected wrist and one on the lumbar region, thus potentially reducing patient burden of wearing sensors while supporting continuous monitoring in out of office settings.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which is characterized by typical symptoms including gradual progressive muscle rigidity, tremor and loss of motor skills. Although there is no definitive cure for PD, the extract of some medicinal plants and their ingredients have been suggested to relieve its symptoms and to prevent disability in patients. This review is focused on therapeutic effects of some medicinal plants and their ingredients on PD. The findings presented in this review were collected from experimental and clinical studies in databases including PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar until the end of May 2019. The keywords \"neurotoxicity \" or \"Parkinson's disease\" or \"neuroprotective\" and \"Medicinal plants\" and \"Flavonoids\" were searched. Based on the results of animal and clinical studies, the extract of medicinal plants and their components which are discussed in this review have neuro-protective effects against PD. These protective properties mainly are mediated through inhibition of dopamine metabolizing enzymes, reduction oxidant markers, increase of antioxidant agents and suppression of neuro-inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The gut-brain axis is a hot topic in Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been postulated that gut pathogens and dysbiosis can contribute to peripheral inflammatory states or trigger downstream metabolic effects that exacerbate the neurodegenerative process in PD. Several preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated disrupted intestinal permeability, intestinal inflammation, altered gut microbiome, and reduced fecal short-chain fatty acids in PD. In this regard, microbial-directed therapies such as probiotics are emerging as potential therapeutic options. Probiotic supplementation is postulated to confer a variety of health benefits due to the diverse functions of these live microorganisms, including inhibition of pathogen colonization, modulation/\"normalization\" of the microbiome and/or its function, immunomodulatory effects (e.g. reducing inflammation), and improved host epithelial barrier function. Interestingly, several PD animal model studies have demonstrated the potential neuroprotective effects of probiotics in reducing dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Notably, two randomized placebo-controlled trials have provided class I evidence for probiotics as a treatment for constipation in PD. However, the effects of probiotics on other PD aspects, such as motor disability and cognitive function, and its long-term efficacy (including effects on PD drug absorption in the gut) have not been investigated adequately. Further targeted animal and human studies are also warranted to understand the mechanisms of actions of probiotics in PD and to tailor probiotic therapy based on individual host profiles to improve patient outcomes in this disabling disorder.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene GBA, encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are the highest genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). GCase is a lysosomal glycoprotein responsible for the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide. Mutations in GBA cause a decrease in GCase activity, stability and protein levels which in turn lead to the accumulation of GCase lipid substrates as well as \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) in vitro and in vivo. \u03b1S is the main constituent of Lewy bodies found in the brain of PD patients and an increase in its levels was found to be associated with a decrease in GCase activity/protein levels in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we describe the reported biophysical and biochemical changes that GBA mutations can induce in GCase activity and stability as well as the current overview of the levels of GCase protein/activity, \u03b1S and lipids measured in patient-derived samples including post-mortem brains, stem cell-derived neurons, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and fibroblasts as well as in SH-SY5Y cells. In particular, we report how the levels of \u03b1S and lipids are affected by/correlated to significant changes in GCase activity/protein levels and which cellular pathways are activated or disrupted by these changes in each model. Finally, we review the current strategies used to revert the changes in the levels of GCase activity/protein, \u03b1S and lipids in the context of PD.",

In addition, the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 (cleaved-casp-3) and Bax (apoptosis-related proteins) was increased, while the expression of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) was reduced in MPTP-HCl-treated mice.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder which is assessed based on the motor symptoms. A number of microRNAs (miRNAs) are dysregulated and involved in the pathogenesis or development of PD. However, no confirmed markers are used for the early detection of PD. The present study aimed to elucidate the potential two miRNAs (miR-132-3p and miR-146-5p) as novel markers for early PD diagnosis. In the present study, the expression levels of miR-132-3p and miR-146-5p in serum samples from 82 patients with PD and 44 healthy volunteers were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the correlation analysis was performed between aberrant miRNAs and Braak staging, Part V of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-V; the modified Hoehn and Yahr staging of PD) and Part III of the UPDRS-III. Subsequently, the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve results of miR-132-3p and miR-146-5p from healthy volunteers for PD prediction and from severe PD patients were assessed. From the results it was observed that miR-132-3p and miR-146a-5p expressions were significantly decreased in the serum samples of patients with PD compared to those in the healthy volunteers. Moreover, the expressions of miR-132-3p and miR-146a-5p showed a dramatic decrease in severe PD patients as compared to the normal PD patients. Meanwhile, miR-132-3p and miR-146-5p expressions were negatively correlated with Braak staging (",

    "abstract": "Numerous clinical studies have shown that the serotonergic system also degenerates in patients with Parkinson's disease. The causal role of this impairment in Parkinson's symptomatology and the response to treatment remains to be refined, in particular thanks to approaches allowing the two components DA and 5-HT to be isolated if possible. We have developed a macaque monkey model of Parkinson's disease exhibiting a double lesion (dopaminergic and serotonergic) thanks to the sequential use of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine) (or MDMA prior MPTP). We characterized this monkey model by multimodal imaging (PET, positron emission tomography with several radiotracers; DTI, diffusion tensor imaging), behavioral assessments (parkinsonism, dyskinesia, neuropsychiatric-like behavior) and post-mortem analysis (with DA and 5-HT markers). When administrated after MPTP, MDMA damaged the 5-HT presynaptic system without affecting the remaining DA neurons. The lesion of 5-HT fibers induced by MDMA altered rigidity and prevented dyskinesia and neuropsychiatric-like symptoms induced by levodopa therapy in MPTP-treated animals. Interestingly also, prior MDMA administration aggravates the parkinsonian deficits and associated DA injury. Dystonic postures, action tremor and global spontaneous activities were significantly affected. All together, these data clearly indicate that late or early lesions of the 5-HT system have a differential impact on parkinsonian symptoms in the macaque model of Parkinson's disease. Whether MDMA has an impact on neuropsychiatric-like symptoms such as apathy, anxiety, depression remains to be addressed. Despite its limitations, this toxin-based double-lesioned monkey model takes on its full meaning and provides material for the experimental study of the heterogeneity of patients.",

    "abstract": "Many Parkinson disease (PD) patients complain about chronic fatigue and sleep disturbances during the night. The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between fatigue and sleep disturbances by using polysomnography (PSG) in PD patients.\nTwo hundred and thirty-two PD patients (152 with mild fatigue and 80 with severe fatigue) were recruited in this study. Demographic information and clinical symptoms were collected. Fatigue severity scale (FSS) was applied to evaluate the severity of fatigue, and PSG was conducted in all PD patients. FSS \u22654 was defined as severe fatigue, and FSS <4 was defined as mild fatigue. Multivariate logistic regression and linear regression models were used to investigate the associations between fatigue and sleep disturbances.\nPatients with severe fatigue tended to have a longer duration of disease, higher Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale score, more advanced Hoehn and Yahr stage, higher daily levodopa equivalent dose, worse depression, anxiety, and higher daytime sleepiness score. In addition, they had lower percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (P\u200a=\u200a0.009) and were more likely to have REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (P\u200a=\u200a0.018). Multivariate logistic regression analyses found that the presence of RBD and proportion of REM sleep were the independent predictors for fatigue. After the adjustment of age, sex, duration, body mass index, severity of disease, scores of Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and other sleep disorders, proportion of REM sleep and degree of REM sleep without atonia in patients with PD were still associated with FSS score.\nConsidering the association between fatigue, RBD, and the altered sleep architecture, fatigue is a special subtype in PD and more studies should be focused on this debilitating symptom.",

    "abstract": "The antioxidant effects of bilirubin in Parkinson's disease (PD) have recently gained much attention from the research community. However, results from these studies have been conflicting. This meta-analysis is conducted to assess the relationship between the serum bilirubin concentration and the risk of PD.\nTwo reviewers performed a systematic literature search across five databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). The case-control studies regarding bilirubin levels in PD patients published up to April 2020 were included. These studies were subjected to rigorous scrutiny and data extraction to determine the standard mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (CI), which were analyzed using the Stata V.12.0 statistical software.\nA total of eight studies which included 1463 PD cases and 1490 controls were incorporated into our meta-analysis. SMD analysis showed that there was a higher total bilirubin (TBIL) and direct bilirubin (DBIL) levels in PD patients compared with controls (for TBIL, SMD: 0.300, 95% CI: 0.050-0.549, P\u200a=\u200a0.018; for DBIL, SMD: 0.395, 95% CI: 0.102-0.688, P\u200a=\u200a0.008). However, no significant relationship was found between the serum indirect bilirubin and PD patients (SMD: -0.223, 95% CI: -0.952-0.505, P\u200a=\u200a0.548). A subgroup analysis based on ethnicity indicated that the serum TBIL was higher in PD patients of Caucasian descent in contrast to matched healthy controls (SMD: 0.511, 95% CI: 0.324-0.698, P\u200a=\u200a0.000, I2\u200a=\u200a58.0%).\nHigher serum bilirubin levels in PD patients suggest that bilirubin might play a role in the pathogenesis of PD and have the potential to be utilized as a biochemical marker for PD diagnosis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "The reason why dopamine neurons die in Parkinson's disease remains largely unknown. Emerging evidence points to a role for brain inflammation in neurodegeneration. Essential questions are whether brain inflammation happens sufficiently early so that interfering with this process can be expected to slow down neuronal death and whether the contribution from inflammation is large enough so that anti-inflammatory agents can be expected to work. Here I discuss data from human PD studies indicating that brain inflammation is an early event in PD. I also discuss the role of T-lymphocytes and peripheral inflammation for neurodegeneration. I critically discuss the failure of clinical trials targeting inflammation in PD.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporotic fractures (OF) may occur without major trauma or injury. This case reports present a spine OF in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Pisa syndrome (PS). A 75-years-old woman diagnosed with PD for 19 years and PS has been developed. She recently has acute and severe low back pain. No recent injury or fall. After clinical examination and radiograph imaging, moderate wedge compression OF at L2 was revealed without a spinal cord or nerve compression. A program of conservative treatment was applied include antiosteoporotic supplementary, 6-days of bed rest, spine orthosis, and 10-weeks of exercises. The study adapted to use the following outcomes: visual analogues scale for low back pain, wall goniometer for lateral trunk flexion, and Oswesrty disability index for disability. After the intervention, the outcomes were improved as these values: visual analogues scales 7 points, lateral trunk flexion 20\u00b0, and Oswesrty disability index 60%. The case report suggests that the posture deformity as PS in PD may increase the risk of spine OF. The conservative treatment could be beneficial and safe for the OF in PD and PS. Further studies are required to confirm the role of PD postural deformities in OF and the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Providing care to people with Parkinson's disease (PD) poses challenges for family carers, including experiencing stigmatic beliefs -i.e., family stigma. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical study examining the stigmatic experiences of family members of people with PD. This was the aim of the present study. Three focus groups with 22 Israeli spouses of people with PD were conducted. Data were analyzed using theory-led thematic analysis. Overall, the spouses in our study shared mainly experiences of the stigma attached to the illness and/or to their loved ones, and not to themselves as carers. Three major themes emerged: the stereotypes that typify PD, stigmatizing behaviors towards the person with the disease, and structural stigma. Our findings highlight the profound stigma confronting carers of persons with PD, particularly when it comes to structural stigma.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurological disorder characterized by gait impairment. PD has no cure, and an impediment to developing a treatment is the lack of any accepted method to predict disease progression rate. The primary aim of this study was to develop a model using clinical measures and biomechanical measures of gait and postural stability to predict an individual's PD progression over two years. Data from 160 PD subjects were utilized. Machine learning models, including XGBoost and Feed Forward Neural Networks, were developed using extensive model optimization and cross-validation. The highest performing model was a neural network that used a group of clinical measures, achieved a PPV of 71% in identifying fast progressors, and explained a large portion (37%) of the variance in an individual's progression rate on held-out test data. This demonstrates the potential to predict individual PD progression rate and enrich trials by analyzing clinical and biomechanical measures with machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a motor disorder that affects movement. More than 24 loci and 28 associated genes have been identified to be associated with this disease. The present study accounts for the contribution of two candidates, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2) and parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase ( PRKN) in the PD patients, and their characterization in silico and in vitro.\nA total of 145 sporadic PD cases and 120 ethnically matched healthy controls were enrolled with their informed consent. Mutation screening was performed by direct DNA sequencing of the targeted exons of LRRK2 and all exons flanking introns of PRKN. The effect of the pathogenic PRKN variants on a drug (MG-132) induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u25b3\u03a8M) was measured by a fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM).\nTwelve and 20 genetic variants were identified in LRRK2 and PRKN, respectively. Interestingly, five out of seven exonic LRRK2 variants were synonymous. Further assessment in controls confirmed the rarity of two such p.Y1527 and p.V1615. Among the pathogenic missense variations (as predicted in silico) in PRKN, two were selected (p.R42H and p.A82E) for their functional study in vitro, which revealed the reduced fluorescence intensity of TMRM as compared to wild type, in case of p.R42H but not the other.\nAbout 6.2 per cent of the cases (9/145) in the studied patient cohort were found to carry pathogenic (as predicted in silico) missense variations in PRKN in heterozygous condition but not in case of LRRK2 which was rare. The presence of two rare synonymous variants of LRRK2 (p.Y1527 and p.V1615) may support the phenomenon of codon bias. Functional characterization of selected PRKN variations revealed p.R42H to cause disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u25b3\u03a8M) rendering cells more susceptible to cellular stress.",

    "abstract": "The severity of Parkinson's disease (PD) is difficult to assess objectively owing to the lack of a robust biological marker of underlying disease status, with consequent implications for diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. The current standard tool is the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), but this is hampered by variability between observers and within subjects. Postural sway has been shown to correlate with complex brain functioning in other conditions. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between postural sway, MDS-UPDRS and other non-motor measures of disease severity in patients with PD.\n25 patients with PD and 18 age-matched controls participated in the study. All participants underwent assessment of postural sway using a force plate, with eyes open and closed. In addition, participants underwent tests of cognition and quality of life: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Neuropsychiatry Unit Cognitive Assessment (NUCOG) and, for the patients, the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39-1), and assessment of clinical status using the motor component of the MDS-UPDRS.\nPatients swayed significantly more than controls. This was most obvious in the eyes-closed condition. Sway path length showed strong correlations with PDQ-39-1, MoCA and the verbal fluency component of the NUCOG, and, to a lesser degree, with the UPDRS-III in patients with PD.\nThese results suggest that motor and non-motor symptoms of PD are associated in patients, and, in particular, that postural sway shows potential as a possible measure of underlying disease status in PD, either alone or in combination with other measures.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly after Alzheimer's disease. It is expected that PD cumulative incidence will increase in the future, as there are far more people surviving into late age than there ever used to be. While most commonly idiopathic, rare forms of PD can be familial/genetic. In addition, socioeconomic, cultural and genetic factors may influence the way in which anti-parkinsonian medications are prescribed, and how patients respond to them. This review aims to highlight the potential impact of genetic variation on the epidemiology and therapeutics of PD, focusing on data from New Zealand and Australia.",

    "abstract": "Functional (psychogenic) dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are exceedingly rare.\nHerein we report three patients with PD who presented with functional dyskinesias in the first 3\u2009months after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (DBS). All patients presented with chorea mimicking levodopa or stimulation-induced dyskinesias in the first 24\u2009hours following stimulation adjustment. Two patients had generalized chorea and one, hemichorea. In all patients the abnormal movements could be induced or resolved with placebo/nocebo changes to the stimulation parameters. Following the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder (FMD), all patients improved with appropriate management.\nFunctional chorea following DBS might mimic organic dyskinesias in PD but can be accurately diagnosed using suggestibility and placebo responses to sham stimulation adjustments. Recognizing the presence of FMD following DBS is important for proper management of these patients.",

At a cellular level, disruptions of protein trafficking and recycling, particularly by misfolding, accumulation, and aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and other etiopathogenic mechanisms, have been found to result in the death of vulnerable neuronal populations and appear to drive the neurodegeneration underlying Parkinson's disease. The improved understanding of these mechanisms has led to the development of novel pathogenesis-targeted and potentially disease-modifying therapeutic approaches in Parkinson's disease. Until these treatments are fully developed and approved, clinicians must rely on therapies designed to improve quality of life of patients by treating various motor and non-motor symptoms of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Sleep-wake disruptions are among the most prevalent and burdensome non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinical studies have demonstrated that these disturbances can precede the onset of typical motor symptoms by years, indicating that they may play a primary function in the pathogenesis of PD. Animal studies suggest that sleep facilitates the removal of metabolic wastes through the glymphatic system ",

    "abstract": "Disturbance of networks was recently proposed to be associated with the occurrence of depression in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the neurobiological mechanism of depression underlying PD remains unclear.\nThis study was conducted to investigate whether intra-network and inter-network brain connectivity is differently changed in PD patients with and without depression (PDD and PDND patients, respectively).\nForty-one PDD patients, 64 PDND patients, and 55 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), salience network (SN), precuneus network (PCUN), and sensorimotor network (SMN) were extracted using independent component analysis (ICA), and then the functional connectivity (FC) values within and between these networks were measured.\nPDD patients exhibited abnormal FC values within the DMN, ECN, SN, PCUN, and SMN. In addition, PDD patients demonstrated decreased connectivity between anterior SN (aSN) and bilateral ECN, between posterior SN (pSN) and dorsal DMN (dDMN), and between PCUN and dDMN/SMN/bilateral ECN. Connectivity within the left hippocampus of dDMN and the right medial superior frontal gyrus of aSN was a significant predictor of depression level in PD patients.\nAberrant intra- and inter-network FC is involved in several important hubs in the large-scale networks, which can be a biomarker for distinguishing PDD from PDND.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. It has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. The present study aims to study the phenomena of neuropsychiatric symptoms and their association with caregiver burden in PD.\nThe study was conducted in 100 patients of Parkinson's disease and their primary caregivers. The patients of PD were diagnosed on the basis of UK Brain Bank criteria; severity/staging of Parkinson's disease was done by Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS-III). Patients who fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for the study. The neuropsychiatric evaluation was based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Caregiver burden was assessed with the Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory (ZCBI).\nMean age of PD patients was 61.48 \u00b1 6.71 years, majority of them were males (68%). Mean total NPI score of patients was 44.46 \u00b1 5.38. Mean age of caregivers was 52.26 \u00b1 6.80 years, majority of them were females (72%) and spouse (76%) in relation to the patient. Caregiver burden was significantly related to age of the patient, duration of illness, severity of illness, and total NPI score.\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms significantly contribute to the caregiver burden in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic medications administered to remedy motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease are associated with an enhanced risk for impulse control disorders (ICD) and related compulsive behaviors (ICD-RB). Thus, the present study focuses on investigating the gender difference in the prevalence of ICD-RBs in Indian PD patients on dopamine replacement therapy (DRT), its impact on quality of life and to identify ICDs relevant in Indian scenario apart from the criteria set in QUIP-RS.\nThis was a hospital-based observational cross-sectional study in which Parkinson's disease patients attending neurology clinic were included. Complete details of anti-parkinsonian therapy along with demographic and clinical variables were recorded on a predesigned Performa. Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease (QUIP), which is a validated quick screening tool, was used to detect ICD-RBs. The relative frequency and comparative impact of ICD on health-related quality of life (QOL) was studied using validated PDQ-39 Questionnaire.\nOut of 102 patients, at least one ICD or ICD-RB was present in 41.19% and \u22652 ICD-RBs were present in 15.59%. At least one ICD was present in 16.67%, any ICD-related compulsive behaviors was present in 34.31% patients. The most common was punding and compulsive medication use (12.75% each), followed by hobbyism (7.84%), compulsive eating (6.86%), pathological gambling (3.92%), and hypersexuality, walkabout, and compulsive shopping (2.94% each). ICDs not classified elsewhere such as trichotillomania were found 3 patients (2.94%). ICD-RBs showed a trend to be more frequent in women (44.82% women vs. 39.39% men). As compared with patients without ICD-RBs, those with ICD-RBs were found to have higher dose of LD and DA and higher Hoehn and Yahr stage. ICD-RBs have a negative impact on the quality of life of Parkinson's disease patients.\nICDs and ICD-RBs have been included in the behavioral spectrum of nonmotor symptoms in PD. PD patients are at increased risk of developing ICD-RBs which interfere with important activities and have obligation in ordinary life, leading to legal and psychological consequences with a great impact on QOL.",

    "abstract": "Telemedicine is witnessing a rebirth due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the continuing need for limited-contact or contactless care in medicine. Telerehabilitation, an offshoot of telemedicine, is a valuable yet underexplored tool in the therapeutic armamentarium of patients with neurological conditions, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). Although there is evidence in literature reporting the use of telerehabilitation and virtual reality-based services in providing rehabilitation to improve speech, swallowing, gait, and postural instability among persons with PD, the evidence is limited due to small patient numbers. Teleneurorehabilitation (TNR) is an underutilized strategy that may be as effective and perhaps more feasible and affordable among Indian PD patients and also allows sustained rehabilitation. In this article, we encapsulate the evidence on the utility and efficacy of TNR among persons with PD and call upon the neurology community to recognize and utilize the valuable asset that TNR may be for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Emotional processing is a core cognitive process cutting across neuropsychiatric disorders. Understanding the neurophysiological features underlying depressive symptoms and their sensitivity to modulation is critical to modifying emotional bias. The subthalamic nucleus (STN), targeted in Parkinson's disease, shows a late alpha desynchronization to affective stimuli. We targeted this alpha desynchronization using a novel stimulation protocol asking if brief alpha (10 Hz) frequency stimulation time-locked to unpleasant imagery might influence subjective emotion.\nA total of 27 patients with Parkinson's disease were recruited. The first study tested patients (n\u00a0= 16) on affective stimuli with STN local field potential recordings assessed bilaterally without stimulation. In the second study, patients (n\u00a0= 24) were tested on two affective tasks comparing negative and neutral stimuli paired with acute right-STN stimulation, with one of the negative conditions stimulated briefly for 1 second at either 130 Hz or 10 Hz. The subjects rated valence and arousal of negative and neutral stimuli.\nWe confirmed greater alpha desynchronization in both negative and positive affect relative to neutral in the right STN. Using acute stimulation of the right STN, we show a critical interaction effect between ratings, stimulation, and frequency; alpha frequency stimulation increased the subjective pleasantness of negative imagery, particularly with ventromedial contacts. Higher depression scores were associated with a positive bias to 10-Hz but not 130-Hz stimulation.\nWe highlight the potential of brief alpha frequency subthalamic stimulation to reduce negative emotional bias. This finding provides mechanistic insights underlying subjective emotional valence and has implications for the management of depression using neuromodulation.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are essential for neuronal function. They produce ATP to meet energy demands, regulate homeostasis of ion levels such as calcium and regulate reactive oxygen species that cause oxidative cellular stress. Mitochondria have also been shown to regulate protein synthesis within themselves, as well as within the nucleus, and also influence synaptic plasticity. These roles are especially important for neurons, which have higher energy demands and greater susceptibility to stress. Dysfunction of mitochondria has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Glaucoma and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The focus of this review is on how and why mitochondrial function is linked to the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Many of the PD-linked genetic mutations which have been identified result in dysfunctional mitochondria, through a wide-spread number of mechanisms. In this review, we describe how susceptible neurons are predisposed to be vulnerable to the toxic events that occur during the neurodegenerative process of PD, and how mitochondria are central to these pathways. We also discuss ways in which proteins linked with familial PD control mitochondrial function, both physiologically and pathologically, along with their implications in genome-wide association studies and risk assessment. Finally, we review potential strategies for disease modification through mitochondrial enhancement. Ultimately, agents capable of both improving and/or restoring mitochondrial function, either alone, or in conjunction with other disease-modifying agents may halt or slow the progression of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "There is mounting evidence of systemic inflammation in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), yet inconsistency and a lack of replicability in findings of putative biological markers have delayed progress in this space. Variability in performance between platforms may contribute to the lack of consensus in the biomarker literature, as has been seen for a number of psychiatric disorders, including PTSD. Thus, there is a need for high-performance, scalable, and validated platforms for the discovery and development of biomarkers of inflammation for use in drug development and as clinical diagnostics. To identify the best platform for use in future biomarker discovery efforts, we conducted a comprehensive cross-platform and cross-assay evaluation across five leading platform technologies. This initial assessment focused on four cytokines that have been implicated PTSD - interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3. To assess platform performance and understand likely measurements in individuals with brain disorders, serum and plasma samples were obtained from individuals with PTSD (n\u00a0=\u00a013) or Parkinson's Disease (n\u00a0=\u00a014) as well as healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a05). We compared platform performance across a number of common analytic parameters, including assay precision, sensitivity, frequency of endogenous analyte detection (FEAD), correlation between platforms, and parallelism in measurement of cytokines using a serial dilution series. The single molecule array (Simoa\u2122) ultra-sensitive platform (Quanterix), MESO V-Plex (Mesoscale Discovery), and Luminex xMAP\u00ae (Myriad) were conducted by their respective vendors, while Luminex\u00ae and Quantikine\u00ae high-sensitivity ELISA assays were evaluated by R&D System's Biomarker Testing Services. The assay with the highest sensitivity in detecting endogenous analytes across all analytes and clinical populations (i.e. the highest FEAD), was the Simoa\u2122 platform. In contrast, more variable performance was observed for MESO V-plex, R&D Luminex\u00ae and Quantikine\u00ae, while Myriad's Luminex xMAP\u00ae exhibited low FEAD across all analytes and samples. Simoa\u2122 also demonstrated high precision in detecting endogenous cytokines, as reflected in\u00a0<\u00a020 percent coefficient of variance (%CV) across replicate runs for samples from the healthy controls, PTSD patients, and PD patients. In contrast, MESO V-Plex, R&D Luminex\u00ae and Quantikine\u00ae had variable performance in terms of precision across cytokines. Myriad Luminex xMAP\u00ae could not be included in precision estimates because the vendor did not run samples in duplicate. For cross-platform performance comparisons, the highest cross-platform correlations were observed for IL-6 such that all platforms - except for Myriad's Luminex xMAP\u00ae - had strong correlations with one another in measurements of IL-6 (r range\u00a0=\u00a00.59 - 0.86). For the other cytokines, there was low to no correlation across platforms, such that reported measurements of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 varied across assays. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence that the choice of immunoassay could greatly impact reported cytokine findings. The current study provides crucial information on the variability in performance between platforms and across immunoassays that may help inform the selection of assay in future research studies. Further, the results emphasize the need for performing comparative evaluations of immunoassays as new technologies emerge over time, particularly given the lack of reference standards for the quantitative assessments of cytokines.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's means Parkinson's disease, a chronic degenerative disease of central nervous system. The main area which is affected by this disease is motor system. Since it firstly founded by James Parkinson in his 1817 publication, nowadays, people still have lots of questions about this disease. This review mainly summarizes the epigenetics of Parkinson's. DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic mechanisms of Parkinson's. During the development of disease, global hypomethylation, and hypermethylation happen in different areas of patients. Another epigenetic mechanism is histone modification. People believe that some metals can induce Parkinson's disease by modulating epigenetic mechanisms. This review summarizes the relationships between different metals and Parkinson's disease. However, the specific roles of most metals in epigenetics are still unknown, which need further research.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined the effect of rTMS on impaired emotional processing in apathetic Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, which impelled us to use a combination of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with event-related potentials (ERPs) to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms.\nApathetic and non-apathetic patients diagnosed with PD performed a facial emotion categorization task, and ERP data were collected before and after HF-rTMS or sham stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We observed the behavioural results and early components of P100 and N170.\nAfter rTMS, accuracy (ACC) was higher for negative expressions, and reaction times (RTs) were shorter for all expressions in both apathetic and non-apathetic patients. P100 amplitudes significantly increased except for negative expressions in the right hemisphere, and hemisphere lateralization was reversed in apathetic patients. P100 amplitudes increased for all expressions bilaterally in non-apathetic patients. N170 amplitudes in apathetic patients increased, and hemisphere lateralization was normalized. Neither the apathetic sham group nor the non-apathetic cohort of patients showed changes in P100 or N170 lateralization.\nThe effects of rTMS on PD patients relative to normal subjects should be compared and observed over a long period of time.\nHF-rTMS over the right DLPFC is beneficial for emotional processing in both apathetic and non-apathetic PD patients but shows different sensitivities. The effect of rTMS on emotional processing impairments in apathetic PD patients is profound. Treatment with rTMS may be an important, novel nonpharmaceutical approach for apathy in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Tremor is a core feature of Parkinson's disease and the most easily recognized Parkinsonian sign. Nonetheless, its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Here, we show that multispectral spiking activity in the posterior-dorso-lateral oscillatory (motor) region of the subthalamic nucleus distinguishes resting tremor from the other Parkinsonian motor signs and strongly correlates with its severity. We evaluated microelectrode-spiking activity from the subthalamic dorsolateral oscillatory region of 70 Parkinson's disease patients who underwent deep brain stimulation surgery (114 subthalamic nuclei, 166 electrode trajectories). We then investigated the relationship between patients' clinical Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score and their peak theta (4-7 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) powers. We found a positive correlation between resting tremor and theta activity (",

Integrative models of their etiology posit that a decline in executive control of the visuo-perceptual system is a primary mechanism of VH generation. The role of bottom-up processing in the manifestation of VH in this condition is still not clear although visual evoked potential (VEP) differences have been associated with VH at an earlier stage of PD.

    "abstract": "The NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was reported to be regulated by autophagy and activated during inflammatory procession of Parkinson's disease (PD). Berberine (BBR) is well-studied to play an important role in promoting anti-inflammatory response to mediate the autophagy activity. However, the effect of Berberine on NLRP3 inflammasome in PD and its potential mechanisms remain unclear. Hence, in this study, we investigated the effects of BBR on 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice, by evaluating their behavioral changes, dopaminergic (DA) neurons loss, neuroinflammation, NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagic activity. BBR was also applied in BV2 cells treated with 1-methyl-4-pehnyl-pyridine (MPP+). The autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) was administrated to block autophagy activity both ",

    "abstract": "Executive dysfunction is the common thread between pure cortical dementia like the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and subcortical dementia like Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Although there are clinical and cognitive features to differentiate cortical and subcortical dementia, the behavioral symptoms differentiating these 2 conditions are still not well known.\nTo evaluate the behavioral profile of bvFTD and PDD and compare them to find out which behavioral symptoms can differentiate between the two.\nTwenty consecutive patients with bvFTD (>1 year after diagnosis) and 20 PDD patients were recruited according to standard diagnostic criteria. Behavioral symptoms were collected from the reliable caregiver by means of a set of questionnaires and then compared between the 2 groups.\nbvFTD patients had more severe disease and more behavioral symptoms than PDD. bvFTD patients were different from PDD patients due to their significantly greater: loss of basic emotion (\nBehavioral symptoms are helpful to distinguish bvFTD from PDD, and thus also cortical dementia with frontal-lobe dysfunction from subcortical dementia.",

    "abstract": "The question of whether depression contributes to the bladder and bowel complaint in Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been addressed.\nWe studied bladder, bowel and sexual symptoms in PD patients with/without depression.\nWe had 267 referred PD patients: age 68.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7\u2009years, 150 men, 117 women. We divided them into those with/without depression and performed the pelvic function questionnaires including bladder, bowel and sexual items; for example, OABSS, IPSS, and a pelvic organ questionnaire).\nThe patient age, sex ratio, disease duration, Hoehn-Yahr motor grade, and cognitive score were not significantly different between the PD with depression (n = 35, 13.1%) and PD without depression (n = 232, 86.9%) groups. Regarding bladder, bowel and sexual complaints, significant difference was noted in constipation (\nOur PD patients with depression showed significantly more common constipation and sensation of residual urine compared to the patients with PD alone, suggesting that depression contributes to the bladder and bowel complaint in PD patients.",

The Hoehn and Yahr staging system (HY), Clinical Impression of Severity Index for PD (CISI-PD), MDS-NMS (including NMF- subscale), Non-Motor Symptoms scale (NMSS), and MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) were applied. A NMS was considered present when scored \u22651. Differences in scores by sex and HY, CISI-PD, and MDS-UPDRS severity levels were calculated using Fisher's exact and chi-squared tests.\nUsing the MDS-NMS, NMS were present in 99.7% of patients and the mean number of NMS was 16.13 (SD: 9.36). The most prevalent NMS was muscle, joint or back pain (67.4% of the sample) and the least prevalent was dopamine dysregulation syndrome (2.2%). Feeling sad or depressed was significantly more prevalent in women. Using the MDS-NMS revealed more NMS than the other scales assessing NMS. NMF were present in 41% of the sample, with fatigue being the most prevalent symptom (68.5% patients with NMF), and no differences by sex. Patients with greater PD severity had higher prevalence of NMS than patients with lower severity.\nAlmost all patients with PD experience NMS, and many experience NMF. Prevalence rates for NMS using the MDS-NMS are higher than on other scales used and increase with higher disease severity.",

    "abstract": "Loss of nigrosome-1 on 3T and 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a recently explored imaging biomarker in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative parkinsonism.\nThis study was undertaken to evaluate the utility of imaging of nigrosome in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative parkinsonism on 3T MRI.\nAn institution-based prospective case-control study was conducted at a tertiary care center in North India. 3T venous blood oxygen level-dependent (VenoBOLD) and high-resolution susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) imaging sequences in MRI were performed in 100 patients with parkinsonism (56 with idiopathic Parkinson's disease [IPD], 30 with young onset Parkinson's disease [YOPD], 12 with progressive supranuclear palsy, and 2 patients with multiple system atrophy) and 15 controls. Grading of nigrosome was done in both the sequences. Each patient underwent 18F-DOPA positron emission tomography (PET), detailed neurological examination including Hoen and Yahr (H&Y) staging and Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) scoring.\nThe diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the detection of loss of nigrosome-1 on VenoBOLD and SWI sequence at 3T MR imaging were 90% and 66.7% and 94% and 80%, respectively. A weak negative correlation was found between the grading of the nigrosome and clinical parameters (H&Y and UPDRS III). There was no correlation between the side of nigrosome loss and clinical asymmetry. However, nigrosome imaging was not able to differentiate between Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism.\nThe loss of nigrosome-1 on 3T MRI on SWI and VenoBOLD sequences may serve as a potential imaging marker in the diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes. However, it cannot differentiate between idiopathic Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonian syndromes.",

    "abstract": "The neuroanatomical substrates of Parkinson's disease (PD) with tremor-dominance (TD) and those with non-tremor dominance (nTD), postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD), and akinetic-rigid (AR) are not fully differentiated. A better understanding of symptom specific pathoanatomical markers of PD subtypes may result in earlier diagnosis and more tailored treatment. Here, we aim to give an overview of the neuroimaging literature that compared PD motor subtypes.\nA systematic literature review on neuroimaging studies of PD subtypes was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Search terms submitted to the PubMed database included: \"Parkinson's disease\", \"MRI\" and \"motor subtypes\" (TD, nTD, PIGD, AR). The results are first discussed from macro to micro level of organization (i.e., (1) structural; (2) functional; and (3) molecular) and then by applied imaging methodology.\nSeveral neuroimaging methods including diffusion imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) distinguish specific PD motor subtypes well, although findings are mixed. Furthermore, our review demonstrates that nTD-PD patients have more severe neuroalterations compared to TD-PD patients. More specifically, nTD-PD patients have deficits within striato-thalamo-cortical (STC) circuitry and other thalamocortical projections related to cognitive and sensorimotor function, while TD-PD patients tend to have greater cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) circuitry dysfunction.\nBased on the literature, STC and CTC circuitry deficits seem to be the key features of PD and the subtypes. Future research should make greater use of multimodal neuroimaging and techniques that have higher sensitivity in delineating subcortical structures involved in motor diseases.",

    "abstract": "The level of \u03b1-synuclein, a component of Lewy bodies, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in Parkinson's disease (PD) has attracted recent attention. Most meta-analyses conclude that CSF levels of \u03b1-synuclein are decreased in PD. Patients with PD present with cognitive impairment, including frontal/executive dysfunction in the early phase and later emergence of visuospatial and mnemonic deficits. To examine whether CSF \u03b1-synuclein levels reflect the activities of various cognitive domains, we reviewed reports examining the association of these levels with cognitive performance in each domain in PD. Among 13 cross-sectional studies, five showed that a lower CSF \u03b1-synuclein level was associated with worse cognitive function. In four of these five reports, frontal/executive function showed this association, suggesting a link of the pathophysiology with Lewy bodies. In three other reports, a higher CSF \u03b1-synuclein level was associated with temporal-parieto-occipital cognitive deterioration such as memory. In the other five reports, the CSF \u03b1-synuclein level did not correlate with cognitive performance for any domain. In four longitudinal studies, a higher baseline CSF \u03b1-synuclein level was associated with a worse cognitive outcome, including cognitive processing speed, visuospatial function and memory in two, but not with any cognitive outcome in the other two. The different associations may reflect the heterogeneous pathophysiology in PD, including different pathogenic proteins, neurotransmitters. Thus, more studies of the association between cognitive domains and CSF levels of pathogenic proteins are warranted.",

    "abstract": "To investigate feasibility and effects of table tennis training on balance control and physical function in individuals with Parkinson disease.\nSingle group, observational, before-after trial.\nTable tennis training in a gymnasium.\nCommunity-dwelling individuals with Parkinson disease (N=9; 5 men, 4 women) with an average age of 66.9 years, average time since diagnosis of 8.6 years, and a modified Hoehn and Yahr score between 2 and 2.5 participated in this study. Participants were recruited via newspaper advertisement, at the patient organization, and at the university hospital outpatient clinic. Eight participants completed the study. One participant withdrew for logistical reasons.\nGroup training program consisting of 2 table tennis training sessions per week (120min each) for 10 weeks.\nThe primary outcome was feasibility, including attendance rate, drop-out rate, a final questionnaire assessing the participants' experience during the intervention, and any adverse events. The primary effect outcome was the Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest). Secondary effect outcomes were Parkinson's disease questionnaire-8, European quality of life questionnaire, Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, 10-meter walk test, generic walking scale, activities-specific balance confidence scale, and physical activity measured with an accelerometer and the Fr\u00e4ndin-Grimby scale.\nThe average attendance rate was 84%. There were no adverse events reported. The participants reported that the training improved well-being. The mean total score on the Mini-BESTest before and after intervention was 21.2 versus 23.3 \nThis study demonstrates that table tennis training is safe and feasible, and may have the potential to improve balance control, mental well-being, and self-reported physical activity level. Further studies are required before table tennis can be considered an evidence-based recommendation for individuals with Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Self-perceived unmet needs in people with typical and atypical parkinsonism (PwP) and their caregivers, support network, personalized ways to address self-perceived unmet needs during confinement, as well as the prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 related symptoms, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and self-reported COVID-19 related hospitalization in Luxembourg and the Greater Region were assessed. From 18th March to 10th April 2020, 679 PwP were contacted by phone. Data was collected in the form of a semi-structured interview. The thematic synthesis identified 25 themes where PwP need to be supported in order to cope with consequences of the pandemic, and to adapt their daily and health-related activities. The present work highlights that in the context of personalized medicine, depending on the individual needs of support of the patient the identified self-perceived unmet needs were addressed in various ways ranging from one-directed information over interaction up to proactive counseling and monitoring. Family and health professionals, but also other support systems were taking care of the unmet needs of PwP (e.g., shopping, picking-up medication, etc.) during the pandemic. 7/606 PwP (1.15%) reported COVID-19 related symptoms, 4/606 (0.66%) underwent a rRT-PCR-based diagnostic test and 2/606 (0.33%) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive. None of these PwP reported being hospitalized due to COVID-19. Our results will allow health professionals to expand their services in a meaningful way i.e., personalize their support in the identified themes and thus improve the healthcare of PwP in times of crisis.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the adherence of physicians to the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines on Parkinson's Disease (CPTG-PD) within the scope of the Unified Health System (SUS). A descriptive analysis of 375 drug application documents sent to the Pharmaceutical Services of the Rio Grande do Sul State Public Health Department (AF/SES/RS) between March and September 2016, and a structured survey to evaluate the physician's perception about the protocol and barriers to its use was conducted. Only 5.33% of the requests analyzed presented all the necessary data, considering the criteria of the protocol. The requests from specialists had a higher percentage of adherence to the diagnostic and dose criteria (p<0.05). The main barriers to protocol use were the lack of awareness or familiarity with the protocol (48%) and the lack of time to complete the mandatory documents (52%). More recently qualified physicians tended to perceive fewer barriers to protocol use (p<0.05). The results indicate that actions are still necessary to implement the PCDT-DP in medical practice, focusing on care and management teams. Greater integration between pharmaceutical assistance and the healthcare network is needed.\nEste estudo avaliou a ades\u00e3o de m\u00e9dicos ao Protocolo Cl\u00ednico e Diretrizes Terap\u00eauticas para a Doen\u00e7a de Parkinson (PCDT-DP), no \u00e2mbito do SUS. Dois m\u00e9todos complementares foram utilizados: avalia\u00e7\u00e3o descritiva de 375 solicita\u00e7\u00f5es de medicamentos encaminhadas \u00e0 Assist\u00eancia Farmac\u00eautica da Secretaria de Estado da Sa\u00fade do Rio Grande do Sul, de mar\u00e7o a setembro de 2016, e levantamento por meio de question\u00e1rio estruturado aos prescritores para investigar a percep\u00e7\u00e3o de barreiras \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Apenas 5,33% das solicita\u00e7\u00f5es analisadas apresentaram ades\u00e3o completa \u00e0s recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es do protocolo. As solicita\u00e7\u00f5es oriundas de especialistas em DP tiveram maior ades\u00e3o aos crit\u00e9rios para o diagn\u00f3stico (p<0,05) e dose do medicamento (p<0,05). Dentre as respostas ao question\u00e1rio destacaram-se como principais barreiras a falta de tempo para preenchimento dos documentos obrigat\u00f3rios (52%) e nenhum ou pouco conhecimento sobre o protocolo (48%). M\u00e9dicos com menor tempo de exerc\u00edcio de profiss\u00e3o tendem a perceber menos barreiras para a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do protocolo (p<0,05). Os resultados indicam a necessidade de a\u00e7\u00f5es de implementa\u00e7\u00e3o do PCDT-DP \u00e0 pr\u00e1tica m\u00e9dica, direcionadas \u00e0s equipes assistenciais e de gest\u00e3o, e maior integra\u00e7\u00e3o da assist\u00eancia farmac\u00eautica com a rede de aten\u00e7\u00e3o.",

    "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) contributes to injury due to the alteration of the expected atonia during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. It occurs before the overt signs of Parkinson's disease (PD). The co-expression of PD and RBD is characterized by non-tremor predominant subtype and higher incidence of freezing. Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom seen in PD patients that lead to falls. While this phenomenon is understood poorly, the involvement of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and the neural circuits that control locomotion and gait have been examined. This network has also the same control for REM sleep and arousal. The close relationship between PD and RBD and FOG's consequences has led us to explore the relationship between RBD and PD with FOG. This review provides an overview of the neural connections that control gait, locomotion, and REM sleep. The neural changes were seen in PD with FOG and RBD, and sensory and motor changes observed in these two diseases. The functional neuroanatomy that controls REM sleep, arousal, and locomotion overlap significantly with multiple neural circuits affected in RBD and PD with FOG. Visual perception dysfunction and motor symptoms that primarily affect gait initiation are common to both patients with RBD and FOG in PD, leading to freezing episodes.\u00a0Prospective studies should be conducted to elucidate the relationship of RBD and PD with FOG subtype and find innovative treatment approaches and diagnostic tools for PD with FOG.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has found ankle proprioception to be impaired in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the relationship between ankle proprioception and functional mobility in people with PD has not been fully investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine whether ankle proprioception is related to the functional mobility of people with PD. Forty-two participants with mild to moderate PD volunteered. Ankle proprioceptive acuity was measured in standing, by using active movement extent discrimination assessment (AMEDA). Functional mobility measures included the timed-up-and-go test (TUG), 30 s sit-to-stand test (30s-STS) and 10-meter walking test (10MWT). Step length and step cadence were recorded during the 10MWT. No significant correlation was found between ankle proprioceptive discrimination scores and any mobility performance measure in people with PD (-0.20<r<0.04, all ",

    "abstract": "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and games set a new domain in understanding people's motivations in gaming, behavioral implications of game play, game adaptation to player preferences and needs for increased engaging experiences in the context of HCI serious games (HCI-SGs). When the latter relate with people's health status, they can become a part of their daily life as assistive health status monitoring/enhancement systems. Co-designing HCI-SGs can be seen as a combination of art and science that involves a meticulous collaborative process. The design elements in assistive HCI-SGs for Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, in particular, are explored in the present work. Within this context, the Game-Based Learning (GBL) design framework is adopted here and its main game-design parameters are explored for the Exergames, Dietarygames, Emotional games, Handwriting games, and Voice games design, drawn from the PD-related i-PROGNOSIS Personalized Game Suite (PGS) (www.i-prognosis.eu) holistic approach. Two main data sources were involved in the study. In particular, the first one includes qualitative data from semi-structured interviews, involving 10 PD patients and four clinicians in the co-creation process of the game design, whereas the second one relates with data from an online questionnaire addressed by 104 participants spanning the whole related spectrum, i.e., PD patients, physicians, software/game developers. Linear regression analysis was employed to identify an adapted GBL framework with the most significant game-design parameters, which efficiently predict the transferability of the PGS beneficial effect to real-life, addressing functional PD symptoms. The findings of this work can assist HCI-SG designers for designing PD-related HCI-SGs, as the most significant game-design factors were identified, in terms of adding value to the role of HCI-SGs in increasing PD patients' quality of life, optimizing the interaction with personalized HCI-SGs and, hence, fostering a collaborative human-computer symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), the fronto-striatal network is involved in motor and cognitive symptoms. Working memory (WM) updating training engages this network in healthy populations, as observed by improved cognitive performance and increased striatal BOLD signal. This two-part study aimed to assess the feasibility of WM updating training in PD and measure change in cognition, movement and functional brain response in one individual with PD after WM updating training. A feasibility and single-subject (FL) study were performed in which patients with PD completed computerized WM updating training. The outcome measures were the pre-post changes in criterion and transfer cognitive tests; cognitive complaints; psychological health; movement kinematics; and task-related BOLD signal. Participants in the feasibility study showed improvements on the criterion tests at post-test. FL displayed the largest improvements on the criterion tests and smaller improvements on transfer tests. Furthermore, FL reported improved cognitive performance in everyday life. A shorter onset latency and smoother upper-limb goal-directed movements were measured at post-test, as well as increased activation within the striatum and decreased activation throughout the fronto-parietal WM network. This two-part study demonstrated that WM updating training is feasible to complete for PD patients and that change occurred in FL at post-test in the domains of cognition, movement and functional brain response.",

    "abstract": "The study hypothesis held that in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD), the reaction time (RT) tests of the higher cognition demand would have more readily improved under the program of analog microgravity (\u03bcG) modeled with \"dry\" immersion (DI). To test this hypothesis, 10 subjects with PD have passed through a program of seven DI sessions (each 45 min long) within 25-30 days, with overall \u03bcG dose 5 1/4 h. Five patients were enrolled as controls, without DI (noDI group). Simple RT (SRT), disjunctive RT (DRT), and choice RT (CRT) were assessed in four study points: before the DI program (preDI), 1 day after the DI program (postDI), 2 weeks after the DI program (DI2w), and 2 months after the DI program (DI2m). The motor time (MT) was assessed with the tapping test (TT). Additionally, signal detection time (SDT) and central processing time (CPT) were extracted from the data. Before the program of DI, the RT tests are in accordance with their cognition load: SRT (284 \u00b1 37 ms), DRT (338 \u00b1 38 ms), and CRT (540 \u00b1 156 ms). In accordance with the hypothesis, CRT and DRT have improved under DI by, respectively, 20 and 8% at the study point \"DI2w,\" whereas SRT, SDT, and MT did not change (<5% in the preDI point, ",

    "abstract": "The present study seeks to provide an overview of executive (inhibition and flexibility) deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) by combining a cognitive and behavioral approach.\nFifteen PD patients and 15 healthy controls underwent a neuropsychological and behavioral assessment including the Hayling and Trails Tests, the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (QUIP-RS), the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-A), and the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). The level of awareness of executive functioning was also analyzed. We finally explored how these neuropsychological and clinical outcomes could relate to each other.\nPD patients performed significantly worse in both neuropsychological tasks designed to evaluate inhibition abilities. They also reported more inhibition difficulties in everyday life and poorer quality of life. Associations between neuropsychological measures and self-reports were found. Moreover, as indicated by the discrepancy score, PD patients were as accurate as their relatives in self-reporting their executive daily difficulties.\nInhibition and cognitive flexibility impairments assessed by the neuropsychological tests (Hayling and Trails tests) seem to capture daily life executive problems in PD. Furthermore, our study provides a deeper understanding of PD patients' and their relatives' experience of these executive dysfunctions.",

    "abstract": "Recent research on Parkinson's disease (PD) has demonstrated the topological abnormalities of structural covariance networks (SCNs) using various morphometric features from structural magnetic resonance images (sMRI). However, the sulcal depth (SD)-based SCNs have not been investigated. In this study, we used SD to investigate the topological alterations of SCNs in 60 PD patients and 56 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). SCNs were constructed by thresholding SD correlation matrices of 68 regions and analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Compared with HC, PD patients showed increased normalized clustering coefficient and normalized path length, as well as a reorganization of degree-based and betweenness-based hubs (i.e., less frontal hubs). Moreover, the degree distribution analysis showed more high-degree nodes in PD patients. In addition, we also found the increased assortativity and reduced robustness under a random attack in PD patients compared to HC. Taken together, these findings indicated an abnormal topological organization of SD-based SCNs in PD patients, which may contribute in understanding the pathophysiology of PD at the network level.",

    "abstract": "Development of efficacious treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) demands an improved understanding of mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. Two cellular death pathways postulated to play key roles in PD are autophagy and apoptosis. Molecular overlap between these pathways was investigated through identifying studies that used therapeutic compounds to alter expression of specific molecular components of the pathways. Bcl-2 was identified as an important protein with the ability to suppress autophagy and apoptosis through inhibiting Beclin-1 and Bax, respectively. Involvement of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38, was evident in the activation of apoptosis through increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. JNK-mediated phosphorylation also suppresses the inhibiting functions of Bcl-2, indicating an ability to induce not only apoptosis but also autophagy. Additionally, a p38-mediated increase in heme oxygenase-1 expression inhibits apoptosis. Moreover, besides inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin, Akt is associated with decreased Bax expression, thereby acting as both an autophagy inducer and apoptosis inhibitor. Ultimately, manipulation of molecular components involved in autophagy and apoptosis regulation could be targeted as possible therapies for PD.",

    "abstract": "Our present objective was to better characterize the mechanisms that regulate striatal neuroinflammation in mice developing L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). For that, we used 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned mice rendered dyskinetic by repeated intraperitoneal injections of 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA) and quantified ensuing neuroinflammatory changes in the dopamine-denervated dorsal striatum. LID development was associated with a prominent astrocytic response, and a more moderate microglial cell reaction restricted to this striatal area. The glial response was associated with elevations in two pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2. Treatment with the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol and the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV-1) channel antagonist capsazepine diminished LID intensity and decreased TNF-\u03b1 levels without impacting other inflammation markers. To possibly reproduce the neuroinflammatory component of LID, we exposed astrocyte and microglial cells in culture to candidate molecules that might operate as inflammatory cues during LID development, i.e., L-DOPA, dopamine, or glutamate. Neither L-DOPA nor dopamine produced an inflammatory response in glial cell cultures. However, glutamate enhanced TNF-\u03b1 secretion and GFAP expression in astrocyte cultures and promoted Iba-1 expression in microglial cultures. Of interest, the antidyskinetic treatment with cannabidiol + capsazepine reduced TNF-\u03b1 release in glutamate-activated astrocytes. TNF-\u03b1, on its own, promoted the synaptic release of glutamate in cortical neuronal cultures, whereas cannabidiol + capsazepine prevented this effect. Therefore, we may assume that the release of TNF-\u03b1 by glutamate-activated astrocytes may contribute to LID by exacerbating corticostriatal glutamatergic inputs excitability and maintaining astrocytes in an activated state through a self-reinforcing mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Recent investigations demonstrated that genetic factors might play an important role in sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD). To clarify the specific loci susceptibility to sPD, we analyze the relationship between 30 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and sPD in the population of Han ancestry from Chinese mainland (HACM) by using genome-wide association study, sequenom massARRAY, DNA sequence, and biological information analysis. Results showed that the subjects carrying the T allele of rs863108 and rs28499371 exhibited a decreased risk for sPD. The subjects carrying the T allele of rs80315856 exhibited an increased risk for sPD. The A/T genotype of rs863108 and the C/T genotype of rs28499371 were a potential increased risk for sPD, and the G/T genotype of rs80315856 and T/T genotype of rs2270568 were a potential decreased risk for sPD. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs80315856 and rs2270568 was higher in sPD. The T allele of rs80315856 and rs2270568 might be a risk locus for sPD. Our data suggested that the alteration of these SNPs might play some roles through changing/affecting LINC01524/LOC105372666, DMRT2/SMARCA2, PLEKHN1, and FLJ23172/FNDC3B genes in the pathogenesis of sPD.",

    "abstract": "To systematically evaluate the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) compounds combined with levodopa medicine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease(PD), and screen basic herbs to provide certain evidence-based medical proof and program for better guidance on clinical drug use. Six databases were searched to screen out the randomized controlled trial on the TCM compounds combined with levodopa medicine in the treatment of PD. Literature quality of the included studies was evaluated by improved Jadad rating scale, and the Meta-analysis was performed by RevMan 5.3 software. After the data of the basic TCM compounds involved were sorted out, the strong association rules were found by using Apriori algorithm of SPSS Modeler 18.0 software, and then the basic herbs for the treatment of PD could be picked out. A total of 20 studies were eventually included, involving 1 784 patients. Ten studies were of high-quality literature, Jadad score\u22654 points. Meta-analysis showed that efficacy of TCM combined with levodopa medicine was better than levodopa medicine alone in lowering Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale(UPDRS) score: UPDRS \u2160(MD=-0.43, 95%CI[-0.62,-0.24], P&lt;0.000 1), UPDRS \u2161(MD=-2.72, 95%CI[-3.24,-2.21], P&lt;0.000 01), UPDRS \u2162(MD =-1.97, 95%CI[-2.69,-1.25], P&lt;0.000 01), UPDRS \u2163(MD=-0.28, 95%CI[-0.46,-0.11], P=0.002). And the improvement in UPDRS score reduction rate of TCM combined with levodopa medicine was better than that in levodopa medicine alone: effective rate(OR=4.81, 95%CI[3.50, 6.62], P&lt;0.000 01). Data mining results showed that the basic prescription for treating PD consisted of Paeoniae Radix Alba-Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata-Gastrodiae Rhizoma in general. According to each part of UPDRS, the basic prescription for treating mentation, behavior and mood(UPDRS \u2160) consists of Paeoniae Radix Alba-Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle, Among which Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle might have unique efficacy. The basic prescriptions for treating UPDRS \u2161 and UPDRS \u2162 consisted of Paeoniae Radix Alba-Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata, or Chuanxiong Rhizoma-Angelicae Sinensis Radix(two drug combinations). However, in the treatment of UPDRS \u2163, the drugs were scattered. But due to the limitations in the quantity and quality of clinical studies, the results obtained still need further research and clinical confirmation of its efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically well recognized by its characteristic motor symptoms (e.g., bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor). The cognitive symptoms of PD are increasingly being acknowledged by clinicians and researchers alike. However, PD also involves a host of emotional and communicative changes which can cause major disruptions to social functioning. These incude problems producing emotional facial expressions (i.e., facial masking) and emotional speech (i.e., dysarthria), as well as difficulties recognizing the verbal and nonverbal emotional cues of others. These social symptoms of PD can result in severe negative social consequences, including stigma, dehumanization, and loneliness, which might affect quality of life to an even greater extent than more well-recognized motor or cognitive symptoms. It is, therefore, imperative that researchers and clinicans become aware of these potential social symptoms and their negative effects, in order to properly investigate and manage the socioemotional aspects of PD. This narrative review provides an examination of the current research surrounding some of the most common social symptoms of PD and their related social consequences and argues that proactively and adequately addressing these issues might improve disease outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of bee venom, a form of alternative therapy, on rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) in mice. Moreover, the possible modulation by bee venom of the effect of L-dopa/carbidopa or rasagiline was examined.\nRotenone (1.5 mg/kg, subcutaneously; SC) was administered every other day for two weeks and at the same time mice received the vehicle (DMSO, SC), bee venom (0.065, 0.13, and 0.26 mg/kg; intradermal; ID), L-dopa/carbidopa (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneal; IP), L-dopa/carbidopa+bee venom (0.13 mg/kg, ID), rasagiline (1 mg/kg, IP) or rasagiline+bee venom (0.13 mg/kg, ID). Then, wire hanging and staircase tests were performed and mice were euthanized and brains' striata separated. Oxidative stress biomarkers namely, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), reduced glutathione (GSH), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured. Additionally, butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and dopamine (DA) were evaluated. Brain histopathological changes and caspase-3- expression were done.\nBee venom significantly enhanced motor performance and inhibited rotenone-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress, observed as a reduction in both MDA and NO along with increasing GSH, PON-1, and TAC. Besides, bee venom decreased MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, and caspase-3 expression together with an increase in BuChE activity and DA content.\nBee venom alone or in combination with L-dopa/carbidopa or rasagiline alleviated neuronal degeneration compared with L-dopa/carbidopa or rasagiline treatment only. Bee venom via its antioxidant and cytokine reducing potentials might be of value either alone or as adjunctive therapy in the management of PD.",

    "abstract": "The exact mechanism of Parkinson's disease (PD) is not fully understood yet, but it is suggested that inflammation is one of its contributing factors. Among several inflammatory factors, adipokines, especially leptin may have a great role in this mechanism; since it is not only causing inflammation, but it can also play other roles in the body that may contribute to the symptoms described for PD. Regarding the contradictions in the association of serum leptin levels with Parkinson's disease, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to have a more accurate estimation of this relationship.\nPublished literature was obtained by searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Ovid, ProQuest and Google Scholar. Random-effect model analysis was used to calculate pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was tested with the heterogeneity statistic Q and quantified using I\nSix studies including a total number of 198 PD patients and 182 controls were finally included in the meta-analysis. Serum leptin levels in PD patients were non-significantly lower than those in control group (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.40\u00a0ng/ml, 95% CI -2.33-1.53). Subgroup analyses revealed that serum leptin levels of PD patients and controls in either females or males didn't show any significant difference.\nThis meta-analysis revealed that leptin level doesn't show any significant difference between PD patients and healthy controls, even when taking the participants' gender into consideration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction for which there is an unmet need for better treatment options. Although oxidative stress is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases, notably PD, there is currently no efficient therapeutic strategy able to tackle this multi-target pathophysiological process. Based on our previous observations of the potent antioxidant and neuroprotective activity of SELENOT, a vital thioredoxin-like selenoprotein, we designed the small peptide PSELT from its redox active site to evaluate its antioxidant properties in vivo, and its potential polyfunctional activity in PD models. PSELT protects neurotoxin-treated dopaminergic neurons against oxidative stress and cell death, and their fibers against neurotoxic degeneration. PSELT is cell-permeable and acts in multiple subcellular compartments of dopaminergic neurons that are vulnerable to oxidative stress. In rodent models of PD, this protective activity prevented neurodegeneration, restored phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase levels, and led to improved motor skills. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that gene regulation by PSELT after MPP",

    "abstract": "Stereotactic radiofrequency pallidotomy has demonstrated improvement in motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly levodopa (L-dopa)-induced dyskinesias. The authors aimed to determine whether or not unilateral pallidotomy with MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) could safely improve Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS; the primary outcome measure) scores over baseline scores in patients with PD.\nTwenty patients with PD and L-dopa responsiveness, asymmetrical motor signs, and motor fluctuations, including dyskinesias, participated in a 1-year multicenter open-label trial of unilateral MRgFUS ablation of the globus pallidus internus.\nThe sonication procedure was successfully completed in all 20 enrolled patients. MRgFUS-related adverse neurological events were generally mild and transient, including visual field deficit (n = 1), dysarthria (n = 4, 2 mild and 2 moderate), cognitive disturbance (n = 1), fine motor deficit (n = 2), and facial weakness (n = 1). Although 3 adverse events (AEs) were rated as severe (transient sonication-related pain in 2, nausea/vomiting in 1), no AE fulfilled US FDA criteria for a Serious Adverse Effect. Total UDysRS, the primary outcome measure, improved 59% after treatment (baseline mean score 36.1, 95% CI 4.88; at 3 months 14.2, 95% CI 5.72, p < 0.0001), which was sustained throughout the study (at 12 months 20.5, 95% CI 7.39, 43% improvement, p < 0.0001). The severity of motor signs on the treated side (Movement Disorder Society version of the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS] part III) in the \"off\" medication state also significantly improved (baseline mean score 20.0, 95% CI 2.4; at 3 months 10.6, 95% CI 1.86, 44.5% improvement, p < 0.0001; at 12 months 10.4, 95% CI 2.11, 45.2% improvement, p > 0.0001). The vast majority of patients showed a clinically meaningful level of improvement on the impairment component of the UDysRS or the motor component of the UPDRS, while 1 patient showed clinically meaningful worsening on the UPDRS at month 3.\nThis study supports the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of MRgFUS pallidotomy in the treatment of patients with PD and motor fluctuations, including dyskinesias. These preliminary data support continued investigation, and a placebo-controlled, blinded trial is in progress. Clinical trial registration no.: NCT02263885 (clinicaltrials.gov).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder affecting up to 10 million people in the world. Diagnostic motor symptoms of PD appear as a result of progressive degeneration and death of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Current PD treatments only relieve symptoms without halting the progression of the disease, and their use is complicated by severe adverse effects emerging as the disease progresses. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapies for PD management. We developed a small molecule compound, BT13, targeting receptor tyrosine kinase RET. RET is the signalling receptor for a known survival factor for dopamine neurons called glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Previously we showed that BT13 prevents the death of cultured dopamine neurons, stimulates dopamine release and activates pro-survival signalling cascades in na\u00efve rodent brain. In the present study, we evaluate the effects of BT13 on motor imbalance and nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of PD. We show that BT13 alleviates motor dysfunction in experimental animals. Further studies are needed to make a conclusion whether BT13 can protect the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopamine system since even the positive control, GDNF protein, was unable to produce a clear neuroprotective effect in the model used in the present work. In contrast to GDNF, BT13 is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, which together with the ability to reduce motor symptoms of the disease makes it a valuable lead for further development as a potential disease-modifying agent to treat PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease that commonly affects people aged 60 years and above. So far, no treatment has been shown to halt or slow the progression of the disease and our options are limited to symptomatic management. Levodopa is the most preferred antiparkinsonian medication that provides excellent control of symptoms early in the disease. However, in most patients the response declines over time and complications of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia arise. Other medical therapies play an adjunctive role in the management, as they are not as effective as levodopa. Advanced therapies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) can provide effective control of symptoms in moderate to advanced disease. Deep brain stimulation surgery has recently been started in Pakistan. This review provides an overview of deep brain stimulation, its indications, patient selection process and details of surgery, expected benefits and limitations as well as its history and challenges in Pakistan.",

    "abstract": "The underlying pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease is complex, but mitochondrial dysfunction has an established and prominent role. This is supported by an already large and rapidly growing body of evidence showing that the role of mitochondrial (dys)function is central and multifaceted. However, there are clear gaps in knowledge, including the dilemma of explaining why inherited mitochondriopathies do not usually present with parkinsonian symptoms. Many aspects of mitochondrial function are potential therapeutic targets, including reactive oxygen species production, mitophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics and trafficking, mitochondrial metal ion homeostasis, sirtuins, and endoplasmic reticulum links with mitochondria. Potential therapeutic strategies may also incorporate exercise, microRNAs, mitochondrial transplantation, stem cell therapies, and photobiomodulation. Despite multiple studies adopting numerous treatment strategies, clinical trials to date have generally failed to show benefit. To overcome this hurdle, more accurate biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction are required to detect subtle beneficial effects. Furthermore, selecting study participants early in the disease course, studying them for suitable durations, and stratifying them according to genetic and neuroimaging findings may increase the likelihood of successful clinical trials. Moreover, treatments involving combined approaches will likely better address the complexity of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. Therefore, selecting the right patients, at the right time, and using targeted combination treatments, may offer the best chance for development of an effective novel therapy targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative condition after Alzheimer's disease, affecting an estimated 160 per 100,000 people 65 years of age or older. Fatigue is a debilitating non-motor symptom frequently reported in PD, often manifesting prior to disease diagnosis, persisting over time, and negatively affecting quality of life. Fatigability, on the other hand, is distinct from fatigue and describes the magnitude or rate of change over time in the performance of activity (i.e., performance fatigability) and sensations regulating the integrity of the performer (i.e., perceived fatigability). While fatigability has been relatively understudied in PD as compared to fatigue, it has been hypothesized that the presence of elevated levels of fatigability in PD results from the interactions of homeostatic, psychological, and central factors. Evidence from exercise studies supports the premise that greater disturbances in metabolic homeostasis may underly elevated levels of fatigability in people with PD when engaging in physical activity. Cardiorespiratory impairments constraining oxygen delivery and utilization may contribute to the metabolic alterations and excessive fatigability experienced in individuals with PD. Cardiorespiratory fitness is often reduced in people with PD, likely due to the combined effects of biological aging and impairments specific to the disease. Decreases in oxygen delivery (e.g., reduced cardiac output and impaired blood pressure responses) and oxygen utilization (e.g., reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity) compromise skeletal muscle respiration, forcing increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism. Thus, the assessment of fatigability in people with PD may provide valuable information regarding the functional status of people with PD not obtained with measures of fatigue. Moreover, interventions that target cardiorespiratory fitness may improve fatigability, movement performance, and health outcomes in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial, chronic, and progressive neurodegenerative disease. \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-syn), which is the main protein component of Lewy bodies, plays an important role in the pathological hallmarks of PD. However, the pathological function of \u03b1-syn and the molecular mechanisms responsible for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons are still elusive.\nCumulative evidence implicates that abnormal processing of \u03b1-syn will be predicted to lead to pathological changes in PD. Key Messages: In this review, we summarize the structure and physiological function of \u03b1-syn, and further discuss the interplay of pathology, neuroinflammation, and environmental factors in PD. Additionally, we suggest future directions for understanding the toxicity of \u03b1-syn to neurons, which may ultimately encourage us to better design disease-modifying therapeutic strategies for PD.",

    "abstract": "In the last decades, early disease identification through non-invasive and automatic methodologies has gathered increasing interest from the scientific community. Among others, Parkinson's disease (PD) has received special attention in that it is a severe and progressive neuro-degenerative disease. As a consequence, early diagnosis would provide more effective and prompt care strategies, that cloud successfully influence patients' life expectancy. However, the most performing systems implement the so called black-box approach, which do not provide explicit rules to reach a decision. This lack of interpretability, has hampered the acceptance of those systems by clinicians and their deployment on the field. In this context, we perform a thorough comparison of different machine learning (ML) techniques, whose classification results are characterized by different levels of interpretability. Such techniques were applied for automatically identify PD patients through the analysis of handwriting and drawing samples. Results analysis shows that white-box approaches, such as Cartesian Genetic Programming and Decision Tree, allow to reach a twofold goal: support the diagnosis of PD and obtain explicit classification models, on which only a subset of features (related to specific tasks) were identified and exploited for classification. Obtained classification models provide important insights for the design of non-invasive, inexpensive and easy to administer diagnostic protocols. Comparison of different ML approaches (in terms of both accuracy and interpretability) has been performed on the features extracted from the handwriting and drawing samples included in the publicly available PaHaW and NewHandPD datasets. The experimental findings show that the Cartesian Genetic Programming outperforms the white-box methods in accuracy and the black-box ones in interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Due to possible sensory impairments in people with Parkinson's disease, several methodological aspects of electrical stimulation as a potential cueing method remain to be explored. This study aimed to investigate the applicability and tolerability of sensory and motor electrical stimulation in 10 people with Parkinson's disease. The study focused on assessing the electrical stimulation voltages and visual analogue scale discomfort scores at the electrical sensory, motor, discomfort, and pain thresholds. Results show that sensory electrical stimulation at the tibialis anterior, soleus, hamstrings, and quadriceps stimulation sites was applicable and tolerable for 6/10, 10/10, 9/10, and 10/10 participants, respectively. Furthermore, motor electrical stimulation at the tibialis anterior, soleus, hamstrings, and quadriceps stimulation sites were applicable and tolerable for 7/10, 7/10, 7/10, and 8/10 participants, respectively. Interestingly, the thresholds for the lower leg were higher than those of the upper leg. The data presented in this paper indicate that sensory and motor electrical stimulation is applicable and tolerable for cueing applications in people with Parkinson's disease. Sensory electrical stimulation was applicable and tolerable at the soleus and quadriceps sites. Motor electrical stimulation was not tolerable for two participants at any of the proposed stimulation sites. Therefore, future studies investigating motor electrical stimulation cueing, should apply it with caution in people with Parkinson's disease.",

We sought to examine a possible association between alpha herpesvirus infections and Parkinson's disease.\nWe conducted a population-based case-control study of incident Parkinson's disease in 2009 Medicare beneficiaries age 66-90 years (89,790 cases, 118,095 randomly selected comparable controls). We classified beneficiaries with any diagnosis code for \"herpes simplex\" and/or \"herpes zoster\" in the previous 5 years as having had the respective alpha herpesviruses. In beneficiaries with Part D prescription coverage, we also identified those prescribed anti-herpetic medications. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI between alpha herpesvirus diagnosis/treatment and Parkinson's disease with logistic regression, with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, and use of medical care.\nParkinson's disease risk was inversely associated with herpes simplex (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.74-0.84), herpes zoster (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.85-0.91), and anti-herpetic medications (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.96).\nHerpesvirus infection or treatment might reduce risk of Parkinson's disease, but future studies will be required to explore whether this inverse association is causal.",

    "abstract": "To study correlations between oxidative stress (OS) and clinical changes in patients with neurodegenerative Parkinson's and to identify clinical/biochemical subtypes of the disease.\nOne hundred and nine people were studied, including 91 patients with neurodegenerative Parkinson's (72 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD); 10 with multiple system atrophy (MSA); 9 with corticobasal degeneration (CBD), average age 61.1\u00b17.2 years), and 18 clinically healthy people (average age 55.1\u00b19.2). OS indexes were detected for scoring of redox state in peripheral blood of patients with PD and healthy people (control group). Detection of biochemical indexes was performed in erythrocytes and mononuclear fraction and blood. The activity of glutathione reductase (GR), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and content of reduced glutathione (GSH) was estimated.\nOS is a universal mechanism and is observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. However it is possible to identify quite typical changes of redox state with group selection and their correlations with definite subtypes and PD progress, it gives opportunity, in particular, to make the differential diagnosis with atypical Parkinsonism.\n\u0418\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u043a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0443 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0445\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f.\n\u0412 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044b 109 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a, \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u0438\u0445 91 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0441 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u043e\u043c (72 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0441 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c\u044e \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f), 10 \u2014 \u0441 \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0435\u0439 (\u041c\u0421\u0410), 9 \u2014 \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u0439;

    "abstract": "To study tremor and olfactory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), patients with essential tremor and healthy people for the differential diagnosis and to verify the hypothesis on the inverse dependence between tremor and olfactory dysfunction.\nOlfactory dysfunction was studied in 45 patients with PD, 40 patients with essential tremor and 64 healthy controls. Tremor was studied in 90 people, including 30 controls and 30 patients with PD and essential tremor. The olfactory function was tested with Sniffin' Sticks test. Tremor parameters were studied with wireless monitoring instrument for electrophysiological signals record, where three essential data flows have been recorded: electromyogram, gyroscope and acceleration. The instrument recorded the frequency and amplitude of each parameter. The data were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistica 2.3 software using standard methods. Besides, non-linear statistics using ViDaExpert software with elastic map technique was utilized.\nThe elastic map perfectly separated the patients with PD and essential tremor, as well as healthy controls. Three clusters were observed. The analysis of composition of the clusters proved the better quality of olfactory function of the patients with essential tremor compared to the patients with PD. This bias confirms the hypothesis on the inverse dependence between the tremor level and olfactory dysfunction.\n\u0418\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435

    "abstract": "To determine changes in the chemical composition of blood plasma in subjects at risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) at the prodromal stage compared with age control.\nSubjects at risk were selected for the presence of characteristic premotor symptoms, including impairments of sleep, olfaction and constipation.The risk group included 12 people, the control group - 8 people.\nAmong seven catecholamines and their metabolites detected in the blood, only the concentration of L-dioxiphenylalanine (L-DOPA) changed (decreased) in subjects at risk compared with the control. A decrease in the concentration of L-DOPA is considered as a manifestation (marker) of selective degeneration of central and peripheral catecholaminergic neurons in PD. In contrast to L-DOPA, the concentration of seven of the twelve detected sphingomyelins in the blood of the subjects at risk increased. Given that a change in the metabolism of sphingomyelins is associated with processes such as apoptosis, autophagy, and synucleinopathy, an increase in their concentration in the blood of patients at risk is considered as a manifestation of systemic general degeneration of central and peripheral neurons. Finally, in the blood of subjects at risk, we found a trend towards a decrease in the concentration of urates, which are endogenous neuroprotectors.\nThe changes in the level of L-DOPA, sphingmyelins and urates in the blood of subjects at risk may serve as diagnostic markers of PD at the prodromal stage.\n\u041e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435

A decrease in the concentration of L-DOPA is considered as a manifestation (marker) of selective degeneration of central and peripheral catecholaminergic neurons in PD. In contrast to L-DOPA, the concentration of seven of the twelve detected sphingomyelins in the blood of the subjects at risk increased. Given that a change in the metabolism of sphingomyelins is associated with processes such as apoptosis, autophagy, and synucleinopathy, an increase in their concentration in the blood of patients at risk is considered as a manifestation of systemic general degeneration of central and peripheral neurons. Finally, in the blood of subjects at risk, we found a trend towards a decrease in the concentration of urates, which are endogenous neuroprotectors.",

A survey which included the grit scale, QOL scale, and open-ended questions was distributed to participants (n = 101, 51 male and 50 female) who are members of online PD support groups across the United States. Data were analyzed by SPSS 25. Grit values averaged 3.65 \u00b1 0.51 for participants (n = 101). When divided into groups, mean grit score for community-based exercisers was 3.78 \u00b1 0.42 and 3.10 \u00b1 0.48 for home-based exercisers. Grit was positively correlated to higher QOL on the Parkinson's disease quality of life (PDQL; ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most widespread neurodegenerative diseases. However, the currently available treatments could only relieve symptoms. Novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed. Several previous studies mentioned that protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) acted as a negative regulator of the insulin signal pathway and played a significant role in the inflammation process. However, few studies have investigated the role of PTP1B in the central nervous system. Our study showed that suramin, an inhibitor of PTP1B, could improve neuronal damage. It could significantly attenuate the interferon-gamma-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-",

    "abstract": "Action observation (AO) relies on the mirror neuron system (MNS) and has been proposed as a rehabilitation tool in Parkinson's disease (PD), in particular for gait disorder such as freezing of gait (FOG). In this study, we aimed to explore the brain functional correlates of the observation of human gait in PD patients with (FOG+) and without (FOG-) FOG and to investigate a possible relationship between AO-induced brain activation and gait performance.\nFifty-four participants were enrolled in the study (15 PD FOG+; 18 PD FOG-; 21 healthy subjects (HS)) which consisted of two tasks in two separate days: (i) gait assessment and (ii) task-fMRI during AO of gait. Differences between patients with PD (FOG+ and FOG-) and HS were assessed at the level of behavioral and functional analysis.\nGait parameters, including gait velocity, stride length, and their coefficients of variability (CV), were different in PD patients compared to HS, whereas gait performance was similar between FOG+ and FOG-. The PD group, compared to HS, presented reduced functional activation in the frontal, cingulum, and parietooccipital regions. Reduced activity was more pronounced in the FOG+ group, compared to both HS and FOG- groups. Gait variability positively correlated with precuneus neural activity in the FOG+ group. ",

    "abstract": "After Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease is the most frequent neurodegenerative disorder. Although numerous treatments have been developed to control the disease symptomatology, with some successes, an efficacious therapy affecting the causes of PD is still a goal to pursue. The genetic evidence and the identification of \u03b1-synuclein as the main component of intracellular Lewy bodies, the neuropathological hallmark of PD and related disorders, have changed the approach to these disorders. More recently, the detrimental role of \u03b1-synuclein has been further extended to explain the wide spread of cerebral pathology through its oligomers. To emphasize the central pathogenic role of these soluble aggregates, we have defined synucleinopathies and other neurodegenerative disorders associated with protein misfolding as oligomeropathies. Another common element in the pathogenesis of oligomeropathies is the role played by inflammation, both at the peripheral and cerebral levels. In the brain parenchyma, inflammatory reaction has been considered an obvious consequence of neuronal degeneration, but recent observations indicate a direct contribution of glial alteration in the early phase of the disease. Furthermore, systemic inflammation also influences the development of neuronal dysfunction caused by specific elements, \u03b2 amyloid, \u03b1-synuclein, tau or prion. However, each disorder has its own specific pathological process and within the same pathological condition, it is possible to find inter-individual differences. This heterogeneity might explain the difficulties developing efficacious therapeutic approaches, even though the possibility of intervention is supported by robust biological evidence. We have recently demonstrated that peripheral inflammation can amplify the neuronal dysfunction induced by \u03b1-synuclein oligomers and the neuropathological consequences observed in a Parkinson's disease model. In both cases, activation of microglia was incremented by the \"double hit\" process, compared to the single treatment. In contrast, astrocyte activation was attenuated and these cells appeared damaged when chronic inflammation was combined with \u03b1-synuclein exposure. This evidence might indicate a more specific anti-inflammatory strategy rather than the generic anti-inflammatory treatment.",

    "abstract": "The primary motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) result from the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), and often, the loss is asymmetrical, resulting in unilateral tremor presentation. Notably, age is the primary risk factor for PD, and it is likely that the disease ultimately stems from the impact of environmental factors, which interact with the aging process. Recent research has focused on the role of microglia and pro-oxidative responses in dopaminergic neuronal death. In this study, we sought to examine the neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and stress effects of exposure to the etiologically relevant pesticide, paraquat, over time (up to 6\u00a0months after injections). We also were interested in whether a high-resolution, 7-Tesla animal magnetic resonance imaging would be sensitive enough to detect the degenerative impact of paraquat. We found that paraquat induced a loss of dopaminergic SNc neurons and activation of microglia that surprisingly did not change over 6\u00a0months after the last injection. A long-lasting reduction was evident for body weight, and alterations in organ (lung and heart) weight were evident, which reflect the peripheral impact of the toxicant. The microglial proinflammatory actin-remodeling factor, WAVE2, along with the inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B were also elevated within the brain. Remarkably, the stress hormone, corticosterone, was still significantly elevated 1 month after paraquat, whereas the inflammasome factor, caspase-1, and antigen presentation factor, MFG-E8, both displayed delayed rises after the 6-month time. Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, we detected no striatal changes but modest hemispheric differences in the SNc and time-dependent volumetric enlargement of the ventricles in paraquat-treated mice. These data suggest that paraquat induces long-term nigrostriatal pathology (possibly asymmetric) and inflammatory changes and stress and trophic/apoptotic effects that appear to either increase with the passage of time or are evident for at least 1 month. In brief, paraquat may be a useful nonspecific means to model widespread stress and inflammatory changes related to PD or age-related disease in general, but not the progressive nature of such diseases.",

    "abstract": "Although a number of clinical factors have been linked to falls in Parkinson's disease (PD), the diagnostic value of gait parameters remains subject to debate. The objective of this retrospective study was to determine to what extent the combination of gait parameters with clinical characteristics can distinguish between fallers and non-fallers.\nUsing a video motion system, we recorded gait in 174 patients with PD. The patients' clinical characteristics (including motor status, cognitive status, disease duration, dopaminergic treatment and any history of falls or freezing of gait) were noted. The considered kinematic gait parameters included indices of gait bradykinesia and hypokinesia, asymmetry, variability, and foot clearance. After a parameters selection using an ANCOVA analysis, support vector machine algorithm was used to build classification models for distinguishing between fallers and non-fallers. Two models were built, the first included clinical data only while the second incorporated the selected gait parameters.\nThe \"clinical-only\" model had an accuracy of 94% for distinguishing between fallers and non-fallers. The model incorporating additional gait parameters including stride time and foot clearance performed even better, with an accuracy of up to 97%.\nAlthough fallers differed significantly from non-fallers with regard to disease duration, motor impairment or dopaminergic treatment, the addition of gait parameters such as foot clearance or stride time to clinical variables increased the model's discriminant power.\nThis predictive model now needs to be validated in prospective cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive decline does not always follow a predictable course in Parkinson's disease (PD), with some patients remaining stable while others meet criteria for dementia from early stages. Functional connectivity has been proposed as a good correlate of cognitive decline in PD, although it has not been explored whether the association between this connectivity and cognitive ability is influenced by disease duration, which was our objective.\nWe included 30 patients with PD and 15 healthy controls (HC). Six cognitive domains were estimated based on neuropsychological assessment. Phase-based connectivity at frontal and posterior cortical regions was estimated from a resting EEG.\nThe PD group showed significant impairment for the executive, visuospatial, and language domains compared with HC. Increased connectivity at frontal regions was also found in the PD group. Frontal delta and theta connectivity negatively influenced general cognition and visuospatial performance, but this association was moderated by disease duration, with increased connectivity predicting worse performance after 8\u00a0years of disease duration.\nSubtle neurophysiological changes underlie cognitive decline along PD progression, especially around a decade after motor symptoms onset.\nConnectivity of EEG slow waves at frontal regions might be used as a predictor of cognitive decline in PD.",

Patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD and clinically significant depressive symptoms (defined by a 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D] score\u00a0\u2265\u00a08) were included in this study, randomly assigned to PCG or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio and followed for 24\u00a0weeks.\nThe primary outcome was the change from baseline to week 24 in HAM-D score among the set of patients who completed the study following the treatment protocol (per-protocol set). Secondary outcomes included changes in scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part 2 (UPDRS-II), UPDRS part 3 (UPDRS-III), Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), between baseline and week 24.\nEighty-six patients were enrolled, and 85 patients were included in the per-protocol set.

    "abstract": "Innovative tools are urgently needed to accelerate the evaluation and subsequent approval of novel treatments that may slow, halt, or reverse the relentless progression of Parkinson disease (PD). Therapies that intervene early in the disease continuum are a priority for the many candidates in the drug development pipeline. There is a paucity of sensitive and objective, yet clinically interpretable, measures that can capture meaningful aspects of the disease. This poses a major challenge for the development of new therapies and is compounded by the considerable heterogeneity in clinical manifestations across patients and the fluctuating nature of many signs and symptoms of PD. Digital health technologies (DHT), such as smartphone applications, wearable sensors, and digital diaries, have the potential to address many of these gaps by enabling the objective, remote, and frequent measurement of PD signs and symptoms in natural living environments. The current climate of the COVID-19 pandemic creates a heightened sense of urgency for effective implementation of such strategies. In order for these technologies to be adopted in drug development studies, a regulatory-aligned consensus on best practices in implementing appropriate technologies, including the collection, processing, and interpretation of digital sensor data, is required. A growing number of collaborative initiatives are being launched to identify effective ways to advance the use of DHT in PD clinical trials. The Critical Path for Parkinson's Consortium of the Critical Path Institute is highlighted as a case example where stakeholders collectively engaged regulatory agencies on the effective use of DHT in PD clinical trials. Global regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, are encouraging the efficiencies of data-driven engagements through multistakeholder consortia. To this end, we review how the advancement of DHT can be most effectively achieved by aligning knowledge, expertise, and data sharing in ways that maximize efficiencies.",

    "abstract": "Hand tremor associated with Parkinson disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET) can often become challenging to treat in clinical practice. Local injections of botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A) for hand tremor is an evolving field with newer injection techniques being utilized in clinical studies. The utility of BoNT-A therapy for ET and PD-tremor however, has been questioned based on the high incidence of finger and hand weakness after treatment.\nThe study includes detailed analysis of the techniques utilized in BoNT injection in ET and PD tremor.\nThere were 4 high-quality investigations which consisted of Class I or II double-blind placebo-controlled trials and one medium-quality study that was a prospective, open label, class III investigation.\nThis paper discusses two recently developed technology-based injection methods for BoNT-A therapy of ET and PD tremor, which includes comprehensive EMG screening of forearm and arm muscles with selective injections (Yale method) and the whole arm kinematic tremor assessment developed by Jog et al. In recent years, controlled, blinded studies of these two methods have shown significant post-injection reduction of finger, hand and whole limb tremor compared to the previously published controlled clinical trials not using these methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Remote assessment of gait in patients' homes has become a valuable tool for monitoring the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these measurements are often not as accurate or reliable as clinical evaluations because it is challenging to objectively distinguish the unique gait characteristics of PD. We explore the inference of patients' stage of PD from their gait using machine learning analyses of data gathered from their smartphone sensors. Specifically, we investigate supervised machine learning (ML) models to classify the severity of the motor part of the UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS 2.10-2.13). Our goals are to facilitate remote monitoring of PD patients and to answer the following questions: (1) What is the patient PD stage based on their gait? (2) Which features are best for understanding and classifying PD gait severities? (3) Which ML classifier types best discriminate PD patients from healthy controls (HC)? and (4) Which ML classifier types can discriminate the severity of PD gait anomalies?\nOur work uses smartphone sensor data gathered from 9520 patients in the mPower study, of whom 3101 participants uploaded gait recordings and 344 subjects and 471 controls uploaded at least 3 walking activities. We selected 152 PD patients who performed at least 3 recordings before and 3 recordings after taking medications and 304 HC who performed at least 3 walking recordings. From the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data, we extracted statistical, time, wavelet and frequency domain features, and other lifestyle features were derived directly from participants' survey data. We conducted supervised classification experiments using 10-fold cross-validation and measured the model precision, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC).\nThe best classification model, best feature, highest classification accuracy, and AUC were (1) random forest and entropy rate, 93% and 0.97, respectively, for walking balance (MDS-UPDRS-2.12); (2) bagged trees and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.92, respectively, for shaking/tremor (MDS-UPDRS-2.10); (3) bagged trees and entropy rate, 98% and 0.98, respectively, for freeze of gait; and (4) random forest and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.99, respectively, for distinguishing PD patients from HC.\nMachine learning classification was challenging due to the use of data that were subjectively labeled based on patients' answers to the MDS-UPDRS survey questions. However, with use of a significantly larger number of subjects than in prior work and clinically validated gait features, we were able to demonstrate that automatic patient classification based on smartphone sensor data can be used to objectively infer the severity of PD and the extent of specific gait anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), are increasing in the aging population. Crucially, neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD is associated with chronic inflammation and glial activation. Besides this, bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, sensory alteration, and cognitive and psychiatric impairments are also present in PD. Currently, no pharmacologically effective treatment alters the progression of the disease. Discovery and development of new treatment strategies remains a focus for ongoing investigations. For example, one approach is cell therapy to prevent dopaminergic neuronal loss or to slow PD progression. The neuroprotective role of a diverse range of natural products, including venoms from bees, scorpions, snakes and lizards, are also being tested in preclinical PD models and in humans. The main findings from recent studies that have investigated venoms as therapeutic options for PD are summarized in this special report.",

    "abstract": "Examining the spontaneous BOLD activity to understand the neural mechanism of Parkinson's disease (PD) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a focus in resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) studies. This study aimed to investigate the alteration of brain functional connectivity in PD with MCI in a systematical way at two levels: functional connectivity analysis within resting state networks (RSNs) and functional network connectivity (FNC) analysis. Using group independent component analysis (ICA) on rs-fMRI data acquired from 30 participants (14 healthy controls and 16 PD patients with MCI), 16 RSNs were identified, and functional connectivity analysis within the RSNs and FNC analysis were carried out between groups. Compared to controls, patients with PD showed decreased functional connectivity within putamen network, thalamus network, cerebellar network, attention network, and self-referential network, and increased functional connectivity within execution network. Globally disturbed, mostly increased functional connectivity of FNC was observed in PD group, and insular network and execution network were the dominant network with extensively increased functional connectivity with other RSNs. Cerebellar network showed decreased functional connectivity with caudate network, insular network, and self-referential network. In general, decreased functional connectivity within RSNs and globally disturbed, mostly increased functional connectivity of FNC may be characteristics of PD. Increased functional connectivity within execution network may be an early marker of PD. The multi-perspective study based on RSNs may be a valuable means to assess functional changes corresponding to specific RSN, contributing to the understanding of the neural mechanism of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) can present with dystonia or essential tremor but task specific tremor (TST) preceding PD has been only rarely reported. The relationship between TST and PD is unclear. We report a series of 12 patients with TST who later developed PD.\nPatients with TST and PD were identified from our database. Records and imaging were reviewed and descriptive statistics presented. Twelve patients were identified. All 11 patients who had TST of arm developed rest tremor ipsilateral to the TST arm. DaTscan showed reduced dopaminergic uptake in all 11 patients who were scanned. The TST improved with STN and VIM DBS (3/12) and partially to dopaminergic medications (N = 3) and trihexyphenidyl (N = 2).\nRest tremor consistently occurring ipsilateral to TST, positive DaTscan, and partial response to dopaminergic medications but not to ET medications suggests TST is a precursor to PD in this population rather than chance occurrence.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is a prevalent, multidimensional neuropsychiatric condition in Parkinson's disease (PD). Several authors have proposed apathy subtypes in PD, but no study has examined the classification of PD patients into distinct apathy subtypes, nor has any study examined the clinical utility of doing so.\nThe current study used a data-driven approach to explore the existence and associated clinical characteristics of apathy subtypes in PD.\nThe Apathy Scale (AS) was administered to 157 non-demented individuals with PD. Participants were classified into apathy subgroups through cluster analysis. Differences among apathy subtypes on external clinical indicators were explored across apathy subgroups.\nIndividuals with PD were classified into three subgroups: a Non-Apathetic group with low levels of apathy symptoms, a Low Interest/Energy group, characterized by elevated symptoms of low interest/energy and minimal low initiation/emotional indifference symptoms, and a Low Initiation group, characterized by an absence of low interest/energy symptoms and elevated levels of low initiation/emotional indifference symptoms. Both Low Interest/Energy and Low Initiation groups exhibited worse depression, fatigue, anxiety, health-related quality of life, and caregiver burden than the Non-Apathetic subgroup. The Low Initiation group exhibited worse overall cognition, emotional well-being, state anxiety, communicative ability, and functional ability than the Low Interest/Energy group. Importantly, disease-related characteristics did not differ across apathy symptom subgroups.\nNon-demented PD patients can be separated into distinct apathy symptom subgroups, which are differentially associated with important clinical variables. Apathy subgroup membership may reflect disruption to different neural systems independent of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric and affective symptoms are prevalent in prodromal and clinical Parkinson's disease (PD). Some evidence suggests that they may also signify risk for motor complications (motor fluctuations and dyskinesias) of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT).\nTo determine whether neuropsychiatric symptoms present in de novo PD (ie, before DRT initiation) predict the severity of eventual motor complications of DRT.\nWe used clinical, demographic, neurobehavioral, and neuroimaging data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), a multicenter observational PD study. Participants were unmedicated at enrollment and 361 initiated DRT during PPMI follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazard and multivariate ordinal mixed-effects regression models to evaluate the relationship between baseline neuropsychiatric symptoms and motor complications as measured by the Movement Disorders Society-revised Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).\nThe cumulative incidences of dyskinesias and motor fluctuations during follow-up (6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u2009years) were 34.3% and 59.9%, respectively. Both apathy and high trait-anxiety (top quartile) conveyed over two-fold increases in hazard for dyskinesia onset and for adverse impact on activities of daily living caused by both dyskinesias and motor fluctuations. The longitudinal severity of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias was significantly predicted by baseline trait-anxiety and apathy, but not depression. Models were adjusted for dimensionally related symptoms (eg autonomic dysfunction) and potential confounding variables (eg DRT dose).\nApathy and anxiety levels in de novo PD may be neuropsychiatric biomarkers of vulnerability to earlier and more disabling motor complications of DRT.",

    "abstract": "Following the severe consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, on March 9, 2020, the Italian government implemented extraordinary measures to limit viral transmission, including restrictive quarantine measures. This resulted in a rapid and profound change of people's daily lives.\nWe assessed the psychological impact of the 40-day quarantine in a large cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and caregivers. Moreover, we analyzed whether prelockdown clinical features may be associated with subjective response of patients with PD to this traumatic event.\nA total of 94 patients with PD were enrolled in the study. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, and the 12-item Zarit Burden Inventory were obtained from patients and caregivers by email. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine whether prelockdown clinical motor and nonmotor features were associated with the psychological impact of lockdown.\nRegression analyses showed that prelockdown levels of anxiety, treatment-related motor complications, patients' quality of life, and lockdown hours per day were significantly associated with psychological impact measures of the 40-day quarantine. In addition, we showed that caregiver burden was correlated with overall patient autonomy and attention/memory impairment.\nWe identified specific PD motor and nonmotor features potentially predisposing to higher psychological impact of stressful situations, such as quarantine. This may help guide postpandemic interventions and preventive strategies to avoid further impairment of psychological well-being in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Deficits in basic vision are associated with visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease. Of particular interest is contrast sensitivity loss in this disorder and its effect on object identification.\nEvaluate whether increased contrast improves object perception in persons with Parkinson's disease and visual hallucinations, without dementia.\nWe assessed 26 individuals with mild to moderate idiopathic Parkinson's disease, half of whom reported one or more episodes of hallucinations/unusual perceptual experiences in the past month, with a letter-identification task that determined the contrast level required to achieve 80% accuracy. Contrast sensitivity was further assessed with a chart that presented stimuli at multiple spatial frequencies. The groups were closely matched for demographic and clinical characteristics except for experience of hallucinations.\nRelative to participants without visual hallucinations, those with hallucinations had poorer spatial frequency contrast sensitivity and required significantly greater contrast to correctly identify the letters on the identification task. Specifically, participants with hallucinations required a mean contrast of 52.8%, whereas participants without hallucinations required 35.0%. When given sufficient contrast, the groups with and without hallucinations were equally accurate in letter identification.\nCompared to those without hallucinations, individuals with Parkinson's disease and hallucinations without dementia showed poorer contrast sensitivity. Once contrast was individually enhanced, the groups were equally accurate at object identification. These findings suggest the potential of visual perception tests to predict, and perception-based interventions to reduce, hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor fluctuations are a major concern in Parkinson's disease (PD), and they have been categorized into neuropsychiatric, autonomic and sensory fluctuations. However, this categorization does not include sleep and sleep-related features, and the association between daytime sleepiness and other motor and/or non-motor fluctuations in PD remains to be elucidated.\nTo investigate the relationship between daytime sleepiness and other non-motor and motor fluctuations in people with PD.\nA three-day home diary recording daytime sleepiness, mood, anxiety, and motor symptoms was used along with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and 6\u2009days of accelerometer (Parkinson's KinetiGraph\u2122; PKG\u2122) registration to detect motor fluctuations among people with a DaTSCAN verified clinical PD diagnosis (32 men; mean PD duration, 8.2\u2009years). Participants were categorized as motor fluctuators or non-fluctuators according to the UPDRS part IV and/or the presence of motor and non-motor fluctuations.\nFifty-two people with PD participated. Daytime sleepiness correlated significantly with motor symptoms, mood and anxiety among those classified as motor fluctuators (n = 28). Motor fluctuators showed stronger correlations between the individual mean level of all diary variables (daytime sleepiness, anxiety, mood and motor symptoms) when compared to the non-fluctuators (n = 24). Stronger positive within-individual correlations were found among fluctuators in comparison to non-fluctuators. In general, PKG data did not correlate with diary data.\nEpisodes of daytime sleepiness, as reported by home diaries, were associated with other self-reported non-motor and motor fluctuations, but were not supported by PKG data.",

    "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) occurs occasionally in essential tremor (ET), but polysomnographic REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) analyses have been sparse.\nTo characterize the amount and distribution of polysomnographic RSWA, the electrophysiologic substrate of RBD, in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and ET.\nWe analyzed quantitative RSWA in 73 patients: PD (23), ET (23), and age-sex-matched controls (27). None had dream-enactment behavior history or received antidepressants. Phasic, tonic, \"any,\" and phasic-burst duration RSWA measures were calculated in the submentalis (SM) and anterior tibialis (AT) muscles. The automated REM atonia index (RAI) was also determined. Statistical analysis was performed by Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum and Mann-Whitney tests.\nSM phasic RSWA was significantly greater for PD than ET patients and controls (12.5%\u2009\u00b1\u200912.8% vs. 4.9%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7%, 3.9%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6%), as was SM \"any\" (13.54%\u2009\u00b1\u200914.30% vs. 5.2%\u2009\u00b1\u20097.6%, 4.2%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6%). RAI was significantly lower in PD than in ET and controls (0.78\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23 vs. 0.92\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09 vs. 0.90\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17, \nElevated SM RSWA distinguished PD from ET in patients without dream-enactment symptoms and occurs frequently in PD patients, and in isolated tremor suggests underlying synucleinopathy. Prospective studies will further validate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a significant challenge for the arthroplasty surgeon, owing to excessive muscle tone, higher fracture risk and poor bone quality. Several studies have reported high mortality, early failure and perioperative complications associated with hip fracture surgery in PD; however, no higher-level evidence exists regarding elective hip arthroplasty.The aim of our study was to perform a systematic review to evaluate the evidence basis and clinical outcomes pertaining to patients with underlying Parkinson's disease undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty (THA).We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify studies evaluating the safety and clinical outcomes of THA in patients suffering from Parkinson's. Our review conforms to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.Ten studies encompassing 49,730 patients were included in our systematic review. Qualitative synthesis demonstrated comparable results between PD patients and controls with respect to one-year mortality and surgical site infections. PD patients experienced more medical complications, had a longer hospital stay and worse long-term implant survival. Some studies also reported a higher rate of dislocation, periprosthetic fractures and aseptic loosening.Decisions about the optimal articulation, the utilization of cemented components, dual-mobility cups or constrained liners were not uniform among included studies.THA in patients with Parkinson's disease can offer significant functional gains and pain relief. Surgical considerations pertain to the approach and ways to address instability, whereas emphasis should be placed on appropriate counselling and exploring whether potential improvement of life quality outweighs the risks.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease patients suffer from gait impairments such as reduced gait speed, shortened step length, and deterioration of the temporal organization of stride duration variability (i.e., breakdown in Long-Range Autocorrelations). The aim of this study was to compare the effects on Parkinson's Disease patients' gait of three Rhythmic Auditory Stimulations (RAS), each structured with a different rhythm variability (isochronous, random, and autocorrelated). Nine Parkinson's Disease patients performed four walking conditions of 10-15 min each: Control Condition (CC), Isochronous RAS (IRAS), Random RAS (RRAS), and Autocorrelated RAS (ARAS). Accelerometers were used to assess gait speed, cadence, step length, temporal organization (i.e., Long-Range Autocorrelations computation), and magnitude (i.e., coefficient of variation) of stride duration variability on 512 gait cycles. Long-Range Autocorrelations were assessed using the evenly spaced averaged Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (\u03b1-DFA exponent). Spatiotemporal gait parameters and coefficient of variation were not modified by the RAS. Long-Range Autocorrelations were present in all patients during CC and ARAS although all RAS conditions altered them. The \u03b1-DFA exponents were significantly lower during IRAS and RRAS than during CC, exhibiting anti-correlations during IRAS in seven patients. \u03b1-DFA during ARAS was the closest to the \u03b1-DFA during CC and within normative data of healthy subjects. In conclusion, Isochronous RAS modify patients' Long-Range Autocorrelations and the use of Autocorrelated RAS allows to maintain an acceptable level of Long-Range Autocorrelations for Parkinson's Disease patients' gait.",

    "abstract": "As a typical traditional Chinese medicine, Bu-Yin-Qian-Zheng Formula (BYQZF) has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly by ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction and regulating expression of the parkin protein. However, the underlying mechanisms by which BYQZF affects mitochondrial function through parkin are unclear. Accordingly, in this study, we evaluated the mechanisms by which BYQZF ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction through parkin in PD. We constructed a parkin-knockdown cell model and performed fluorescence microscopy to observe transfected SH-SY5Y cells. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were conducted to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of parkin. Additionally, we evaluated the cell survival rates, ATP levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), mitochondrial morphology, parkin protein expression, PINK1 protein expression, and mitochondrial fusion and fission protein expression after treatment with MPP",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of necrotic cell death characterized by its dependency on iron and lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis has attracted much attention recently in the area of neurodegeneration since the involvement of ferroptosis in Parkinson's disease (PD), a major neurodegenerative disease, has been indicated using animal models. Although PD is associated with both genetic and environmental factors, sporadic forms of PD account for more than 90% of total PD. Following the importance of environmental factors, various neurotoxins are used as chemical inducers of PD both ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated structural and functional alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the topological patterns of functional brain networks in newly diagnosed PD patients with MCI are unclear so far. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and graph theory approaches to explore the functional brain network in 45 PD patients with MCI (PD-MCI), 22 PD patients without MCI (PD-nMCI), and 18 healthy controls (HC). We found that the PD-MCI, PD-nMCI, and HC groups exhibited a small-world architecture in the functional brain network. However, early-stage PD-MCI patients had decreased clustering coefficient, increased characteristic path length, and changed nodal centrality in the default mode network (DMN), control network (CN), somatomotor network (SMN), and visual network (VN), which might contribute to factors for MCI symptoms in PD patients. Our results demonstrated that PD-MCI patients were associated with disrupted topological organization in the functional network, thus providing a topological network insight into the role of information exchange in the underlying development of MCI symptoms in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with a strong genetic component. To date, several genes have been associated with monogenic forms of the disease, but these only explain a small fraction of the observed familial aggregation in PD. Recently, a heterozygous loss-of-function variant in LIN28A was associated with PD pathogenesis in the Asian population. Here, we comprehensively investigate the role of LIN28A variants in PD patients of European ancestry and assess susceptibility using individual-level genotyping data from 14,671 PD cases and 17,667 controls, as well as whole-genome sequencing data from 1647 patients with PD and 1050 controls. In addition, we further assess the summary statistics from the most recent genome-wide association studies meta-analyses to date for PD risk and age at onset. After evaluating these data, we did not find evidence to support a role for LIN28A as a major causal gene for PD. However, additional large-scale familial and case-control studies in non-European ancestry populations are necessary to further evaluate the role of LIN28A in PD etiology.",

    "abstract": "Increased burdens of rare coding variants in genes related to lysosomal storage disease or mitochondrial pathways were reported to be associated with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Under a hypothesis that the burden of damaging rare coding variants is increased in causative genes for hereditary parkinsonism, we analyzed the burdens of rare coding variants with a case-control design. Two cohorts of whole-exome sequencing data and a cohort of genome-wide genotyping data of clinically validated idiopathic Parkinson's disease cases and controls, which were open to the public, were used. The sequence kernel association test-optimal was used to analyze the burden of rare variants in the hereditary parkinsonism gene set, which was constructed from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database through manual curation. The hereditary parkinsonism gene set consisted of 17 genes with a locus symbol prefix for familial Parkinson's disease and 75 hereditary atypical parkinsonism genes. We detected a significant association of enriched burdens of predicted damaging rare coding variants in hereditary parkinsonism genes in all three datasets. Meta-analyses of the rare variant burden test in a subgroup of gene sets revealed an association between burdens of rare damaging variants with PD in a hereditary atypical parkinsonism gene set, but not in a subgroup gene set with a locus symbol prefix for familial Parkinson's disease. Our results highlight the roles of rare damaging variants in causative genes for hereditary atypical parkinsonian disorders. We propose that Mendelian genes associated with hereditary disorders accompanying parkinsonism are involved in Parkinson's disease-related genetic networks.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic determinants of Parkinson's disease (PD), with the G2019S accounting for about 3% of PD cases. LRRK2 regulates various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking that is crucial for receptor localization at the plasma membrane. In this study, induced pluripotent stem cells derived from 2 PD patients bearing the G2019S LRRK2 kinase activating mutation were used to generate neuronal cultures enriched in dopaminergic neurons. The results show that mutant LRRK2 prevents the membrane localization of both the dopamine D3 receptors (D3R) and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) and the formation of the D3R-nAChR heteromer, a molecular unit crucial for promoting neuronal homeostasis and preserving dopaminergic neuron health. Interestingly, D3R and nAChR as well as the corresponding heteromer membrane localization were rescued by inhibiting the abnormally increased kinase activity. Thus, the altered membrane localization of the D3R-nAChR heteromer associated with mutation in LRRK2 might represent a pre-degenerative feature of dopaminergic neurons contributing to the special vulnerability of this neuronal population.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a high incidence of dysphagia. Aspiration pneumonia due to dysphagia is a major cause of death in patients with PD, and therefore accurately evaluating dysphagia should help improve prognosis. It has been reported that the severity of dysphagia does not always correlate with the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage for classifying PD severity. However, no reports have quantitatively evaluated the relationship between severity of dysphagia and H&Y stage. High-resolution pharyngeal manometry (HRPM) is a quantitative method that can be used to measure swallowing pressure from the velopharynx to the entry of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES). We used HRPM to measure swallowing pressure in 51 patients with PD. As PD progresses, atrophy and degeneration of the pharyngeal muscles become more pronounced, which contributes to dysphagia. However, thus far there is no quantitative clinical evidence for this pathological change. To evaluate the relationship between severity of underlying PD and dysphagia, patients were categorized by H&Y stage, as follows: stage II in four patients, stage III in 23, stage IV in 14, and stage V in 10. In patients with H&Y stages II, III, IV, and V, the respective velopharyngeal pressures were 179.8 \u00b1 32.5, 157.6 \u00b1 62.2, 172.2 \u00b1 48.9, and 107.4 \u00b1 44.0 mmHg, the mesopharyngeal pressures were 126.8 \u00b1 53.2, 121.6.1 \u00b1 50.4, 142.1 \u00b1 57.8, and 61.4 \u00b1 19.6 mmHg, the residual UES pressure were -8.0 \u00b1 10.8, 10.3 \u00b1 16.1, 16.5 \u00b1 37.9, and 11.2 \u00b1 16.2 mmHg, and the resting UES pressure were 49.5 \u00b1 30.0, 15.8 \u00b1 25.7, 1.85 \u00b1 14.1, and -1.2 \u00b1 12.2 mmHg. Patients with severe PD demonstrated significantly decreased velopharyngeal and oropharyngeal pressures, along with incomplete UES opening and contraction. HRPM can detect subtle abnormalities by quantifying swallowing pressure in patients with PD. Evaluating swallowing pressure with HRPM provides insights into neuromuscular dysfunction that causes abnormal pressure generation during pharyngeal swallowing in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) are currently the most common and effective surgical targets for advanced Parkinson's disease (APD). Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the comprehensive efficacy of STN-DBS and GPi-DBS in patients with APD.\nWe conducted a systematic search for relevant articles written in English in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMBASE databases through January 2020. Studies comparing the efficacy and clinical outcomes of GPi-DBS and STN-DBS for APD were included and analyzed.\nTen eligible trials with a total of 857 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed no significant difference between the STN-DBS and GPi-DBS groups in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III scores during the on and off-medication phases(SMD, 0.1; 95 % CI, -0.04 to 0.25; p = 0.17, on-med), (SMD,-0.12;95 % CI -0.37 to 0.13, p = 0.33,off-med). Dyskinesia scores and the activities of daily living (ADLs) scores during the on-medication phase showed significant differences in favor of GPi stimulation (SMD, 0.16; 95 % CI, 0.01-0.32; P < 0.05)/(SMD, 0.18; 95 % CI, 0.01-0.34; P < 0.05). The ADLs score during the off-medication phase showed no significant difference between the STN-DBS and GPi-DBS groups (SMD, -0.11; 95 % CI, -0.32-0.11; P = 0.33). The LED showed significant differences in favor of STN stimulation (SMD, -0.57; 95 % CI, -0.74-0.40; P < 0.00001).\nBoth STN and GPi-DBS were equally effective in improving motor dysfunction. STN-DBS was superior for medication reduction, whereas GPi-DBS perhaps led to less dyskinesia and improved the postoperative ADLs (on-medication) in APD patients. Hence, the goals of DBS can be important in the target selection. More studies comparing the adverse events and quality of life between the two targets are needed.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the potential of using changes in the plasma levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, as a biomarker in early Parkinson's disease (PD).\nPlasma TMAO levels were measured in 85 patients with drug-na\u00efve early stage PD and 20 healthy controls. A linear mixed model was used to assess longitudinal changes in levodopa-equivalent dose (LED) during follow-up (>2 y) in three tertile PD groups according to plasma TMAO levels. Additionally, a Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of plasma TMAO levels on dementia conversion.\nPlasma TMAO levels of patients with PD were lower than those of healthy controls. A linear mixed model demonstrated that patients with PD and lower levels of TMAO (<4.75 \u03bcmol/L; i.e., lowest tertile group) exhibited faster increases in LED over time. The Cox regression model did not reveal that plasma TMAO level was associated with the risk for dementia conversion (P = 0.488). However, when we divided patients with PD into two subgroups according to bet cutoff TMAO level to maximize the log-rank statistics, the PD group with a low plasma TMAO level (<6.92 \u03bcmol/L) had a higher risk (with borderline statistical significance) for PD-dementia conversion than the group with a high TMAO level (hazard ratio: 7.565; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-57.019; P = 0.050).\nThe results demonstrate that lower baseline plasma TMAO levels are associated with faster increases in LED and tend to increase the risk for PD-dementia conversion, suggesting the prognostic implications of TMAO in early stage PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. However, the rate of misdiagnosis remains high, even at specialized movement disorder centers.\nTo assess the accuracy of nigrosome 1 and midbrain neuromelanin evaluation in the diagnosis of PD, and to identify possible differences in diagnostic accuracy between neuroradiologists of different experience levels in analyzing these structures.\nA case-control study was conducted between April 2017 and January 2019. We prospectively evaluated 41 PD patients and 21 control individuals. Participants underwent axial, T2*-weighted, multi-echo gradient echo (GRE), and susceptibility-weighted imaging phase (SWIp) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences to evaluate nigrosome 1 and axial, T1-weighted, turbo spin-echo magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) MRI sequences to evaluate midbrain neuromelanin. All MRI sequences were acquired at 3.0\u00a0T. The images were analyzed by two experienced neuroradiologists, one with and one without expertise in nigrosome 1 and neuromelanin imaging. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the diagnoses were calculated between PD patients vs. healthy participants and between the two neuroradiologists.\nThe sensitivity and specificity of each imaging sequence for PD diagnosis were as follows: multi-echo, 100% and 86%; SWIp, 91% and 88%; and T1 MTC, 90% and 93%, respectively. The accuracy of clinical PD diagnosis was higher for the expert neuroradiologist compared to the neuroradiologist lacking expertise.\nNigrosome 1 and midbrain neuromelanin represent useful tools for PD diagnosis. However, these structures should be evaluated by experienced neuroradiologists in order to ensure high accuracy and reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported in recent years that blood levels of plasmalogens (Pls) are decreased in various diseases. None of those reports, however, conducted any clinical trials to examine the effect of Pls on those diseases. This article describes our recent report on a therapeutic efficacy of orally administered Pls in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). A 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in patients with MCI (n\u00a0=\u00a0178) and mild AD (n\u00a0=\u00a098). The study design for moderate AD (n\u00a0=\u00a057) and severe AD (n\u00a0=\u00a018) was 12-week open-labeled, and the design for patients with PD (n\u00a0=\u00a010) was 24-week open-labeled. They showed a significant improvement in cognitive function and other clinical symptoms with elevation of the blood Pls levels. No adverse events were reported. The baseline levels of plasma ethanolamine plasmalogen and erythrocyte ethanolamine plasmalogen in MCI, AD, and PD were significantly lower than those of normal aged. The degree of reduction in the blood Pls levels was in the order of MCI\u00a0\u227a\u00a0mild AD \u227a moderate AD \u227a severe AD \u227a PD. The findings suggest that the blood levels of Pls may be a beneficial biomarker for assessing AD severity. Based on these results, we have proposed a new hypothesis for the etiology of AD and other neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an important disabling age\u2011related disorder and is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Currently, no established molecular biomarkers exist for the early diagnosis of PD. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), either vesicle\u2011free or encapsulated in extracellular vesicles\u00a0(EVs), have emerged as potential blood\u2011based biomarkers also for neurodegenerative diseases. In this exploratory study, we focused on miR\u201134a\u20115p because of its well\u2011documented involvement in neurobiology. To explore a differential profile of circulating miR\u201134a\u20115p in PD, PD patients and age\u2011matched control subjects were enrolled. Serial ultracentrifugation steps and density gradient were used to separate EV subpopulations from plasma according to their different sedimentation properties (Large, Medium, Small EVs). Characterization of EV types was performed using western blotting and atomic force microscopy (AFM); purity from protein contaminants was checked with the colorimetric nanoplasmonic assay. Circulating miR\u201134a\u20115p levels were evaluated using qPCR in plasma and in each EV type. miR\u201134a\u20115p was significantly up\u2011regulated in small EVs devoid of exogenous protein contaminants (pure\u00a0SEVs) from PD patients and ROC analysis indicated a good diagnostic performance in discriminating patients from controls (AUC=0.74, P<0.05). Moreover, miR\u201134a\u20115p levels in pure SEVs were associated with disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr and Beck Depression Inventory scores. These results underline the necessity to examine the miRNA content of each EV subpopulation to identify miRNA candidates with potential diagnostic value and lay the basis for future studies to validate the overexpression of circulating miR\u201134a\u20115p in PD via the use of pure SEVs.",

    "abstract": "Caffeine is considered to be a neuroprotective agent against Parkinson's disease (PD) and is expected to offer a blood-based biomarker for the disease. We herein investigated the ability of this biomarker to discriminate between PD and neurodegenerative diseases. To quantify caffeine concentrations in serum and plasma, we developed a specific competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To validate the diagnostic performance of the assay, we conducted a case control-study of two independent cohorts among controls and patients with PD and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Parallelism, recovery rate, and intra- and inter-assay precision of our assay were within the standard of acceptance. In the first cohort of 31 PD patients, 18 MSA patients and 33 age-matched controls, serum caffeine levels were significantly lower in PD patients than in Controls (",

    "abstract": "REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia and a common sleep disorder in Parkinson's disease (PD). While deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for advanced PD with beneficial effects on cardinal PD motor symptoms, the data on the impact of DBS on RBD are limited and often controversial. We reviewed published articles that reported on RBD in the context of DBS surgery via systematic PubMed search. We identified 75 studies and included 12 studies, involving a total of 320 subjects, in our review. Results in respect to EMG activity outcome after subthalamic stimulation are inconsistent. We found no study that reported on RBD outcome after pallidal DBS and no DBS study quantified complex behavior during REM sleep. We also added data on RBD outcome after subthalamic (N\u00a0=\u00a04 patients) or pallidal (N\u00a0=\u00a03 patients) DBS from patients with PD with RBD, obtained as part of a prospective DBS study in our centre. Our case series showed an increase of complex behavior during REM (CB-REM) after surgery, independent of DBS target. Conversely, we found a trend towards increasing REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) in subthalamic-stimulated patients and a trend towards decreased RSWA in pallidal stimulated patients. We conclude that CB-REM and RSWA might represent two distinct elements in RBD and should be assessed separately, especially in studies that report on RBD outcome after treatment interventions. Further, larger, prospective, controlled studies in different DBS targets, reporting separately on the different RBD modalities, are needed.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) using autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising method to influence the pathogenesis of the disease. The aim of this study was to assess the immediate results of the introduction of MSCs on the effectiveness of motor and nonmotor symptoms in patients with PD.\nMSCs were transplanted to 12 patients with PD through intravenous and tandem (intranasal + intravenous) injections. Effectiveness of the therapy was evaluated 1 and 3 months posttransplantation. Neurological examination of the intensity of motor symptoms was carried out in the morning after a 12 or 24 h break in taking antiparkinsonian drugs, then 1 h after they were taken. The intensity of motor symptoms was assessed with the help of Section III of the Unified PD Rating Scale of the International Society for Movement Disorders (UPDRS). The intensity of nonmotor symptoms was assessed with the help of the following scales: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Nonmotor Symptoms Scale, and the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire.\nWe found a statistically significant decrease in the severity of motor and nonmotor symptoms in the study group in the posttransplant period.\nPositive results allow us to consider MSCs transplantation as a disease-modifying therapeutic strategy in PD. However, this method of PD treatment is not a fully understood process, which requires additional studies and a longer follow-up period to monitor the patients' condition posttransplantation.",

    "abstract": "Zonisamide has been used as an add-on treatment in order to overcome the deficiencies of the general therapies currently used to resolve the motor complications and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson disease. Various trials have been designed to investigate the mechanism of action and treatment effects of zonisamide in this condition. Most clinical trials of zonisamide in Parkinson disease were from Japan. The vast majority of studies used changes in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and daily \"OFF\" time as primary endpoints. Based on adequate randomized controlled trials, zonisamide is considered a safe and efficacious add-on treatment in Parkinson disease. The most convincing proof is available for a dosage of 25-50 mg, which was shown to lead to a significant reduction in the UPDRS III score and daily \"OFF\" time, without increasing disabling dyskinesia. Furthermore, zonisamide may play a beneficial role in improving non-motor symptoms in PD, including impulsive-compulsive disorder, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and dementia. Among the various mechanisms reported, inhibition of monoamine oxidase-B, blocking of T-type calcium channels, modulation of the levodopa-dopamine metabolism, modulation of receptor expression, and neuroprotection are the most often cited. The mechanisms underlying neuroprotection, including modulation of dopamine turnover, induction of neurotrophic factor expression, inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis, inhibition of neuroinflammation, modulation of synaptic transmission, and modulation of gene expression, have been most extensively studied. This review focuses on structure, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms, therapeutic effectiveness, and safety and tolerability of zonisamide in patients with Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "To detect brain morphological alterations in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD) by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphometry under radiological diagnostic conditions.\nT1-weighted brain images of 18 early PD patients and 18 age-sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were analyzed with free software Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12). Regional cortical thickness (rCTh) in 68 atlas-defined regions-of-interest (ROIs) and subcortical gray matter volume (SGMV) in 14 atlas-defined ROIs were determined and compared between patients and HCs by paired comparison using both ROI-wise and voxel-wise analyses. False-discovery rate (FDR) was used multiple comparison correction. Possible correlations between brain morphological changes in patients and clinical observations were also analyzed.\nComparing to the HCs, the ROI-wise analysis revealed rCTh thinning significantly in left medial orbitofrontal (P = .001), by trend (P < .05 but not significant after FDR correction) in four other ROIs located in frontal and temporal lobes, and a volume decreasing trend in left pallidum of the PD patients, while the voxel-wise analysis revealed one cluster with rCTh thinning trend located between left insula and superior temporal region of the patients. In addition, the patients showed more distinct rCTh thinning in ipsilateral hemisphere and SGMV deceasing trends in contralateral hemisphere in respect of the symptom-onset body side.\nBrain morphological alterations in early PD patients are evident despite of their inconspicuous findings in standard MRI. Quantitative morphological measurements with CAT12 may be an applicable add-on tool for clinical diagnosis of early PD. These results have to be verified in future studies with larger patient samples.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is prevalent in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) with many individuals also experiencing cognitive deficits negatively impacting everyday life.\nIn this study, we examine differences in pain severity and interference between 113 nondemented individuals with idiopathic PD who were statistically classified as having low executive function (n=24), low memory function (n=35), no cognitive deficits (n=54). The individuals with PD were also compared to matched non-PD controls (n=64).\nPD participants with low executive function reported significantly higher pain interference (p<0.05), despite reporting similar pain severity levels compared to other phenotypes. These differences remained statistically significant, even after accounting for important confounders such as anxiety and depression (p<0.05).\nPain interference in those with lower executive function may represent a target for psychosocial interventions for individuals with pain and PD.",

The pathogenesis of AD and PD is complex, and the current drugs and surgical treatments have not successfully alleviated or terminated the progression of the diseases. The lentiviral vector (LV) is a retroviral vector. In recent years, LV mediated gene therapy has been a hotspot to study the mechanisms of human disease and clinical drug discovery. This review summarizes the recent progresses in the treatment of AD and PD by the application of LV, and offers a prospect for its application.\n\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7 (Alzheimer\u2019s disease\uff0cAD) \u4e0e\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c7 (Parkinson\u2019s disease\uff0cPD) \u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u3002AD \u4e0ePD \u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u836f\u7269\u548c\u5916\u79d1\u624b\u672f\u6cbb\u7597\u65e0\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u6216\u963b\u6b62\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u7a0b\u3002\u6162\u75c5\u6bd2\u8f7d\u4f53 (Lentiviral vector\uff0cLV) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9006\u8f6c\u5f55\u75c5\u6bd2\u8f7d\u4f53\uff0c\u7531LV \u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u6cbb\u7597\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u75be\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u836f\u7269\u5f00\u53d1\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765LV \u5e94\u7528\u4e8eAD\u3001PD \u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4eca\u540e\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u524d\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5c55\u671b\u3002.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects postural and cardiac autonomic control. However, since it is unknown whether these changes are associated, the objective of this study was to determine whether such a relationship exists. Twenty-three patients with PD participated. The RR intervals were recorded in different positions and heart rate variability (HRV) was analyzed. Postural sway was analyzed based on the center of pressure. No significant differences on HRV indices were induced by postural change. A correlation was found between these indices and postural control, high frequency (HF), and anterior-posterior (AP) root mean square (RMS-AP) (",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's dementia is a common and devastating part of Parkinson's disease. Whilst timing and severity vary, dementia in Parkinson's is often preceded by visual dysfunction. White matter changes, representing axonal loss, occur early in the disease process. Clarifying which white matter connections are affected in Parkinson's with visual dysfunction and why specific connections are vulnerable will provide important mechanistic insights. Here, we use diffusion tractography in 100 Parkinson's patients (33 low visual performers) and 34 controls to identify patterns of connectivity loss in Parkinson's with visual dysfunction. We examine the relationship between regional transcription and connectivity loss, using the Allen Institute for Brain Science transcriptome atlas. We show that interhemispheric connections are preferentially affected in Parkinson's low visual performers. Interhemispheric connection loss was associated with downweighted genes related to the smoothened signalling pathway (enriched in glutamatergic neurons) and upweighted metabolic genes. Risk genes for Parkinson's but not Alzheimer's or Dementia with Lewy bodies were over-represented in upweighted genes associated with interhemispheric connection loss. Our findings suggest selective vulnerability in Parkinson's patients at highest risk of dementia (those with visual dysfunction), where differences in gene expression and metabolic dysfunction, affecting longer connections with higher metabolic burden, drive connectivity loss.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of central networks, particularly of those responsible for integrating multimodal afferents in a spatial reference frame, were proposed in the pathophysiology of lateral trunk flexion in Parkinson's disease (PD). Knowledge about the underlying neuroanatomical structures is limited.\nTo investigate if decreased focal grey matter (GM) is associated with trunk flexion to the side and if the revealed GM clusters correlate with a disturbed perception of verticality in PD.\n37 PD patients with and without lateral trunk flexion were recruited. Standardized photos were taken from each patient and trunk orientation was measured by a blinded rater. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to detect associated clusters of decreased GM. The subjective visual vertical (SVV) was assessed as a marker for perception of verticality and SVV estimates were correlated with GM clusters.\nVBM revealed clusters of decreased GM in the right posterior parietal cortex and in the right thalamus were associated with lateral trunk flexion. The SVV correlated with the extent of trunk flexion, and the side of the SVV tilt correlated with the side of trunk flexion. GM values from the thalamus correlated with the SVV estimates.\nWe report an association between neurodegenerative changes within the posterior parietal cortex and the thalamus and lateral trunk flexion in PD. These brain structures are part of a network proposed to be engaged in postural control and spatial self-perception. Disturbed perception of verticality points to a shifted egocentric spatial reference as an important pathophysiological feature.",

    "abstract": "Specific impairments of anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) during step initiation have been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and freezing of gait (FoG). Although APA disruption has been associated with FoG, there is scarce knowledge about its neural correlates. We sought to better understand the neural networks involved with APA in patients with FoG by assessing the level of hemodynamic response of specific brain regions and the functional connectivity during the leg lifting task. In the current investigation, APAs of patients with PD, with and without (nFoG) freezing were assessed during a leg lifting task in an event-related, functional magnetic resonance imaging (er-fMRI) protocol. Results identified a high hemodynamic response in the right anterior insula (AI) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in the FoG group when an APA was required. The nFoG had stronger connectivity between the right and left insulae than the FoG group. The strength of this connectivity was negatively correlated with the severity of FoG. Both groups showed different brain network organizations comprising the SMA and the bilateral AI. The SMA was found to be a hub in patients with FoG when an APA was required for the task. Our findings suggest that both groups used compensatory mechanism comprising the insulae during APA. Neither group used the entire network comprised of the insulae and SMA to accomplish the task. The FoG group relied more on SMA as a hub than as part of a broader network to exchange information during the APA.",

    "abstract": "The ventral intermediate (Vim) nucleus of the thalamus is difficult to identify even with 3\u202fT magnetic resonance imaging. Stereotactic Vim thalamotomy is a usual procedure to control Parkinson tremor. Successful relieving of the tremor depends on the accuracy of defining the Vim location.\nThree patients with Parkinson tremor were subjected to stereotactic thalamotomy using the Vim line technique (VLT) so as to precisely determine the Vim location. All patients showed good results, with improved tremors, as indicated by the UPDRS score, without any complications.\nThe precise targeting of the Vim nucleus is crucial importance for the successful Vim thalamotomy. Various method has been developed to determine Vim location. Atlas based and Guiot's technique routinely used by neurosurgeon. VLT is a new technique that has been developed to determine the Vim location on MRI.\nVLT is useful for the determination of the Vim location. However, further research is warranted to prove its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Postactivation depression of the Hoffmann reflex is reduced in Parkinson's disease (PD), but how the recovery is influenced by the state of the muscle is unknown. The present pilot study examined postactivation depression in PD at rest and during a voluntary contraction while patients were off treatment and while receiving medications and/or deep brain stimulation.\nThe authors recruited nine patients with PD treated with implanted deep brain stimulation and examined postactivation depression under four treatment conditions. Paired pulses were delivered 25 to 300 ms apart, and soleus Hoffmann reflex recovery was tested at rest and during voluntary plantar flexion. Trials were matched for background muscle activity and compared with 10 age-matched controls.\nPatients with Parkinson disease who were OFF medications (OFF meds) and OFF stimulation (OFF stim) at rest showed less postactivation depression at the 300 ms interpulse interval (86.1% \u00b1 21.0%) relative to control subjects (36.4% \u00b1 6.1%; P < 0.05). Postactivation depression was restored when dopaminergic medication and/or deep brain stimulation was applied. Comparisons between resting and active motor states revealed that the recovery curves were similar OFF meds/OFF stim owing to faster recovery in PD seen at rest. In contrast, the effect of the motor state was different ON meds/OFF stim and ON meds/ON stim (both P < 0.05), with a nonsignificant trend OFF meds/ON stim ( P > 0.08). During a contraction, recovery curves were similar between all treatment conditions in PD and control.\nDisrupted Hoffmann reflex recovery is restored to control levels in PD patients at rest when receiving medications and/or deep brain stimulation or when engaged in voluntary contraction.",

    "abstract": "The consumption of dairy products, particularly of low fat milk, has been shown to be associated with the occurrence of Parkinson's disease. This association does not necessarily reflect a pathophysiological role of milk intake in the development of Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, the present review discusses a potential mechanism possibly mediating an effect of milk consumption on Parkinson's disease. The case is made that milk is tailored in part to support bone mineralization of the suckling offspring and is thus rich in calcium and phosphate. Milk intake is thus expected to enhance intestinal calcium phosphate uptake. As binding to fatty acids impedes Ca",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing need for improved endpoints to assess clinical trial effects in Parkinson's disease. We propose the Parkinson's Disease Comprehensive Response as a novel weighted composite endpoint integrating changes measured in three established Parkinson's outcomes, including: OFF state Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Examination scores; Motor Experiences of Daily Living scores; and total good-quality ON time per day.\u00a0The data source for the initial development of the composite described herein was a recent Phase II trial of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. A wide range of clinically derived relative weights was assessed to normalize for differentially scoring base rates with each endpoint component. The Parkinson's disease comprehensive response, in contrast to examining practically defined OFF state Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Examination scores alone, showed stability over 40\u2009weeks in placebo patients, and all 432 analyses in this permutation exercise yielded significant differences in favour of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. The findings were consistent with results obtained employing three different global statistical test methodologies and with patterns of intra-patient change. Based on our detailed analyses, we conclude it worth prospectively evaluating the clinical utility, validity and regulatory feasibility of using clinically supported final Parkinson's disease comprehensive response formulas (for both the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-based and Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-based versions) in future disease-modifying Parkinson's trials. Whilst the data source employed in the initial development of this weighted composite score is from a recent Phase II trial of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, we wish to stress that the results are not described to provide ",

    "abstract": "The population of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) is growing in Mexico and the United States, and there is an increasing need for family members to provide caregiving. This study examined the connections between family dynamics and coping, or sense of coherence, among PD caregivers in Mexico (n\u00a0=\u00a0148) and the United States (n\u00a0=\u00a0105).\nCaregivers completed measures of family dynamics and sense of coherence across indices of comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness.\nAlthough caregivers in Mexico and the United States had similar levels of sense of coherence and family dynamics reflecting strengths/adaptability and being overwhelmed with difficulties, caregivers in Mexico had worse disrupted communication. Family dynamics explained: 24.2% of the variance in caregiver comprehensibility in the United States and 17.5% in Mexico; 34.1% in manageability in the United States and 23.5% in Mexico; and 22.6% in meaningfulness in the United States and 22.7% in Mexico (all \nThe development of family-systems interventions for PD caregivers to improve family strengths/adaptability and help families deal with difficulties may increase caregiver coping.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has been modeled in several animal species using the neurotoxins 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and its oxidized product 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). MPP+ selectively kills dopaminergic neurons in pars compacta of the substantia nigra, inducing parkinsonian symptoms in animals. Typically, neurotoxicity models of PD in zebrafish assess acute drug effects on locomotion. In the present study, we examined the lasting effects of MPP+ exposure and drug treatment in zebrafish larvae. Larvae were incubated in 500 \u03bcM MPP+, from 1 to 5 days post fertilization (dpf), followed by 24 h drug-free acclimation. At 6 dpf, the behavior was analyzed for locomotion, thigmotaxis, and sleep. Next, in separate assays we assessed the drug effects of brain injected glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), co-incubated with MPP+. We show that MPP+ exposure consistently reduces swim distance, movement frequency, and cumulative time of movement; thus mimicking a parkinsonian phenotype of reduced movement. In contrast, MPP+ exposed larvae demonstrate reduced anxiety-like behavior and exhibit a sleep phenotype inconsistent with human PD: the larvae display longer sleep bouts, less sleep fragmentation, and more sleep. Previously reported rescuing effects of PBA were not replicated in this study. Moreover, whereas GDNF attenuated the sleep phenotype induced by MPP+, PBA augmented it. The current data suggest that MPP+ exposure generates a multifaceted phenotype in zebrafish and highlights that analyzing a narrow window of data can reveal effects that may be inconsistent with longer multi-parameter approaches. It further indicates that the model generally captures motor symptoms more faithfully than non-motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration, motor impairment and non-motor symptoms. Epidemiological and experimental investigations into potential risk factors have firmly established that dietary factor caffeine, the most-widely consumed psychoactive substance, may exerts not only neuroprotective but a motor and non-motor (cognitive) benefits in PD. These multi-benefits of caffeine in PD are supported by convergence of epidemiological and animal evidence. At least six large prospective epidemiological studies have firmly established a relationship between increased caffeine consumption and decreased risk of developing PD. In addition, animal studies have also demonstrated that caffeine confers neuroprotection against dopaminergic neurodegeneration using PD models of mitochondrial toxins (MPTP, 6-OHDA, and rotenone) and expression of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn). While caffeine has complex pharmacological profiles, studies with genetic knockout mice have clearly revealed that caffeine's action is largely mediated by the brain adenosine A",

    "abstract": "Studies regarding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) have focused on common upstream regulators or dysregulated pathways or ontologies; however, the relationships between DEGs and disease-related or cell type-enriched genes have not been systematically studied. Meta-analysis of DEGs (meta-DEGs) are expected to overcome the limitations, such as replication failure and small sample size of previous studies.\nMeta-DEGs were performed to investigate dysregulated genes enriched with neurodegenerative disorder causative or risk genes in a phenotype-specific manner.\nSix microarray datasets from PD patients and controls, for which substantia nigra sample transcriptome data were available, were downloaded from the NINDS data repository. Meta-DEGs were performed using two methods, combining \nOur meta-analyses revealed 449 downregulated and 137 upregulated genes. Overrepresentation analyses with cell type-enriched genes were significant in neuron-enriched genes but not in astrocyte- or microglia-enriched genes. Meta-DEGs were significantly enriched in causative genes for hereditary disorders accompanying parkinsonism but not in genes associated with AD or hereditary progressive ataxia. Enrichment of PD-related genes was highly significant in downregulated DEGs but insignificant in upregulated genes.\nDownregulated meta-DEGs were associated with PD-related genes, but not with other neurodegenerative disorder genes. These results highlight disease phenotype-specific changes in dysregulated genes in PD.",

    "abstract": "Hallucinations, percepts in the absence of external stimuli, are a shared feature of eye-disease (Charles Bonnet Syndrome, CBS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) thought to arise through pathophysiologically distinct mechanisms: deafferentation and attentional network dysfunction respectively. Recent studies have found an association between visual hallucinations and structural changes in the cerebellum without obvious link to either mechanism. Here, we employed Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM), optimised for the cerebellum using the Spatially Unbiased Infratentorial Template (SUIT), to characterise similarities and differences in cerebellar structure associated with visual hallucinations in PD and CBS. Grey and white matter volume (GMV & WMV) from patients with eye-disease (n\u00a0=\u00a012 hallucinators; n\u00a0=\u00a09 non-hallucinators) and PD (n\u00a0=\u00a07 hallucinators; n\u00a0=\u00a09 non-hallucinators) was examined in a 2-way ANOVA controlling for age, sex, and intracranial volume. Comparing hallucinators to controls across both groups, lower GMV was found bilaterally within cerebellar lobule VIII extending to IX/VII. GMV reductions were also found in Crus 1, greater in PD than eye-disease. Predominantly within PD, hallucination-related lower WMV was found in the medulla. No regions of increased GMV or WMV were found. A correlation was observed between brainstem WMV and lobule VIIIb GMV suggesting a functional association. Lobule VIII comprises a functional node within the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), linking these findings to current attentional theories of hallucinations, while Crus 1 is linked to cortical visual processing. These findings provide preliminary evidence of a cerebellar contribution to hallucinations that transcends clinical conditions.",

Recent studies into drug development focused on emerging new molecular mechanisms, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, nuclear receptor-related 1 (Nurr1), adenosine receptor A2, nicotine receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Also, immunotherapy and common pathological mechanisms shared with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and diabetes have attracted much attention.

    "abstract": "Notwithstanding the large improvement in motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS), apathy may increase. Postoperative apathy cannot always be related to a dose reduction of dopaminergic medication and stimulation itself may play a role.\nWe studied whether apathy in DBS-treated PD patients could be a stimulation effect.\nIn 26 PD patients we acquired apathy scores before and >6 months after DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Magnetoencephalography recordings (ON and OFF stimulation) were performed \u22656 months after DBS placement. Change in apathy severity was correlated with (i) improvement in motor function and dose reduction of dopaminergic medication, (ii) stimulation location (merged MRI and CT-scans) and (iii) stimulation-related changes in functional connectivity of brain regions that have an alleged role in apathy.\nAverage apathy severity significantly increased after DBS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the number of patients considered apathetic increased from two to nine. Change in apathy severity did not correlate with improvement in motor function or dose reduction of dopaminergic medication. For the left hemisphere, increase in apathy was associated with a more dorsolateral stimulation location (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010). The increase in apathy severity correlated with a decrease in alpha1 functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), but not with changes of the medial orbitofrontal or the anterior cingulate cortex.\nThe present observations suggest that apathy after STN-DBS is not necessarily related to dose reductions of dopaminergic medication, but may be an effect of the stimulation itself. This highlights the importance of determining optimal DBS settings based on both motor and non-motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Advanced age is the major risk factor for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), but to date the biological relationship between PD and ageing remains elusive. Here we describe the rationale and the design of the H2020 funded project \"PROPAG-AGEING\", whose aim is to characterize the contribution of the ageing process to PD development. We summarize current evidences that support the existence of a continuum between ageing and PD and justify the use of a Geroscience approach to study PD. We focus in particular on the role of inflammaging, the chronic, low-grade inflammation characteristic of elderly physiology, which can propagate and transmit both locally and systemically. We then describe PROPAG-AGEING design, which is based on the multi-omic characterization of peripheral samples from clinically characterized drug-na\u00efve and advanced PD, PD discordant twins, healthy controls and \"super-controls\", i.e. centenarians, who never showed clinical signs of motor disability, and their offspring. Omic results are then validated in a large number of samples, including in vitro models of dopaminergic neurons and healthy siblings of PD patients, who are at higher risk of developing PD, with the final aim of identifying the molecular perturbations that can deviate the trajectories of healthy ageing towards PD development.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) and metabolic function are frequently altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). Although enteric nervous system anatomopathological alterations have previously been reported in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) monkey model of PD, the resulting gastric emptying and intestinal permeability functional parameters are unknown. The current exploratory study was, thus, designed to investigate these GI functional factors and insulin resistance in the MPTP-treated monkey.\nEight rhesus macaque monkeys (4 controls and 4 MPTP-treated) received the oral acetaminophen absorption test to measure gastric emptying, the oral FITC-dextran absorption test to investigate intestinal permeability, and the intravenous glucose tolerance test to assess insulin resistance. Constipation was evaluated using the Bristol stool scale.\nNone of the tests, acetaminophen absorption, FITC-dextran absorption or glucose tolerance, showed a difference between control and MPTP-treated monkeys. MPTP-treated monkeys did present signs of transit acceleration.\nWhile the MPTP monkey model reliably displays motor and certain non-motor symptoms of PD, the current study did not demonstrate the GI symptoms associated with PD.",

    "abstract": "Despite the significance of tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis, classification, and patient's quality of life, there is a relative lack of data on prevalence and relationship of different tremor types in PD.\nThe presence of rest tremor (RT) and action tremor (AT; defined as combination of both postural and kinetic tremor) was determined and RT severity was defined using the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) at baseline in the Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI, n = 423), the Fox Investigation for New Discovery of Biomarkers (BioFIND, n = 118) and the Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP, n = 873) cohorts.\nAcross baseline data of all three cohorts, RT prevalence (58.2%) was higher than AT prevalence (39.0%). Patients with RT had significantly higher (Chi-square test, p < 0.05) prevalence of AT compared to patients without RT in the PPMI (40.0% versus 30.1%), BioFIND (48.0% versus 40.0%) and PDBP (49.9% versus 21.0%) cohorts. Furthermore, patients with AT had significantly (Student t-test, p < 0.05) higher RT severity that those without AT in PPMI (5.7 \u00b1 5.4 versus 3.9 \u00b1 3.3), BioFIND, 6.4 \u00b1 6.3 versus 3.8 \u00b1 4.4) and PDBP (6.4 \u00b1 6.6 versus 3.7 \u00b1 4.4) cohorts. In the BioFIND cohort, the prevalence of all types of tremor and their combinations significantly decreased from the off-state to on-state.\nThe RT is the most frequent tremor type and present in more than half of the PD patients. However, AT is also present in nearly one-third of the PD patients. Our results also indicate that RT and AT may have cross-interactions in PD, and that dopaminergic treatment influences both RT and AT.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease has been found to significantly affect health-related quality of life. The gender differences of the health-related quality of life of subjects with Parkinson's disease have been observed in a number of studies. These differences have been reported in terms of the age at onset, clinical manifestations, and response to therapy. In general, women with Parkinson's disease showed more positive disease outcomes with regard to emotion processing, non-motor symptoms, and cognitive functions, although women report more Parkinson's disease-related clinical manifestations. Female gender predicted poor physical functioning and socioemotional health-related quality of life, while male gender predicted the cognitive domain of health-related quality of life. Some studies reported gender differences in the association between health-related quality of life and non-motor symptoms. Depression and fatigue were the main causes of poorer health-related quality of life in women, even in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. The aim of this review was to collect the best available evidence on gender differences in the development of Parkinson's disease symptoms and health-related quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal lesions in Parkinson's disease (PD) are commonly associated with \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn)-induced cell damage that are present both in the central and peripheral nervous systems of patients, with the enteric nervous system also being especially vulnerable. Here, we bring together evidence that the development and presence of PD depends on specific sets of interlinking factors that include neuroinflammation, systemic inflammation, \u03b1-Syn-induced cell damage, vascular dysfunction, iron dysregulation, and gut and periodontal dysbiosis. We argue that there is significant evidence that bacterial inflammagens fuel this systemic inflammation, and might be central to the development of PD. We also discuss the processes whereby bacterial inflammagens may be involved in causing nucleation of proteins, including of \u03b1-Syn. Lastly, we review evidence that iron chelation, pre-and probiotics, as well as antibiotics and faecal transplant treatment might be valuable treatments in PD. A most important consideration, however, is that these therapeutic options need to be validated and tested in randomized controlled clinical trials. However, targeting underlying mechanisms of PD, including gut dysbiosis and iron toxicity, have potentially opened up possibilities of a wide variety of novel treatments, which may relieve the characteristic motor and nonmotor deficits of PD, and may even slow the progression and/or accompanying gut-related conditions of the disease.",

    "abstract": "A laboratory-developed test (LDT) is a type of in vitro diagnostic test that is developed and used within a single laboratory. The holistic metabolomic LDT integrating the currently available data on human metabolic pathways, changes in the concentrations of low-molecular-weight compounds in the human blood during diseases and other conditions, and their prevalent location in the body was developed. That is, the LDT uses all of the accumulated metabolic data relevant for disease diagnosis and high-resolution mass spectrometry with data processing by in-house software. In this study, the LDT was applied to diagnose early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), which currently lacks available laboratory tests. The use of the LDT for blood plasma samples confirmed its ability for such diagnostics with 73% accuracy. The diagnosis was based on relevant data, such as the detection of overrepresented metabolite sets associated with PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, the ability of the LDT to detect normal composition of low-molecular-weight compounds in blood was demonstrated, thus providing a definition of healthy at the molecular level. This LDT approach as a screening tool can be used for the further widespread testing for other diseases, since 'omics' tests, to which the metabolomic LDT belongs, cover a variety of them.",

    "abstract": "Deficits in cognitive functioning are a common yet poorly understood symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies have highlighted the importance of (dynamic) interactions between resting-state networks for cognition, which remains understudied in PD. We investigated how altered (dynamic) functional interactions between brain networks relate to cognitive dysfunction in PD patients. In this fMRI study, 50 PD patients (mean age 65.5\u00a0years\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.27) on dopaminergic medication were studied cross-sectionally, and of this cohort 31 PD patients were studied longitudinally. MRI imaging and neuropsychological testing was performed at two time points, with a follow-up duration of approximately three years. Functional connectivity within and between seven resting-state networks was calculated (both statically and dynamically) and correlated with four neuropsychological test scores; a combined score of (four) executive tasks, a motor perseveration, memory, and category fluency task. Cognitive dysfunction was determined based on a longitudinal sample of age-matched healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a013). PD patients showed dysfunction on six out of seven cognitive tasks when compared to healthy controls. Severity of executive dysfunction was correlated with higher static and lower dynamic functional connectivity between deep gray matter regions and the frontoparietal network (DGM-FPN). Over time, declining executive function was related to increasing static DGM-FPN connectivity, together with changes of connectivity involving the dorsal attention network (amongst others with the ventral attention network). Static functional connectivity between the ventral and dorsal attention network correlated with motor perseveration. Our findings demonstrate that in PD patients, dysfunctional communication between (i) subcortical, fronto-parietal and attention networks mostly underlies worsening of executive functioning, (ii) attention networks are involved in motor perseveration.",

Theoretically, the cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been attributed to the dysregulations of internal wind, phlegm, fire, and stasis. Thus, HLJDT has been used to treat PD. However, the molecular mechanism is unknown. Besides, paraquat (PQ) as an herbicide has been known to impair midbrain dopaminergic neurons, resemblance to the pathology of PD. Thus, the molecular mechanism of HLJDT in treating PD and PQ-induced in vitro PD model was investigated in this study. Primarily, the dose-response of PQ (0.1\u223c1\u2009mM)-induced neurotoxicity for 24\u2009h was performed in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The LD",

    "abstract": "Gait disturbances have emerged as some of the main therapeutic concerns in late-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS). External cues may help to overcome freezing of gait (FOG) and improve some of the gait parameters.\nTo evaluate the effect of 3D visual cues and STN-DBS on gait in PD group.\nWe enrolled 35 PD patients treated with DBS of nucleus subthalamicus (STN-DBS). Twenty-five patients (5 females; mean age 58.9 \u00b16.3) and 25 sex- and age-matched controls completed the gait examination. The gait in 10 patients deteriorated in OFF state. The severity of PD was evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (HY). The PD group filled the Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES) and Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ). Gait was examined using the GaitRite Analysis System, placed in the middle of the 10m marked path. The PD group was tested without dopaminergic medication with and without visual cueing together with the DBS switched ON and OFF. The setting of DBS was double-blind and performed in random order.\nThe UPDRS was 21.9 \u00b19.5 in DBS ON state and 41.3 \u00b113.7 in DBS OFF state. HY was 2.5 \u00b10.6, FES 12.4 \u00b14.1 and FOGQ 9.4 \u00b15.7. In the DBS OFF state, PD group walked more slowly with shorter steps, had greater step length variability and longer duration of the double support phase compared to healthy controls. The walking speed and step length increased in the DBS ON state. The double support phase was reduced with 3D visual cueing and DBS; the combination of both cueing and DBS was even more effective.\nCueing with 3D visual stimuli shortens the double support phase in PD patients treated with DBS-STN. The DBS is more effective in prolonging step length and increasing gait speed. We conclude that 3D visual cueing can improve walking in patients with DBS.",

    "abstract": "We determined the effectiveness of a multi-strain probiotic (Hexbio\u00ae) containing microbial cell preparation MCP\u00aeBCMC\u00ae on constipation symptoms and gut motility in PD patients with constipation.\nPD patients with constipation (ROME III criteria) were randomized to receive a multi-strain probiotic (Lactobacillus sp and Bifidobacterium sp at 30 X 109 CFU) with fructo-oligosaccaride or placebo (fermented milk) twice daily for 8 weeks. Primary outcomes were changes in the presence of constipation symptoms using 9 items of Garrigues Questionnaire (GQ), which included an item on bowel opening frequency. Secondary outcomes were gut transit time (GTT), quality of life (PDQ39-SI), motor (MDS-UPDRS) and non-motor symptoms (NMSS).\nOf 55 recruited, 48 patients completed the study: 22 received probiotic and 26 received placebo. At 8 weeks, there was a significantly higher mean weekly BOF in the probiotic group compared to placebo [SD 4.18 (1.44) vs SD 2.81(1.06); (mean difference 1.37, 95% CI 0.68, 2.07, uncorrected p<0.001)]. Patients in the probiotic group reported five times higher odds (odds ratio = 5.48, 95% CI 1.57, 19.12, uncorrected p = 0.008) for having higher BOF (< 3 to 3-5 to >5 times/week) compared to the placebo group. The GTT in the probiotic group [77.32 (SD55.35) hours] reduced significantly compared to placebo [113.54 (SD 61.54) hours]; mean difference -36.22, 95% CI -68.90, -3.54, uncorrected p = 0.030). The mean change in GTT was 58.04 (SD59.04) hour vs 20.73 (SD60.48) hours respectively (mean difference 37.32, 95% CI 4.00, 70.63, uncorrected p = 0.028). No between-groups differences were observed in the NMSS, PDQ39-SI, MDS-UPDRS II and MDS-UPDRS III scores. Four patients in the probiotics group experienced mild reversible side effects.\nThis study showed that consumption of a multi-strain probiotic (Hexbio\u00ae) over 8 weeks improved bowel opening frequency and whole gut transit time in PD patients with constipation.",

At 8 weeks, there was a significantly higher mean weekly BOF in the probiotic group compared to placebo [SD 4.18 (1.44) vs SD 2.81(1.06); (mean difference 1.37, 95% CI 0.68, 2.07, uncorrected p<0.001)]. Patients in the probiotic group reported five times higher odds (odds ratio = 5.48, 95% CI 1.57, 19.12, uncorrected p = 0.008) for having higher BOF (< 3 to 3-5 to >5 times/week) compared to the placebo group. The GTT in the probiotic group [77.32 (SD55.35) hours] reduced significantly compared to placebo [113.54 (SD 61.54) hours]; mean difference -36.22, 95% CI -68.90, -3.54, uncorrected p = 0.030). The mean change in GTT was 58.04 (SD59.04) hour vs 20.73 (SD60.48) hours respectively (mean difference 37.32, 95% CI 4.00, 70.63, uncorrected p = 0.028).

    "abstract": "The consumption of dairy products, particularly of low fat milk, has been shown to be associated with the occurrence of Parkinson's disease. This association does not necessarily reflect a pathophysiological role of milk intake in the development of Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, the present review discusses a potential mechanism possibly mediating an effect of milk consumption on Parkinson's disease. The case is made that milk is tailored in part to support bone mineralization of the suckling offspring and is thus rich in calcium and phosphate. Milk intake is thus expected to enhance intestinal calcium phosphate uptake. As binding to fatty acids impedes Ca",

    "abstract": "Gait impairment is a pivotal feature of parkinsonian syndromes and increased gait variability is associated with postural instability and a higher risk of falls.\nWe compared gait variability at different walking velocities between and within groups of patients with Parkinson-variant multiple system atrophy, idiopathic Parkinson's disease, and a control group of older adults.\nGait metrics were recorded in 11 multiple system atrophy, 12 Parkinson's disease patients, and 18 controls using sensor-based gait analysis. Gait variability was analyzed for stride, swing and stance time, stride length and gait velocity. Values were compared between and within the groups at self-paced comfortable, fast and slow walking speed.\nMultiple system atrophy patients displayed higher gait variability except for stride time at all velocities compared with controls, while Parkinson's patients did not. Compared with Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy patients displayed higher variability of swing time, stride length and gait velocity at comfortable speed and at slow speed for swing and stance time, stride length and gait velocity (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Stride time variability was significantly higher in slow compared to comfortable walking in patients with multiple system atrophy (P\u2009=\u20090.014). Variability parameters significantly correlated with the postural instability/gait difficulty subscore in both disease groups. Conversely, significant correlations between variability parameters and MDS-UPDRS III score was observed only for multiple system atrophy patients.\nThis analysis suggests that gait variability parameters reflect the major axial impairment and postural instability displayed by multiple system atrophy patients compared with Parkinson's disease patients and controls.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation and immunopathology in Parkinson's disease (PD) are believed to be associated with genetic and environmental factors.\nWe conducted the current study to evaluate the Toll-like receptors (TLR4 and TLR9) genes polymorphism in patients with Parkinson's disease in northern Iran.\nWe extracted DNA from peripheral blood samples of 100 sporadic cases of Parkinson's disease and 100 healthy-matched controls with the mean age of 69.98 and 71.94 years, respectively. Subsequently, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TLR4 and TLR9 were genotyped using restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR). Results were confirmed employing Sanger sequencing. For the analysis of our data, we used SNPStats and SPSS 22 software.\nOur findings indicated that the allele distribution for rs352140 of TLR9 gene was significantly different in the PD group compared with the healthy controls (p=0.02). Moreover, rs352140 T allele was observed to be correlated with PD reduced risk (TT + TC vs. CC). The dominant rs352140 model was approved as the most acceptable inheritance model for fitting the data (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23-0.75, p=0.0031). Additionally, haplotype analysis revealed a significant correlation between TLR9 polymorphisms and Parkinson's disease.\nThe results of this study indicated that rs352140T of TLR9 gene was a protective factor in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, this SNP could be regarded as a prognostic factor. However, this conclusion should be confirmed by further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Gait disturbance is an early, disabling feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is typically refractory to dopaminergic medication. The cortical cholinergic system, originating in the nucleus basalis of Meynert of the basal forebrain, has been implicated. However, it is not known if degeneration in this region relates to a worsening of disease-specific gait impairment.\nTo evaluate associations between sub-regional cholinergic basal forebrain volumes and longitudinal progression of gait impairment in PD.\n99 PD participants and 47 control participants completed gait assessments via an instrumented walkway during 2\u2009minutes of continuous walking, at baseline and for up to 3\u2009years, from which 16 spatiotemporal characteristics were derived. Sub-regional cholinergic basal forebrain volumes were measured at baseline via MRI and a regional map derived from post-mortem histology. Univariate analyses evaluated cross-sectional associations between sub-regional volumes and gait. Linear mixed-effects models assessed whether volumes predicted longitudinal gait changes.\nThere were no cross-sectional, age-independent relationships between sub-regional volumes and gait. However, nucleus basalis of Meynert volumes predicted longitudinal gait changes unique to PD. Specifically, smaller nucleus basalis of Meynert volume predicted increasing step time variability (P =\u20090.019) and shortening swing time (P =\u20090.015); smaller posterior nucleus portions predicted shortening step length (P =\u20090.007) and increasing step time variability (P =\u20090.041).\nThis is the first study to demonstrate that degeneration of the cortical cholinergic system predicts longitudinal progression of gait impairments in PD. Measures of this degeneration may therefore provide a novel biomarker for identifying future mobility loss and falls. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

However, nucleus basalis of Meynert volumes predicted longitudinal gait changes unique to PD. Specifically, smaller nucleus basalis of Meynert volume predicted increasing step time variability (P =\u20090.019) and shortening swing time (P =\u20090.015); smaller posterior nucleus portions predicted shortening step length (P =\u20090.007) and increasing step time variability (P =\u20090.041).",

QTc prolongation is a side effect that requires monitoring in order to avoid more serious cardiac complications. One particular understudied area is the potential for antipsychotics to elicit electroconduction abnormalities in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome.

    "abstract": "This study has been designed with the aim of using optimal scaling to perform the allocation of scores and to be able to construct an indicator of the Parkinson's Disease Gravity Index. Scores were assigned to interrelated dimensions that share information about the patient's situation, to have an objective, holistic tool which integrates scores so that doctors can have a comprehensive idea of the patient's situation. \nThere were no missing data. An appropriate Cronbach's alpha value of 0.71 was gathered, and all items were found to be pertinent to the scale. The item homogeneity index was 0.36. Precision evaluated with the standard error of measurement was 7.8. The Parkinson's Disease Gravity Index discriminant validity (validity for known groups), assessed among the different stages of Hoehn and Yahr scale by the Kruskal-Wallis test, showed major significance (\nThe Parkinson's Disease Gravity Index has shown adequate metric properties.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) has evolved as a well-established treatment in neurosurgery, and identifying appropriate surgical candidates could contribute to better DBS outcomes. The Florida Surgical Questionnaire for Parkinson Disease (FLASQ-PD) is a reasonable screening tool for assessing DBS candidacy in PD patients; however, a Chinese version of FLASQ-PD is needed for functional neurosurgery units in China. In this study, we translated the FLASQ-PD to Chinese and assessed its reliability and validity for Chinese PD patients.\nThe FLASQ-PD was translated before the study formally started. A single-center retrospective analysis of FLASQ-PD was performed at the Ruijin Hospital, affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, between July and December 2019. The Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS-III) was also used to assess PD patients on and off medication. All patients were evaluated for surgical candidacy by specialists.\nOverall, 115 PD patients, 25 with parkinsonism and six with multiple system atrophy were consecutively included. Internal consistency of the Chinese FLASQ-PD was roughly adequate (Cronbach's alpha\u2009=\u20090.664). There were significant differences in mean total scores of the Chinese FLASQ-PD between the diagnostic (Kruskal-Wallis H value\u2009=\u200937.450, \nThe Chinese FLASQ-PD, which is a simple and efficient screening tool for clinicians, was developed and initially validated in this retrospective single-center study.",

    "abstract": "Early- and late-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD and LOPD, respectively) have different risk factors, clinical features, and disease course; however, the functional outcome of these differences have not been well characterized. This study investigated differences in global brain synchronization changes and their clinical significance in EOPD and LOPD patients. Patients with idiopathic PD including 25 EOPD and 24 LOPD patients, and age- and sex-matched healthy control (HC) subjects including 27 younger and 26 older controls (YCs and OCs, respectively) were enrolled. Voxel-based degree centrality (DC) was calculated as a measure of global synchronization and compared between PD patients and HC groups matched in terms of disease onset and severity. DC was decreased in bilateral Rolandic operculum and left insula and increased in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and precuneus of EOPD patients compared to YCs. DC was decreased in the right putamen, mid-cingulate cortex, bilateral Rolandic operculum, and left insula and increased in the right cerebellum-crus1 of LOPD patients compared to OCs. Correlation analyses showed that DC in the right cerebellum-crus1 was inversely associated with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) score in LOPD patients. Thus, EOPD and LOPD patients show distinct alterations in global synchronization relative to HCs. Furthermore, our results suggest that the left SFG and right cerebellum-crus1 play important roles in the compensation for corticostriatal-thalamocortical loop injury in EOPD and LOPD patients, whereas the cerebellum is a key hub in the neural mechanisms underlying LOPD with depression. These findings provide new insight into the clinical heterogeneity of the two PD subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Much thought has been given to the impact of Amyloid Beta, Tau and Alpha-Synuclein in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the clinical failures of the recent decades indicate that there are further pathological mechanisms at work. Indeed, besides amyloids, AD and PD are characterized by the culminative interplay of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and hyperfission, defective autophagy and mitophagy, systemic inflammation, BBB and vascular damage, demyelination, cerebral insulin resistance, the loss of dopamine production in PD, impaired neurogenesis and, of course, widespread axonal, synaptic and neuronal degeneration that leads to cognitive and motor impediments. Interestingly, the acylated form of the hormone ghrelin has shown the potential to ameliorate the latter pathologic changes, although some studies indicate a few complications that need to be considered in the long-term administration of the hormone. As such, this review will illustrate the wide-ranging neuroprotective properties of acylated ghrelin and critically evaluate the hormone's therapeutic benefits for the treatment of AD and PD.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction (hyposmia) is an important non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate the potential prognostic value of hyposmia as a marker for disease progression, we prospectively assessed clinical manifestations and longitudinal changes of hyposmic PD patients and normosmic ones.\nOlfactory function was evaluated with the Sniffin' Sticks in PD patients at baseline. One hundred five hyposmic PD patients and 59 normosmic PD patients were enrolled and followed up for 2 years. They were subsequently evaluated at baseline and during follow-up periods with neurological and neuropsychological assessments. Clinical manifestations and disease progressions were compared between hyposmic and normosmic patients. In addition, the relationship between disease progressions and olfactory function was analyzed.\nOur study suggested that hyposmic PD patients and normosmic ones were similar in gender, age, education levels, age of onset, disease duration, and clinical features at baseline. Hyposmic PD patients exhibited more severe Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part II-III (UPDRS II-III) scores, higher levodopa equivalent dose (LED) needs, and poorer Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at follow-up visits compared to those in normosmic PD patients. Hyposmia also showed greater rates in the increase of LED needs, improvement of UPDRS III score, and deterioration of MMSE score. Both improvement of UPDRS III score and decline of MMSE score were associated with poorer odor identification.\nOur prospective study demonstrated that hyposmic PD patients showed a relatively worse clinical course compared with normosmic patients. Olfactory dysfunction is a useful predictor of disease progression.",

    "results": "Our study suggested that hyposmic PD patients and normosmic ones were similar in gender, age, education levels, age of onset, disease duration, and clinical features at baseline. Hyposmic PD patients exhibited more severe Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part II-III (UPDRS II-III) scores, higher levodopa equivalent dose (LED) needs, and poorer Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at follow-up visits compared to those in normosmic PD patients. Hyposmia also showed greater rates in the increase of LED needs, improvement of UPDRS III score, and deterioration of MMSE score. Both improvement of UPDRS III score and decline of MMSE score were associated with poorer odor identification.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have reported the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects of fisetin. However, the therapeutic efficacy of fisetin in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that fisetin could markedly alleviate 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in mice. To confirm the reported correlation between gut microbiota and PD, the bacterial DNA in the fresh feces of mice from each group was subjected to 16S rRNA (V3 and V4 regions) sequencing. The results revealed that fisetin changed the number, diversity, and distribution of gut microbiota in MPTP-induced mice model of PD. The alpha and beta diversity analyses showed that the fisetin intervented MPTP group gut microbiota exhibited a significantly higher abundance of Lachnospiraceae and a significantly lower abundance of uncultured_bacterium_g_Escherichia-Shigella and uncultured_bacterium_g_Bacillus than the MPTP group gut microbiota. These findings indicated that fisetin exerts a neuroprotective effect on neurodegeneration by altering the composition and diversity of gut microbiota. Thus, fisetin could be a potential novel therapeutic for PD.",

    "abstract": "Ginkgolide B (GB) is a terpene lactone derivative of Ginkgo biloba that is believed to function in a neuroprotective manner ideal for treating Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite its promising therapeutic properties, GB has poor bioavailability following oral administration and cannot readily achieve sufficient exposure in treated patients, limiting its clinical application for the treatment of PD. In an effort to improve its efficacy, we utilized poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) nanoparticles as a means of encapsulating GB (GB-NPs). These NPs facilitated the sustained release of GB into the blood, thereby improving its ability to accumulate in the brain and to treat PD.\nUsing Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, we were able to confirm that these NPs could be taken into cells via multiple nonspecific mechanisms including micropinocytosis, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and lipid raft/caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Once internalized, these NPs tended to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes. In zebrafish, we determined that these NPs were readily able to undergo transport across the chorion, gastrointestinal, blood-brain, and blood-retinal barriers. In a 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP\nIn conclusion, these results indicate that NPs encapsulation of GB can significantly improve its oral bioavailability, cerebral accumulation, and bioactivity via mediating its sustained release in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of Gait (FoG) is a common symptom in Parkinson's Disease (PD) occurring with significant variability and severity and is associated with increased risk of falls. FoG detection in everyday life is not trivial, particularly in patients manifesting the symptom only in specific conditions. Various wearable devices have been proposed to detect PD symptoms, primarily based on inertial sensors. We here report the results of the validation of a novel system based on a pair of pressure insoles equipped with a 3D accelerometer to detect FoG episodes. Twenty PD patients attended a motor assessment protocol organized into eight multiple video recorded sessions, both in clinical and ecological settings and both in the ON and OFF state. We compared the FoG episodes detected using the processed data gathered from the insoles with those tagged by a clinician on video recordings. The algorithm correctly detected 90% of the episodes. The false positive rate was 6% and the false negative rate 4%. The algorithm reliably detects freezing of gait in clinical settings while performing ecological tasks. This result is promising for freezing of gait detection in everyday life via wearable instrumented insoles that can be integrated into a more complex system for comprehensive motor symptom monitoring in PD.",

    "abstract": "The neuroanatomical and molecular substrates for cognitive impairment in Parkinson Disease (PD) are far from clear. Evidence suggests a non-dopaminergic basis, and a crucial role for cerebellum in cognitive control in PD. We investigated whether a PD cognitive marker (response inhibition) was differently controlled by g-amino butyric acid (GABA) and/or by glutamate-glutamine (Glx) levels in the cerebellum of idiopathic PD patients, and healthy comparators (HC). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of GABA/Glx (MEGA-PRESS acquisition sequence) was performed at 3 Tesla, and response inhibition assessed by the Stroop Word-Color Test (SWCT) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Linear correlations between cerebellar GABA/Glx levels, SWCT time/error interference effects and WCST perseverative errors were performed to test differences between correlation coefficients in PD and HC. Results showed that higher levels of mean cerebellar GABA were associated to SWCT increased time and error interference effects in PD, and the contrary in HC. Such effect dissociated by hemisphere, while correlation coefficients differences were significant in both right and left cerebellum. We conclude that MRS measured levels of cerebellar GABA are related in PD patients with decreased efficiency in filtering task-irrelevant information. This is crucial for developing pharmacological treatments for PD to potentially preserve cognitive functioning.",

    "abstract": "Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome occurs due to the presence of accessory pathways that abnormally communicate the atria with the ventricles. It is one of the main causes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in young people and adolescents, in whom the ideal management is catheter ablation. This syndrome can also occur in younger patients such as neonates and infants, where the therapeutic options are different. We present the case of a 47-day-old patient who was admitted to a public pediatric hospital in Peru due to vomiting. Upon admission, she showed a heart rate of 250 beats per minute; wide QRS complex tachycardia was documented; later, on the electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm, signs of pre-excitation were evident.\nEl s\u00edndrome de Wolff Parkinson White ocurre por la presencia de v\u00edas accesorias que comunican anormalmente las aur\u00edculas con los ventr\u00edculos, es una de las principales causas de taquicardia parox\u00edstica supraventricular en j\u00f3venes y adolescentes, en quienes el manejo ideal es la ablaci\u00f3n con cat\u00e9ter. Este s\u00edndrome tambi\u00e9n puede presentarse en pacientes de menor edad como neonatos y lactantes, en donde las opciones terap\u00e9uticas son distintas. Presentamos el caso de una paciente de 47 d\u00edas de vida que ingres\u00f3 a un hospital pedi\u00e1trico p\u00fablico de Per\u00fa presentando v\u00f3mitos, a su ingreso mostr\u00f3 una frecuencia cardiaca de 250 latidos por minuto; se logr\u00f3 documentar taquicardia de complejos QRS anchos; posteriormente, en el electrocardiograma en ritmo sinusal, se evidenci\u00f3 signos de preexcitaci\u00f3n.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies reported conflicting results on the association of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with dementia and Parkinson's disease in patients with prostate cancer (Pca). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) increases the risk of both diseases. A nationwide population cohort study was conducted involving newly diagnosed patients with Pca %who started ADT with GnRHa (GnRHa users, n = 3,201) and control (nonusers, n = 4,123) between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2016, using data from the National Health Insurance Service. To validate the result, a hospital cohort of patients with Pca consisting of GnRHa users (n = 205) and nonusers (n = 479) in a tertiary referral center from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2016, were also analyzed. Traditional and propensity score-matched Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effects of ADT on the risk of dementia and Parkinson's disease. In univariable analysis, risk of dementia was associated with GnRHa use in both nationwide and hospital validation cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 1.696; 95% CI, 1.425-2.019, and HR, 1.352; 95% CI, 1.089-1.987, respectively). In a nationwide cohort, ADT was not associated with dementia in both traditional and propensity score-matched multivariable analysis, whereas in a hospital validation cohort, ADT was associated with dementia only in unmatched analysis (HR, 1.203; 95% CI, 1.021-1.859) but not in propensity score-matched analysis. ADT was not associated with Parkinson's disease in either nationwide and validation cohorts. This population-based study suggests that the association between GnRHa use as ADT and increased risk of dementia or Parkinson's disease is not clear, which was also verified in a hospital validation cohort.",

The PubMed, Cochrane Library, OvidSP, Web of Science, China Science and Technology Journal Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and China Wanfang Standards Database databases were systematically searched from the inception dates to October 1st, 2019, using the key words'glutathione' or 'GSH' and 'Parkinson' or 'Parkinson's disease' or 'PD'. The quality of the included articles was assessed using the bias risk assessment tool of the Cochrane systematic evaluator manual (version 5.1.0). Pooled analysis of the relevant data was performed using RevMan 5.3 software and subgroup analysis was performed to determine the impact of the dosage (300 vs. 600 mg) on the outcome measures. A total of seven randomized controlled trials involving 450 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The results of the present study indicated a statistically significant difference between the GSH and control groups, in terms of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III [standard mean difference (SMD), -0.48; 95% CI, -(0.88-0.08); P=0.02] and GSH peroxidase (SMD, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.52-3.24; P=0.007). However, the differences in the UPDRS I (SMD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.25-0.16; P=0.70) and UPDRS II (SMD, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.17-0.24; P=0.77) score and in side effects were not statistically significant between the groups. Subgroup analyses revealed that the dosage (300 vs. 600 mg) was an influencing factor for UPDRS III. The present study demonstrated that GSH may mildly improve motor scores in PD, but not at the expense of increased adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Dysbiosis is implicated by many studies in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Advances in sequencing technology and computing have resulted in confounding data regarding pathogenic bacterial profiles in conditions such as PD. Changes in the microbiome with reductions in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and increases in endotoxin-producing bacteria likely contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. GPR109A, a G-protein coupled receptor found on the surface of the intestinal epithelium and immune cells, plays a key role in controlling intestinal permeability and the inflammatory cascade. The absence of GPR109A receptors is associated with decreased concentration of tight junction proteins, leading to increased intestinal permeability and susceptibility to inflammation. In inflammatory states, butyrate acts via GPR109A to increase concentrations of tight junction proteins and improve intestinal permeability. Niacin deficiency is exacerbated in PD by dopaminergic medications. Niacin supplementation has been shown to shift macrophage polarization from pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory profile. Niacin and butyrate, promising nutrients and unique ligands for the G protein-coupled receptor GPR109A, are reviewed in this paper in detail.",

    "abstract": "The challenge of differentiating, at an early stage, Parkinson's disease from parkinsonism caused by other disorders remains unsolved. We proposed using an artificial neural network (ANN) to process images of dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT).\nAbnormal DAT-SPECT images of subjects with Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism caused by other disorders were divided into training and test sets. Striatal regions of the images were segmented by using an active contour model and were used as the data to perform transfer learning on a pre-trained ANN to discriminate Parkinson's disease from parkinsonism caused by other disorders. A support vector machine trained using parameters of semi-quantitative measurements including specific binding ratio and asymmetry index was used for comparison.\nThe predictive accuracy of the ANN classifier (86%) was higher than that of the support vector machine classifier (68%). The sensitivity and specificity of the ANN classifier in predicting Parkinson's disease were 81.8% and 88.6%, respectively.\nThe ANN classifier outperformed classical biomarkers in differentiating Parkinson's disease from parkinsonism caused by other disorders. This classifier can be readily included into standalone computer software for clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Genetics has an essential role in the development of early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD). Consequently, genetic screening is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of EOPD. In this study, we reported two EOPD with compound heterozygous in PARKIN detected by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Two unrelated EOPD patients and their parents were enrolled in this study. Genetic analysis was performed through WES and verified by direct Sanger sequencing. In addition, MLPA was used to detect exon dosage. Detailed clinical manifestations and several scale assessments were collected for genotype and phenotype analysis. Compound heterozygous mutations in PARKIN were identified in both patients. c.735-1G > A and Ex2del were detected in Case A, while G284R (c.850 G > C) and Ex2del were found in Case B. These variants were confirmed to originate from their normal parents. The c.735-1G > A is a novel PARKIN variant, which was predicted to result from disappearing of the acceptor splice site by NetGene2. The G284R is a previously reported pathological mutation and the Ex2del is a hot variant of PARKIN found in the Asian population. The phenotypes of both patients are quite different, the main manifestation of case A is rigidity onset, while the case B starts with tremor and foot dystonia. In the present study, we reported a novel compound heterozygous form of PARKIN consisting of splice variant c. 735-1G > A and Ex2del. Moreover, we also found that tiny differences in genotypes of PARKIN may lead to obvious clinical phenotypic differences.",

    "abstract": "Assays that specifically measure \u03b1-synuclein seeding activity in biological fluids could revolutionize the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Recent improvements in \u03b1-synuclein real-time quaking-induced conversion assays of cerebrospinal fluid have dramatically reduced reaction times from 5-13\u00a0days down to 1-2\u00a0days.\nTo test our improved assay against a panel of cerebrospinal fluid specimens from patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls from the MJ Fox Foundation/NINDS BioFIND collection.\nSpecimens collected from healthy controls and patients with clinically typical moderate-to-advanced Parkinson's disease were tested without prior knowledge of disease status. Correlative analyses between assay parameters and clinical measures were performed by an independent investigator.\nBioFIND samples gave positive signals in 105/108 (97%) Parkinson's disease cases versus 11/85 (13%) healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic analyses of diagnosis of cases versus healthy controls gave areas under the curve of 95%. Beyond binary positive/negative determinations, only weak correlations were observed between various assay response parameters and Parkinson's disease clinical measures or other cerebrospinal fluid analytes. Of note, REM sleep behavioral disorder questionnaire scores correlated with the reaction times needed to reach 50% maximum fluorescence. Maximum fluorescence was inversely correlated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores, which was driven by the patients without REM sleep behavioral disorder.\nOur improved \u03b1-synuclein seed amplification assay dramatically reduces the time needed to diagnose Parkinson's disease while maintaining the high-performance standards associated with previous \u03b1-synuclein seed assays, supporting the clinical utility of this assay for Parkinson's disease diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "In addition to the typical motor symptoms, a majority of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease experience language impairments. Deep Brain Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus robustly reduces motor dysfunction, but its impact on language skills remains ambiguous.\nTo elucidate the impact of subthalamic deep brain stimulation on natural language production, we systematically analyzed language samples from fourteen individuals (three female / eleven male, average age 66.43 \u00b1 7.53 years) with Parkinson's disease in the active (ON) versus inactive (OFF) stimulation condition. Significant ON-OFF differences were considered as stimulation effects. To localize their neuroanatomical origin within the subthalamic nucleus, they were correlated with the volume of tissue activated by therapeutic stimulation.\nWord and clause production speed increased significantly under active stimulation. These enhancements correlated with the volume of tissue activated within the associative part of the subthalamic nucleus, but not with that within the dorsolateral motor part, which again correlated with motor improvement. Language error rates were lower in the ON vs. OFF condition, but did not correlate with electrode localization. No significant changes in further semantic or syntactic language features were detected in the current study.\nThe findings point towards a facilitation of executive language functions occurring rather independently from motor improvement. Given the presumed origin of this stimulation effect within the associative part of the subthalamic nucleus, this could be due to co-stimulation of the prefrontal-subthalamic circuit.",

    "abstract": "The genetics and pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) strongly implicate mitochondria in disease aetiology. Elegant studies over the last two\u00a0decades have elucidated complex molecular signaling governing the identification and removal of dysfunctional mitochondria from the cell, a process of mitochondrial quality control known as mitophagy. Mitochondrial deficits and specifically reduced mitophagy are evident in both sporadic and familial PD. Mendelian genetics attributes loss-of-function mutations in key mitophagy regulators PINK1 and Parkin to early-onset PD. Pharmacologically enhancing mitophagy and accelerating the removal of damaged mitochondria are of interest for developing a disease-modifying PD therapeutic. However, despite significant understanding of both PINK1-Parkin-dependent and -independent mitochondrial quality control pathways, the therapeutic potential of targeting mitophagy remains to be fully explored. Here, we provide a summary of the genetic evidence supporting the role for mitophagy failure as a pathogenic mechanism in PD. We assess the tractability of mitophagy pathways and prospects for drug discovery and consider intervention points for mitophagy enhancement. We explore the numerous hit molecules beginning to emerge from high-content/high-throughput screening as well as the biochemical and phenotypic assays that enabled these screens. The chemical and biological properties of these reference compounds suggest many could be used to interrogate and perturb mitochondrial biology to validate promising drug targets. Finally, we address key considerations and challenges in achieving preclinical proof-of-concept, including in\u00a0vivo mitophagy reporter methodologies and disease models, as well as patient stratification and biomarker development for mitochondrial forms of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Studies regarding the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on quality of life (QOL) have reported conflicting results, and the underlying QOL domains require further study. In order to understand the association between PD and QOL, we conducted this meta-analysis to systematically compare QOL between PD patients and healthy controls.\nThe PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched. Data were analyzed using the random-effects model.\nTwenty studies covering 2707 PD patients and 150,661 healthy controls were included in the study. Compared with healthy controls, PD patients had significantly poorer QOL overall and in most domains with moderate to large effects sizes. Different QOL measures varied in their association with quality of life, with the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) having the largest effect size (standard mean difference, SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.384, 95% CI: -1.607, -1.162, Z\u00a0=\u00a012.189, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), followed by the Europe Quality of Life Questionnaire-visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.081, 95% CI: -1.578, -0.584, Z\u00a0=\u00a0-4.265, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Europe Quality of Life Questionnaire-5D (EQ-5D) (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.889, 95% CI: -1.181, -0.596, Z\u00a0=\u00a0-5.962, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and the Short-form Health Survey (SF) scales (physical dimension: SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.826, 95% CI: -1.529, -0.123, Z\u00a0=\u00a0-2.303, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021; mental dimension: SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.376, 95% CI: -0.732, -0.019, Z\u00a0=\u00a0-2.064, P\u00a0=\u00a00.039).\nPD patients had lower QOL compared with healthy controls in most domains, especially in physical function and mental health. Considering the negative impact of poor QOL on daily life and functional outcomes, effective measures should be developed to improve QOL in this population.",

    "abstract": "Progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in basal ganglia is blamed as the main source of gait disturbance in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is known that the normal step pattern does not disappear in PD, but there is a problem in activating the correct step response. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS), which is an external stimulus, on gait in individuals with PD.\nTwenty-six individuals, 13 in the PD group and 13 in the control group, participated in the study. All individuals were asked to walk under four different RAS conditions configured with beat frequency and melodic variations. Time-distance parameters and gait performance of the individuals were evaluated.\nRAS significantly increased the gait speed of the individuals with PD compared to the control group. RAS set to 10% increase in the cadence of the patient with melody (10\nOur study has shown that RAS implementation improves gait in individuals with PD both in terms of time-distance parameters and performance, especially when set to 10% more than the patient's gait cadence. It was concluded that cadence-compatible melodic RAS can be safely included in PD rehabilitation programs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has a high incidence in the elderly, and the late stage seriously affects the daily life of the patients. Most of the initial symptoms of PD are not obvious or atypical, which brings difficulties to the early diagnosis. Replacement therapy and neuroprotection after early diagnosis can significantly improve the prognosis and quality of life of patients. More and more evidence shows that 11C-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane positron emission tomography ( 11C-CFT PET) combined with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) can effectively improve the accuracy of early diagnosis. However, there is no consistent conclusion at present. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 11C-CFT PET combined with 18F-FDG PET in the diagnosis of early PD.\nWe will search 7 electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane library, PsycINFO, AMED, Scopus), ongoing trials and grey literature to collect related randomized controlled trials and will use Review Manager Software 5.2 and STATA Software 16.0 for analysis and synthesis.\nWe will integrate the existing randomized controlled trials to evaluate the value of 11C-CFT PET combined with 18F-FDG PET in the diagnosis of early PD.\nOur study may prove that 11C-CFT PET combined with 18F-FDG PET can effectively diagnose early PD.\nInternational Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO): CRD42020203442.",

    "abstract": "The subthalamic nucleus is the preferred neurosurgical target for deep-brain stimulation to treat cardinal motor features of Parkinson's disease. Focused ultrasound is an imaging-guided method for creating therapeutic lesions in deep-brain structures, including the subthalamic nucleus.\nWe randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, patients with markedly asymmetric Parkinson's disease who had motor signs not fully controlled by medication or who were ineligible for deep-brain stimulation surgery to undergo focused ultrasound subthalamotomy on the side opposite their main motor signs or a sham procedure. The primary efficacy outcome was the between-group difference in the change from baseline to 4 months in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor score (i.e., part III) for the more affected body side (range, 0 to 44, with higher scores indicating worse parkinsonism) in the off-medication state. The primary safety outcome (procedure-related complications) was assessed at 4 months.\nAmong 40 enrolled patients, 27 were assigned to focused ultrasound subthalamotomy (active treatment) and 13 to the sham procedure (control). The mean MDS-UPDRS III score for the more affected side decreased from 19.9 at baseline to 9.9 at 4 months in the active-treatment group (least-squares mean difference, 9.8 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6 to 11.1) and from 18.7 to 17.1 in the control group (least-squares mean difference, 1.7 points; 95% CI, 0.0 to 3.5); the between-group difference was 8.1 points (95% CI, 6.0 to 10.3; P<0.001). Adverse events in the active-treatment group were dyskinesia in the off-medication state in 6 patients and in the on-medication state in 6, which persisted in 3 and 1, respectively, at 4 months; weakness on the treated side in 5 patients, which persisted in 2 at 4 months; speech disturbance in 15 patients, which persisted in 3 at 4 months; facial weakness in 3 patients, which persisted in 1 at 4 months; and gait disturbance in 13 patients, which persisted in 2 at 4 months. In 6 patients in the active-treatment group, some of these deficits were present at 12 months.\nFocused ultrasound subthalamotomy in one hemisphere improved motor features of Parkinson's disease in selected patients with asymmetric signs. Adverse events included speech and gait disturbances, weakness on the treated side, and dyskinesia. (Funded by Insightec and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03454425.).",

The mean MDS-UPDRS III score for the more affected side decreased from 19.9 at baseline to 9.9 at 4 months in the active-treatment group (least-squares mean difference, 9.8 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6 to 11.1) and from 18.7 to 17.1 in the control group (least-squares mean difference, 1.7 points; 95% CI, 0.0 to 3.5); the between-group difference was 8.1 points (95% CI, 6.0 to 10.3; P<0.001). Adverse events in the active-treatment group were dyskinesia in the off-medication state in 6 patients and in the on-medication state in 6, which persisted in 3 and 1, respectively, at 4 months; weakness on the treated side in 5 patients, which persisted in 2 at 4 months; speech disturbance in 15 patients, which persisted in 3 at 4 months; facial weakness in 3 patients, which persisted in 1 at 4 months; and gait disturbance in 13 patients, which persisted in 2 at 4 months. In 6 patients in the active-treatment group, some of these deficits were present at 12 months.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FoG) is one of the most disabling yet poorly understood symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). FoG is an episodic gait pattern characterized by the inability to step that occurs on initiation or turning while walking, particularly with perception of tight surroundings. This phenomenon impairs balance, increases falls, and reduces the quality of life.\nClinical-anatomical correlations, electrophysiology, and functional imaging have generated several mechanistic hypotheses, ranging from the most distal (abnormal central pattern generators of the spinal cord) to the most proximal (frontal executive dysfunction). Here, we review the neuroanatomy and pathophysiology of gait initiation in the context of FoG, and we discuss targets of central nervous system neuromodulation and their outcomes so far. The PubMed database was searched using these key words: neuromodulation, freezing of gait, Parkinson's disease, and gait disorders.\nDespite these investigations, the pathogenesis of this process remains poorly understood. The evidence presented in this review suggests FoG to be a heterogenous phenomenon without a single unifying pathologic target. Future studies rigorously assessing targets as well as multimodal approaches will be essential to define the next generation of therapeutic treatments.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder requiring motor signs for diagnosis, but showing more widespread pathological alterations from its beginning. Compared to age-matched healthy individuals, patients with Parkinson's disease bear a 6-fold lifetime risk of dementia. For individualized counselling and treatment, prognostic biomarkers for assessing future cognitive deterioration in early stages of Parkinson's disease are needed. In a case-control study, 42 cognitively normal patients with Parkinson's disease were compared with 24 healthy control participants matched for age, sex and education. Tsallis entropy and band power of the \u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3-band were evaluated in baseline EEG at eyes-open and eyes-closed condition. As the \u03b8-band showed the most pronounced differences between Parkinson's disease and healthy control groups, further analysis focussed on this band. Tsallis entropy was then compared across groups with 16 psychological test scores at baseline and follow-ups at 6\u2009months and 3\u2009years. In group comparison, patients with Parkinson's disease showed lower Tsallis entropy than healthy control participants. Cognitive deterioration at 3\u2009years was correlated with Tsallis entropy in the eyes-open condition (",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment amongst Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is highly prevalent and associated with an increased risk of dementia. There is growing evidence that altered cerebrovascular functions contribute to cognitive impairment. Few studies have compared cerebrovascular changes in PD patients with normal and impaired cognition and those with mild-cognitive-impairment (MCI) without movement disorder. Here, we investigated arteriolar-cerebral-blood-volume (CBVa), an index reflecting the homeostasis of the most actively regulated segment in the microvasculature, using advanced MRI in various brain regions in PD and MCI patients and matched controls. Our goal is to find brain regions with altered CBVa that are specific to PD with normal and impaired cognition, and MCI-without-movement-disorder, respectively. In PD patients with normal cognition (n=10), CBVa was significantly decreased in the substantia nigra, caudate and putamen when compared to controls. In PD patients with impaired cognition (n=6), CBVa showed a decreasing trend in the substantia nigra, caudate and putamen, but was significantly increased in the presupplementary motor area and intracalcarine gyrus compared to controls. In MCI-patients-without-movement-disorder (n=18), CBVa was significantly increased in the caudate, putamen, hippocampus and lingual gyrus compared to controls. These findings provide important information for efforts towards developing biomarkers for the evaluation of potential risk of PD dementia (PDD) in PD patients. The current study is limited in sample size and therefore is exploratory in nature. The data from this pilot study will serve as the basis for power analysis for subsequent studies to further investigate and validate the current findings.",

However, neuromodulatory effects on kinetic and postural tremor in PD is less clear.\nWe present a 67-year-old PD patient with marked dissociative tremor response following pallidal neuromodulation. We observed excellent resting tremor suppression, but postural and kinetic tremors remained severe, requiring additional thalamic VIM stimulation for management.\nOur findings illustrate the phenotypical differences in PD and differential response to diverse tremor characteristics with distinctive stimulation targets. Additional studies are necessary to understand these differences.",

    "abstract": "Leg rigidity is associated with frequent falls in people with Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting a potential role in functional balance and gait impairments. Changes in the neural state due to secondary tasks, e.g., activation maneuvers, can exacerbate (or \"activate\") rigidity, possibly increasing the risk of falls. However, the subjective interpretation and coarse classification of the standard clinical rigidity scale has prohibited the systematic, objective assessment of resting and activated leg rigidity. The pendulum test is an objective diagnostic method that we hypothesized would be sensitive enough to characterize resting and activated leg rigidity. We recorded kinematic data and electromyographic signals from rectus femoris and biceps femoris during the pendulum test in 15 individuals with PD, spanning a range of leg rigidity severity. From the recorded data of leg swing kinematics, we measured biomechanical outcomes including first swing excursion, first extension peak, number and duration of the oscillations, resting angle, relaxation index, maximum and minimum angular velocity. We examined associations between biomechanical outcomes and clinical leg rigidity score. We evaluated the effect of increasing rigidity through activation maneuvers on biomechanical outcomes. Finally, we assessed whether either biomechanical outcomes or changes in outcomes with activation were associated with a fall history. Our results suggest that the biomechanical assessment of the pendulum test can objectively quantify parkinsonian leg rigidity. We found that the presence of high rigidity during clinical exam significantly impacted biomechanical outcomes, i.e., first extension peak, number of oscillations, relaxation index, and maximum angular velocity. No differences in the effect of activation maneuvers between groups with clinically assessed low rigidity were observed, suggesting that activated rigidity may be independent of resting rigidity and should be scored as independent variables. Moreover, we found that fall history was more common among people whose rigidity was increased with a secondary task, as measured by biomechanical outcomes. We conclude that different mechanisms contributing to resting and activated rigidity may play an important yet unexplored functional role in balance impairments. The pendulum test may contribute to a better understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying motor symptoms in PD, evaluating the efficacy of treatments, and predicting the risk of falls.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common neurodegenerative disorders worldwide, with age being their major risk factor. The increasing worldwide life expectancy, together with the scarcity of available treatment choices, makes it thus pressing to find the molecular basis of AD and PD so that the causing mechanisms can be targeted. To study these mechanisms, gene expression profiles have been compared between diseased and control brain tissues. However, this approach is limited by mRNA expression profiles derived for brain tissues highly reflecting their degeneration in cellular composition but not necessarily disease-related molecular states. We therefore propose to account for cell type composition when comparing transcriptomes of healthy and diseased brain samples, so that the loss of neurons can be decoupled from pathology-associated molecular effects. This approach allowed us to identify genes and pathways putatively altered systemically and in a cell-type-dependent manner in AD and PD brains. Moreover, using chemical perturbagen data, we computationally identified candidate small molecules for specifically targeting the profiled AD/PD-associated molecular alterations. Our approach therefore not only brings new insights into the disease-specific and common molecular etiologies of AD and PD but also, in these realms, foster the discovery of more specific targets for functional and therapeutic exploration.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Studies on the routine clinical use of dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging have largely been conducted in Europe and the United States. In this real-world study, we investigated the use of cerebral 99mTc-TRODAT-1 SPECT imaging of DAT in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) at a tertiary hospital in Brazil. MATERIAL AND METHODS We included 119 patients with suspected PD or clinically unclear parkinsonism who underwent brain scintigraphy with 99mTc-TRODAT-1 during a 3-year period. Additionally, a brief interview was conducted with the physician who requested the scan to determine the usefulness of the method in clinical decision-making. RESULTS Regarding the scan requests, most were intended to evaluate or confirm dopaminergic denervation (69%), distinguish PD from essential tremor (10%), or distinguish degenerative parkinsonism from drug-induced parkinsonism (6%). Data analysis showed that scintigraphy with 99mTc-TRODAT-1 was useful in 85% of cases, changing the management of 75% of the patients who underwent a scan. The majority of physicians who requested the scan were neurologists, and 54% were self-reported movement disorder specialists. An inappropriate use of DAT imaging was seen in 5% of cases. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that brain scintigraphy with the DAT ligand 99mTc-TRODAT-1 may influence diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, meaning that Brazilian physicians who requested the exam have taken in vivo DAT results into account at the time of clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Assessing postural stability in Parkinson's disease (PD) often relies on measuring the stepping response to an imposed postural perturbation. The standard clinical technique relies on a brisk backwards pull at the shoulders by the examiner and judgement by a trained rater. In research settings, various quantitative measures and perturbation directions have been tested, but it is unclear which metrics and perturbation direction differ most between people with PD and controls.\n(1) Use standardized forward vs. backward perturbations of a support surface to evaluate reactive stepping performance between PD and control participants. (2) Evaluate the utility of using principal components analysis to capture the dynamics of the reactive response and differences between groups.\nSixty-two individuals participated (40\u202fmild-to-moderate PD, off medication). Standardized rapid translations of the support surface were applied, requiring at least one step, backward or forward, to restore balance. The number of steps taken and the projection of the first principal component (PC1) of the center of pressure (COP) time series were entered in linear repeated-measures mixed effect models.\nForward falls required significantly fewer steps to recover than backward falls. PC1 captured more than half of the variance in the COP trajectory. Analysis of the PC1 projection revealed a significant interaction effect of group (PD vs. controls) by direction, such that there was a group difference in forward stepping, but not backward.\nForward reactive stepping in PD differed from controls more than backward-stepping. PC1 projections of the COP trajectory capture the dynamics of the postural response and differ between PD and controls.",

    "abstract": "The most common features of Parkinson's disease (PD) are motor impairments, but many patients also present depression and memory impairment. Ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been shown to be effective in patients with treatment-resistant major depression. Thus, the present study evaluated the action of ketamine on memory impairment and depressive-like behavior in an animal model of PD. Male Wistar rats received a bilateral infusion of 6 \u03bcg/side 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Short-term memory was evaluated by the social recognition test, and depressive-like behaviors were evaluated by the sucrose preference and forced swimming tests (FST). Drug treatments included vehicle (i.p., once a week); ketamine (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, i.p., once a week); and imipramine (20 mg/kg, i.p., daily). The treatments were administered 21 days after the SNc lesion and lasted for 28 days. The SNc lesion impaired short-term social memory, and all ketamine doses reversed the memory impairment and anhedonia (reduction of sucrose preference) induced by 6-OHDA. In the FST, 6-OHDA increased immobility, and all doses of ketamine and imipramine reversed this effect. The anti-immobility effect of ketamine was associated with an increase in swimming but not in climbing, suggesting a serotonergic effect. Ketamine and imipramine did not reverse the 6-OHDA-induced reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry in the SNc. In conclusion, ketamine reversed depressive-like behaviors and short-term memory impairment in rats with SNc bilateral lesions, indicating a promising profile for its use in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "The progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) correlates with rupture of lysosome in Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been found that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) has been attributed to the regulation of metabolic pathways and neuroprotective effect. In the present study, we showed in a mouse model that 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) caused lysosomal damage and DA neurons loss in the SNpc. MPTP only induced SP1-mediated TIGAR upregulation in the early stage of neurotoxin-induced pathology, and this compensatory mechanism was not enough to maintain normal lysosomal function. MPTP significantly decreased the levels of NADPH and GSH, and the effects were ameliorated by the expression of exogenous TIGAR but execerbated by knockdown of TIAGR. TIGAR or NADPH alleviated oxidative stress, rescued lysosomal dysfunction and attenuated DA neurons degeneration. Overexpression of TIGAR or NADPH supplement inhibited MPP",

    "abstract": "Acute cardiovascular exercise has shown to promote neuroplastic processes supporting the consolidation of newly acquired motor skills in healthy adults. First results suggest that this concept may be transferred to populations with motor and cognitive dysfunctions. In this context, Parkinson's disease (PD) is highly relevant since patients demonstrate deficits in motor learning. Hence, in the present study we sought to explore the effect of a single post-practice exercise bout on motor memory consolidation in PD. For this purpose, 17 patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr: 1 - 2.5, age: 60.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9 y) practiced a whole-body skill followed by either (i) a moderate-intense bout of cycling, or (ii) seated rest for a total of 30\u00a0min. The motor skill required the participants to balance on a tiltable platform (stabilometer) for 30\u00a0s. During skill practice, participants performed 15 trials followed by a retention test 1\u00a0day and 7\u00a0days later. We calculated time in balance (platform within\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00b0 from horizontal) for each trial and within- and between-group differences in memory consolidation (i.e. offline learning\u00a0=\u00a0skill change from last acquisition block to retention tests) were analyzed.

    "abstract": "What specific attributes of exercise programs influence the preferences of people with Parkinson's disease for additional exercise compared with their current practice? What trade-offs are participants willing to make between exercise program attributes?\nDiscrete choice experiment.\nFive hundred and forty people with Parkinson's disease.\nParticipants decided whether they would adopt a hypothetical program in addition to their current exercise routine.\nExercise program attributes included: type, number of sessions/week, location, travel time/session, delivery mode, supervisor's expertise, extent of supervision, benefits for physical and psychological function and out-of-pocket cost/session.\nParticipants preferred additional exercise when programs: provided physical (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.13) or psychological (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.67) benefit, involved less travel time (ORs 1.50 to 2.02) and were supervised by qualified professionals with Parkinson's disease expertise (ORs 1.51 to 1.91). Participants were most willing to add multimodal exercise to their exercise routine (ORs 2.01 to 2.19). Participants were less likely to prefer higher cost programs (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.71, per AU$10 cost increase) or group sessions compared to individual sessions (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.96). Men preferred adding strengthening exercises (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.26) and women had a preference against adding aerobic exercise (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.73). Participants not currently exercising were more likely to prefer adding exercise compared with those already exercising 300 minutes weekly (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.63).\nPeople with Parkinson's disease were more willing to participate in exercise programs that cost less, involve less travel, provide physical or psychological benefits and are supervised by qualified professionals. To enable more people with Parkinson's disease to exercise, health services should provide programs addressing these factors and account for sex differences.",

Our aim was to analyze the opinion of different Parkinson's disease experts about the STAT-ON\u2122 tool after using the device in a real clinical practice setting (RCPS).\nSTAT-ON\u2122 was provided by the Company Sense4Care to Spanish neurologists for using it in a RCPS. Each neurologist had the device for at least three months and could use it in PD patients at his/her own discretion. In February 2020, a survey with 30 questions was sent to all participants.\nTwo thirds of neurologists (53.8% females; mean age 44.9\u00b19 years old) worked in a Movement Disorders Unit, the average experience in PD was 16\u00b16.9 years, and 40.7% of them had previously used other devices. A total of 119 evaluations were performed in 114 patients (range 2-9 by neurologist; mean 4.5\u00b12.3). STAT-ON\u2122 was considered \"quite\" to \"very useful\" by 74% of the neurologists with an overall opinion of 6.9\u00b11.7 (0, worst; 10, best).

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) develops due to oxidative stress, mitochondrial aberrations, posttranslational modification, and \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) aggregation. The \u03b1-synucleinopathy is attributed to phosphorylation and aggregation of \u03b1-Syn. A strategy to degrade or reduce phosphorylated protein paves the way to develop PD therapy. Hence, the neuroprotective efficiency of PP2A (Protein phosphatase 2) activator FTY720, loaded chitosan nanoformulation has been evaluated in vitro and ex vivo experimental PD models. Bio-compatible chitosan-based nanocarriers have been utilized to enhance the bio-availability and neuroprotective effect of FTY720. The neuroprotective effect of characterized nanoformulation was determined by the downregulation of PD hallmark phospho-serine 129 (pSer129) \u03b1-Syn, with anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory potentials. The neuroprotective mechanism uncovered novel physical interaction of PP2A and polycomb group of protein Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 to mediate ubiquitination and degradation of agglomerated pSer129 \u03b1-Syn. Indeed, this study establishes the neuroprotective potential of chitosan based FTY720 nanoformulations by PP2A mediated epigenetic regulation for PD prevention.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is considered to be the fastest growing neurological disorder in the world. Patients with PD are hospitalised more frequently, have longer admissions and experience more complications during hospitalisation than age-matched control groups. The incorrect timing of levodopa administration and prescription of contraindicated antidopaminergic drugs are the most important risk factors for motor function deterioration during hospital admission, and have been associated with longer hospital stays and even increased mortality. Despite their crucial role in pharmacotherapy, little attention has been paid to the perspective of hospital pharmacists. The objective of this study was to identify key issues in the pharmacotherapeutic management of inpatients with PD by the implementation of a national Spanish survey specifically designed to analyse the perspective of hospital pharmacists.\nAn internet-based questionnaire covering the following areas was designed: hospital and participant characteristics, drug formulary, medication compliance and reconciliation, protocols and contraindicated drugs and areas for improvement.\nA total of 76 pharmacists from 59 hospitals answered the survey. Some weaknesses were identified in the availability of drugs: (1) pharmacy services closed at certain times (86.4%); (2) low variety of antiparkinsonian drugs (18.4% store >21 different drugs); (3) delay in antiparkinsonian drug administration if unavailable (>12 hours in 39.5% of cases); (4) lack of flexibility in administration times; (5) low availability of transdermal rotigotine and subcutaneous apomorphine (<50%). The participants ranked highly the designing of specific protocols for patients with PD and implementation of concrete actions to optimise PD inpatient pharmacotherapy.\nThe participants detected some improvement opportunities and proposed realistic and applicable recommendations and strategies aiming to enhance the safety of patients with PD. Protocols for antiparkinsonian drug interchange, administration timing and nil by mouth status, medication reconciliation, and handling nausea/vomiting or psychotic symptoms are considered the main improvement areas.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa-Carbidopa Intrajejunal gel (LCIG) infusion is an effective intervention for people with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Although age may not be a limiting factor for LCIG implant, no data are available on late elderly PD (LE-PD) subjects. In this cross-sectional, we aimed to demonstrate if older age may impact on quality of life (QoL), motor and non-motor symptoms severity, and profile of side effects\u00a0in PD treated with LCIG.\nOut of 512 PD subjects treated with LCIG at 9 Italian PD centers, we selected 25 LE-PD defined as age\u2009\u2265\u200980\u00a0years at last follow-up who were available to attend the study visit. Twenty-five PD patients (Control-PD, defined as age\u2009<\u200975\u00a0years at last follow-up) matched to LE-PD by disease and LCIG duration served as control group. The following motor and non-motor variables were ascertained: quality of life (PDQ-8), time spent in ON, wearing-off Questionnaire, Unified PD Rating Scale, freezing of gait questionnaire, Parkinson's disease sleep scale-2, Non Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), and MOCA.\nNo statistically significant differences were found between LE-PD and Control-PD on PDQ-8 and several motor and non-motor variables. LE-PD had less frequent and milder impulsive-compulsive behaviors and milder dyskinesia. At multivariable regression, worse quality of life was associated with UPDRS-III and NMSS scores but not to age at study visit and age at LICG implant. Rate of adverse effects was similar in both groups. Drop-out rate calculated in the whole PD cohort was comparable between the two groups.\nOur data provide evidence that valuable LCIG infusion might be achieved in late elderly PD.",

Recently, applications to the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease have become very promising by considering different statistical regression models. However, well-known statistical regression models may give misleading results for the diagnosis of the neurodegenerative diseases when experimental data contain outlier observations that lie an abnormal distance from the other observation. The main achievements of this study consist of a novel mathematics-supported approach beside statistical regression models to identify and treat the ",

    "abstract": "The netrin-1/DCC ligand/receptor pair has key roles in central nervous system (CNS) development, mediating axonal, and neuronal navigation. Although expression of netrin-1 and DCC is maintained in the adult brain, little is known about their role in mature neurons. Notably, netrin-1 is highly expressed in the adult substantia nigra, leading us to investigate a role of the netrin-1/DCC pair in adult nigral neuron fate. Here, we show that silencing netrin-1 in the adult substantia nigra of mice induces DCC cleavage and a significant loss of dopamine neurons, resulting in motor deficits. Because loss of adult dopamine neurons and motor impairments are features of Parkinson's disease (PD), we studied the potential impact of netrin-1 in different animal models of PD. We demonstrate that both overexpression of netrin-1 and brain administration of recombinant netrin-1 are neuroprotective and neurorestorative in mouse and rat models of PD. Of interest, we observed that netrin-1 levels are significantly reduced in PD patient brain samples. These results highlight the key role of netrin-1 in adult dopamine neuron fate, and the therapeutic potential of targeting netrin-1 signaling in PD.",

    "abstract": "The expanding power and accessibility of personal technology provide an opportunity to reduce burdens and costs of traditional clinical site-centric therapeutic trials in Parkinson's disease and generate novel insights. The value of this approach has never been more evident than during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to (1) establish and implement the infrastructure for longitudinal, virtual follow-up of clinical trial participants, (2) compare changes in smartphone-based assessments, online patient-reported outcomes, and remote expert assessments, and (3) explore novel digital markers of Parkinson's disease disability and progression.\nParticipants from two recently completed phase III clinical trials of inosine and isradipine enrolled in Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of Parkinson's Disease trials (AT-HOME PD), a two-year virtual cohort study. After providing electronic informed consent, individuals complete annual video visits with a movement disorder specialist, smartphone-based assessments of motor function and socialization, and patient-reported outcomes online.\nFrom the two clinical trials, 226 individuals from 42 states in the United States and Canada enrolled. Of these, 181 (80%) have successfully downloaded the study's smartphone application and 161 (71%) have completed patient-reported outcomes on the online platform.\nIt is feasible to conduct a large-scale, international virtual observational study following the completion of participation in brick-and-mortar clinical trials in Parkinson's disease. This study, which brings research to participants, will compare established clinical endpoints with novel digital biomarkers and thereby inform the longitudinal follow-up of clinical trial participants and design of future clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "This article is to investigate the effect of piperine on the small intestine of mice with Parkinson's disease with dementia(PDD). Ninety-six C57 BL/6 mice of SPF grade were randomly divided into 8 groups(male, 12 in each group): normal group, model group, autophagy inhibitor group(6-amino-3-methylpurine, 3 MA, 30 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)), autophagy activator group(rapamycin, 1 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)), low, medium, and high dose piperine groups(10, 20, 40 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)), and medopar group(112.5 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)). Except for the normal group, mice in each group were injected subcutaneously with reserpine(0.1 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)) once every 48 hours for 40 days. In addition, on the 20 th day of administration, except for the normal group, the mice in the other groups were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion to finally prepare PDD models. At the same time, each group was given the corresponding drug treatment once a day for 40 days. After the last administration, the behavioral changes of mice were observed by autonomic activity experiment and hot plate experiment. The expression levels of \u03b1-synuclein(\u03b1-syn) and tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) in the small intestine were detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of beclin-1, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 B(LC3 B) and p62 in the small intestine were detected by immunofluorescence assay. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the pathological morphology of small intestine tissues in each group. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was adopted for detection of \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein(APP), p-tau, acetylcholine transferase(ChAT), interleukin-6(IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1(TNF-\u03b1) in small intestine. Real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of \u03b1-syn, TH, beclin-1, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3(LC3), and p62 mRNA and mmu-miR-99 a-5 p in the small intestine. The results of this study showed that, as compared with the model group, the number of activities, the expression levels of ChAT, TH, and p62 were significantly increased in the 3 MA group, the various piperine dose groups, and the medopar group(P&lt;0.05), and their first foot licking time was shortened; APP, p-tau, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, \u03b1-syn, beclin-1, LC3 B and mmu-miR-99 a-5 p expression levels were significantly reduced(P&lt;0.05). However, as compared with the model group, the number of activities, ChAT, TH, and p62 expression levels in the rapamycin group were significantly reduced(P&lt;0.05), and the APP, p-tau, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, \u03b1-syn, beclin-1, LC3 B and mmu-miR-99 a-5 p expression levels were significantly increased(P&lt;0.05). As compared with the 3 MA group, the number of activities, ChAT, TH, and p62 expression levels were significantly reduced in the low and medium dose piperine groups and rapamycin group(P&lt;0.05); howe-ver, their first foot licking time was significantly prolonged, APP, p-tau, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, \u03b1-syn, beclin-1, LC3 B and mmu-miR-99 a-5 p expression levels were increased significantly(P&lt;0.05). As compared with the medopar group, the number of activities, ChAT, TH, and p62 expression levels were significantly reduced in low dose piperine group and rapamycin group(P&lt;0.05), but their first foot licking time was significantly extended, and APP, p-tau, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, \u03b1-syn, beclin-1, LC3 B and mmu-miR-99 a-5 p expression levels were significantly increased(P&lt;0.05). In addition, as compared with the normal group, the small intestinal epithelial cells of the model group and the rapamycin group were shed off a lot, with severe damages of intestinal mucosa as well as edema and shedding of the small intestine villi. After administration of the therapeutic interventions, the small intestinal epithelial cells of the 3 MA group, each dose group of piperine, and the medopa group were slightly damaged and the villi were slightly shed off. In summary, piperine has a protective effect on the small intestine of PDD model mice, showing reduced expression of mmu-miR-99 a-5 p, pro-inflammatory factors and autophagy factors, and the mechanism of slowing PDD pathological symptoms may be related to the inhibition of autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Compared to other neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease (PD) is distinctive in terms of marked symptomatic variability and prognosis, as well as for the wide variety of symptomatic treatment options. Despite several decades of advances in medications and neurosurgical approaches, there remains an unmet need for symptomatic motor control. Better control of tremor, gait and balance, posture, dexterity, and communication skills are major challenges for better therapeutics of the PD movement disorder. Non-motor symptoms (NMS), which often precede motor impairments, add complexity to the burden of PD and its management. Recognized by James Parkinson MD two centuries ago, and despite 21st century neurological advances, a range of NMS plague the patient's journey, from prodromal to palliative stages. Characterizing the clinical phenotype of the entire non-motor profile of PD is challenging. Further research and understanding are needed for discovering biomarkers of certain NMS, such as dementia, fatigue, pain, sleep, and apathy. More work is needed to gather a robust evidence base for guiding treatment of troubling NMS, which exert a major impact on quality of life for people with PD and their caregivers.",

While these treatments are initially highly effective, with long-term use and disease progression, the therapeutic response is often limited by the development of motor complications, dopaminergic side effects, and residual unresponsive motor and non-motor symptoms. An alternative or additive treatment approach may be to target non-dopaminergic receptors within the motor control pathways, which function to modulate basal ganglia output. Adenosine A",

    "abstract": "Executive dysfunction and risk of falling are hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is unclear how executive dysfunction predisposes people with PD to falling.\nTo: (i) identify sensorimotor, balance, and cardiovascular risk factors for falls that discriminate between those with normal executive function and those with mild and marked executive dysfunction in people with PD and (ii) determine whether mild and marked executive dysfunction are significant risk factors for falls when adjusting for PD duration and severity and freezing of gait (FOG).\nUsing the Frontal Assessment Battery, 243 participants were classified into normal executive function (n\u202f=\u202f87), mild executive dysfunction (n\u202f=\u202f100), and marked executive dysfunction (n\u202f=\u202f56) groups. Participants were asked if they had episodes of FOG in the last month and were assessed with the Movement Disorders Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), the Hoehn and Yahr Scale, the physiological profile assessment, and tests of orthostatic hypotension, coordinated stability, and gait and were then followed-up prospectively for falls for 32-52 weeks.\nSeveral PD-specific (elevated Hoehn and Yahr stage, higher MDS-UPDRS scale scores, a history of FOG, Postural Instability and Gait Difficulty subtype, and longer PD duration), sensorimotor (poor vision, knee extension weakness, slow simple reaction time), and balance (greater postural sway and poor controlled leaning balance) factors discriminated among the normal executive function and mild and marked executive dysfunction groups. Fall rates (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD) differed significantly among the groups (normal executive function: 1.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.7; mild executive dysfunction: 2.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.2; marked executive dysfunction: 4.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.3) with the presence of both mild and marked executive dysfunction identified as significant risk factors for falls when adjusting for three measures of PD severity (Hoehn and Yahr scale scores, disease duration, and FOG).\nSeveral PD-specific, sensorimotor, and balance factors differed significantly among the normal, mild, and marked executive dysfunction groups and both mild and marked executive dysfunction were identified as independent risk factors for falls in people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine D2-like receptors - mainly dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) and dopamine D3 receptors (D3R) - are believed to be greatly involved in the pathology of Parkinson disease (PD) progression. However, these receptors have not been precisely examined in PD patients. Our aim was to quantitatively calculate the exact densities of dopamine D1 receptors (D1R), D2R, and D3R in control, Alzheimer disease (AD), and Lewy body disease (LBD) patients (including PD, Dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson disease dementia); and analyze the relationship between dopamine receptors and clinical PD manifestations.\nWe analyzed the densities of D1R, D2R, and D3R in the striatum and substantia nigra (SN) using a novel quantitative autoradiography procedure previously developed by our group. We also examined the expression of D2R and D3R mRNA in the striatum by in situ hybridization.\nThe results showed that although no differences of striatal D1R were found among all groups; D2R was significantly decreased in the striatum of PD patients when compared with control and AD patients. Some clinical manifestations: age of onset, PD stage, dopamine responsiveness, and survival time after onset; showed a better correlation with striatal D1R\u00a0+\u00a0D3R densities combined compared to D1R or D3R alone.\nThere is a possibility that we may infer the results in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of PD by detecting D1R\u00a0+\u00a0D3R as opposed to using dopamine D1 or D3 receptors alone. This is especially true for elderly patients with low D2R expression as is common in this disease.",

    "abstract": "Cancer and neurodegeneration are two major leading causes of morbidity and death worldwide. At first sight, the two fields do not seem to share much in common and, if anything, might be placed on opposite ends of a spectrum. Although neurodegeneration results in excessive neuronal cell death, cancer emerges from increased proliferation and resistance to cell death. Therefore, one might expect significant differences in the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. However, the more we deepen our understanding of these two types of diseases, the more we appreciate the unexpected overlap between them. Although most epidemiological studies support an inverse association between the risk for development of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, increasing evidence points to a positive correlation between specific types of cancer, like melanoma, and neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's disease (PD). We believe that deciphering the molecular processes and pathways underlying one of these diseases may significantly increase our understanding about the other. Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches in cancer, may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of neurodegeneration, and vice versa. In this Viewpoint, we summarize recent findings connecting both diseases and speculate that insights from one disease may inform on mechanisms, and help identify novel biomarkers and targets for intervention, possibly leading to improved management of both diseases. \u00a9 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex and widespread neurodegenerative disease characterized by depletion of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Key issues are the development of therapies that can stop or reverse the disease progression, identification of dependable biomarkers, and better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of PD. RhoA-ROCK signals appear to have an important role in PD symptoms, making it a possible approach for PD treatment strategies. Activation of RhoA-ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase) appears to stimulate various PD risk factors including aggregation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn), dysregulation of autophagy, and activation of apoptosis. This manuscript reviews current updates about the biology and function of the RhoA-ROCK pathway and discusses the possible role of this signaling pathway in causing the pathogenesis of PD. We conclude that inhibition of the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway may have high translational potential and could be a promising therapeutic target in PD.",

    "abstract": "Anticipatory eye movement promotes cranio-caudal sequencing during walking turns. Clinical groups, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), do not produce anticipatory eye movements, leading to increased risk of falls. Visual cues may promote anticipatory eye movement by guiding the eyes into the turn. This study examined if visual cues could train anticipatory eye movement. Ten neurotypical young adults and 6 adults with PD completed three blocks of walking trials. Trials were blocked by visual condition: non-cued baseline turns (5 trials), visually cued turns (10 trials), and non-cued post turns (5 trials). A Delsys Trigno (Delsys, Boston, MA) recorded horizontal saccades at 1024 Hz via electrooculography (EOG). Two Optotrak cameras (Northern Digital Inc., ON, Canada) captured body segment kinematics at 120 Hz. Initiation of segment rotation with respect to ipsilateral foot contact (IFC1) prior to the turn was calculated. Neurotypical young adults (NYA) produced typical cranio-caudal rotation sequences during walking turns. Eyes led (407 ms prior to IFC1), followed by the head (50 ms prior to IFC1), then trunk and pelvis. In contrast, PD produced no anticipatory eye or segment movement at baseline. During pre-trials the eyes moved 96 ms after IFC1 and segment movement was initiated by the pelvis followed by trunk and head segments. After visual cue training however, PD produced anticipatory eye movements 161 ms prior to IFC1, followed by the head 88 ms following IFC1 but ahead of trunk and pelvis onset. These results suggest visual cues assist in producing cranio-caudal control during walking turns in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease. Five to ten percent of patients have monogenic form of the disease, while most of sporadic PD cases are caused by the combination of genetic and environmental factors. Microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) has been appointed as one of the most important risk factors for several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. MAPT is characterized by an inversion in chromosome 17 resulting in two distinct haplotypes H1 and H2. Studies described a significant association of MAPT H1j subhaplotype with PD risk, while H2 haplotype was associated with Parkinsonism, particularly to its bradykinetic component. We report here an isolated case displaying an akinetic-rigid form of PD, with age of onset of 41 years and a good response to levodopa, who developed dementia gradually during the seven years of disease progression. The patient does not carry the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, copy number variations, nor pathogenic and rare variants in known genes associated with PD. MAPT subhaplotype genotyping revealed that the patient has the H1j/H2 diplotype, his mother H1j/H1j, his two healthy brothers H1j/H1v and his deceased father was by deduction H1v/H2. The H1j/H2 diplotype was shown in a total of 3 PD patients among 80, who also did not have known PD-causing mutation and in 1 out of 92 healthy individual controls. The three patients with this diplotype all have a similar clinical phenotype. Our results suggest that haplotypes H1j and H2 are strong risk factor alleles, and their combination could be responsible for early onset of PD with dementia.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies reported abnormal spontaneous neural activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI). However, the frequency-dependent neural activity in PD is largely unknown. Here, 35 PD patients and 35 age- and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent R-fMRI scanning to investigate abnormal spontaneous neural activity of PD using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) approach within the conventional band (typical band: 0.01-0.08 Hz) and specific frequency bands (slow-5: 0.010-0.027 Hz and slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz). Compared with HCs, PD patients exhibited increased ALFF in the parieto-temporo-occipital regions, such as the bilateral inferior temporal gyrus/fusiform gyrus (ITG/FG) and left angular gyrus/posterior middle temporal gyrus (AG/pMTG), and displayed decreased ALFF in the left cerebellum, right precuneus, and left postcentral gyrus/supramarginal gyrus (PostC/SMG) in the typical band. PD patients showed greater increased ALFF in the left caudate/putamen, left anterior cingulate cortex/medial superior frontal gyrus (ACC/mSFG), left middle cingulate cortex (MCC), right ITG, and left hippocampus, along with greater decreased ALFF in the left pallidum in the slow-5 band, whereas greater increased ALFF in the left ITG/FG/hippocampus accompanied by greater decreased ALFF in the precentral gyrus/PostC was found in the slow-4 band (uncorrected). Additionally, the left caudate/putamen was positively correlated with levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage, and disease duration. Our results suggest that PD is related to widespread abnormal brain activities and that the abnormalities of ALFF in PD are associated with specific frequency bands. Future studies should take frequency band effects into account when examining spontaneous neural activity in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by motor symptoms related to the deficiency in dopamine levels, and cognitive symptoms that are similar in nature to those manifested during Alzheimer's disease. Levosimendan, on the other hand, is a calcium sensitizer and phosphodiesterase inhibitor that was shown to possess neuroprotective, memoryenhancing, and anti-apoptotic properties.\nIn the current study, the possible protective effect of levosimendan was investigated in two animal models of Parkinson's disease.\nBoth intracerebral injection 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and the direct injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the substantia nigra were used as models to induce Parkinson's-like behavior. Levosimendan (12 \u03bcg/kg intraperitoneally once weekly) was started 7 days before or 2 days after lesioning of the animals. At day 14 post-lesioning, animals were subjected to apomorphine challenge, which was correlated with dopamine levels in the striatum and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive nigral cells.\nResults showed that levosimendan restored the number of rotations in the apomorphine challenge test, the levels of dopamine in the striatum, and the TH-positive nigral cells when administered 7 days before, but not two days after 6-OHDA lesioning. In the LPS model of PD, the number of rotations in the apomorphine challenge test, the levels of dopamine in the striatum, and the TH-positive nigral cells were restored when levosimendan was administered 7 days before as well as two days after lesioning.\nLevosimendan seems to provide a promising agent with potential clinical value for PD.",

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease, the most prevalent metabolic storage disorder, is caused by mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene GBA1, which lead to the accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in affected cells. Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1), although defined as a nonneuronopathic subtype, is accompanied by an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. To gain insights into the association of progressive accumulation of GlcCer and the Parkinson's disease phenotypes, we generated dopaminergic (DA) neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a GD1 patient and a healthy donor control, and measured GlcCer accumulation by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We tested two DA neuron differentiation methods: a well-established method that mimics a step-wise developmental process from iPSCs to neural progenitor cells, and to DA neurons; and a synthetic mRNA-based method that overexpresses a transcription factor in iPSCs. GD1-specific accumulation of GlcCer was detected after 60\u2009days of differentiation by the former method, whereas it was detected after only 10\u2009days by the latter method. With this synthetic mRNA-based rapid differentiation method, we found that the metabolic defect in GD1 patient cells can be rescued by the overexpression of wild-type GBA1 or the treatment with an inhibitor for GlcCer synthesis. Furthermore, we detected the increased phosphorylation of \u03b1-synuclein, a biomarker for Parkinson's disease, in DA neurons derived from a GD1 patient, which was significantly decreased by the overexpression of wild-type GBA1. These results suggest that synthetic mRNA-based method accelerates the analyses of the pathological mechanisms of Parkinson's disease in GD1 patients and possibly facilitates drug discovery processes.",

    "abstract": "Varying early survival rates have been reported across studies on patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we reported the 10-year relative survival rate of patients with PD using a nationwide database.\nThis was a population-based cohort study.\nWe identified incident PD cases from 2004 to 2006 using the PD registration codes from the National Health Insurance Service database covering the entire South Korean population.\nRelative survival up to 10\u00a0years was evaluated by adjusting all-cause survival for expected survival, estimated from population life tables and matched by sex, age, and year of diagnosis.\nOf the 10,159 patients with PD, 4675 (46.0%) patients survived 10\u00a0years after diagnosis. Relative survival rates decreased with time after diagnosis (0.972 after 1\u00a0year, 0.772 after 5\u00a0years, and 0.588 after 10\u00a0years). Ten-year relative survival gradually decreased with age at diagnosis. Men had a lower relative survival rate than women 2\u00a0years post diagnosis, and if they were older than 60\u00a0years.\nPatients diagnosed with PD are expected to have a lower 10-year relative survival. In the real world, patients with PD might have lower survival than the general population even in the early disease stage. Our results suggest further efforts to prevent premature mortality among patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Rehabilitation therapies are critical for optimizing quality-of-life and daily functions for individuals living with Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, understanding the patterns of and under what conditions physicians make rehabilitation referrals is important for optimizing care.\nWe analyzed data from 5020 participants (4 countries) collected from 1/3/2016 to 4/20/2018 as part of the Parkinson's Foundation Quality Improvement Initiative (PF QII).

    "abstract": "The quinone derivative of the non-psychotropic cannabinoid cannabigerol (CBG), so-called VCE-003.2, has been recently investigated for its neuroprotective properties in inflammatory models of Parkinson's disease (PD) in mice. Such potential derives from its activity at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3). In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective properties of VCE-003.2 against the parkinsonian neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), in comparison with two new CBG-related derivatives, the cannabigerolic acid quinone (CBGA-Q) and its sodium salt CBGA-Q-Salt, which, similarly to VCE-003.2, were found to be active at the PPAR-\u03b3 receptor, but not at the cannabinoid CB",

    "abstract": "Recent studies highlight the initiation of Parkinson's disease (PD) in the gastrointestinal tract, decades before the manifestations in the central nervous system (CNS). This gut-brain axis of neurodegenerative diseases defines the critical role played by the unique microbial composition of the \"second brain\" formed by the enteric nervous system (ENS). Compromise in the enteric wall can result in the translocation of gut-microbiota along with their metabolites into the system that can affect the homeostatic machinery. The released metabolites can associate with protein substrates affecting several biological pathways. Among these, the bacterial endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), has been implicated to play a definite role in progressive neurodegeneration. The molecular interaction of the lipid metabolites can have a direct neuro-modulatory effect on homeostatic protein components that can be transported to the CNS via the vagus nerve. \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) is one such partner protein, the molecular interactions with which modulate its overall fibrillation propensity in the system. LPS interaction has been shown to affect the protein's aggregation kinetics in an alternative inflammatory pathway of PD pathogenesis. Several other lipid contents from the bacterial membranes could also be responsible for the initiation of \u03b1-syn amyloidogenesis. The present review will focus on the intermolecular interactions of \u03b1-syn with bacterial lipid components, particularly LPS, with a definite clinical manifestation in PD pathogenesis. However, deconvolution of the sequence of interaction events from the ENS to its propagation in the CNS is not easy or obvious. Nevertheless, the characterization of these lipid-mediated structures is a step towards realizing the novel targets in the pre-emptive diagnoses of PD. This comprehensive description should prompt the correlation of potential risk of amyloidogenesis upon detection of specific paradigm shifts in the microbial composition of the gut.",

    "abstract": "Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is essential for axonal maintenance and reflects neuronal damage. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially exosomes, secreted by cells into the blood, are emerging as novel biomedical research platforms of physiological and pathological processes. The present study investigated the possible association between plasma EV NfL and Parkinson's disease (PD).\nOne hundred and sixteen patients with mild to moderate PD and 46 non-PD, neurological controls were recruited, and their clinical motor symptoms and cognitive function were evaluated. Plasma EVs were isolated using an exoEasy kit, and immunomagnetic reduction assay was used to assess EV NfL level. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0, and \nThe isolated plasma EVs were validated according to size and the presence of specific surface markers. Compared with the neurological control group, the levels of plasma EV NfL in patients with PD were not significantly different (PD: 9.42\u2009\u00b1\u20093.89, control: 9.53\u2009\u00b1\u20093.62\u2009pg/mL plasma, \nPlasma EV NfL levels did not distinguish patients with PD from the neurological control group. The possible correlation between plasma EV NfL with the severity of motor symptoms within the PD patients, especially with akinetic rigidity, was noted. Further clinical validation of the blood EV NfL by a longitudinal follow-up study of PD patients is warranted.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease, the excess of beta oscillations in cortical-basal ganglia (BG) circuits has been correlated with normal movement suppression. In this paper, a physiologically based resonance model, generalizing an earlier model of the STN-GPe circuit, is employed to analyze critical dynamics of the occurrence of beta oscillations, which correspond to Hopf bifurcation. With the experimentally measured parameters, conditions for the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation with time delay are deduced by means of linear stability analysis, center manifold theorem, and normal form analysis. It is found that beta oscillations can be induced by increasing synaptic transmission delay. Furthermore, it is revealed that the oscillations originate from interaction among different synaptic connections. Our analytical results are consistent with the previous experimental and simulating findings, thus may provide a more systematic insight into the mechanisms underlying the transient beta bursts.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. PD has been traditionally perceived as a motor disorder. However, it is frequently associated with pulmonary dysfunction which has been assessed by Spirometry, an effort-dependent technique.\nTo evaluate in patients with PD the effect of disease severity on respiratory impedance using Impulse Oscillometry (IOS) and to correlate with Spirometry.\nThe study was conducted on 30 patients diagnosed with PD. Pulmonary function was assessed by IOS and spirometer. IOS is an effort-independent technique that uses sound waves of different frequencies to measure airway resistance. Spirometer measures the lung volume and generates flow-volume and volume-time relationship.\nThe mean age of patients was 60.1\u00b19.45. Resistance at 5 Hz (R5) was found to be negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume in the first second of the FVC manoeuver (FEV\nIOS might be a promising tool for diagnosis of respiratory dysfunction in addition to Spirometry, especially in cases where patients are not able to perform forced manoeuvers.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with multiple comorbidities, including seborrheic dermatitis (SD), which develops in more than half of PD patients. SD in patients with PD can be severe and frequently intractable by traditional topical therapy. Cannabinoids possess anti-inflammatory and neuromodulatory properties working within the intrinsic endocannabinoid system, the activation of which may alleviate the motor symptoms of PD. The effect of cannabinoids on SD is unknown. Here we explore the pathophysiological mechanisms and possible therapeutic role of oral cannabinoids in PD patients with SD, and review speculative mechanisms underlying the association of PD and SD. Current data supporting the use of cannabinoids in both PD and SD, as well as oral cannabinoid safety and tolerability, are presented. Cannabinoids may provide the possibility of simultaneous treatment of both SD and PD. Specific SD studies and additional safety data on oral cannabinoids are needed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurological disorders, of insidious onset, with major motor symptomatology including bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity, and postural disturbances. Virtual reality (VR) and motor imagery (MI) are among the more innovative techniques for the rehabilitation of patients with PD which promote motor learning both through explicit and implicit processes. This study is unique in that it will examine the combined effects of VR and MI on motor function, balance and activities of daily living (ADLs) in patients with PD.\nThe aim of this work is to investigate the effects of VR with MI techniques in addition to routine physical therapy on motor function, balance, and ADLs in patients with PD.\nThis is a two-armed parallel design, single-blinded (assessor blinded), single-centered, randomized controlled trial, and the study protocol is based on SPIRIT guidelines. Thirty-four patients with PD (Modified Hoehn and Yahr stages I-III) will be randomly allocated with a 1:1 ratio into Group A (control group) and Group B (treatment group). Group A will be given routine physical therapy in 40-min sessions and 20 min of walking and cycling with a short period of rest, every alternate day (3 days per week) for 12 weeks, while for Group B routine physical therapy protocols along with VR and MI will be used in 60-min sessions, every alternate day (3 days per week) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measures are as follows: (i) the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS; part III), (ii) the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC). The secondary outcome measure is the UPDRS (part II). Assessments will be recorded at baseline, the sixth and twelfth weeks of therapy, and 1 month after the discontinuation of therapy. Clinical Study Registration: This randomized controlled prospective study was registered with the Iranian Registry of clinical trials (IRCT20200221046567N1) on April 1, 2020 (https://www.irct.ir/trial/46073).",

    "abstract": "Motor outcomes after subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) for Parkinson disease (PD) vary considerably among patients and strongly depend on stimulation location. The objective of this retrospective study was to map the regions of optimal STN DBS for PD using an atlas-independent, fully individualized (N-of-1) tissue activation modeling approach and to assess the relationship between patient-level therapeutic volumes of tissue activation (VTAs) and motor improvement.\nThe stimulation-induced electric field for 40 PD patients treated with bilateral STN DBS was modeled using finite element analysis. Neurostimulation models were generated for each patient, incorporating their individual STN anatomy, DBS lead position and orientation, anisotropic tissue conductivity, and clinical stimulation settings. A voxel-based analysis of the VTAs was then used to map the optimal location of stimulation. The amount of stimulation in specific regions relative to the STN was measured and compared between STNs with more and less optimal stimulation, as determined by their motor improvement scores and VTA. The relationship between VTA location and motor outcome was then assessed using correlation analysis. Patient variability in terms of STN anatomy, active contact position, and VTA location were also evaluated. Results from the N-of-1 model were compared to those from a simplified VTA model.\nTissue activation modeling mapped the optimal location of stimulation to regions medial, posterior, and dorsal to the STN centroid. These regions extended beyond the STN boundary towards the caudal zona incerta (cZI). The location of the VTA and active contact position differed significantly between STNs with more and less optimal stimulation in the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior directions. Therapeutic stimulation spread noticeably more in the dorsal and posterior directions, providing additional evidence for cZI as an important DBS target. There were significant linear relationships between the amount of dorsal and posterior stimulation, as measured by the VTA, and motor improvement. These relationships were more robust than those between active contact position and motor improvement. There was high variability in STN anatomy, active contact position, and VTA location among patients. Spherical VTA modeling was unable to reproduce these results and tended to overestimate the size of the VTA.\nAccurate characterization of the spread of stimulation is needed to optimize STN DBS for PD. High variability in neuroanatomy, stimulation location, and motor improvement among patients highlights the need for individualized modeling techniques. The atlas-independent, N-of-1 tissue activation modeling approach presented in this study can be used to develop and evaluate stimulation strategies to improve clinical outcomes on an individual basis.",

    "abstract": "In the current work, prolonged systemic delivery of apomorphine via buccal mucosa was shown to be a promising treatment for Parkinson's disease as a substitute for clinically utilized subcutaneous infusions. Due to extensive 'first-pass' metabolism, apomorphine is administered parenterally to bypass liver metabolism. Drawbacks of parenteral administration cause low patient compliance and adherence to treatment. On the other hand, while also bypassing the liver, delivery through buccal mucosa has a superior safety profile, is less costly, lacks pain and discomfort, and possesses excellent accessibility, overall augmenting patient compliance. Current in\u00a0vivo study in pigs showed: (1) steady plateau levels of apomorphine in plasma were obtained 30\u00a0min following administration and remained constant for 8\u00a0h until a delivery device was removed, (2) bioavailability of apomorphine was 55%-80% as opposed to <2% peroral and (3) simulation of the pharmacokinetic profile obtained in pigs predicted therapeutically relevant levels of apomorphine in human. Furthermore, antipyrine was incorporated as a permeation marker to enable mechanistic investigation of apomorphine release from the delivery device and its permeation through the buccal mucosa. In addition, limitations of an Ussing diffusion chamber as an ex\u00a0vivo research tool were also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a significant immune component, as demonstrated by changes in immune biomarkers in patients' biofluids. However, which specific cells are responsible for those changes is unclear because most immune biomarkers can be produced by various cell types.\nThe aim of this study was to explore monocyte involvement in PD.\nWe investigated the monocyte-specific biomarker sCD163, the soluble form of the receptor CD163, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum in two experiments, and compared it with other biomarkers and clinical data. Potential connections between CD163 and alpha-synuclein were studied in vitro.\nCSF-sCD163 increased in late-stage PD and correlated with the PD biomarkers alpha-synuclein, Tau, and phosphorylated Tau, whereas it inversely correlated with the patients' cognitive scores, supporting monocyte involvement in neurodegeneration and cognition in PD. Serum-sCD163 increased only in female patients, suggesting a sex-distinctive monocyte response. CSF-sCD163 also correlated with molecules associated with adaptive and innate immune system activation and with immune cell recruitment to the brain. Serum-sCD163 correlated with proinflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins, suggesting a relation to chronic systemic inflammation. Our in vitro study showed that alpha-synuclein activates macrophages and induces shedding of sCD163, which in turn enhances alpha-synuclein uptake by myeloid cells, potentially participating in its clearance.\nOur data present sCD163 as a potential cognition-related biomarker in PD and suggest a role for monocytes in both peripheral and brain immune responses. This may be directly related to alpha-synuclein's proinflammatory capacity but could also have consequences for alpha-synuclein processing. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

    "results": "CSF-sCD163 increased in late-stage PD and correlated with the PD biomarkers alpha-synuclein, Tau, and phosphorylated Tau, whereas it inversely correlated with the patients' cognitive scores, supporting monocyte involvement in neurodegeneration and cognition in PD. Serum-sCD163 increased only in female patients, suggesting a sex-distinctive monocyte response. CSF-sCD163 also correlated with molecules associated with adaptive and innate immune system activation and with immune cell recruitment to the brain. Serum-sCD163 correlated with proinflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins, suggesting a relation to chronic systemic inflammation. Our in vitro study showed that alpha-synuclein activates macrophages and induces shedding of sCD163, which in turn enhances alpha-synuclein uptake by myeloid cells, potentially participating in its clearance.",

    "abstract": "The aetiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still very controversial, with a peculiar lack of established risk factors or protective behavior.\nWe carried out a case-control study of 634 idiopathic PD patients admitted from 2011 to 2015 to two hospitals located in central Italy and 532 controls matched by hospital, gender and age (\u00b1 5 years). The study questionnaire included questions on host factors, family history, residence, occupation and lifestyle. Odds ratios (ORs) for PD and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with logistic regression, adjusting for actual and potential confounders.\nA lower OR was observed in females (0.74; 95%CI:0.58-0.96), while older age classes showed a constantly increased risk for PD (p<0.005) starting from the class 65-69 years. Subjects who reported a first degree relative affected by PD showed a borderline increase which was more evident in those enrolled in the urban center of Rome (OR = 1.65; 95%CI: 1.09-2.50). Significant reduction of the risk was associated to current smoking (OR = 0.48; 95%CI: 0.24-0.54), and to vegetables consumption (p<0.03), while borderline increases were associated to meat and cold cut consumption. Occupational activities classified according to ISCO-08 categories did not show increased risk, while higher ORs' were found for pilots and physicians.\nThe results from this study confirmed the higher risk of PD in males and in elderly, and the inverse association with smoking habit. The possible etiological role of familial clustering, dietary habit, and some job tasks is suggested.",

    "abstract": "Apathy, the loss of motivation, is a common problem in Parkinson's disease (PD) and often observed following deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the occurrence of apathy following STN DBS in literature. Relevant articles were searched in PubMed/Medline, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Web of Sciences electronic databases. Studies were included if they reported apathy scores pre- and post-DBS or the cross-sectional difference between PD patients receiving STN DBS and patients receiving medication only. Thirty-three articles were included in the meta-analyses from 6,658 screened articles by two authors independently. A total of 1,286 patients were included with a mean age (\u00b1standard deviation [SD]) of 58.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.5\u2009years and a disease duration of 11.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u2009years. The apathy score measured by means of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS), and the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) was significantly higher after DBS than pre-operatively (g = 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] =\u20090.19-0.48, P\u2009<\u20090.001). An equal, significant difference in severity of apathy was found between STN DBS and medication only (g = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.03-0.65; P = 0.004). Statistical heterogeneity was moderately high, but the effects stood strong after multiple analyses and were independent of tapering off dopaminergic medication. The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that apathy is increased after STN DBS compared to the pre-operative state and to medication only (systematic review registration number: PROSPERO CRD42019133932). \u00a9 2020 Universiteit van Amsterdam.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with pathological hallmarks including progressive neuronal loss from the substantia nigra pars compacta and \u03b1-synuclein intraneuronal inclusions, known as Lewy bodies. Although the etiology of PD remains elusive, mitochondrial damage has been established to take center stage in the pathogenesis of PD. Mitochondria are critical to cellular energy production, metabolism, homeostasis, and stress responses; the association with PD emphasizes the importance of maintenance of mitochondrial network integrity. To accomplish the pleiotropic functions, mitochondria are dynamic not only within their own network but also in orchestrated coordination with other organelles in the cellular community. Through physical contact sites, signal transduction, and vesicle transport, mitochondria and intracellular organelles achieve the goals of calcium homeostasis, redox homeostasis, protein homeostasis, autophagy, and apoptosis. Herein, we review the finely tuned interactions between mitochondria and surrounding intracellular organelles, with focus on the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes, and lysosomes. Participants that may contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms of PD will be highlighted in this review.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the symptoms of motor deficits and cognitive decline. There are a number of therapeutics available for the treatment of PD, but most of them suffer from serious side effects such as bradykinesia, dyskinesia and on-off effect. Therefore, despite the availability of these pharmacological agents, PD patients continue to have an inferior quality of life. This has warranted a need to look for alternate strategies and molecular targets. Recent evidence suggests the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels could be a potential target for the management of motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Though still in the preclinical stages, agents targeting these channels have shown immense potential in the attenuation of behavioral deficits and signaling pathways. In addition, these channels are known to be involved in the regulation of ionic homeostasis, which is disrupted in PD. Moreover, activation or inhibition of many of the TRP channels by calcium and oxidative stress has also raised the possibility of their paramount involvement in affecting the other molecular mechanisms associated with PD pathology. However, due to the paucity of information available and lack of specificity, none of these agents have gone into clinical trials for PD treatment. Considering their interaction with oxidative stress, apoptosis and excitotoxicity, TRP channels could be considered as a potential future target for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits are increasingly being recognized as a common trait in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to exert positive effects as an adjunctive therapy on motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide an overview of reported evidence on the efficacy of tDCS interventions in the treatment of cognitive impairments in PD. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine articles that were published in the past 10 years and that study the effects of tDCS on cognitive deficits in PD patients. The PubMed, Scopus and Scielo databases were searched. Eight tDCS studies involving 168 participants were included for the analysis. Our meta-analysis results showed that anodal tDCS (atDCS) had various levels or no evidence of effectiveness. In the pre-post stimulation analysis, a strong effect was reported for executive functions (pre-post: ",

    "abstract": "Research is increasingly focusing on gut inflammation as a contributor to Parkinson's disease (PD). Such gut inflammation is proposed to arise from a complex interaction between various genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, however these factors are under-characterized. This study investigated the association between PD and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes responsible for binding of bacterial metabolites and intestinal homeostasis, which have been implicated in intestinal infections or inflammatory bowel disease. A case-control analysis was performed utilizing the following cohorts: (i) patients from the Australian Parkinson's Disease Registry (APDR) (",

    "abstract": "Corticospinal tract impairment is no longer an absolute exclusion in the updated Movement Disorder Society Parkinson's disease criteria. Triple stimulation technique (TST) is an accurate method to quantitatively assess the integrity and impairment of corticospinal pathway in a variety of neurological diseases. This study aims to evaluate the corticospinal tract impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients using TST.\nTen PD patients, 19 multiple-system atrophy parkinsonian variant (MSA-P) patients, and 12 healthy controls (HC) were sequentially recruited in this study. Information of age, disease duration, pyramidal signs, and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage was obtained from all patients. The TST was assessed at right abductor digiti minimi for HCs and both sides for patients. The Chi-square test was used for categorical variables, and variance analysis was performed for continuous variables in comparing the difference among PD, MSA-P, and HC, plus the \nAll subjects were age and gender matched. There was no significant difference in disease duration (\nCorticospinal tract impairment is not a rare manifestation in PD and can be quantitatively evaluated with TST. The result needs to be verified in amplified sample.",

Indeed, syntactic and emotional language tasks have emerged as potential biomarkers of frontostriatal disturbances. However, relevant studies and models have typically considered these linguistic dimensions in isolation, overlooking the potential advantages of targeting multidimensional markers.

    "abstract": "The corpus callosum (CC) is an important feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) not only in motor but also in non-motor functions. However, CC is not a homogeneous component, and the damage of specific subsection may contribute to corresponding clinical deficit.\nThe objective of the study is to investigate the structural alterations of different callosal subsections cross-sectionally and longitudinally in PD and evaluate their relationships to clinical performance.\nThirty-nine PD patients who had been longitudinally reexamined and 82 normal controls (NC) were employed. According to their specific callosal-cortical connectivity, 3D CC was divided into five subsections (including prefrontal, premotor, motor, somatosensory, and temporal-parietal-occipital subsection). The fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and volume of whole CC and its subsections were computed and compared between groups. Regression model was constructed to explore the relationships between callosal structure and clinical performance.\nAt baseline, PD did not show any significant macro/microstructural difference compared with NC. During disease course, there was a decreased FA and increased MD of whole CC as well as its subsections (except temporal-parietal-occipital subsection), and the volume of motor subsection was decreased. Moreover, the FA of temporal-parietal-occipital subsection and volume of motor subsection were correlated with the mood domain at baseline, and the MD of somatosensory subsection was associated with the motor domain at follow-up.\nThe structure of CC and its connectivity-specific subsections remain preserved at a relatively early stage in PD and are progressively disrupted during disease course. Besides, different callosal subsections possess specific associations with clinical performance in PD.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest brain tumor. Its poor prognosis is due to cell heterogeneity, invasiveness, and high vascularization that impede an efficient therapeutic approach. In the past few years, several molecular links connecting GBM to neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) were identified at preclinical and clinical level. In particular, giving the increasing critical role that epigenetic alterations play in both GBM and NDDs, we deeply analyzed the role of miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs acting epigenetic modulators in several key biological processes. Specific miRNAs, transported by extracellular vesicles (EVs), act as intercellular communication signals in both diseases. In this way, miRNA-loaded EVs modulate GBM tumorigenesis, as they spread oncogenic signaling within brain parenchyma, and control the aggregation of neurotoxic protein (Tau, A\u03b2-amyloid peptide, and \u03b1-synuclein) in NDDs. In this review, we highlight the most promising miRNAs linking GBM and NDDs playing a significant pathogenic role in both diseases.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess whether brain volumes may affect the results of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Eighty-one consecutive patients with PD (male:female 40:41), treated with DBS between June 2012 and December 2017, were enrolled. Total and regional brain volumes were measured using automated brain volumetry (NeuroQuant). The Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor score quotient was used to assess changes in clinical outcome and compare the preoperative regional brain volume in patients categorized into the higher motor improvement and lower motor improvement groups based on changes in the postoperative scores. The study groups showed significant volume differences in multiple brain areas. In the higher motor improvement group, the anterior cingulate and\u00a0right thalamus showed high volumes after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. In the lower motor improvement group, the left caudate, paracentral, right primary sensory and left primary motor cortex showed high volume, but no area showed high volumes after FDR correction. Our data suggest that the effectiveness of DBS in patients with PD may be affected by decreased brain volume in different areas, including the cingulate gyrus and thalamus. Preoperative volumetry could help predict outcomes in patients with PD undergoing DBS.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a progressive degeneration of the central or peripheral nervous systems. A central role of the RNA metabolism has emerged in these diseases, concerning mRNAs processing and non-coding RNAs biogenesis. We aimed to identify possible common grounds or differences in the dysregulated pathways of AD, PD, and ALS. To do so, we performed RNA-seq analysis to investigate the deregulation of both coding and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in ALS, AD, and PD patients and controls (CTRL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A total of 293 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and 87 mRNAs were found in ALS patients. In AD patients a total of 23 DE genes emerged, 19 protein coding genes and four lncRNAs. Through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses, we found common affected pathways and biological processes in ALS and AD. In PD patients only five genes were found to be DE. Our data brought to light the importance of lncRNAs and mRNAs regulation in three principal neurodegenerative disorders, offering starting points for new investigations on deregulated pathogenic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the efficacy of transcutaneous tibial nerve home stimulation for overactive bladder (OAB) in women with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe current study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial. Home intervention was carried out and\u00a0assessments were conducted at a tertiary hospital in South Brazil. Women with PD and OAB symptoms were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: (1) stimulation and (2) sham. Both groups underwent intervention at home for 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at 12 weeks (end of intervention),\u00a030- and 90-day follow-up. The primary outcome was the mean reduction in the number of\u00a0urgency incontinence episodes, and secondary outcomes included daytime and nighttime urinary frequency, urinary urgency episodes, use of pad (reported in a 24-h bladder diary), OAB-V8 and\u00a0King's Health Questionnaire scores, and maintenance\u00a0of symptom relief after discontinuation of the intervention.\nIn total, 30 consecutive patients completed the study (15/group). The stimulation group showed a reduction in nighttime urinary frequency (0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6), urinary urgency (1.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2), urgency incontinence episodes (0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6), use of pads (1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2), and OAB-V8 (1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2)\u00a0and King's Health Questionnaire scores. In a 30-day and 90-day follow-up, 8 (53.3%) and 5 (33.3%) stimulation patients, respectively, reported full\u00a0maintenance of symptom relief after discontinuation of the intervention. Stimulation patients presented a statistically significant improvement of symptoms as compared with sham patients (p\u2009=\u2009.001).\nTranscutaneous tibial nerve home stimulation can be used in clinical practice as an effective nonpharmacological resource for the reduction of OAB symptoms in women with PD, and the resulting relief seems to persist\u00a0in the follow-up (30 and 90 days).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative movement disorders, for which there has been no effective treatments. To clarify the pathogenesis of PD, we constructed a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network based on the genome-wide RNA sequencing data. It was found that 92 RNAs were differentially expressed, including 50 mRNAs, 25 miRNAs and 17 lncRNAs, based on which a ceRNA network was constructed and evaluated from 4 aspects of number of nodes, topological coefficients, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality. The functional annotation and enrichment analysis suggested that 6 functional modules, particularly the peripheral nervous system development and toxin metabolic process, dominated the development of PD. To validate the assumption, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted basing on the genome-wide RNAs regardless whether they were differentially expressed or not. Consistently, the results revealed that dysregulation of MAG, HOXB3, MYRF and PLP1 led to metabolic disorders of sphingolipid and glutathione, which contributed to the pathogenesis of PD. Also, in-depth mining of previous literature confirmed a pivotal role of these dysregulated RNAs, which had been indicated to be potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers of PD. Overall, we constructed a ceRNA network based on the dysregulated mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs in PD, and the aberrant expression of MAG, HOXB3, MYRF and PLP1 caused metabolism disorder of sphingolipid and glutathione, and these genes are of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of PD.",

The identification of PD patients in an early phase is, however, crucial for developing disease-modifying drugs. The objective of our study is to investigate whether Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) of the Substantia nigra (SN) analyzed by machine learning algorithms (ML) can be used to identify PD patients.\nOur study proposes the use of computer-aided algorithms and a highly reproducible approach (in contrast to manually SN segmentation) to increase the reliability and accuracy of DTI metrics used for classification.\nThe results of our study do not confirm the feasibility of the DTI approach, neither on a whole-brain level, ROI-labelled analyses, nor when focusing on the SN only.\nOur study did not provide any evidence to support the hypothesis that DTI-based analysis, in particular of the SN, could be used to identify PD patients correctly.",

    "abstract": "Dementia in Parkinson's disease (PDD) is a common non-motor symptom of advanced disease, associated with pronounced neocortical cholinergic deficits due to neurodegeneration of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) and its cholinergic terminals. In advanced PD, patients often require advanced therapies such as infusion therapy or deep brain stimulation (DBS) to improve motor control. However, patients with associated dementia are commonly excluded from DBS because of potential deterioration of cognitive functions. Yet marked reductions in dopaminergic medication and the subsequent risk of side effects (e.g., cognitive decline, psychosis, delirium) suggest that critical re-consideration of DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) for advanced stages of PD and PDD is worthwhile. In this Phase 1b study, we will provide STN-DBS to a cohort of PDD patients with severe motor fluctuations and combine two additional electrodes for augmentative neurostimulation of the NBM.\nWe aim to include 12 patients with mild-to-moderately severe PDD who fulfill indication criteria regarding motor symptoms for STN-DBS. Eligible patients will undergo implantation of a neurostimulation system with bilateral electrodes in both the STN and NBM. After 12\u2009weeks of STN-DBS (visit 1/V1), participants will be randomized to receive either effective neurostimulation of the NBM (group 1) or sham stimulation of the NBM (group 2). NBM-DBS will be activated in all participants after 24\u2009weeks of blinded treatment (visit 2/V2). The primary outcome will be the safety of combined bilateral STN- and NBM-DBS, determined by spontaneously-reported adverse events. Other outcome measures will comprise changes on scales evaluating cognition, activities of daily living functioning and clinical global impression, as well as motor functions, mood, behavior, caregiver burden and health economic aspects, and several domain-specific cognitive tests. Changes in scores (V1 - V2) for both treatment arms will undergo analysis of covariances, with baseline scores as covariates.\nThe feasibility and safety of combined STN-NBM-DBS in patients with PDD will be assessed to determine whether additional NBM-DBS improves or slows the progression of cognitive decline. Positive results would provide a basic concept for future studies evaluating the efficacy of NBM-DBS in larger PDD cohorts. Indirectly, proof-of-safety of STN-DBS in PDD might influence patient selection for this standard treatment option in advanced PD.\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT number): NCT02589925.",

    "abstract": "\"Printed by Parkinson's\" is an innovative project with the main aim to raise awareness for the many aspects of Parkinson's disease and their implication for everyday life. In a cooperation of Innocean Worldwide GmbH and the Movement Disorder and Neuromodulation Section, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, design and medical and neuroscientific expertise were combined to create unique artworks: Bronze sculptures were created when combining personal objects selected by each patient, and their neurophysiological individual health data. As a core element, patient interviews in an accompanying film shed light on the personal stories behind the art objects. Public presentations raised interest in the topic and very positive reactions by patients and relatives, and we think that the possibility to use art for improved communication in the field of medicine holds promise for the future.",

    "abstract": "The advent of therapeutic strategies designed to modify the disease course in Parkinson's disease has raised great expectations in the currently conducted clinical trials. However, we see ethical challenges in the cooperation of industry and clinical partners, specifically evident in the way recruitment is performed.We here discuss the different positions and challenges of all involved to set the stage for a study and recruitment culture taking into account the expectations of all: (i) patients and their caregivers, ready to take the considerable burden of clinical trials in hope for the development of disease-modifying treatments; (ii) physicians and study nurses, obligated to the patients' well-being and benefit who accompany and supervise patients closely as basis for the performance of elaborate clinical trials (iii) industrial partners, investing years of efforts and finances to develop new treatments.\nWe conclude that the current competitive race for enrollment in clinical studies in PD is challenging the primary goal to ensure patients' benefit and formulate requests to the industrial partners to encounter these concerns.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, the pathological features of which include the presence of Lewy bodies and the neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. However, until recently, research on the pathogenesis and treatment of PD have progressed slowly. Glutamate and dopamine are both important central neurotransmitters in mammals. A lack of enzymatic decomposition of extracellular glutamate results in glutamate accumulating at synapses, which is mainly absorbed by excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). Glutamate exerts its physiological effects by binding to and activating ligand-gated ion channels [ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs)] and a class of G-protein-coupled receptors [metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)]. Timely clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft is necessary because high levels of extracellular glutamate overactivate glutamate receptors, resulting in excitotoxic effects in the central nervous system. Additionally, increased concentrations of extracellular glutamate inhibit cystine uptake, leading to glutathione depletion and oxidative glutamate toxicity. Studies have shown that oxidative glutamate toxicity in neurons lacking functional N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may represent a component of the cellular death pathway induced by excitotoxicity. The association between inflammation and excitotoxicity (i.e., immunoexcitotoxicity) has received increased attention in recent years. Glial activation induces neuroinflammation and can stimulate excessive release of glutamate, which can induce excitotoxicity and, additionally, further exacerbate neuroinflammation. Glutamate, as an important central neurotransmitter, is closely related to the occurrence and development of PD. In this review, we discuss recent progress on elucidating glutamate as a relevant neurotransmitter in PD. Additionally, we summarize the relationship and commonality among glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative toxicity, and immunoexcitotoxicity in order to posit a holistic view and molecular mechanism of glutamate toxicity in PD.",

    "abstract": "Gaining insight to pathologically relevant processes in continuous volumes of unstained brain tissue is important for a better understanding of neurological diseases. Many pathological processes in neurodegenerative disorders affect myelinated axons, which are a critical part of the neuronal circuitry. Cryo ptychographic X-ray computed tomography in the multi-keV energy range is an emerging technology providing phase contrast at high sensitivity, allowing label-free and non-destructive three dimensional imaging of large continuous volumes of tissue, currently spanning up to 400,000 \u03bcm",

    "abstract": "Alterations in the metabolism of iron and its accumulation in the substantia nigra pars compacta accompany the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Changes in iron homeostasis also occur during aging, which constitutes a PD major risk factor. As such, mitigation of iron overload via chelation strategies has been considered a plausible disease modifying approach. Iron chelation, however, is imperfect because of general undesired side effects and lack of specificity; more effective approaches would rely on targeting distinctive pathways responsible for iron overload in brain regions relevant to PD and, in particular, the substantia nigra. We have previously demonstrated that the Transferrin/Transferrin Receptor 2 (TfR2) iron import mechanism functions in nigral dopaminergic neurons, is perturbed in PD models and patients, and therefore constitutes a potential therapeutic target to halt iron accumulation. To validate this hypothesis, we generated mice with targeted deletion of TfR2 in dopaminergic neurons. In these animals, we modeled PD with multiple approaches, based either on neurotoxin exposure or alpha-synuclein proteotoxic mechanisms. We found that TfR2 deletion can provide neuroprotection against dopaminergic degeneration, and against PD- and aging-related iron overload. The effects, however, were significantly more pronounced in females rather than in males. Our data indicate that the TfR2 iron import pathway represents an amenable strategy to hamper PD progression. Data also suggest, however, that therapeutic strategies targeting TfR2 should consider a potential sexual dimorphism in neuroprotective response.",

    "abstract": "Evidence on the association between night work and Parkinson's disease (PD) is sparse and conflicting, calling for more definitive studies.\nWe included 20\u2009138 female nurses from the Danish Nurse Cohort without PD who at baseline in 1993 and/or 1999 reported their most common current work schedule (day, evening, night, and rotating (a combination of at least two of these)), including information on lifetime cumulative duration (years) of each shift in a 2009 follow-up survey. We obtained information on PD hospital contacts and PD medication until November 2018 via linkage to the Danish National Patient (inpatient from 1977 and outpatient contacts from 1995 onwards) and Prescription Registers starting in 1995. We defined the incidence of PD as the first-ever hospital contact due to PD, or the first-ever redeemed levodopa prescription, whichever came first. We used Cox regression models to calculate HRs and 95% CIs, adjusting for age, smoking status, coffee consumption and use of hormone replacement therapy.\nWe found no significant difference in PD risk among nurses who reported working evening (HR=0.86; 95% CI=0.55 to 1.34), night (HR=1.26; 95% CI=0.79 to 2.02) or rotating shifts (HR=0.83; 95% CI=0.56 to 1.21) at cohort baseline in 1993 or 1999, when compared with permanent day workers. Similarly, persistency of shift work (working the same work schedule for 6+ years) or duration of shift work was not associated with PD risk.\nOverall, there was little evidence for an association between various shift work schedules including night work and PD in this cohort of middle-aged female nurses.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) for over 30 years. Despite this, the role of mitochondrial dysfunction as an initiator, propagator, or bystander remains undetermined. The discovery of the role of the PD familial genes PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and parkin (PRKN) in mediating mitochondrial degradation (mitophagy) reaffirmed the importance of this process in PD aetiology. Recently, progress has been made in understanding the upstream and downstream regulators of canonical PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy, alongside noncanonical PINK1/parkin mitophagy, in response to mitochondrial damage. Progress has also been made in understanding the role of PD-associated genes, such as SNCA, LRRK2, and CHCHD2, in mitochondrial dysfunction and their overlap with sporadic PD (sPD), opening opportunities for therapeutically targeting mitochondria in PD.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience a gradual loss of functional abilities that affects all facets of their daily life. There is a lack of longitudinal studies on coping styles in relation to the disease progression among people with PD. The aim of this study was to explore how coping styles in PD evolve over a 3-year period. Data from the longitudinal project \"Home and Health in People Ageing with PD\" was utilized (N = 158), including baseline and 3-year follow-up assessments. Coping was captured by ratings of 13 different coping styles. A factor analysis was conducted to analyse patterns of coping styles. Stability and change were analysed for each of the 13 styles with respect to the course of the disease. The factor analysis revealed four coping patterns: pessimistic, optimistic, persistent and support-seeking. The stability of each coping style over time ranged from 75.3% to 90.5%. Those who experienced a worsening of the disease were most inclined to change their coping style (",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can non-invasively probe cortical excitability in movement disorders, although clinical significance is still controversial, especially at early stages. We compare single-pulse TMS in two prototypic synucleinopathy and tauopathy-i.e., Parkinson's disease (PD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), respectively-to find neurophysiological differences and identify early measures associated with cognitive impairment.\n28 PD and 23 PSP de novo patients were age-matched with 28 healthy controls, all right-handed and drug-free. Amplitude and latency of motor evoked potentials (MEP), central motor conduction time, resting motor threshold (rMT), and cortical silent period (CSP) were recorded through a figure-of-eight coil from the First Dorsal Interosseous muscle (FDI), bilaterally.\nMini Mental Examination and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) scored worse in PSP; PD had worse FAB than controls. Higher MEP amplitude from right FDI in PD and PSP than controls was found, without difference between them. CSP was bilaterally longer in patients than controls, but similar between patient groups. A positive correlation between FAB and rMT was observed in PSP, bilaterally.\nDespite the small sample size, PD and PSP might share, at early stage, a similar global electrocortical asset. rMT might detect and possibly predict cognitive deterioration in PSP.",

    "results": "Mini Mental Examination and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) scored worse in PSP; PD had worse FAB than controls. Higher MEP amplitude from right FDI in PD and PSP than controls was found, without difference between them. CSP was bilaterally longer in patients than controls, but similar between patient groups. A positive correlation between FAB and rMT was observed in PSP, bilaterally.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria, the energy stations of the cell, are the only extranuclear organelles, containing their own (mitochondrial) DNA (mtDNA) and the protein synthesizing machinery. The location of mtDNA in close proximity to the oxidative phosphorylation system of the inner mitochondrial membrane, the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is an important factor responsible for its much higher mutation rate than nuclear DNA. Being more vulnerable to damage than nuclear DNA, mtDNA accumulates mutations, crucial for the development of mitochondrial dysfunction playing a key role in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Good evidence exists that some mtDNA mutations are associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), the movement disorder resulted from the degenerative loss of dopaminergic neurons of ",

    "abstract": "In 2019, we published the results of a Phase IIb randomized controlled trial of putaminal encapsulated porcine choroid plexus cell (termed NTCELL\u00ae) administration in patients with Parkinson's disease. This study failed to meet its primary efficacy end-point of a change in UPDRS part III score in the 'off' state at 26-weeks post-implant. However, a number of secondary end-points reached statistical significance. We questioned whether with longer follow-up, clinically significant improvements would be observed. For this reason, we decided to follow-up all patients periodically to week 104. Herein, we report the results of this long-term follow-up.\nAll 18 patients included in the original study were periodically re-assessed at weeks 52, 78 and 104 post-implant. At each time-point, motor and non-motor function, quality of life and levodopa equivalent daily dose was assessed using a standardized testing battery.\nAt week 104, no significant differences in UPDRS part III scores in the 'off' state were observed in any of the treatment groups compared to baseline. Only a single serious adverse event - hospitalisation due to Parkinson's disease rigidity not responding to changes in medications - was considered potentially related to the implant procedure. There was no evidence of xenogeneic viral transmission.\nUn-blinded, long-duration follow-up to week 104 post-implantation showed no evidence that putaminal NTCELL\u00ae administration produces significant clinical benefit in patients with moderately advanced Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "High frequency (130\u00a0Hz) subthalamic Deep-Brain-Stimulation (STN-DBS) optimally improves cardinal motor symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD). Low stimulation frequencies (60-80\u00a0Hz) improve axial symptoms in some patients and, according to preliminary evidences, may also have a beneficial effect on the cognitive component of motor planning.\nTo analyze the configuration of the P300 component of cortical event-related auditory potentials (ERPs), a reliable index of attentive cognitive functions, at different stimulation frequencies in STN-DBS in PD patients.\n12 PD patients underwent ERPs recordings using a standard oddball auditory paradigm with STN-DBS at 60\u00a0Hz, 80\u00a0Hz, 130\u00a0Hz, and OFF-stimulation, applied in a randomized double-blind sequence. ERPs analysis considered the peak amplitude and latency of the P300 components at midline electrode positions (Fz, Cz, Pz).\nP300 latency over Cz and Pz electrodes significantly increased with STN-DBS at 130\u00a0Hz compared to OFF-stimulation. P300 latency was also significantly increased, though to a lesser degree, over Pz electrode with stimulation at 80\u00a0Hz. No significant P300 latency modifications were detected at 60\u00a0Hz stimulation compared to OFF-stimulation condition. P300 amplitude did not change significantly for any of the stimulation conditions tested.\nLow frequency STN-DBS is associated with minor modifications of P300 latency compared to conventional stimulation at 130\u00a0Hz, possibly suggesting that 60 and 80\u00a0Hz may have less interference with attentive and cognitive processes in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease in the world, and PD significantly impacts the quality of life, especially as in general people are living longer. Because of the numerous and complex features of sporadic PD that progressively develops, it is difficult to build an ideal animal model for PD research. Genetically modified PD rodent animal models are considered as a major tool with which to study the mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for PD. Up to now, none of the rodent animal models displays all PD characteristics. The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF) funded SAGE Laboratories to generate a PTEN-induced putative kinase-1 (PINK1) knockout (KO) rat model for familial PD using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology. In the current paper, we review all papers from PubMed that report studies with PINK1 KO rats, presenting the research results, and discussing the fidelity of this rat model to PD according to its phenotypes studied by several laboratories. This review will serve as a critical reference for future studies with this rodent model, providing a better understanding of PD etiology, pathology, and potential treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) enables timely treatment of patients and helps control the course of the disease. An efficient and reliable approach is therefore needed to develop for improving the clinical ability to diagnose this disease.\nWe proposed a two-layer stacking ensemble learning framework with fusing multi-modal features in this study, for accurately identifying early PD with healthy control (HC). To begin with, we investigated relative importance of multi-modal neuroimaging (T1 weighted image (T1WI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)) and early clinical assessment to classify PD and HC. Next, a two-layer stacking ensemble framework was proposed: at the first layer, we evaluated advantages of these four base classifiers: support vector machine (SVM), random forests (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and artificial neural network (ANN); at the second layer, a logistic regression (LR) classifier was applied to classify PD. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing with traditional ensemble models.\nThe proposed method performed an accuracy of 96.88 %, a precision of 100 %, a recall of 95 % and a F\nThe classification results showed that the proposed model achieved a superior performance in comparison with traditional ensemble models.\nThe stacking ensemble model with efficiently and effectively integrate multiple base classifiers performed higher accuracy than each single traditional model.

    "abstract": "Genetic testing for Parkinson's disease (PD) is growing as interventional clinical trials begin to enroll participants with PD who carry pathogenic variants in the LRRK2 or GBA genes. However, the impact of receiving genetic test results and the satisfaction with receiving genetic counseling among PD populations have not yet been studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate (1) the psychological impact of genetic testing for PD and (2) satisfaction with genetic counseling. Surveyed participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0875) were individuals with PD or at risk of developing PD, initially recruited for the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) study and currently enrolled in the Widespread Recruitment Initiative (WRI) at Indiana University. Individuals were surveyed following genetic test disclosure and genetic counseling regarding results from targeted testing for pathogenic variants in the LRRK2 and GBA genes. Participants were surveyed via two tools: a modified version of the Multidimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment Survey (M-MICRA), which measured the psychological impact of genetic testing and the Genetic Counseling Satisfaction Survey (GCSS). Participants were divided into affected/unaffected and variant positive/negative groups for subset analyses. The majority of participants had favorable M-MICRA scores and were satisfied with the disclosure of the genetic test results and genetic counseling for PD. However, participants with PD and those with pathogenic variants had less favorable M-MICRA scores and lower satisfaction scores compared to those without disease or pathogenic variants. This information is valuable to providers performing genetic testing of and genetic counseling to people and families affected with PD. Individuals with PD and individuals with pathogenic variants may benefit from additional interventions.",

    "abstract": "The clinical application of DBS has become manifold and there has been a tremendous growth in DBS technology in the last few decades making it safer and user friendly. The earlier concept of its delayed application in motor fluctuations of Parkinson's disease has been replaced by Class-I evidence of EARLY-STIM trial in 2013, leading to its FDA approval to be used in early-stage despite criticism. Various studies have provided evidence of beneficial effects of bilateral STN-DBS on both motor as well as nonmotor symptoms and different new targets such as the pedunculopontine nucleus, posterior subthalamic area or caudal zona incerta, centromedian-parafascicular complex, and substantia nigra pars reticulata have now become a new area of interest in addition to the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus for the alleviation of both motor and nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. New data has confirmed that the DBS is clinically as effective and safe in elderly patients as it is in younger ones. Technological advances like current steering, directional leads, and closed-loop DBS are directed towards reducing the stimulation-induced adverse effects and preservation of the battery life for a longer period. Results of the long-term efficacy of DBS on Parkinson's disease are now available. These have shown that as the motor benefit continues, the clinical progression of Parkinson's disease also continues. We plan to discuss all these in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Neuromodulation therapies, including deep brain stimulation (DBS) and pump therapies, are currently the standard of care for PD patients with advanced disease and motor complications that are difficult to control with medical management alone. The quest for alternate lesser invasive approaches led to the development of several novel therapies like intrajejunal levodopa infusions (IJLI), continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions (CSAI) and Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) in recent years. To achieve good outcomes with any of these therapeutic modalities, careful patient selection, multidisciplinary evaluation and technical expertise are equally important. In this review, we will provide an overview of the neuromodulation strategies currently available for PD, emphasizing on patient selection and choosing among the various strategies.",

    "abstract": "Alexithymia is a neuropsychiatric symptom conceptualized as difficulty identifying and describing feelings. Although associated with other non-motor symptoms, mainly neuropsychiatric, alexithymia may present as an isolated symptom in persons with Parkinson's Disease (PwP). The objective of the study is to identify determinants of alexithymia and its association with quality of life (QoL) in Parkinson's disease.\nSubjects with Parkinson's disease were recruited. The following instruments were applied: Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20) and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8). Matched healthy controls were screened using TAS-20. Clinical and demographical variables were compared between alexithymic and non-alexithymic. Regression models were used to find determinants of alexithymia. Impact of alexithymia on QoL was estimated with a linear regression model.\n98 patients were included. 56.1% PwP and 28.8% controls were alexithymic (p<0.001). Education level (OR 0.86) and NMSS urinary score (OR 1.09) determined alexithymia as well as TAS-20 score. Alexithymia was an independent determinant of QoL.\nAlexithymia is a prevalent independent non-motor symptom in PwP with impact on QoL. Low education level and urinary symptoms are important determinants of alexithymia.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the endocannabinoid system in an animal model of Parkinson's disease, in-tube solid-phase microextraction (in-tube SPME) was directly coupled to a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) system for determination of the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in rat brain samples. In-tube SPME-which consisted of a microtube of restricted access material (RAM) with a hydrophilic diol external surface and a hydrophobic octyl inner surface-efficiently excluded (up to 95%) macromolecules from the biological samples and selectively pre-concentrated the analytes. In-tube SPME parameters, such as sample volume, mobile phases, flow rate, and pre-concentration time, were evaluated to improve the extraction efficiency and throughput performance. The selectivity of the in-tube SPME and MS/MS (MRM mode) techniques allowed them to be directly coupled online, which dismissed the need for the chromatographic separation step. The in-tube SPME-MS/MS method was validated and shown to be linear from 6.0 to 30.0 ng mL",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an important treatment for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients after DBS implantation need specialized programming to get optimal outcomes. However, access to timely and economical postoperative programming for many patients living in remote areas is limited. Teleprogramming, which refers to deliver real-time remote programming through Internet, can help to address this gap.\nWe aimed to evaluate the clinical application of remote programming for PD patients with DBS.\nWe retrospectively studied 90 patients with PD who received remote DBS programming after implantation at Yuquan Hospital (Beijing, China) between March 2016 and June 2018. Patients' medical records were reviewed in an electronic database. A self-designed questionnaire was performed on all patients by phone.\nOver a mean follow-up period of 27.0 months, 90 patients underwent a total of 386 remote programming visits, of which the average frequency within 6 months after DBS was 2.27 times/person. The average distance between the patients' residences and Yuquan Hospital was 1243.8 \u00b1 746.5 km. The questionnaire survey showed that each remote programming visit saved \u22652000\u00a5 for 76.7% of the patients and \u226512 hours for 90.0% of the patients, compared with the on-site programming visit. The acceptability of the remote programming platform was highly rated. Transient side effects related to programming were reported and were relieved after adjustments of parameters.\nRemote programming may offer a feasible and acceptable approach to timely and economic management in patients with PD after DBS implantation.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as an important feature in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it remains unclear whether neuroinflammation contributes to nigral degeneration in PD or is merely a secondary marker of neurodegeneration. We aimed to investigate the temporal relationship between synucleopathy, neuroinflammation and nigrostriatal degeneration in a mouse model of PD. Mice received unilateral intrastriatal injection of alpha-synuclein pre-formed fibrils, alpha-synuclein monomer or vehicle and were sacrificed at 15, 30 and 90 days post-injection. Intrastriatal inoculation of alpha-synuclein fibrils led to significant alpha-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra peaking at 30 days after injection while the significant increase in Iba-1 cells, GFAP cells and IL-1\u03b2 expression peaked earlier at 15 days. At 90 days, the striatal dopaminergic denervation was associated with astroglial activation. Alpha-synuclein monomer did not result in long-term glia activation or increase in inflammatory markers. The spread of alpha-synuclein aggregates into the cortex was not associated with any changes to neuroinflammatory markers. Our results demonstrate that in the substantia nigra glial activation is an early event that precedes alpha-synuclein inclusion formation, suggesting neuroinflammation could play an important early role in the pathogenesis of PD.",

This study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of accelerated rTMS and to understand the underlying neural mechanism. In a double-blinded way, a total of 42 patients with PD were randomized to receive real (n =\u200922) or sham (n =\u200920) continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) on the left supplementary motor area (SMA) for 14 consecutive days. Patients treated with real cTBS, but not with sham cTBS, showed a significant improvement in Part III of the Unified PD Rating Scale (p <\u2009.0001). This improvement was observed as early as 1\u2009week after the start of cTBS treatment, and maintained 8\u2009weeks after the end of the treatment. These findings indicated that the treatment response was swift with a long-lasting effect. Imaging analyses showed that volume of the left globus pallidus (GP) increased after cTBS treatment. Furthermore, the volume change of GP was mildly correlated with symptom improvement and associated with the baseline fractional anisotropy of SMA-GP tracts. Together, these findings implicated that the accelerated cTBS could effectively alleviate motor symptoms of PD, maybe by modulating the motor circuitry involving the SMA-GP pathway.",

    "abstract": "Genetic stratification of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients facilitates gene-tailored research studies and clinical trials. The objective of this study was to describe the design of and the initial data from the Rostock International Parkinson's Disease (ROPAD) study, an epidemiological observational study aiming to genetically characterize ~10,000 participants.\nRecruitment criteria included (1) clinical diagnosis of PD, (2) relative of participant with a reportable LRRK2 variant, or (3) North African Berber or Ashkenazi Jew. DNA analysis involved up to 3 successive steps: (1) variant (LRRK2) and gene (GBA) screening, (2) panel sequencing of 68 PD-linked genes, and (3) genome sequencing.\nInitial data based on the first 1360 participants indicated that the ROPAD enrollment strategy revealed a genetic diagnostic yield of ~14% among a PD cohort from tertiary referral centers.\nThe ROPAD screening protocol is feasible for high-throughput genetic characterization of PD participants and subsequent prioritization for gene-focused research efforts and clinical trials. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) is a movement disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and aggregation of the protein \u03b1-synuclein. Patients with iPD vary in age of symptom onset, rate of progression, severity of motor and non-motor symptoms, and extent of central and peripheral inflammation. Genetic and environmental factors are believed to act synergistically in iPD pathogenesis. We propose that environmental factors (pesticides and infections) increase the risk for iPD via the immune system and that the role of PD risk genes in immune cells is worthy of investigation. This review highlights the major PD-relevant genes expressed in immune cells and key environmental factors that activate immune cells and, alone or in combination with other factors, may contribute to iPD pathogenesis. By reviewing these interactions, we seek to enable the future development of immunomodulatory approaches to prevent or delay onset of iPD. \u00a9 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) protein, Mitofilin or Mic60, has been shown to play a key role in controlling and maintaining mitochondrial cristae morphology, and its dysregulation induces cyto-deleterious effects. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying Mitofilin degradation in dopaminergic neuron death using N27-A cells, and Human Dopamine Neuronal Primary cells treated with PD stressors, Dopamine (DA) or Rotenone (Rot). We found that both PD stressors increased mitochondrial Parkin translocation and interaction with Mitofilin that promotes Mitofilin degradation ",

    "abstract": "The search for new therapies, derived from natural compounds in order to prevent and treat Parkinson's disease (PD) has aroused the interest of many researchers. Spondias mombin (L) has active constituents with known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of the hexane extract of S. mombin (EHSm) in an experimental model of DP induced by rotenone in zebrafish. The analysis of GC/MS demonstrated cyclogallipharaol (13.88%) and dl-\u03b1-tocopherol (8.08%) mostly, while HPLC-DAD indicated the presence of quercetin (<5), quercetrin (6.54\u00a0mg/g) and rutin (8.83\u00a0mg/g). The zebrafish exposed for 4\u00a0weeks to rotenone (ROT, 3\u00a0\u03bcg/L) and EHSm (5, 15, 25\u00a0mg/L). EHSm (25\u00a0mg/L) was able to reverse the behavioral damage induced by ROT in the entries and time spent in the top area of the tank. The parameters biochemicals indicated of EHSm prevented oxidative stress (TBARS e total thiols), inflammation and dopamine uptake triggered by ROT, evidenced of increased on the CAT, SOD and GSH and decreased of GST, O",

    "abstract": "Evidence about altered bimanual coordination has been reported in Parkinson's Disease. However, no previous study has explored such an alteration quantifying the interference effect that the trajectory of each hand might impose on the other one. Thus, in the present research, we applied the traditional Circles-Lines Coupling Task, which allowed assessing the motor coordination of the two hands, in the context of Parkinson's Disease.\nThirty-six individuals affected by Parkinson's Disease were consecutively recruited and assigned to two groups according to their symptoms' lateralization. Moreover, eighteen age-matched healthy controls participated in the study. We capitalized on the Circles-Lines Coupling Task, in which the performance during incongruent movements (drawing lines with one hand and circles with the other hand) was compared with the performance during congruent movements (drawing lines with both hands). A bimanual coupling index was computed to compare the interference effect of each hand on the other one.\nIn healthy controls, the bimanual coupling index did not differ between the two hands. Crucially, in both groups of individuals affected by Parkinson's Disease, the less affected hand showed a significantly higher bimanual coupling index, due to the abnormal interference exerted by the most affected one, than vice versa.\nOur results highlighted an altered spatial bimanual coupling in Parkinson's disease, depending on the symptoms' lateralization. We offered different explanations of our results according to the theoretical frameworks about the mechanisms subserving bimanual coordination.",

    "abstract": "The NUS1 gene was recently associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) in the Chinese population. Here, as part of the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium, we have leveraged large-scale PD case-control cohorts to comprehensively assess damaging NUS1 variants in individuals of European descent. Burden analysis of rare nonsynonymous damaging variants across case-control individuals from whole-exome and -genome data sets did not find evidence of NUS1 association with PD. Overall, single-variant tests for rare (minor allele frequency<0.01) and common (minor allele frequency>0.01) variants, including 15 PD-GWAS cohorts and summary statistics from the largest PD GWAS meta-analysis to date, also did not uncover any associations. Our results indicate a lack of evidence for a role of rare damaging nonsynonymous NUS1 variants in PD in unrelated case-control cohorts of European descent, suggesting that the previously observed association could be driven by extremely rare population-specific variants.",

    "abstract": "Lipid peroxidation is a key to a portfolio of neurodegenerative diseases and plays a central role in \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death, all key processes in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are important constituents of the synaptic and mitochondrial membranes and are often the first molecular targets attacked by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The rate-limiting step of the chain reaction of ROS-initiated PUFAs autoxidation involves hydrogen abstraction at bis-allylic sites, which can be slowed down if hydrogens are replaced with deuteriums. In this study, we show that targeted overexpression of human A53T \u03b1-syn using an AAV vector unilaterally in the rat substantia nigra reproduces some of pathological features seen in PD patients. Chronic dietary supplementation with deuterated PUFAs (D-PUFAs), specifically 0.8% D-linoleic and 0.3% H-linolenic, produced significant disease-modifying beneficial effects against \u03b1-syn-induced motor deficits, synaptic pathology, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupted trafficking along axons, inflammation and DA neuronal loss. These findings support the clinical evaluation of D-PUFAs as a neuroprotective therapy for PD.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows that Parkinson's disease is negatively associated with colon cancer risk, indicating that Parkinson's disease family proteins may be involved in the initiation of colon cancer. Here, we aimed to identify a Parkinson's disease-related gene involved in colon cancer, elucidate the underlying mechanisms, and test whether it can be used as a target for cancer therapy.\nWe first screened colon cancer and normal tissues for differential expression of Parkinson's disease-associated genes and identified ATP13A2, which encodes cation-transporting ATPase 13A2, as a putative marker for colon cancer. We next correlated ATP13A2 expression with colon cancer prognosis. We performed a series of ATP13A2 knockdown and overexpression studies in vitro to identify the contribution of ATP13A2 in the stemness and invasive capacity of colon cancer cells. Additionally, autophagy flux assay were determined to explore the mechanism of ATP13A2 induced stemness. Finally, we knocked down ATP13A2 in mice using siRNA to determine whether it can be used as target for colon cancer treatment.\nColon cancer patients with high ATP13A2 expression exhibit shorter overall survival than those with low ATP13A2. Functionally, ATP13A2 acts as a novel stimulator of stem-like traits. Furthermore, knockdown of ATP13A2 in HCT116 resulted in decreased levels of cellular autophagy. Additionally, bafilomycin A1, an autophagy inhibitor, reversed the ATP13A2-induced stemness of colon cancer cells. Lastly treatment with ATP13A2 siRNA reduced the volume of colon cancer xenografts in mice.\nThe PD-associated gene ATP13A2 is involved in colon cancer stemness through regulation of autophagy. Furthermore, ATP13A2 is a novel prognostic biomarker for colon cancer and is a potential target for colon cancer therapy.",

The aim of this work is to evaluate the global left ventricular systolic function in patients with PD in comparison with healthy controls using speckle tracking echocardiography and to correlate the global left ventricular systolic function with both motor and cognitive functions in PD patients.\nA case-control study was conducted on 40 patients diagnosed with PD and 40 healthy controls. Evaluation and staging of PD were performed using the Modified Hoehn and Yahr staging scale (H&Y staging) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Cognitive assessment for PD patients was done using Parkinson's Disease - Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS). Conventional and two-dimensional (2D) speckle-tracking strain echocardiography was done for both groups to assess the global left ventricular systolic function.\nThere was a statistically significant difference between PD patients and controls regarding global longitudinal strain (\nPD patients were found to have significant subclinical left ventricular systolic dysfunction in comparison with healthy controls. Such dysfunction was correlated with the severity of the motor disability and cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disease characterized by localized eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in cells of the nervous system and internal organs. This disorder is frequently missed or misdiagnosed, as there is significant heterogeneity of its clinical presentation. Recently, genetic sequencing has revealed complex links between neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, potentially explaining the diversity of clinical manifestations. Herein, we describe the case of\u00a0a\u00a068-year-old male Chinese patient who was initially diagnosed with Parkinson's disease based on classic symptomatology and \u00b9\u00b2\u00b3I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy results and was subsequently treated with oral methyldopa for 3 years. He developed a paroxysmal tic before he presented to our hospital for treatment after a convulsive seizure. Brain magnetic resonance imaging identified signal hyperintensity at the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging. Skin biopsy results and genetic testing confirmed a revised diagnosis of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease. This report highlights that patients clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease may actually be in the early stages of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease, suggesting that patients with suspected Parkinson's disease should also be screened for this disease.",

    "abstract": "A high-risk left-sided posterolateral manifest accessory pathway (AP) was identified in a 49-year-old man. Two prior ablations had failed. A repeat procedure using 3D electroanatomic mapping demonstrated an extremely oblique AP. The earliest atrial activation site was not amenable to endocardial ablation. The earliest ventricular activation site was identified, demonstrating an AP with an extremely slanted course. Radiofrequency ablation here resulted in sustained bidirectional AP block. In challenging AP ablation cases, recognition of the potential for an oblique AP and the use of electroanatomic mapping may be beneficial.\nUne voie accessoire (VA) apparente post\u00e9ro-lat\u00e9rale gauche \u00e0 haut risque a \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9e chez un homme de 49 ans.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, of which the histopathological hallmark is the formation of Lewy bodies consisting of \u03b1-synuclein as the major component. \u03b1-Synuclein can sequester DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the maintenance DNA methylation enzyme, from the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, leading to global DNA hypomethylation in human brain. As DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression and there is no specific database storing PD associated methylation information, PDmethDB (Parkinson's Disease Methylation Database) aims to curate PD associated methylation information from literature to facilitate the study of the relationship between PD and methylation. Currently, PDmethDB contains 97,077 PD methylation associated entries among 12,308 molecules, 37,944 CpG sites, 31 tissues and 3 species through a review of about 1600 published papers. This includes information concerning the gene/molecule name, CpG site, methylation alteration, expression alteration, tissue, PMID, experimental method, and a brief description about the entry. PDmethDB provides a user-friendly interface to search, browse, download and submit data. PDmethDB supports browsing by molecule, species, tissue, gene region, methylation alteration and experimental methods. PDmethDB also shows the entry gene interaction network including protein-protein interactions and miRNA-targets interactions with a highlight of PD associated genes from DisGeNET database. PDmethDB aims to facilitate the understanding of the relationship between PD and methylation. ",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the effect of pre-existing essential tremor (ET) history on the disease progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). We recruited and followed-up a group of PD patients from March 2009 to July 2020. The ET history of each patient was obtained by retrospective interviews or past medical records. Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Of 785 patients who completed the followed-up visits, 61 patients (7.8%) reported a history of pre-existing ET. Cox regression models after IPTW indicated that the positive ET history in patients with PD was protective against time to United PD Rating Scale III 14-point increase (HR\u2009=\u20090.301, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.134-0.678, P\u2009=\u20090.004), time to akinesia and rigidity 8-point increase (HR\u2009=\u20090.417, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.218-0.796, P\u2009=\u20090.008), time to conversion to Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 (HR\u2009=\u20090.356, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.131-0.969, P\u2009=\u20090.043), time to develop dyskinesia (HR\u2009=\u20090.160, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.037-0.698, P\u2009=\u20090.015), and time to Montreal Cognitive Assessment 3-point decrease (HR\u2009=\u20090.389, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.160-0.946, P\u2009=\u20090.037), but had no relationship with time to tremor 4-point increase (HR\u2009=\u20091.638, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.822-3.266, P\u2009=\u20090.161) and time to death (HR\u2009=\u20090.713, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.219-2.319, P\u2009=\u20090.574).

    "abstract": "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are considered as the risk factors for dementia (PDD). Posterior cortically based functions, such as visuospatial and visuoperceptual (VS-VP) processing, have been described as predictors of PDD. However, no investigations have focused on the qualitative analysis of the Judgment of Line Orientation Test (JLOT) and the Facial Recognition Test (FRT) in PD-SCD and PD-MCI. The aim of this work was to study the VS-VP errors in JLOT and FRT. Moreover, these variables are considered as predictors of PDD.\nForty-two PD patients and 19 controls were evaluated with a neuropsychological protocol. Patients were classified as PD-SCD and PD-MCI. Analyses of errors were conducted following the procedure described by Ska, Poissant, and Joanette (1990). Follow-up assessment was conducted to a mean of 7.5 years after the baseline.\nPD-MCI patients showed a poor performance in JLOT and FRT total score and made a greater proportion of severe intraquadrant (QO2) and interquadrant errors (IQO). PD-SCD showed a poor performance in FRT and made mild errors in JLOT. PD-MCI and QO2/IQO errors were independent risk factors for PDD during the follow-up. Moreover, the combination of both PD-MCI diagnosis and QO2/IQO errors was associated with a greater risk.\nPD-MCI patients presented a greater alteration in VS-VP processing observable by the presence of severe misjudgments. PD-SCD patients also showed mild difficulties in VS-SP functions. Finally, QO2/IQO errors in PD-MCI are a useful predictor of PDD, more than PD-MCI diagnosis alone.",

    "abstract": "The benefits of daily-living physical activity are clear. Nonetheless, the relationship between physical activity levels and motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD), i.e., tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD), have not been well-studied. It is also unclear if patient perspectives and motor symptom severity are related to objective, sensor-based assessment of daily-living activity in those subtypes. To address these questions, total daily-living physical activity was quantified in 73 patients with PD and 29 healthy controls using a 3D-accelerometer worn on the lower back for at least three days. We found that individuals with the PIGD subtype were significantly less active than healthy older adults (",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that leads to significant morbidity and disability. PD is caused by a loss of dopaminergic, cholinergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), and peripherally; the syndromic parkinsonism symptoms of movement disorder, gait disorder, rigidity and tremor are mostly driven by the loss of these neurons in the basal ganglia. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of patients taking levodopa, the standard of care treatment for PD, will begin to experience a decrease in effectiveness at varying times. These periods, referred to as \"off episodes\", are characterized by increased symptoms and have a detrimental effect on quality of life and disability. Istradefylline, a novel adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, is indicated as a treatment addition to levodopa/carbidopa in patients experiencing \"off episodes\". It promotes dopaminergic activity by antagonizing adenosine in the basal ganglia. This review will discuss istradefylline as a treatment for PD patients with off episodes.",

    "abstract": "Literature shows that home confinement during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly affected sleep. However, such information regarding subjects having Parkinson's disease (PD) is unavailable.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted using a questionnaire, developed and validated by experts. PD subjects from nine centers across India were included. Questionnaire assessed presence as well as change in sleep-related parameters and PD symptoms during home confinement. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and REM sleep behavior disorder (REMBD) was diagnosed using validated questionnaire. Additionally, changes in physical activity, adoption of new hobbies during home confinement and perceived quality of life were assessed.\nOf 832 subjects, 35.4% reported sleep disturbances. New-onset/worsening of sleep disturbances (NOWS) was reported by 23.9% subjects. Among those with sleep disturbances (n\u00a0=\u00a0295), insomnia symptoms worsened in half (51.5%) and nearly one-fourth reported worsening of RLS (24.7%) and REMBD (22.7%) each. NOWS was common in subjects lacking adequate family support during home confinement (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03); home confinement\u00a0>\u00a060 days (P\u00a0=\u00a00.05) and duration of PD\u00a0>\u00a07 years (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Contrarily, physical activity >1\u00a0h/day and engagement in new hobbies during home confinement were associated with better sleep. NOWS was associated with worsening of motor as well as non-motor symptoms of PD (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and poorer life quality (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nHome confinement during COVID-19 pandemic was significantly associated with NOWS among PD subjects. NOWS was associated with global worsening of PD symptoms and poorer life quality. Physical activity >1\u00a0h/day and adoption of new hobbies during home confinement were associated with better sleep.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine system in the midbrain is essential for volitional movement, action selection, and reward-related learning. Despite its versatile roles, it contains only a small set of neurons in the brainstem. These dopamine neurons are especially susceptible to Parkinson's disease and prematurely degenerate in the course of disease progression, while the discovery of new therapeutic interventions has been disappointingly unsuccessful. Here, we show that O-GlcNAcylation, an essential post-translational modification in various types of cells, is critical for the physiological function and survival of dopamine neurons. Bidirectional modulation of O-GlcNAcylation importantly regulates dopamine neurons at the molecular, synaptic, cellular, and behavioural levels. Remarkably, genetic and pharmacological upregulation of O-GlcNAcylation mitigates neurodegeneration, synaptic impairments, and motor deficits in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. These findings provide insights into the functional importance of O-GlcNAcylation in the dopamine system, which may be utilized to protect dopamine neurons against Parkinson's disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of diplopia in Parkinson's disease (PD) ranges from 10% to 30%. Diplopia is usually limited to specific situations such as reading and looking around, however, it can also be constant. The aim of this review, supplemented by two case studies, was to summarise current knowledge on the frequency, possible causes, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment approaches to double vision in PD patients.\nAn electronic search (PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science) to identify studies regarding diplopia in PD patients was performed in May 2020. The following search terms were used: Parkinson's Disease and diplopia.\nFive articles are included in this literature review. In the literature, the number of included patients with PD who presented with symptoms of diplopia varied from a single case report to 88 patients. Diplopia was usually intermittent and binocular. The most commonly reported type of diplopia was single object diplopia, and the second most common was complete diplopia. Risk factors contributing to developing diplopia were: older age, disease duration, disease severity, cognitive decline, presence of visual hallucinations, and higher levodopa equivalent dose. Results also showed that diplopia had a significant impact on quality of life. Possible comorbidities of diplopia include myasthenia gravis and vascular disease.\nDiplopia is relatively common in PD, but still understudied. The research shows that it has a clear impact on health-related quality of life and patient safety. The acute onset of diplopia should always result in tests to exclude other diseases. Tailored interventions should be developed, leading to improved patient safety, quality of life, and quality of care.",

    "abstract": "Medical conditions with effective therapies are usually managed with objective measurement and therapeutic targets. Parkinson's disease has effective therapies, but continuous objective measurement has only recently become available. This blinded, controlled study examined whether management of Parkinson's disease was improved when clinical assessment and therapeutic decisions were aided by objective measurement. The primary endpoint was improvement in the Movement Disorder Society-United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale's (MDS-UPDRS) Total Score. In one arm, objective measurement assisted doctors to alter therapy over successive visits until objective measurement scores were in target. Patients in the other arm were conventionally assessed and therapies were changed until judged optimal. There were 75 subjects in the objective measurement arm and 79 in the arm with conventional assessment and treatment. There were statistically significant improvements in the moderate clinically meaningful range in the MDS-UPDRS Total, III, IV scales in the arm using objective measurement, but not in the conventionally treated arm. These findings show that global motor and non-motor disability is improved when management of Parkinson's disease is assisted by objective measurement.",

    "abstract": "The catecholamine neurotransmitter dopamine has the potential to act as an endogenous neurotoxin when its vesicular sequestration is dysregulated. Despite postmortem analyses from patients with Parkinson's disease that demonstrate decreased vesicular sequestration of dopamine with a corresponding increase in dopamine metabolism, dopamine's contribution to nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in Parkinson's disease has been debated. Here, we present a new in vivo model demonstrating the induction of Parkinson's disease-associated pathogenic mechanisms of degeneration resulting from acquired dysregulation of dopamine sequestration in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in adult rats. Utilizing adeno-associated virus (serotype 2), viral-mediated small-hairpin RNA interference of endogenous vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) expression resulted in a loss of VMAT2 protein expression in transduced dopaminergic cell bodies in the substantia nigra with a corresponding loss of VMAT2 protein within the striatal terminals. The loss of VMAT2 resulted in an accumulation of cytosolic dopamine and subsequent increased dopamine metabolism, deficits in dopamine-mediated behaviors, and degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons that was rescued through reintroduction of exogenous VMAT2, demonstrating that the toxicity was specific to the loss of VMAT2. Analysis of parkinsonian pathogenic mechanisms of degeneration identified oxidative damage, activation of Parkinson's disease-associated kinase LRRK2, and the formation of aberrant \u03b1-synuclein. This model demonstrates that a progressive acquired loss of VMAT2 expression in adulthood is sufficient to induce Parkinson's disease-associated pathogenic mechanisms of degeneration and provides a new model to further investigate the consequences of cytosolic dopamine.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the presence of Lewy bodies, which gives rise to motor and non-motor symptoms. Unfortunately, current therapeutic strategies for PD merely treat the symptoms of the disease, only temporarily improve the patients' quality of life, and are not sufficient for completely alleviating the symptoms. Therefore, cell-based therapies have emerged as a novel promising therapeutic approach in PD treatment. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have arisen as a leading contender for cell sources due to their regenerative and immunomodulatory capabilities, limited ethical concerns, and low risk of tumor formation. Although several studies have shown that MSCs have the potential to mitigate the neurodegenerative pathology of PD, variabilities in preclinical and clinical trials have resulted in inconsistent therapeutic outcomes. In this review, we strive to highlight the sources of variability in studies using MSCs in PD therapy, including MSC sources, the use of autologous or allogenic MSCs, dose, delivery methods, patient factors, and measures of clinical outcome. Available evidence indicates that while the use of MSCs in PD has largely been promising, conditions need to be standardized so that studies can be effectively compared with one another and experimental designs can be improved upon, such that this body of science can continue to move forward.",

    "abstract": "Few exercise interventions practice both gait and balance tasks with cognitive tasks to improve functional mobility in people with PD. We aimed to investigate whether the Agility Boot Camp with Cognitive Challenge (ABC-C), that simultaneously targets both mobility and cognitive function, improves dynamic balance and dual-task gait in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). We used a cross-over, single-blind, randomized controlled trial to determine efficacy of the exercise intervention. Eighty-six people with idiopathic PD were randomized into either an exercise (ABC-C)-first or an active, placebo, education-first intervention and then crossed over to the other intervention. Both interventions were carried out in small groups led by a certified exercise trainer (90-min sessions, 3 times a week, for 6 weeks). Outcome measures were assessed Off levodopa at baseline and after the first and second interventions. A linear mixed-effects model tested the treatment effects on the Mini-BESTest for balance, dual-task cost on gait speed, SCOPA-COG, the UPDRS Parts II and III and the PDQ-39. Although no significant treatment effects were observed for the Mini-BESTest, SCOPA-COG or MDS-UPDRS Part III, the ABC-C intervention significantly improved the following outcomes: anticipatory postural adjustment sub-score of the Mini-BESTest (p\u2009=\u20090.004), dual-task cost on gait speed (p\u2009=\u20090.001), MDS-UPDRS Part II score (p\u2009=\u20090.01), PIGD sub-score of MDS-UPDRS Part III (p\u2009=\u20090.02), and the activities of daily living domain of the PDQ-39 (p\u2009=\u20090.003). Participants with more severe motor impairment or more severe cognitive dysfunction improved their total Mini-BESTest scores after exercise. The ABC-C exercise intervention can improve specific balance deficits, cognitive-gait interference, and perceived functional independence and quality of life, especially in participants with more severe PD, but a longer period of intervention may be required to improve global cognitive and motor function.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, causing movement defects. The incidence of PD is constantly increasing and this disease is still incurable. Thus, understanding PD pathophysiology would be pivotal for the development of PD therapy, and various PD models have thus been already developed. Through recent advances in reprogramming techniques, a primitive neural stem cell (pNSC) derived from PD patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could be potentially used as a reproducible and reliable experimental system to analyze the effect of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. PD patients exhibit motor symptoms such as akinesia/bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural instability due to a loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Although the pathogenesis in sporadic PD remains unknown, there is a consensus on the involvement of non-neuronal cells in the progression of PD pathology. Astrocytes are the most numerous glial cells in the central nervous system. Normally, astrocytes protect neurons by releasing neurotrophic factors, producing antioxidants, and disposing of neuronal waste products. However, in pathological situations, astrocytes are known to produce inflammatory cytokines. In addition, various studies have reported that astrocyte dysfunction also leads to neurodegeneration in PD. In this article, we summarize the interaction of astrocytes and dopaminergic neurons, review the pathogenic role of astrocytes in PD, and discuss therapeutic strategies for the prevention of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This review highlights neuron-astrocyte interaction as a target for the development of disease-modifying drugs for PD in the future.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Pathologically, PD is characterized by the formation of Lewy bodies (LBs) in the brain, which mainly comprises phosphorylated and aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn). The aberrant aggregation of \u03b1-syn is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of PD. While \u03b1-syn expression can be reduced by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), the challenge to deliver ASOs safely and effectively into the neurons remains unresolved. Here, we developed a safe and highly effective ASO delivery method by using exosomes. We first identified the ASO sequence that selectively reduced \u03b1-syn expression: ASO4. Exosome-mediated delivery of ASO4 (exo-ASO4) showed high cellular uptake and low toxicity in primary neuronal cultures. Exo-ASO4 also significantly attenuated \u03b1-syn aggregation induced by pre-formed \u03b1-syn fibrils in vitro. Exo-ASO4 intracerebroventricular injection into the brains of \u03b1-syn A53T mice, a transgenic model of PD, significantly decreased the expression of \u03b1-syn and attenuated its aggregation. Furthermore, exo-ASO4 ameliorated the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in these mice. Finally, the \u03b1-syn A53T mice showed significantly improved locomotor functions after exo-ASO4 injection. Overall, this study demonstrates that exosome-mediated ASO4 delivery may be an effective treatment option for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that presents with motor and non-motor manifestations. Amongst the non-motor features, various forms of sleep disturbances can occur, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is considered to be a common comorbidity. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of OSA on cognitive and motor functions in PD.\nThe information sources of for this systematic review and meta-analysis were PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect. Studies meeting the following criteria were included: (1) studies including idiopathic PD patients, (2) studies using polysomnography to categorize PD patients into PD with OSA and PD without OSA, and (3) studies with observational designs (case-control, cohort, or cross-sectional). Data analysis was performed using RevMan.\nOur meta-analysis showed that OSA was associated with significantly lower scores of Montreal Cognitive Assessments (MoCA) (mean difference (MD) = -0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-1.28, -0.13], P = 0.01) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (MD = -0.69, 95% CI [-1.17, -0.21], P = 0.005). Moreover, the score of the motor part of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III) was significantly higher in PD patients with OSA as compared with those without OSA (MD = 1.63, 95% CI [0.03, 3.23], P = 0.049).\nOSA is associated with increased severity of PD-associated cognitive dysfunction and motor symptoms. However, further studies are needed to corroborate these findings, assess the underlying mechanisms by which OSA influences the motor and cognitive functions in PD, and investigate whether OSA can accelerate the neurodegenerative process of PD. \u00a9 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Clusterin (CLU) plays important role in the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, a genetic variant of CLU rs9331896 has been reported as a risk estimate for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the association between this variant and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in the Chinese Han population remains elusive.\nWe sequenced CLU rs9331896 in 353 PD patients and 326 healthy-matched individuals of the Chinese Han population. The genotypes of rs9331896 were analyzed using MassArray (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The distribution of genotypes and allelic frequencies was analyzed by a chi-squared test. Additionally, the expression of CLU protein in plasma was evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and analysed with a t-test.\nThe TT genotype in rs9331896 in a recessive model was found to be associated with the increased risk of PD (odds ratio = 1.408, 95% confidence interval = 1.034-1.916, p = 0.029). Subgroup analysis indicated that TT genotype carriers showed a significantly higher risk in male PD patients compared to male healthy controls (odds ratio = 1.611, 95% confidence interval = 1.046-2.483, p = 0.030). In addition, CLU levels in the plasma of PD patients were significantly higher than controls (p = 0.024).\nThe CLU-rs9331896-TT genotype was a risk factor for PD, particularly in males. PD patients also expressed a high level of CLU in plasma.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and complex neurodegenerative disease; the pathogenesis of which is still uncertain. Exosomes, nanosized extracellular vesicles, have been suggested to participate in the pathogenesis of PD, but their role is unknown. Here, a metabolomic analysis of serum and brain exosomes showed differentially expressed metabolites between 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride- (MPTP-) induced PD mice and control mice, such as oxidized lipids, vitamins, and cholesterol. These metabolites were enriched in coenzyme, nicotinamide, and amino acid pathways related to PD, and they could be served as preclinical biomarkers. We further found that blood-derived exosomes from healthy volunteers alleviated impaired motor coordination in MPTP-treated mice. Results from immunohistochemistry and western blotting indicated that the loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra and striatum of PD model mice was rescued by the exosome treatment. The exosome treatment also restored the homeostasis of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cell apoptosis in the model mice. These results suggest that exosomes are important mediators for PD pathogenesis, and exosomes are promising targets for the diagnosis and treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "The field related to mood disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) is fragmented. The aim of this cohort observational study was to evaluate whether the episodes of mood alteration could appear in different disease stages and to verify how nonmotor symptoms were led off into different stages. We enrolled 93 PD outpatients (three groups: drug naive-DN; not exhibiting motor fluctuations-n-MF; and exhibiting motor fluctuations-MF) and 50 healthy controls. Mood state was assessed through the Internal State Scale (ISS) while depressive symptoms were evaluated through the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), nonmotor symptoms by means of the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), and the presence of impulse control disorders (ICDs) with the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (QUIP). Clinical and pharmacological data have also been recorded. No significant differences in mood state distribution between groups were observed. Nevertheless, as regards the mood state distribution within groups, in n-MF (47.6%) and MF patients (50%), (hypo)mania presence was significantly higher than other symptoms. In DN patients, hypomania showed a prevalence of 38.1% although it was not significant. At least one ICD was reported in 29.3% of n-MF and 50% of MF patients. In the MF group, a moderate positive correlation between ISS ACTivation subscale scores and the presence of ICDs and compulsive medication use emerged. Finally, MF patients reported higher BDI-II total scores than DN. Our results show that mood alterations in PD, considering both depressive symptoms and mood elevation, are related to the advanced stages of the disease as well as the presence of ICDs, and dopaminergic therapy would not always be able to restore a normal mood condition.",

While pharmacological advancements have been a mainstay in the treatment of PD for decades, it is becoming increasingly clear that nonpharmacological approaches including traditional and nontraditional forms of exercise and physical rehabilitation can be critical adjunctive or even primary treatment avenues. Here, we provide an overview of preclinical and clinical research detailing the biological role of proinflammatory molecules in PD and how motor rehabilitation can be used to therapeutically modulate neuroinflammation, restore neural plasticity, and improve motor function in PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the burden and the quality of life (QoL) perceived by caregivers assisting advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.\nConsecutive advanced PD patients treated with levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) or continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI) or care as usual (CU) and their care partners were recruited during routine visits according to a cross-sectional design. Caregiver's distress was assessed by Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and a QoL survey to evaluate and understand the burden experienced by care partners during family and working activities.\nA total of 126 patients (53 LCIG, 19 CSAI and 54 CU) and their care partners were enrolled. The ZBI score boxplot showed that LCIG and CU populations have a similar distribution (ZBI inter-quartile range [IQR] values respectively 18-42 for LCIG and 19-43 for CU group), while the CSAI group has a wider score range (IQR 16-52). Caregivers assisting patients in treatment with LCIG have more time to perform family or household duties (p=0.0022), or to engage in leisure activities (p=0.0073) compared to CU, while no difference was found when compared to CSAI group. Approximately 50% of the care partners showed mood changes in the last 6 months and LCIG and CSAI had less impact on caregiver's mood compared to CU. Patients treated with LCIG were more independent in taking a bath or shower without assistance and were more able to move and walk without assistance.\nCare partners of advanced PD patients treated with device-aided therapies have more time for their own life and a better perception of their QoL with a tendency to an improvement of mood compared with those of patients treated with CU.",

The ZBI score boxplot showed that LCIG and CU populations have a similar distribution (ZBI inter-quartile range [IQR] values respectively 18-42 for LCIG and 19-43 for CU group), while the CSAI group has a wider score range (IQR 16-52). Caregivers assisting patients in treatment with LCIG have more time to perform family or household duties (p=0.0022), or to engage in leisure activities (p=0.0073) compared to CU, while no difference was found when compared to CSAI group. Approximately 50% of the care partners showed mood changes in the last 6 months and LCIG and CSAI had less impact on caregiver's mood compared to CU. Patients treated with LCIG were more independent in taking a bath or shower without assistance and were more able to move and walk without assistance.",

    "abstract": "Digital assessments of motor severity could improve the sensitivity of clinical trials and personalise treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) but have yet to be widely adopted. Their ability to capture individual change across the heterogeneous motor presentations typical of PD remains inadequately tested against current clinical reference standards. We conducted a prospective, dual-site, crossover-randomised study to determine the ability of a 16-item smartphone-based assessment (the index test) to predict subitems from the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (MDS-UPDRS III) as assessed by three blinded clinical raters (the reference-standard). We analysed data from 60 subjects (990 smartphone tests, 2628 blinded video MDS-UPDRS III subitem ratings). Subject-level predictive performance was quantified as the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) accuracy. A pre-specified analysis classified 70.3% (SEM 5.9%) of subjects into a similar category to any of three blinded clinical raters and was better than random (36.7%; SEM 4.3%) classification. Post hoc optimisation of classifier and feature selection improved performance further (78.7%, SEM 5.1%), although individual subtests were variable (range 53.2-97.0%). Smartphone-based measures of motor severity have predictive value at the subject level. Future studies should similarly mitigate against subjective and feature selection biases and assess performance across a range of motor features as part of a broader strategy to avoid overly optimistic performance estimates.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) has increased globally, especially in older age groups. Older age at onset is associated with more severe motor and nonmotor symptoms at diagnosis and more rapid and severe progression. Because majority of older people have multiple comorbidities, patients with PD may be misdiagnosed. Limited response to L-dopa medication in the older patients has been indicated. The risk of motor complications decreases with increasing age, while the risk of axial complications, hallucinations, and dementia increases. Evidence for many of the currently used PD medications is based on clinical trials with the criteria that exclude older patients, and it will be necessary to establish evidence of medication for PD in older patients.",

    "abstract": "Gut dysbiosis has been repeatedly reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) but only once in idiopathic rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) from Germany. Abnormal aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein fibrils causing PD possibly starts from the intestine, although this is still currently under debate. iRBD patients frequently develop PD. Early-stage gut dysbiosis that is causally associated with PD is thus expected to be observed in iRBD. We analyzed gut microbiota in 26 iRBD patients and 137 controls by 16S rRNA sequencing (16S rRNA-seq). Our iRBD data set was meta-analyzed with the German iRBD data set and was compared with gut microbiota in 223 PD patients. Unsupervised clustering of gut microbiota by LIGER, a topic model-based tool for single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, revealed four enterotypes in controls, iRBD, and PD. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria were conserved in an enterotype observed in controls and iRBD, whereas they were less conserved in enterotypes observed in PD. Genus ",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FoG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been associated with response inhibition. However, the relationship between response inhibition, neural dysfunction, and PD remains unclear. We assessed response inhibition and microstructural integrity of brain regions involved in response inhibition [right hemisphere inferior frontal cortex (IFC), bilateral pre-supplementary motor areas (preSMA), and subthalamic nuclei (STN)] in PD subjects with and without FoG and elderly controls.\nTwenty-one people with PD and FoG (PD-FoG), 18 without FoG (PD-noFoG), and 19 age-matched controls (HC) completed a Stop-Signal Task (SST) and MRI scan. Probabilistic fiber tractography assessed structural integrity (fractional anisotropy, FA) among IFC, preSMA, and STN regions.\nStop-signal performance did not differ between PD and HC, nor between PD-FoG and PD-noFoG. Differences in white matter integrity were observed across groups (.001 < p < .064), but were restricted to PD versus HC groups; no differences in FA were observed between PD-FoG and PD-noFoG (p > .096). Interestingly, worse FoG was associated with higher (better) mean FA in the r-preSMA, (\u03b2 = .547, p = .015). Microstructural integrity of the r-IFC, r-preSMA, and r-STN tracts correlated with stop-signal performance in HC (p \u2264 .019), but not people with PD.\nThese results do not support inefficient response inhibition in PD-FoG. Those with PD exhibited white matter loss in the response inhibition network, but this was not associated with FoG, nor with response inhibition deficits, suggesting FoG-specific neural changes may occur outside the response inhibition network. As shown previously, white matter loss was associated with response inhibition in elderly controls, suggesting PD may disturb this relationship.",

    "abstract": "The utility of informant-based measures of cognitive decline to accurately describe objective cognitive performance in Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia is uncertain. Due to the clinical relevance of this information, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between informant-based reports of patient cognitive decline via the Informant Questionnaire of Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) and objective cognition in non-demented PD controlling for cognitive status (i.e., mild cognitive impairment; PD-MCI and normal cognition; PD-NC).\nOne-hundred and thirty-nine non-demented PD participants (PD-MCI n = 38; PD-NC n = 101) were administered measures of language, executive function, attention, learning, delayed recall, visuospatial function, mood, and motor function. Each participant identified an informant to complete the IQCODE and a mood questionnaire.\nGreater levels of informant-based responses of patient cognitive decline on the IQCODE were significantly associated with worse objective performance on measures of global cognition, attention, learning, delayed recall, and executive function in the overall sample, above and beyond covariates and cognitive status. However, the IQCODE was not significantly associated with language or visuospatial function.\nResults indicate that informant responses, as measured by the IQCODE, may provide adequate information on a wide range of cognitive abilities in non-demented PD, including those with MCI and normal cognition. Findings have important clinical implications for the utility of the IQCODE in the identification of PD patients in need of further evaluation, monitoring, and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Many persons living with Parkinson's disease (PD) have difficulty rising from a chair. Impaired ability to perform the chair rise may be associated with low physical activity levels and reduced ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL).\nCross-sectional analysis was performed in 88 persons with PD to study the association of chair rising ability with ADL and physical activity.\nWe found that the participants who pushed themselves up from the chair had more severe PD, higher motor impairment and more comorbidity than those who rose from a chair normally. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale ADL (UPDRS-ADL), Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale (SE-ADL) and the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) scores for the participants who pushed themselves up to rise (17.20\u2009\u00b1\u20097.53; 76.67\u2009\u00b1\u200913.23; 46.18\u2009\u00b1\u200952.64, respectively) were significantly poorer than for those who rose normally (10.35\u2009\u00b1\u20093.79; 87.64\u2009\u00b1\u20098.30; 112.90\u2009\u00b1\u200961.40, respectively) (all p\u2009<\u2009.05).

    "abstract": "Despite being introduced in clinical practice more than 20 years ago, selection criteria for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) rely on a document published in 1999 called 'Core Assessment Program for Surgical Interventional Therapies in Parkinson's Disease'. These criteria are useful in supporting the selection of candidates. However, they are both restrictive and out-of-date, because the knowledge on PD progression and phenotyping has massively evolved. Advances in understanding the heterogeneity of PD presentation, courses, phenotypes, and genotypes, render a better identification of good DBS outcome predictors a research priority. Additionally, DBS invasiveness, cost, and the possibility of serious adverse events make it mandatory to predict as accurately as possible the clinical outcome when informing the patients about their suitability for surgery. In this viewpoint, we analyzed the pre-surgical assessment according to the following topics: early versus delayed DBS; the evolution of the levodopa challenge test; and the relevance of axial symptoms; patient-centered outcome measures; non-motor symptoms; and genetics. Based on the literature, we encourage rethinking of the selection process for DBS in PD, which should move toward a broad clinical and instrumental assessment of non-motor symptoms, quantitative measurement of gait, posture, and balance, and in-depth genotypic and phenotypic characterization.",

    "abstract": "The immune system has been increasingly recognized as a major contributor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The double-edged nature of the immune system poses a problem in harnessing immunomodulatory therapies to prevent and slow the progression of this debilitating disease. To tackle this conundrum, understanding the mechanisms underlying immune-mediated neuronal death will aid in the identification of neuroprotective strategies to preserve dopaminergic neurons. Specific innate and adaptive immune mediators may directly or indirectly induce dopaminergic neuronal death. Genetic factors, the gut-brain axis and the recent identification of PD-specific T cells may provide novel mechanistic insights on PD pathogenesis. Future studies to address the gaps in the identification of autoantibodies, variability in immunophenotyping studies and the contribution of gut dysbiosis to PD may eventually provide new therapeutic targets for PD.",

    "abstract": "It is unclear how dual-task gait influences the lower limb range of motion (RoM) in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and freezing of gait (FOG). The lower limb kinematics during dual-task gait might differ from regular gait, but during what events in the gait cycle?\nThis is an observational within-subjects study. Thirty-two individuals with PD and FOG underwent a gait analysis. Single and dual-task gait was assessed by a 3D motion analysis system and the RoM data of the lower limb were extracted from hips, knees and ankles in the sagittal plane. Dual-task assignment was performed using word-color interference test. To compare both gait conditions, we used two different analyses: (1) common discrete analysis to provide lower limb RoM and (2) Statistical Parametric Mapping analysis (SPM) to provide lower limb joint kinematics. A correlation between lower limb RoM and spatiotemporal gait parameters was also performed for each gait condition.\nCommon discrete analysis evidenced reductions in RoM of hips, knees and ankles during the dual task gait when compared to single gait. SPM analysis showed reductions in flexion-extension of hip, knees and ankles joints when dual task was compared to single task gait. These reductions were observed in specific gait events as toe off (for knees and ankles) and heel strike (for all joints). The reduction in lower limb RoM was positively correlated with the reduction in step length and gait speed.\nLower limb joints kinematics were reduced during toe off and heel strike in dual task gait when compared to single gait. These findings might help physiotherapists to understand the influence of dual and single walking in lower limb RoM throughout the gait cycle in people with PD and FOG.",

    "abstract": "Gait impairment is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Natural walking involves more cognitive demand than treadmill walking or in-laboratory walking tests because patients have to actively work on navigation and top-down cognitive control which taxes cognitive reserve in the prefrontal cortex. To mimic the prefrontal engagement occurring with natural walking in a controlled and safe environment, dual-task (DT) treadmill walking has been developed. In this study, we tested the feasibility of imaging DT walking-related changes in brain glucose metabolism in patients with PD.\nFifteen patients with PD were scanned with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography. Five patients performed DT walking, and 10 patients were rested during the FDG uptake period. First, the images were contrasted between the groups. Second, the walking-related brain glucose metabolism was inspected at the individual level.\nConsistently increased glucose metabolism was identified in DT walking versus rest in the primary visual/sensorimotor areas, thalamus, superior colliculus, and cerebellum. In individual level analysis, patients with less progressed disease (n = 3) showed prefrontal activity during DT walking while patients with more progressed disease (n = 2) did not.\nThis study confirms the feasibility of imaging glucose metabolism during DT walking in patients with PD. We also report that during DT walking, there is a lesser degree of prefrontal engagement in the patients with more progressed disease compared to those with less progressed disease, implying increased degrees of frontal dysfunction with PD progression.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this systematic review was (1) to identify the brain regions involved in anxiety in Parkinson's disease (PD) based on neuroimaging studies and (2) to interpret the findings against the background of dysfunction of the fear circuit and limbic cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuit.\nStudies assessing anxiety symptoms in PD patients and studies using magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, or single-photon emission computed tomography were included.\nThe severity of anxiety was associated with changes in the fear circuit and the cortico-striato-thalamocortical limbic circuit. In the fear circuit, a reduced gray-matter volume of the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); an increased functional connectivity (FC) between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hippocampus and between the striatum and the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), temporal cortex, and insula; and a reduced FC between the lateral PFC and the OFC, hippocampus, and amygdala were reported. In the cortico-striato-thalamocortical limbic circuit, a reduced FC between the striatum and ACC; a reduced dopaminergic and noradrenergic activity in striatum, thalamus, and locus coeruleus; and a reduced serotoninergic activity in the thalamus were reported.\nTo conclude, anxiety is associated with structural and functional changes in both the hypothesized fear and the limbic cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuits. These circuits overlap and may well constitute parts of a more extensive pathway, of which different parts play different roles in anxiety. The neuropathology of PD may affect these circuits in different ways, explaining the high prevalence of anxiety in PD and also the associated cognitive, motor, and psychiatric symptoms. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting more than 1% of the population above 60 years old with both motor and non-motor symptoms of escalating severity as it progresses. Since it cannot be cured, treatment options focus on the improvement of PD symptoms. In fact, evidence suggests that early PD intervention has the potential to slow down symptom progression and improve the general quality of life in the long term. However, the initial motor symptoms are usually very subtle and, as a result, patients seek medical assistance only when their condition has substantially deteriorated; thus, missing the opportunity for an improved clinical outcome. This situation highlights the need for accessible tools that can screen for early motor PD symptoms and alert individuals to act accordingly. Here we show that PD and its motor symptoms can unobtrusively be detected from the combination of accelerometer and touchscreen typing data that are passively captured during natural user-smartphone interaction. To this end, we introduce a deep learning framework that analyses such data to simultaneously predict tremor, fine-motor impairment and PD. In a validation dataset from 22 clinically-assessed subjects (8 Healthy Controls (HC)/14 PD patients with a total data contribution of 18.305 accelerometer and 2.922 typing sessions), the proposed approach achieved 0.86/0.93 sensitivity/specificity for the binary classification task of HC versus PD. Additional validation on data from 157 subjects (131 HC/26 PD with a total contribution of 76.528 accelerometer and 18.069 typing sessions) with self-reported health status (HC or PD), resulted in area under curve of 0.87, with sensitivity/specificity of 0.92/0.69 and 0.60/0.92 at the operating points of highest sensitivity or specificity, respectively. Our findings suggest that the proposed method can be used as a stepping stone towards the development of an accessible PD screening tool that will passively monitor the subject-smartphone interaction for signs of PD and which could be used to reduce the critical gap between disease onset and start of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement, whose early signs may be mild and unnoticed. \u03b1-Synuclein has been identified as the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are the characteristic proteinaceous deposits that are the hallmarks of PD. In this work, three alpha-synuclein peptides were synthesized as templates for the molecular imprinting of conductive polymers to enable recognition of alpha-synuclein via ultrasensitive electrochemical measurements. The peptide sequences encompassed specific residues where mutations are known to accelerate PD (though the target sequences, in this study, were wild-type.) The different peptide targets were all successfully imprinted, but with differing imprinting effectiveness, probably owing to differences in target carboxylic acids (which can bind to the aniline (AN) m-aminobenzenesulfonic acid (MSAN) MIP polymers.) Composition of the imprinted polymer, (the mole proportions of AN and MSAN), and the concentrations and sequences of imprinted peptide templates were optimized by measuring the electrochemical responses to target peptides. The imprinted electrode can detect alpha-synuclein at fg/mL levels, and was therefore used to measure alpha-synuclein in the culture medium of human brain organoids generated from normal and idiopathic PD patients.",

    "abstract": "The factors that contribute to the difficulties persons with Parkinson Disease (PwPD) have when negotiating transitions in walking surfaces are not completely known. The authors investigated if PwPD adjusted their step characteristics when negotiating a familiar outdoor surface transition between synthetic concrete and synthetic turf. Force plate and motion capture data were collected for 10 participants with mild to moderate Parkinson disease and 5 healthy older control participants ambulating bidirectionally across the transition between synthetic concrete and synthetic turf. Between groups, PwPD had a significantly higher minimum toe clearance (P = .007) for both directions of travel compared with the healthy control group. Within groups, PwPD significantly increased their hip (P < .001) and ankle (P = .016) range of motion walking from concrete to turf, while the healthy control participants significantly increased their minimum toe clearance (P = .013), margin of stability (P = .019), hip (P < .001) and ankle (P = .038) range of motion, and step length (P < .001). Walking from turf to concrete, both the Parkinson disease group (P = .014) and the healthy control group (P < .001) increased their knee range of motion. Both groups adjusted their step characteristics when negotiating known surface transitions, indicating that surface transitions result in step changes regardless of health status. However, PwPD exhibited overcompensations, particularly in their minimum toe clearance.",

We observed RBD in 77% of 540 Parkinson patients, with rising frequency at higher age and regardless of sex, in >89% of 89 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies or multiple system atrophy, and in <15% of 42 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal degeneration. Thus, the prevalence of RBD in sporadic Parkinson disease might be higher than previously assumed, particularly in elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "Research addressing perceptions of housing in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is rare, and existing instruments capturing perceived aspects of housing are rarely used. Perceived housing comprises of several domains and is associated with health in general older populations. One such domain is meaning of home, captured by the Meaning of Home Questionnaire (MOH). The aim of this study was to evaluate psychometric properties of the MOH among people with PD.\nThe MOH was administrated to 245 participants with PD (mean age = 69.9 years; mean PD duration = 9.7 years). The instrument consisted of four sub-scales with 28 items, each with 11 response options (strongly disagree = 0; strongly agree = 10). We evaluated data quality, structural validity (factor analysis), construct validity (i.e., testing correlations with relevant constructs according to pre-defined hypotheses), corrected item total correlations, floor and ceiling effects and internal consistency.\nThe data quality was high (0-1.2% missing data). The exploratory factor analysis suggested removal of five items and revealed three new factors; \"My home is my castle\", \"My home is my prison\" and \"My home is my social hub\". The 23-item MOH showed statistically significant correlations with life satisfaction, usability and ADL dependence, while not correlated with number of environmental barriers. These findings were largely as hypothesised, thus supporting construct validity (both convergent and discriminant). The corrected item total correlations were >0.3 for all items and the internal consistency was >0.70 for all sub-scales. No floor or ceiling effects were reported except for the sub-scale \"My home is my castle\" (ceiling effect = 15.6%).\nThe 23-item MOH version with three new sub-scales is sufficiently reliable and valid for use in PD populations. This paves the way for further research of meaning of home among people with PD, using the 23-item MOH version.",

    "results": "The data quality was high (0-1.2% missing data). The exploratory factor analysis suggested removal of five items and revealed three new factors; \"My home is my castle\", \"My home is my prison\" and \"My home is my social hub\". The 23-item MOH showed statistically significant correlations with life satisfaction, usability and ADL dependence, while not correlated with number of environmental barriers. These findings were largely as hypothesised, thus supporting construct validity (both convergent and discriminant). The corrected item total correlations were >0.3 for all items and the internal consistency was >0.70 for all sub-scales. No floor or ceiling effects were reported except for the sub-scale \"My home is my castle\" (ceiling effect = 15.6%).",

    "abstract": "Managing the heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease symptoms and its progressive nature demands strategies targeting the hallmark disrupted neurotransmission but also the comorbid derangements and bolstering neuroprotection and regeneration. Strong efforts are done to find disease-modifying strategies, since slowing disease progression is not enough to hamper its burden and some motor symptoms are resistant to dopamine-replacement therapy. The inclusion of non-pharmacological strategies can provide such a multitarget umbrella approach. The silent long-term biological process that precedes the clinical onset of disease is a challenge but also an opportunity to reinforce healthy lifestyle known to exert preventive/therapeutic effects. These non-pharmacological strategies are foreseen as able to reduce the prevalence and the global impact of long-term diseases demanding strong management of patient-caregiver quality of life. In this regard, European guidelines for Parkinson's disease recommend physical-related activities such as aerobic exercise and dancing known to improve functional mobility and balance in patients. Here, we propose \"PasoDoble,\" a novel dance/music patient-caregiver intervention with additional preventive value. The rationale is founded on evidence-based therapeutic benefits of dance/music therapy and the singular features of this widely extended Hispanic dance/music targeting motor symptoms, mood/cognition, and socialization: (i) As a dance, an easy and simple double-step pattern (back-and-forward and lateral movements) that evolves from a spontaneous individual dance to a partnered dancing, performed in social groups and involving dancing-figures of increasing complexity; (ii) \"PasoDoble,\" as a music that can be sung, has musical rhythmicity with high groove and familiarity that will help to synchronize the steps to the rhythm of music; (iii) Widely extended (Spain, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and USA) and easy-to-learn for others. As a regular dancing \"PasoDoble\" can improve and preserve function, mood and socialization, as an intervention the method is structured to improve gait and balance; facilitate movement, reaching and grasping; muscle power and joint mobility; reduce of risk of falls, and increase of aerobic capacity. Finally, this easy-to-implement into patient care and free-living environments (elderly social centers, home care) rehabilitation programs can promote positive emotions and self-esteem, with added general improvement of social attachment and recognition, thus improving the quality of life of patient-caregiver.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the value of MRI-based radiomic model based on the radiomic features of different basal nuclei in differentiating idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) from Parkinsonian variants of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P).\nRadiomics was applied to the 3T susceptibility- weighted imaging (SWI) from 102 MSA-P patients and 83 IPD patients (allocated to a training and a testing cohort, 7:3 ratio). The substantia nigra (SN), caudate nucleus (CN), putamen (PUT), globus pallidus (GP), red nucleus (RN), and subthalamic nucleus (STN) were manually segmented, and 396 features were extracted. After feature selection, support vector machine (SVM) was generated, and its predictive performance was calculated in both the training and testing cohorts using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\nSeven radiomic features were selected from the PUT, by which the SVM classifier achieved the best diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.867 in the training cohort and an AUC of 0.862 in the testing cohort. Furthermore, the combined model, which incorporating part III of the Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRSIII) scores into radiomic features of the PUT, further improved the diagnostic performance. However, radiomic features extracted from RN, SN, GP, CN, and STN had moderate to poor diagnostic performance, with AUC values that ranged from 0.610 to 0.788 in the training cohort and 0.583 to 0.766 in the testing cohort.\nRadiomic features derived from the PUT had optimal value in differentiating IPD from MSA-P. A combined radiomic model, which contained radiomic features of the PUT and UPDRSIII scores, further improved performance and may represent a promising tool for distinguishing between IPD and MSA-P.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders are very common in patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). However, comorbidity with Bipolar Spectrum disorders is understudied. The aim of this study is to explore the clinical correlates of PD associated with Bipolar Spectrum disorders.\nOne hundred PD patients were screened for psychiatric comorbidities, cognitive profile, motor, and non-motor symptoms. The sample was divided into three groups: PD-patients with Bipolar Spectrum disorders (bipolar disorder type I, type II, and spontaneous or induced hypomania; N\u00a0=\u00a032), PD-patients with others psychiatric comorbidities (N\u00a0=\u00a039), PD-patients without psychiatric comorbidities (N\u00a0=\u00a029). Clinical features were compared among the groups using analysis of variance and chi-square test. A logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between Bipolar Spectrum disorders and early onset of PD (\u226450\u00a0years) controlling for lifetime antipsychotic use.\nIn comparison with PD patients with and without other psychiatric comorbidity, subjects affected by Bipolar Spectrum disorders were younger, showed more frequently an early onset PD, reported more involuntary movements and a higher rate of impulse control disorders and compulsive behaviors. No differences were observed in indexes of exposure to dopamine agonist treatments. The early onset of PD was predicted by Bipolar Spectrum comorbidity, independently from lifetime antipsychotic use.\nBipolar Spectrum disorders are common in early onset PD. The presence of bipolar comorbidity could identify a particular subtype of PD, showing higher rates of neurological and psychiatric complications and deserving further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well-established treatment for psychiatric disorders, including depression and psychosis. ECT has been reported to be effective in treating such psychiatric symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and has been also reported to be effective in treating motor symptoms. The aim of the study is to summarize previous clinical studies investigating the efficacy of ECT for symptoms in patients with PD.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of any study designs assessing motor and/or non-motor symptoms in patients with PD before and after ECT. Co-primary outcomes were set as motor manifestations assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale or other rating scales, and non-motor symptoms included depression and psychosis. Secondary outcomes were wearing-off phenomenon and cognitive function. The impact of ECT on those symptoms was examined by comparing the severity of the symptoms before and after ECT using a random effect model and was expressed in standardized mean difference.\nOf 1219 identified citations, 14 studies (n = 129; 1 randomized controlled study, 9 prospective observational studies, and 4 retrospective studies) were analyzed. The findings were as follows: ECT significantly improved motor manifestations in patients with PD, and the improvement was significant in the subpopulation without psychiatric symptoms; ECT significantly improved depression and psychosis; and ECT significantly relieved wearing-off phenomenon and did not worsen cognitive functioning.\nThe current meta-analysis suggests the potential benefit of ECT on motor and non-motor symptoms in presumably complicated and difficult-to-treat subgroups. \u00a9 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

A multidisciplinary care model needs to be impactful, feasible, and viable economically for widespread utilization. Supportive evidence is lacking.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the implementation and impact of a pragmatic network for PD care, the Integrated Parkinson Care Network (IPCN).\nA 6-month, pre-post design, single-center, phase 2 study for complex interventions for patients with newly diagnosed (<1\u2009year) and advanced (diagnosis >8\u2009years) PD was used to assess a patient-centered care model based on integrated care, self-management support, and technology-enabled care. We comprehensively assessed the implementation of care paths, change in selected health and care quality outcomes after the Integrated Parkinson Care Network program, and costs analyses.\nWe recruited 100 participants in 6\u2009months. Overall, the top care priorities were speech and communication (33.7%), anxiety and depression (31.6%), and mobility, balance, and falls (29.6%), and the most commonly (>45%) used resources were speech-language pathology, community seniors services, and physiotherapy. Care priorities were met successfully in 90.6% of the cases, and there was a positive change in the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (2.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-5.0; statistically significant in the advanced group), the perception of support for chronic care (Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Case score, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.4), and self-management (5As score, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.4). The total cost of the Integrated Parkinson Care Network was C$1367 per patient.\nA pragmatic development of a care delivery network based on integrated care and self-management support is promising for its feasibility, impact, and a sustainable cost. \u00a9 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) at its early stages remains a challenge for modern clinicians. In this study, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to address this problem. In particular, we develop a CNN-based network model highly capable of discriminating PD patients based on Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images from healthy controls. A total of 2723 SPECT images are analyzed in this study, of which 1364 images from the healthy control group, and the other 1359 images are in the PD group. Image normalization process is carried out to enhance the regions of interests (ROIs) necessary for our network to learn distinguishing features from them. A 10-fold cross-validation is implemented to evaluate the performance of the network model. Our approach demonstrates outstanding performance with an accuracy of 99.34 %, sensitivity of 99.04 % and specificity of 99.63 %, outperforming all previously published results. Given the high performance and easy-to-use features of our network, it can be deduced that our approach has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis of PD and its management.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the association of routine blood test values and blood cell ratios with the risk or severity of Parkinson's disease (PD). The medical records of 453 PD patients and 436 controls were retrospectively reviewed. The severity of PD was quantified by the modified Hoehn-Yahr (HY) scale. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) of significant values/ratios and used logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between principal components (PCs) and the risk of PD. Spearman correlation and ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between indicators and the severity of PD. The PCA generated 9 PCs, which contributed to 90.86% of the total variance. Logistic regression analysis revealed positive associations of PC2 (a measure monocyte ratios) and PC6 (a measure of platelet ratios and volume) and negative associations of PC1 (a comprehensive measure of lymphocyte, eosinophil, neutrophil, and red blood cell values), PC4 (a measure of red blood cell values), and PC7 (a measure of red blood cell values and platelet volume) with the risk of PD. However, we observed no associations of variables with the severity of PD. In conclusion, PCA reduced the dimensionality of the data. Peripheral blood disorders may be associated with PD.",

The risk of sarcopenia was assessed using the SARC-F and SARC-CalF questionnaires, the latter of which includes the calf circumference as an additional item.\nSixty patients were evaluated (mean age: 68.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.5\u00a0years). The prevalence of sarcopenia was 21.7% according to EWGSOP-2 and 55.0% according to EWGSOP-1. Positive screening for sarcopenia was 30% according to the SARC-F and 36.7% according to SARC-CalF.

    "abstract": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in Parkinson's disease, but the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. DHA is metabolized to DHA epoxides (EDPs) and hydroxides by cytochrome P450s (P450s), and EDPs are further hydroxylated to the corresponding diols, dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acids (DHDPs) by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). In the present study, we investigated the roles of these DHA metabolites in the beneficial effects of DHA supplementation on a rotenone-induced rat model of Parkinson's disease. Metabolite analysis by LC-MS revealed that CYP2A1, 2C11, 2C13, 2C23, and 2E1 contributed to the formation of EDPs, and these P450s and sEH were expressed in the rat brain. We found that DHA supplementation in rats improved the motor dysfunction induced by rotenone. In addition, DHA reversed the decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase and the increase in lipid peroxidation generated by rotenone in the striatum. DHA supplementation also induced mRNA expression of antioxidant genes, such as sod1 and catalase, and Nrf2 protein expression in the striatum. However, these effects of DHA supplementation were eliminated by cosupplementation with the sEH inhibitor TPPU. Supplementation with DHA increased the amount of 19,20-DHDP in the rat brain, while the amount of EDPs was not significantly increased. In addition, TPPU suppressed the increase in DHDPs and increased EDPs in the brain. In PC12 cells, 19,20-DHDP increased the mRNA levels of sod1 and catalase along with Nrf2 induction. This study suggests that DHA metabolites-DHDPs generated by P450s and sEH-have an important role in improving rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The dithiocarbamate fungicide maneb (MB) has attracted interest due to increasing concern of the negative health effects of pesticides, as well as its association with Parkinson's disease (PD). Our laboratory has previously reported distinct phenotypic changes of neuroblastoma cells exposed to acute, sub-toxic levels of MB, including decreased mitochondrial respiration, altered lactate dynamics, and metabolic stress. In this study, we aimed to further define the specific molecular mechanisms of MB toxicity through the comparison of several thiol-containing compounds and their effects on cellular energy metabolism and thiol redox nodes. Extracellular flux analyses and stable isotope labeled tracer metabolomics were employed to evaluate alterations in energy metabolism of SK-N-AS human neuroblastoma cells after acute exposure of an array of compounds, including dithiocarbamates (maneb, nabam, zineb) and other thiol-containing small molecules (glutathione, N-acetylcysteine). These studies revealed MB and its methylated form (MeDTC) as unique toxicants with significant alterations to mitochondrial respiration, proliferation, and glycolysis. We observed MB to significantly impact cellular thiol redox status by oxidizing cellular glutathione and altering the thiol redox status of peroxiredoxin 3 (Prx3, mitochondrial) after acute exposure. Redox Western blotting revealed a MB-specific modification of cellular Prx3, strengthening the argument that MB can preferentially target mitochondrial enzymes containing reactive cysteine thiols. Further, stable isotope tracer metabolomics confirmed our energetics assessments, and demonstrated that MB exposure results in acute derangement of central carbon metabolism. Specifically, we observed shunting of cellular glucose into the pentose-phosphate pathway and reduction of TCA intermediates derived from glucose and glutamine. Also, we report novel lactate utilization for TCA enrichment and glutathione synthesis after MB exposure. In summary, our results further confirm that MB exerts its toxic effects via thiol modification, and significantly transforms central carbon metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Members of the transmembrane (TMEM) protein family have been identified to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. However, most studies were based on the European-ancestry population and were still awaiting replications. Here, we aimed to systematically evaluate the associations of TMEMs with PD in a large Chinese early-onset PD (EOPD, age at onset <50\u00a0years) cohort. We identified rare variants (minor allele frequency <0.01) in 743 unrelated EOPD patients using whole-exome sequencing and evaluated the association between variants and EOPD at allele and gene levels. Totally 45 rare variants were identified in 6 TMEM protein family members. At allele level, p.176\u00a0K>E in TMEM175 and p.33P>R in TMEM163 were significantly associated with PD. Gene-based burden analysis showed a clear enrichment of TMEM163 variants in EOPD. Our work identifies 2 novel rare variants and TMEM163 as potential risk factors for PD provide a better understanding of the genetic involvement of TMEM protein family members in EOPD and broadens the current mutation spectrum of PD.",

    "abstract": "The PLA2G6 gene has been identified as a causative gene for autosomal recessive early-onset dystonia-parkinsonism. Possible association was reported between single heterozygous PLA2G6 mutation and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), which, however, remained inconclusive. To clarify the effect of heterozygous PLA2G6 variants on the risk of PD, a total of 3710 patients with PD and 2636 controls of Chinese mainland population were recruited and genotyped by whole-exome sequencing or whole-genome sequencing. Variants in the PLA2G6 coding region were extracted and subjected to burden analysis using the optimal sequence kernel association test. In total, we identified 86 rare heterozygous variants in the PLA2G6 coding region, whereas no significant difference was found between cases and controls. Therefore, we found no supportive evidence for heterozygous PLA2G6 variants being a risk factor for PD in Chinese mainland population.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) medications are not readily available in all countries. Citicoline increases dopamine synthesis and inhibits dopamine uptake. This systematic review aims to synthesize current existing evidence on the efficacy of citicoline adjunctive therapy in improving PD symptoms.\nAn extensive literature search of Scopus, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar was conducted for articles published on or before December 31, 2019. The studies were screened and selected by 2 independent reviewers. We included all studies that explored the efficacy of citicoline as an adjunct therapy in PD.\nA total of 7 studies (2 crossover, 3 randomized controlled, and 2 open prospective studies) were included. Despite the varied outcome tools, this review found that patients with PD who were taking citicoline had significant improvement in rigidity, akinesia, tremor, handwriting, and speech. Citicoline allowed effective reduction of levodopa by up to 50%. Significant improvement in cognitive status evaluation was also noted with citicoline adjunctive therapy.\nCiticoline adjuvant therapy has beneficial effects as an adjuvant therapy in patients with PD. However, due to the heterogeneity of the studies, there is a need for more high-quality studies.",

    "abstract": "The consensus is that life expectancy for individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) is reduced, but estimations vary. We aimed to provide an overview of 20 years of mortality and risk factor data from the Queensland Parkinson's Project.\nThe analysis included 1,334 PD and 1,127 control participants. Preliminary analysis of baseline characteristics (sex, age at onset, family history, smoking status, pesticide exposure, depression and neurosurgery) was conducted, and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for each potential risk factor. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated comparing this cohort to the general Australian population. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to analyze potential predictors of mortality.\nIn total, 625 (46.8%) PD and 237 (21.0%) control participants were deceased. Mean disease duration until death was 15.3 \u00b1 7.84 years. Average ages at death were 78.0 \u00b1 7.4 years and 80.4 \u00b1 8.4 years for the deceased PD and control participants, respectively. Mortality was significantly increased for PD in general {SMR = 2.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.53-2.96]; p = 0.001}. SMRs were slightly higher for women and those with an age of onset before 60 years. Multivariate analysis showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment was associated with lower mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.59-0.98], while occasional pesticide exposure increased mortality risk (HR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.17-1.88). Family history of PD, smoking and depression were not independent predictors of mortality.\nMortality in PD is increased. Sex, age at onset and occasional pesticide exposure were independent determinants of increased mortality, while DBS treatment was associated with reduced mortality.",

    "abstract": "The research presented aims at developing Ropinirole hydrochloride (RHCl) nanoemulsion (NE) with nigella oil for Parkinson's disease (PD). In silico study was done to explore interactions of ropinirole and thymoquinone at receptor site (TNF-\u03b1 and NFK-\u03b2). Ropinirole and Thymoquinone forms a hydrogen bond with residue Arginine 201 and residue Arginine 253 with a bond length of 1.89\u00a0\u00c5 and 2.30\u00a0\u00c5 at the NF-\u03ba\u03b2 receptor. NE was optimized using Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD). The globule size of chitosan coated NE, Polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential were 183.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u00a0nm, 0.263\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005, and 24.9\u00a0mV respectively. NE exhibited 85.28% transmittance showing the formulation was clear and transparent. TEM showed that NE had spherical globules with no aggregation. The formulation had a stable pH value of 5.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18. In vitro release and permeation studies exhibited 2 folds and 3.4 folds enhancement when compared with the drug suspension. Neurobehavioral activity and biochemical parameters corroborated well with the pharmacokinetic results. Histopathological study and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to get better picture of 6-OHDA induced toxicity and reversal of PD symptoms. Thus, the NE tailored is a promising synergistic approach yielding enticing outcomes for better management of PD related symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Domperidone is used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. Because of an increased risk of cardiac adverse events, the European Medicines Agency has issued recommendations restricting its use mainly in terms of age, dose, and treatment duration.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate current prescription practices of domperidone in Parkinson's disease among French neurologists.\nA cross-sectional study based on a questionnaire was conducted among French neurologists from Parkinson's disease expert centers from the French NS-Park/FCRIN network, general hospitals, and private practice.\nAmong the 253 neurologists who completed the questionnaire, 86 (34%) were physicians from expert centers and 167 (66%) were from other healthcare settings; 209 (83%) were aware of recommendations restricting domperidone use. The majority of neurologists (92%) declared prescribing domperidone regardless of the age of the patients. Sixty-one percent of neurologists prescribed domperidone beyond 7\u00a0days in newly diagnosed patients, 33% in patients with orthostatic hypotension, and 79% in patients receiving continuous apomorphine treatment. They did not follow the recommendation on posology in newly diagnosed patients (7% of neurologists), patients with orthostatic hypotension (10%), and patients receiving continuous apomorphine therapy (25%). Finally, only 58% of neurologists declared taking specific precautions before prescribing domperidone.\nThese findings show most French neurologists who responded to our questionnaire do not fully follow the restrictions on domperidone use, particularly in terms of treatment duration, and in patients receiving continuous apomorphine treatment. This may reflect the unmet need to prevent nausea in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with dopaminergic drugs, particularly continuous apomorphine therapy.",

The majority of neurologists (92%) declared prescribing domperidone regardless of the age of the patients. Sixty-one percent of neurologists prescribed domperidone beyond 7\u00a0days in newly diagnosed patients, 33% in patients with orthostatic hypotension, and 79% in patients receiving continuous apomorphine treatment. They did not follow the recommendation on posology in newly diagnosed patients (7% of neurologists), patients with orthostatic hypotension (10%), and patients receiving continuous apomorphine therapy (25%). Finally, only 58% of neurologists declared taking specific precautions before prescribing domperidone.",

    "abstract": "Systemic inflammation may be implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Since PD occurs usually in later life, most studies of causal factors are conducted in older populations, so potentially important influences from early life cannot be adequately captured. We investigated whether the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in early adulthood is associated with the subsequent development of PD in men. As part of Swedish national conscription testing conducted from 1968 through 1983 (N\u2009=\u2009716,550), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as a measure of inflammation, was measured in 659,278 young men. The cohort was observed for subsequent PD events (N\u2009=\u20091513) through December 2016. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI with adjustment for potential confounders. Individuals with higher ESRs were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with PD, as ESR was linearly and inversely associated with PD risk. The magnitude of the association between ESR and PD risk was similar for increases up to 15\u00a0mm/h, leveled off thereafter, and was non-significant for ESR values\u2009>\u200920\u00a0mm/h. The HR for PD with basic adjustments (age at conscription, year of conscription, test center and erythrocyte volume fraction) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.99, P\u2009=\u20090.02) per log",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra resulting in severe and progressive motor impairments. However, the mechanisms underlying this neuronal loss remain largely unknown. Oxidative stress and ER stress have been implicated in PD and these factors are known to activate the integrated stress response (ISR). Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a key mediator of the ISR, and has been reported to induce the expression of genes involved in cellular homeostasis. However, during prolonged activation ATF4 can also induce the expression of pro-death target genes. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the role of ATF4 in neuronal cell death in models of PD. We demonstrate that PD neurotoxins (MPP+ and 6-OHDA) and \u03b1-synuclein aggregation induced by pre-formed human alpha-synuclein fibrils (PFFs) cause sustained upregulation of ATF4 expression in mouse cortical and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PD neurotoxins induce the expression of the pro-apoptotic factors Chop, Trb3, and Puma in dopaminergic neurons in an ATF4-dependent manner. Importantly, we have determined that PD neurotoxin and \u03b1-synuclein PFF induced neuronal death is attenuated in ATF4-deficient dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, ectopic expression of ATF4 but not transcriptionally defective ATF4\u0394RK restores sensitivity of ATF4-deficient neurons to PD neurotoxins. Finally, we demonstrate that the eIF2\u03b1 kinase inhibitor C16 suppresses MPP+ and 6-OHDA induced ATF4 activation and protects against PD neurotoxin induced dopaminergic neuronal death. Taken together these results indicate that ATF4 promotes dopaminergic cell death induced by PD neurotoxins and pathogenic \u03b1-synuclein aggregates and highlight the ISR factor ATF4 as a potential therapeutic target in PD.",

    "abstract": "The classic Braak neuropathologic staging model in Parkinson disease (PD) suggests that brain lesions progress from the medulla oblongata to the cortex. An alternative model in which neurodegeneration first occurs in the cortex has also been proposed. These 2 models may correspond to different patient phenotypes. To test these 2 models and to investigate whether they were influenced by the presence of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), we used multimodal MRI and partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) assuming that patients with RBD followed distinct neurodegeneration pattern.\nFifty-four patients with PD (34 with RBD) and 25 healthy volunteers were scanned with T1-weighted, diffusion tensor, and neuromelanin-sensitive imaging. Volume, signal, and mean, axial, and radial diffusivities were calculated in brainstem, basal forebrain, and cortical regions. PLS-PM, estimating a network of causal relationships between blocks of variables, was used to build and test an analytical model based on Braak staging. The overall quality of the model was assessed with goodness of fit coefficient (Gof).\nPLS-PM was run on patients with PD with RBD and without RBD separately. In PD with RBD, a brainstem-to-cortex model had significant Gof (0.71, \nWith the PLS-PM imaging-based model, the neurodegeneration pattern of patients with PD with RBD was consistent with the Braak brainstem-to-cortex model, whereas that of patients without RBD followed the cortex-to-brainstem model.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) may negatively influence the rehabilitative course after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, functional outcomes in this select group remain poorly defined. We compared complication, mortality and revision rates, as well as patient-reported outcomes, and satisfaction between patients with PD and controls after TKA.\nPatients with PD who underwent primary unilateral TKA were identified and matched 1:1 with a control group using propensity scores adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, baseline range of motion, Knee Society Knee Score, Knee Society Function Score, Oxford Knee Score, and 36-item Short-Form Health Survey Mental and Physical Component Summary. Functional outcomes and patient satisfaction were assessed at 6 months and 2 years. Complications, survivorship, and all-cause mortality were analyzed.\nIn total, 114 patients were included. Majority of PD patients had Hoehn and Yahr stage 1 or 2 disease. Overall complication rate was 26.3% in the PD group and 10.5% in the control group (P\u00a0= .030). There was no difference in transfusions, length of stay, and discharge to rehabilitation or readmissions. Patients with PD had more flexion contractures, poorer Knee Society Function Score and Oxford Knee Score at 2 years, and poorer 36-item Short-Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary at 6 months. 80.4% of patients with PD were satisfied compared with 85.5% of controls (P\u00a0= .476). At follow-up of 8.5 \u00b1 2.7 years, one TKA was revised in each group. All-cause mortality was higher in the PD group (15.8% vs 5.3%, P\u00a0= .067).\nAlthough patients with PD had relatively poorer knee function and quality of life, these patients still experienced significant functional gains compared with their preoperative status, and high satisfaction was achieved.\nIII.",

    "abstract": "Othello syndrome (OS) is a type of delusional jealousy, characterized by the false absolute certainty of the infidelity of a partner. This syndrome is not uncommon in Parkinson's Disease (PD), appearing as side effect of Dopaminergic Agonists (DA) therapy. We analyze the observations of five patients with OS, diagnosed in a series of 250 consecutive PD patients during two years. All patients are men, with a particularly young age at onset of PD. The mean duration of DA therapy at OS onset was 3 years. One patient had hypersexuality and another had punding. Significant cognitive impairment was present in two patients. All patients were treated with DA: two with Pramipexol and three with Piribedil. At the time of the management of the OS, three patients had already divorced their spouse. It is imperative for clinicians to know this underestimated syndrome in order to identify it early and approach it adequately to avoid irreversible negative prejudice.",

    "abstract": "Over recent years, several investigations have suggested that Parkinson's disease (PD) can be regarded as the consequence of a bowel disorder. Indeed, gastrointestinal symptoms can occur at all stages of this neurodegenerative disease and in up to a third of cases, their onset can precede the involvement of the central nervous system. Recent data suggest that enteric glial cells (EGCs) may play a major role in PD-related gastrointestinal disturbances, as well as in the development and progression of the central disease. In addition to their trophic and structural functions, EGCs are crucial for the homeostatic control of a wide range of gastrointestinal activities. The main purpose of this review was to provide a detailed overview of the role of EGCs in intestinal PD-associated alterations, with particular regard for their participation in digestive and central inflammation as well as the dynamic interactions between glial cells and intestinal epithelial barrier. Accumulating evidence suggests that several pathological intestinal conditions, associated with an impairment of barrier permeability, may trigger dysfunctions of EGCs and their shift towards a proinflammatory phenotype. The reactive gliosis is likely responsible for PD-related neuroinflammation and the associated pathological changes in the ENS. Thus, ameliorating the efficiency of mucosal barrier, as well as avoiding IEB disruption and the related reactive gliosis, might theoretically prevent the onset of PD or, at least, counteract its progression.",

    "abstract": "The pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the loss of neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Additionally, numerous studies indicate an altered synaptic function during disease progression. To gain new insights into the molecular processes underlying the alteration of synaptic function in PD, a proteomic study was performed. Therefore, synaptosomes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation from SNpc tissue of individuals at advanced PD stages (N = 5) as well as control subjects free of pathology (N = 5) followed by mass spectrometry-based analysis. In total, 362 proteins were identified and assigned to the synaptosomal core proteome. This core proteome comprised all proteins expressed within the synapses without regard to data analysis software, gender, age, or disease. The differential analysis between control subjects and PD cases revealed that CD9 antigen was overrepresented and fourteen proteins, among them Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2), mitochondrial, 39S ribosomal protein L37, neurolysin, and Methionine-tRNA ligase (MARS2) were underrepresented in PD suggesting an alteration in mitochondrial translation within synaptosomes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a widespread neurodegenerative disease, which is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Clinically, the disease is manifested by tremor, bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, and other motor and non-motor symptoms that ultimately lead to disability. To date, there are only symptomatic treatment options for Parkinson's disease; therefore, the search for new approaches is one of the most important directions of therapy for this disease. In the 1970's the idea of using cell replacement therapy based on the local nature and specificity of damage to a particular type of neuron in Parkinson's disease originated. The selection of the source of cells, the method and place of introduction, indications for this operation, and peculiarities of patient management have been in development for a long time. The efficiency of cell replacement therapy has been confirmed by a number of studies on animal models. Clinical trials have already begun and several more are planned soon. This review describes the main prerequisites for the use of cell replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease, the stages of development of this method, and clinical trials that have started in the last few years.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and their caregivers play an important role in patients' treatment and follow-up. Our study aimed to examine the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms among patients with PD and their caregivers, demographic risk factors, and the influence of severity and manifestations of PD on psychiatric distress.\nWe included 125 patients with PD and 125 of their primary caregivers in this descriptive cross-sectional study. The severity of PD was evaluated according to the Hoehn and Yahr severity scale from the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. PD patients and their caregivers completed the Symptom Checklist-25 to determine the presence of psychiatric distress. Also, demographic factors, including age, high level of education, occupation, residence, and cigarette smoking, were assessed in the PD patients and their caregivers.\nThe prevalence of psychiatric distress was 47.2% for PD patients and 18.4% for caregivers. Female sex, city residency, and medical disease were risk factors for more psychiatric symptoms in PD patients. Also, the female sex, single status, living in a village, and having a medical disease were risk factors for greater psychiatric symptoms in caregivers. PD patients in more advanced stages of disease suffered significantly from psychiatric distress, somatization, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and phobia compared to the lower severity of disease. PD patients with manifestation of postural instability showed a higher score of somatization, phobia, and psychiatric distress as compared with tremor, hypokinesia, and rigidity.\nProgression of PD influenced the psychiatric symptoms of both patients and their caregivers. A higher stage of PD is associated with higher scores of psychiatric distress, phobia, and somatization in the patients and their caregivers.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a prominent nonmotor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), and OD is a supportive diagnostic criterion for PD. Physicians often ask their patients if they have noticed a smell disorder. This study evaluates the diagnostic validity of OD self-assessment in PD. To this end, 64 PD patients and 33 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in a study assessing subjective and objective olfactory functioning. To examine subjective olfactory abilities, first, patients and controls had to classify their olfactory sense as \"impaired\" or \"unimpaired,\" comparable to a realistic situation in an outpatient setting. Second, to evaluate subjective olfactory acuity, a visual analogue scale (VAS) was used. Third, the Sniffin' Sticks test battery was used as an objective instrument to diagnose OD. Categorical olfactory self-assessment predicts the classification normosmic versus hyposmic based on the global Sniffin' Sticks score (TDI) with a sensitivity of 0.79 and a specificity of 0.45. TDI correlated significantly with the VAS (",

    "abstract": "Patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD) have an increased risk for fractures. Currently, many studies have reported inferior outcomes in PD patients after orthopedic procedures. However, there are very few studies assessing the outcome of upper extremity fractures (UEF) in PD patients. In this study, we reviewed 40 patients with PD that received surgical intervention for an UEF. We retrospectively reviewed patients with PD that received surgical fixation for an UEF at a tertiary trauma center. The primary objective was to determine the treatment failure rate after surgical fixation. The secondary outcomes include mode of failure, time to treatment failure, length of hospital stay, readmission rate, reoperation rate, and postoperative complications. A total of 40 patients with PD (42 fractures) underwent surgery. The most common fracture type was radius fracture (n\u2009=\u200919), followed by humerus fracture (n\u2009=\u200915), metacarpal/phalangeal fracture (n\u2009=\u20095), clavicle fracture (n\u2009=\u20092) and olecranon fracture (n\u2009=\u20091). The overall treatment failure rate was 40.5% (n\u2009=\u200917). The time to treatment failure was 1.24\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1\u00a0months and length of hospital stay was 6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9\u00a0days, the readmission rate within 30\u00a0days was 14% (n\u2009=\u20096), and reoperation rate was 14% (n\u2009=\u20096). The complication rate was 16.6% (n\u2009=\u20097) and patients with humeral fractures appeared to have the longest hospital stays (6.6\u00a0days) and increased complication rates (13%, n\u2009=\u20092). Patients with PD have high treatment failure rates despite surgical fixation of an UEF. These patients often have a frail status with multiple comorbidities which may complicate their postoperative course.Level of evidence level 4 case series.",

    "abstract": "Visual hallucinations (VH) are common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still unclear. We aimed to explore the association of the presence of VH with inner retinal thinning and, secondarily, with visual acuity. To this end, we included 40 PD patients in this exploratory study, of whom 14 had VH, and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. All participants were interviewed for the presence of VH by a neurologist specialized in movement disorders and underwent a thorough ophthalmologic examination, including measurement of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and optical coherence tomography to obtain macular scans of the combined ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer (GCL-IPL). Patients with VH had a thinner GCL-IPL than patients without VH, which persisted after correction for age, disease stage, levodopa equivalent daily dose (LED) and cognitive function. Furthermore, BCVA was lower in the PD\u00a0group with VH than in the PD\u00a0group without VH, although only a trend remained after correction for age, disease stage, LED and cognitive function. Taken together, in patients with PD, visual hallucinations appear to be associated with a thinning of the inner retinal layers and, possibly, with reduced visual acuity. Further research using a longitudinal design is necessary to confirm these findings and to establish the causality of these relationships.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease dementia is neuropathologically characterized by aggregates of \u03b1-synuclein (Lewy bodies) in limbic and neocortical areas of the brain with additional involvement of Alzheimer's disease-type pathology. Whilst immune activation is well-described in Parkinson's disease (PD), how it links to protein aggregation and its role in PD dementia has not been explored. We hypothesized that neuroinflammatory processes are a critical contributor to the pathology of PDD. To address this hypothesis, we examined 7 brain regions at postmortem from 17 PD patients with no dementia (PDND), 11 patients with PD dementia\u00a0(PDD), and 14 age and sex-matched neurologically healthy controls. Digital quantification after immunohistochemical staining showed a significant increase in the severity of \u03b1-synuclein pathology in the hippocampus, entorhinal and occipitotemporal cortex of PDD compared to PDND cases. In contrast, there was no difference in either tau or amyloid-\u03b2 pathology between the groups in any of the examined regions. Importantly, we found an increase in activated microglia in the amygdala of demented PD brains compared to controls which correlated significantly with the extent of \u03b1-synuclein pathology in this region.

In Block 2, the physiotherapist spent 6.4\u2009hours providing telehealth to the home-based group (mean 10 (4) minutes per participant) and 32.5\u2009hours delivering the centre-based exercise classes (98\u2009minutes per participant). Participants reported that exercise was helpful, they could follow the home program and they would recommend exercising at home or in a group. However, exercising at home was less satisfying and there was a mixed response to the acceptability of the self-management program. There was no difference between groups in any of the secondary outcome measures (preferred walking speed mean difference -0.04 (95% CI: -0.12 to 0.05).",
