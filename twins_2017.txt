    "abstract": "Being unique is good, but not so for conjoined twins. Cephalothoracopagus is a rare type of conjoined twins, which is a rare monozygotic twinning resulting in imperfect fusion of the head, chest and upper abdomen. These twins have separated limbs and pelvis. The incidence of conjoined twins is 1 per 50,000 to 1 per 200,000 births. The cephalothoracopagus however is very rare variant seen in 1 in 3 million births. In literature approximately 200 cases have been reported till now. The cephalothoracopagus janiceps has two types: disymmetros and asymmetros. We present a case of cephalothoracopagus janiceps disymmetros in a 22-year-old gravida at 19 weeks gestation.",

    "abstract": "Twin or multiple pregnancies often have neonatal complications. Common complications include low birth weight, respiratory distress, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (>5\u00a0days) and low APGAR score especially on second twin. (1) To compare referral rates of newborn hearing screening in twins and triplets between risk and non-risk babies for hearing loss, (2) to determine the effects of birth order on referral rates in twins and triplets. A retrospective study was carried out from the case records of the neonates enrolled in the referral based NICU hearing screening program during April 2013 to December 2014 at Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chennai. 1405 neonates (723 males and 682 females) in the age range of 3-28\u00a0days were screened during this period among which 76 were twins (38 pairs) and 9 were triplets (3 sets). We classified them further into non risk and risk babies among twins according to the Joint Committee for Infant Hearing (JCIH) recommendations. A dual step hearing screening protocol was used to screen the neonates. They were initially tested with distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) then with automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) before discharged from the hospital. Out of 76 (100%) twin babies 43 (56.58%) babies had one or more risk factors for hearing loss. Most common risk factors were low birth weight, premature birth, mechanical ventilation >5\u00a0days, hyperbilirubinemia, infections, ototoxic medications and family history of hearing loss. Each risk factor was observed in equal proportion in 1st born and 2nd born twins. 12 (15.76%) risk babies and 11 (14.47%) non risk babies failed in DPOAE testing. Out of 9 triplets babies (3 set) 3 babies had risk factors for hearing loss. One baby in 2nd born babies group failed AABR screening. Referral rates were slightly higher in 2nd born twins when compared to 1st born twins in DPOAE testing. Chi square test did not reveal any significant association between referral rates with risk factors and birth order (",

    "abstract": "Localized aggressive periodontal disease is an uncommon finding observed in adolescents and children. Studies have been conducted to elucidate the etiology, contributing factors, and genetic roles in the phenomena. In particular, twin studies have shown genetic makeup to be a substantial risk factor for periodontitis. This case is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first to be presented in literature of a same dwelling, set of monozygotic twins, displaying similar presentation of localized aggressive periodontitis, however with different microbial profiles.\nA set of 17-year-old black male monozygotic twins were referred for a full-mouth periodontal evaluation and any necessary periodontal treatment on July 7, 2007. A full-mouth radiographic series, periodontal charting, and intraoral photographs were performed on each individual. A family history was obtained through the biological mother, which yielded no known history of early tooth loss or treatment of severe periodontal disease. The father was not involved in the rearing of the children and his periodontal history was unavailable. An initial and surgical treatment plan was developed. Microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples was collected on the affected sites. Initial treatment with scaling and root planing, subgingival irrigation, with administration of systemic antibiotics, and oral hygiene instruction, were rendered on both individuals.\nWithin limitations of this report, it is demonstrated that different microbial pattern exists on aggressive periodontitis even in genetically identical individuals with the same environmental exposure.",

However, for individual identification in complex situations, such as monozygotic \uff08MZ\uff09 twins assumed to be genetically identical, it is impossible to distinguish one from the other by using traditional forensic DNA typing system. Therefore, how to discriminate the MZ twins has become and will continue to be one of the difficult problems in forensic field.

    "abstract": "Twin births among users of assisted reproductive technology (ART) pose serious risks to both mothers and infants. However, patients may prefer twins and may be unaware of the risks of twin pregnancies. Increasing use of elective single embryo transfers (eSET) through improved patient education could help to reduce twin births and related adverse health consequences. A systematic review of PUBMED and EMBASE databases was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of patient education among ART users on knowledge of twin pregnancy risks, desire for twins, preference for or use of eSET, and twin pregnancy rates. Of 187 references retrieved, six met the selection criteria. Most focused on patients undergoing their first ART cycle aged <\u00a035\u202fyears. Patient education was delivered via written materials, DVDs or discussion. Four studies reporting on knowledge of risks or desire for twins showed significant effects of oral and written descriptions of multiple pregnancy complications, risks of twins versus singletons, and DVDs with factual information. Five studies showed increased eSET use or preference after patients were educated on the risks of multiple pregnancy and success rates associated with different types of ART procedures, when combined with clinic policies that supported single blastocyst transfers or provided options for insurance. In younger ART users, patient education on twin pregnancy risks and success rates of eSET may improve knowledge of twin pregnancy risks and increase use of eSET, and may be important for wider implementation of eSET in countries such as the USA where the use of eSET remains low. Clinic policies of single blastocyst transfers or financial incentives may strengthen these effects.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the relation between Hb levels and the size of the placental anastomoses.\nWe performed a retrospective review of all uncomplicated MC twins delivered vaginally at our center from 2002 to 2017. Hb levels at birth and on day 2 were retrieved. All MC placentas were routinely injected with colored dye and high-resolution pictures were taken for computer-based analysis. We measured the size of arterio-arterial (AA) and veno-venous (VV) anastomoses as well as the total venous size, defined as the sum of the diameter of first generation of placental veins within 5\u202fcm of each cord insertion. We assessed the relation between Hb levels and placental angioarchitecture.\nA total of 170\u202fMC twin pairs were analyzed. Median Hb level in twin 1 was significantly lower than that in twin 2 both at birth (16.0 versus 17.4\u202fg/dl, P\u202f=\u202f0.02) and on day 2 (14.6 versus 18.1\u202fg/dl, P\u202f=\u202f0.000000188).

    "abstract": "Conjoined twin is a rare complication of monozygotic twins resulting from incomplete splitting of an embryo into two separate twins or early secondary fusion of two originally separated embryos. When diagnosed at early gestation, one can get adequate time to counsel the family on whether to continue with the pregnancy and proper intervention can be planned. On the other hand, undiagnosed cases may be first recognized in labor after they have caused labor-related complications. In the present case report, an undiagnosed case of a conjoined twin has presented in labor followed by delivery of one baby with the retention of the second baby. This presented a unique challenge to the managing team and required hysterotomy to effect delivery of the unborn baby. We report this case to highlight the importance of early diagnosis of a conjoined twin. On another hand where this does not happen and a conjoined twin is suspected for the first time after it has caused labor-related complications, the management should be individualized based on the clinical circumstance.",

    "abstract": "Chimerism is a phenomenon in which an individual has cells with different genetic content from different zygotes. In dizygotic twins (DTs), chimerism is believed to occur through placental anastomoses that enable the bidirectional exchange of hematopoietic stem cells. Little is still known about chimerism frequency in twins, but several studies have shown a relation between chimerism and some conditions such as autism, Alzheimer's disease, and a group of autoimmune diseases such as Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis. In addition to chimerism of ABO blood groups being possibly mistaken for ABO subgroups, these autoimmune diseases may affect other serologic immunohematologic tests. This study aimed to determine the frequency of chimerism in DTs through ABO and D testing using the tube method, column agglutination, and short tandem repeat (STR) assays. Among the 103 subjects assessed for this study, 24 subjects (12 pairs) were excluded because STR assays showed they were monozygotic; of the remaining, 70 subjects (35 pairs) were DTs and 9 subjects came from gestations of trizygotic triplets. No ABO or D chimerism was detected in any subject through serologic assays, and STR assays did not detect any blood chimerism. Although there was no evidence of chimerism found in this study, we emphasize the importance of observing the family background of individuals with suspected ABO subgroup in complex immunohematologic studies because ABO antigen-antibody reactions are similar in both circumstances, and chimerism can be overlooked. Moreover, the use of the STR analysis method in chimerism studies can be important to help differentiate chimerism and ABO subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) presents a set of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders with impairments in social communication and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior. Here, based on the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of three monozygotic twins discordant for ASD, we explored multiple patient-specific genetic variations and prioritized a list of ASD risk genes. Our results identified DVMT (discordant variation in monozygotic twin) observed in at least two twin pairs, including 14,310 SNPs, 2,425 indels, and 16,735 CNVs, referring to a total of 2,174 genes, and 37 of these were covered by all three types of variations. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of biological processes for 2,174 genes showed that the majority of these genes were related to neurodevelopmental processes. In addition, functional network analysis showed that there was a strong functional relevance between 37 genes covered by all three types of variations. In conclusion, for the first time, we conducted a comprehensive scan of genomic differences between monozygotic twins discordant for ASD, providing researchers with in-depth directions. It may also provide effective strategies for clinical treatment of individuals affected by ASD.",

    "abstract": "Identification of the potential donor(s) of human germline-derived cells is an issue in many criminal investigations and in paternity testing. The experimental and statistical methodology necessary to work up such cases is well established but may be more challenging if monozygotic (MZ) twins are involved. Then, elaborate genome-wide searches are required for the detection of early somatic mutations that distinguish the cell sample and its donor from the other twin, usually relying upon reference material other than semen (e.g. saliva). The first such cases, involving either criminal sexual offenses or paternity disputes, have been processed successfully by Eurofins Genomics and Forensics Campus. However, when presenting the experimental results in court, common forensic genetic practice requires that the residual uncertainty about donorship is quantified in the form of a likelihood ratio (LR). Hence, we developed a general mathematical framework for LR calculation, presented herein, which allows quantification of the evidence in favour of the true donor in the respective cases, based upon observed DNA sequencing read counts.",

    "abstract": "To investigate associations between anthropometric measures (birthweight, weight gain and current BMI) and back pain; and to determine whether these associations differ between those born with low or full birthweight.\nThe cross-sectional associations between the lifetime prevalence of back pain and anthropometric measures (birthweight, weight gain and current BMI) among 2754 adult twins were investigated in three stages: total sample; within-pair case-control for monozygotic and dizygotic twins together; and within-pair case-control analysis separated by dizygotic and monozygotic. Results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nBirthweight was not associated with back pain (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.99-1.00), but a weak association was found between weight gain (OR 1.01; CI 1.00-1.01) or current BMI (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00-1.05) and back pain in the total sample analysis. These associations did not remain significant after adjusting for genetics. The associations did not differ between those whose were born with low or full birthweight.\nBirthweight was not associated with prevalence of back pain in adulthood. Weight gain and current BMI were weakly associated with back pain prevalence in the total sample analysis but did not differ between those born with low or full birthweight. However, the small-magnitude association only just achieved significance and appeared to be confounded by genetics and the early shared environment.

In addition, numerous studies have shown that monozygotic (MZ) twins generally display greater within-pair cooperation and social closeness than dizygotic (DZ) twins. These findings are illuminated by exploring the occupational histories of two female twin pairs, one set MZ and the other set DZ. This is followed by a review of timely twin-based research reports on molar pregnancy, social support, conjoined twinning, and immune discordance. Finally, news items regarding identical twin politicians, multiple birth marriages, a new Guinness World Record for twins, and a twin-family story from the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Santiago, Chile are both interesting and informative.",

In this review, we present the first case of persistent cloaca and complete urinary tract obstruction in discordant monoamniotic twins.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the neural correlates of emotion regulation and -reactivity in adult unaffected monozygotic twins with a co-twin history of unipolar or bipolar disorder (high-risk), remitted or partially remitted twins with a personal history of unipolar or bipolar disorder (affected) and twins with no personal or first-degree family history of unipolar or bipolar disorder (low-risk).\nWe assessed 37 high-risk, 56 affected and 28 low-risk participants. Participants viewed unpleasant and neutral pictures during functional magnetic resonance imaging and were instructed to down-regulate their emotional response through reappraisal or mental imagery, as well as to maintain the elicited emotion.\nAfter adjusting for subsyndromal depressive symptoms, bilateral supplementary motor areas, posterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortices and the left frontal eye field showed less activity during reappraisal of unpleasant pictures in high-risk than low-risk participants. Notably, affected participants did not differ from high-risk or low-risk participants in neural response during reappraisal. There were no group differences in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex seed based functional connectivity during reappraisal or neural response during mental imagery or emotional reactivity.\nLesser response in dorsal midline areas might reflect familial risk related abnormalities during down regulation of emotional reactivity through reappraisal.",

    "abstract": "The role of epigenetic in regulating of the gene expression profile the embryo has been documented. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one of these epigenetic mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of strabismus and subsequent ocular dominance and amblyopia. Our purpose was to compare the characteristics of sensory visual function in 2 adult monozygotic (genetically identical) twins who presented with esotropia at different ages.\nMonocular and binocular visual function was measured in the twins. Contrast sensitivity was used to assess monocular function. Suppressive and stereoscopic measurements were undertaken to assess binocular function. All tests were run using a 2-alternative forced choice psychophysical procedure. Eighteen short tandem repeats (STR) were genotyped across the genome in both twins to determine their exact relationship.\nTwin 1 (nondominant eye OD) was diagnosed with esotropia at 6 months of age, whereas twin 2 (nondominant eye OS) was diagnosed with esotropia at 5 years of age. They underwent a similar corrective surgical intervention soon after diagnosis to correct their esodeviations. Monocular contrast sensitivity was poorer for twin 1, particularly at intermediate spatial frequencies. In addition, twin 1 demonstrated complete suppression and unmeasurable stereoscopic function (>300 seconds). On the other hand, twin 2 demonstrated fusion, exhibited only mild suppression, and had near-normal (28 seconds) stereoscopic function. All STR alleles were identical in the twins, proving monozygosity.\nSensory measurements of monocular and binocular visual function in these genetically proven monozygotic twins were significantly different, with the earlier onset of esotropia associated with reduced visual function. Twin 2, whose esotropia was diagnosed at the age of 5 years, had near-normal visual function, both monocularly and binocularly. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first study of a genetically identical sibling pair with strabismus. By eliminating the genetic differences between these patients, we are able to make powerful observations about the effect of environment on visual function in strabismus.",

    "abstract": "Omphalopagus twins are joined ventrally in the umbilical region. In omphalopagus twins, liver's fusion is very frequent, being present in about 80% of cases. Two conjoined twins born in our Hospital were evaluated using plain x-rays, ultrasound (US), gastrointestinal xrays, Tc-99 hepatobiliary scintigraphy (SC) and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT). There was no bony connection on conventional xrays, neither bowel communication on GI x-rays study. US demonstrated the fusion of left hepatic lobes and a not-quantifiable vascular shunt. Normal biliary function was demonstrated by Tc-99 SC. The first CT scan (twin A) showed irregular lobules in the site of hepatic fusion, a portoportal shunt and a venous vessel to the inferior vena cava of twin B. Only the second CT scan (twin B) showed an arterio-arterial partiallyextrahepatic shunts. The double CT scan allows to increase the probability of a correct individuation and description of vascular shunts for an effective preoperatory assessment. The omphalopagus twins in our case underwent planned surgical separation at 5\u202fmonths of age. The surgery lasted 5\u202fh and was not affected by any intraoperative complications.",

    "abstract": "Dyslipidemia represents a strong and independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Plasma cholesterol, such as total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), is the common indicator of diagnosing dyslipidemia. Here based on 382 Chinese twin pairs, we explored the magnitude of genetic impact on TC, HDL-C, LDL-C variation and further searched for genetic susceptibility loci for them using genome-wide association study (GWAS). The ACE model was the best fit model with additive genetic parameter (A) accounting for 26.6%, common or shared environmental parameter (C) accounting for 47.8%, unique/non-shared environmental parameter (E) accounting for 25.6% for the variance in HDL-C. The AE model was the best fit model for TC (A: 61.4%; E: 38.6%) and LDL-C (A: 65.5%; E: 34.5%). While no SNPs reached the genome-wide significance level (",

    "abstract": "Major depression is a complex disorder with no single, direct causal mechanism. Morbidity has been linked to genetic processes, developmental history, and unique environmental exposures. Epigenetic mechanisms, especially DNA methylation, are also likely important factors in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). A community-based twin sample has many advantages for epigenetic studies, given the shared genetic and developmental histories of same-sex twin pairs. This article describes the rationale and study design for the Mood and Methylation Study in which 133 twin pairs (101 monozygotic and 32 dizygotic), both discordant and concordant for lifetime history of MDD, were evaluated on a large number of variables related to MDD. The twins also provided blood samples for an epigenome-wide association study of differentially methylated regions (DMR) relevant to MDD. Although MDD is typically considered a disorder of the central nervous system, it is unfeasible to obtain a large sample of brain tissues. However, epigenetic variation is not limited to the affected tissue but can also be detected in peripheral blood leukocytes. Thus, this study focused on monocytes for the major analyses. Additional plans for the study include gene expression analysis from the same set of twins using RNA-seq and validation of significant DMRs in postmortem brain tissues from a separate sample. Moreover, sufficient samples have been collected to perform future 'multi-omic' analyses, including metabolome, microbiome, and transcriptome. Our long-term goal is to understand how epigenomic and other 'omic' factors can be manipulated for diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic purposes for MDD and its related conditions.",

    "abstract": "X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) refers to a clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder, in which males are more heavily affected than females. Among the syndromic forms of XLID, identified by additional clinical signs as part of the disease spectrum, the association between XLID and severe myopia has been poorly characterized. We used whole exome sequencing (WES) to study two Italian male twins presenting impaired intellectual function and adaptive behavior, in association with severe myopia and mild facial dysmorphisms. WES analysis detected the novel, maternally inherited, mutation c.916G\u2009>\u2009C (G306R) in the X-linked heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 2 (HS6ST2) gene. HS6ST2 transfers sulfate from adenosine 3'-phosphate, 5'-phosphosulfate to the sixth position of the N-sulphoglucosamine residue in heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans. Low HS sulfation levels are associated with defective optic disc and stalk morphogenesis during mammalian visual system development. The c.916G>C variant affects the HS6ST2 substrate binding site, and its effect was considered \"deleterious\" by in-silico tools. An in-vitro enzymatic assay showed that the HS6ST2 mutant isoform had significantly reduced sulphotransferase activity. Taken together, the results suggest that mutant HS6ST2 is possibly involved in the development of myopia and cognitive impairment, characteristics of the probands reported here.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of multiple births has recently increased. However, the association between gestational age and long-term morbidity among twins remains unclear.\nTo examine the association of gestational age with child health and neurological development in early childhood among twins.\nPopulation-based longitudinal study.\nWe included 947 children from 479 pairs of twins with information on gestational age.\nHospitalization was used as an indicator of physical health, and responses to questions about age-appropriate behaviors were used as an indicator of neurobehavioral development. We conducted binomial log-linear regression analyses, controlling for both child and maternal variables in the model. We accounted for correlations within the pairs with generalized estimating equations.\nThe early term group (i.e., 37 to 38\u202fweeks of gestation) had a lower risk of poor child health and unfavorable neurodevelopment compared with the full term group (\u226539\u202fweeks of gestation) and preterm group (<37\u202fweeks of gestation). Compared with the early term group, the adjusted risk ratios for hospitalization for all causes during the period from 7 to 18\u202fmonths of age was 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.3-3.8) for very preterm children (<32\u202fweeks of gestation), 1.1 (0.8-1.6) for moderately and late preterm children (32 to 36\u202fweeks of gestation), and 1.8 (1.0-3.2) for full term children.\nWe observed a U-shaped association of gestational age with child health and neurodevelopment. The early term group had the lowest risk of poor outcomes among twins.",

    "abstract": "Fetal stroke is an important cause of cerebral palsy but is difficult to diagnose unless imaging is undertaken in pregnancies at risk because of known maternal or fetal disorders. Fetal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging may show haemorrhage or ischaemic lesions including multicystic encephalomalacia and focal porencephaly. Serial imaging has shown the development of malformations including schizencephaly and polymicrogyra after ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. Recognised causes of haemorrhagic fetal stroke include alloimmune and autoimmune thrombocytopaenia, maternal and fetal clotting disorders and trauma but these are relatively rare. It is likely that a significant proportion of periventricular and intraventricular haemorrhages are of venous origin. Recent evidence highlights the importance of arterial endothelial dysfunction, rather than thrombocytopaenia, in the intraparenchymal haemorrhage of alloimmune thrombocytopaenia. In the context of placental anastomoses, monochorionic diamniotic twins are at risk of twin twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), or partial forms including Twin Oligohydramnios Polyhydramnios Sequence (TOPS), differences in estimated weight (selective Intrauterine growth Retardation; sIUGR), or in fetal haemoglobin (Twin Anaemia Polycythaemia Sequence; TAPS). There is a very wide range of ischaemic and haemorrhagic injury in a focal as well as a global distribution. Acute twin twin transfusion may account for intraventricular haemorrhage in recipients and periventricular leukomalacia in donors but there are additional risk factors for focal embolism and cerebrovascular disease. The recipient has circulatory overload, with effects on systemic and pulmonary circulations which probably lead to systemic and pulmonary hypertension and even right ventricular outflow tract obstruction as well as the polycythaemia which is a risk factor for thrombosis and vasculopathy. The donor is hypovolaemic and has a reticulocytosis in response to the anaemia while maternal hypertension and diabetes may influence stroke risk. Understanding of the mechanisms, including the role of vasculopathy, in well studied conditions such as alloimmune thrombocytopaenia and monochorionic diamniotic twinning may lead to reduction of the burden of antenatally sustained cerebral palsy.",

We present a pair of dichorionic twin who had a diverse clinical presentation of NH. One twin passed away despite medical treatment with exchange transfusion and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), whereas the other twin suffered from only mildly deranged liver function, which normalized spontaneously. Early identification of liver failure and clinical awareness of this disease entity are essential to its timely diagnosis and treatment. Antenatal management using IVIg prevents the recurrence of NH in subsequent pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by insensitivity to noxious stimulus and the absence of sweating. Fractures and joint destruction are common complications, but detailed studies on mineral and skeletal homeostasis are not available. Mental retardation is often reported, but detailed observations during childhood are lacking.\nA pair of 46-month-old Chinese identical twin brothers was presented at our hospital. The brothers had the typical manifestations of insensitivity to noxious stimulus, inability to sweat, and recurrent episodes of unexplained fever. Fortunately, they did not present common complications such as self-mutilation, trauma, bruise, and repeated bone fractures.\nTwo novel compound heterozygous variants of NTRK1 (c.632T\u200a>\u200aA and c.1253_1254delTC) were identified.\nThe patients were subjected to routine and specialist clinical examinations. Daily care and symptomatic treatment were given.\nX-ray films of proband 2 showed a fracture in the first metatarsal. Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and mild-to-moderate retardation of the Gesell developmental schedules (GDS), especially language and adaptability, were observed. Evaluation results for BMD and GDS in proband 2 were worse than those in his brother.\nThe current findings expand our knowledge about the spectrum of phenotypic and genotypic features of CIPA, which will help facilitate future genotype-phenotype association studies. Daily care by parents promotes favorable outcomes in patients.",

    "abstract": "T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data contain information about infections that could be used in disease diagnostics and vaccine development, but extracting that information remains a major challenge. Here we developed a statistical framework to detect TCR clone proliferation and contraction from longitudinal repertoire data. We applied this framework to data from three pairs of identical twins immunized with the yellow fever vaccine. We identified 600 to 1,700 responding TCRs in each donor and validated them using three independent assays. While the responding TCRs were mostly private, albeit with higher overlap between twins, they could be well-predicted using a classifier based on sequence similarity. Our method can also be applied to samples obtained postinfection, making it suitable for systematic discovery of new infection-specific TCRs in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "In monozygotic twins two embryos are formed from a single fertilized egg. In \"mirror image twins\" identical siblings have reverse asymmetric features in the right and left sides of the body. We report the case of twins with mirror-image hypermetropic anisometropia. They were referred to an ophthalmologist at the age of 3.5\u00a0years for amblyopia. Cycloplegic refraction of twin 1 was +1.00 in the right eye and +4.50 -0.75 \u00d7180 in the left eye; of twin 2, +4.75 -1.00 \u00d7180 and\u00a0+1.25. Keratometry and axial length were measured with Lenstar LS 900 when the twins were 6\u00a0years of age. In twin 1, the axial length was 22.18\u00a0mm in the right eye and 20.97 in the left eye; in twin 2, 20.94\u00a0mm and 22.13. Keratomtry of both eyes of these twins was relatively equal.",

    "abstract": "Recent discoveries highlight the importance of stochastic epigenetic changes, as indexed by epigenetic outlier DNA methylation signatures, as a valuable tool to understand aberrant cell function and subsequent human pathology. There is evidence of such changes in different complex disorders as diverse as cancer, obesity and, to a lesser extent, depression. The current study was aimed at identifying outlying DNA methylation signatures of depressive psychopathology. Here, genome-wide DNA methylation levels were measured (by means of Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip) in peripheral blood of thirty-four monozygotic twins informative for depressive psychopathology (lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses). This dataset was explored to identify outlying epigenetic signatures of depression, operationalized as extreme hyper- or hypo-methylation in affected co-twins from discordant pairs that is not observed across the rest of the study sample. After adjusting for blood cell count, there were thirteen CpG sites across which depressed co-twins from the discordant pairs exhibited outlying DNA methylation signatures. None of them exhibited a methylation outlier profile in the concordant and healthy pairs, and some of these loci spanned genes previously associated with neuropsychiatric phenotypes, such as GHSR and KCNQ1. This exploratory study provides preliminary proof-of-concept validation that epigenetic outlier profiles derived from genome-wide DNA methylation data may be related to depression risk.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the effects of genetic and environment influences and sex on injury involvement using two sets of Finnish twin data. The younger participants were 955 twins born between 1983 and 1987, aged 20 to 24 years. The older participants were 12,428 twins born between 1930 and 1957, aged 33 to 60 years. Within-twin correlations in monozygotic and dizygotic twins suggested that genetic effects play no role in injury involvement among young twins, but do have some effect at older ages. The results indicated that environmental factors have greater importance in injury involvement than genetic factors in the younger twin data set (FT12), whereas in a middle-aged (33-60 years) twin data set, genetic effects explained about quarter of the variance in injury involvement. Sex was a strong contributing factor, with males being generally more prone to injuries than females.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of secondary urinary reconstruction of previously separated conjoined twins with exstrophic bladder and urinary incontinence. Patients were male and aged 13-year-old. Twin one had a history of failed enterocystoplasty that extruded and was visible like an exstrophic neobladder. He underwent a procedure to close bladder neck and reconfigure abdominal wall. After the procedure the patient developed a fistula that was treated, but it persisted and, for this reason, a catheterizable pouch was constructed and native bladder was discarded. Twin two required the immediately construction of catheterizable pouch using the Macedo's technique. Currently, both patients are continent at 4 hour intervals. The mean follow-up was 8 months. Modern continent urinary diversion techniques offer new perspectives and hope for such complex population.\nRelata-se caso de reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o urin\u00e1ria em g\u00eameos siameses previamente separados com apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o cl\u00ednica de bexiga extr\u00f3fica e incontin\u00eancia urin\u00e1ria.

    "abstract": "Trisomy 21, or Down syndrome (DS), is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 500-750 live births. The prevalence of DS has increased over the past two decades, correlating with a rise in the proportion of pregnancies complicated by advanced maternal age. There is also a correlation between advanced maternal age and dizygotic twinning rates. There is an increased risk of at least one twin being affected in dizygotic pregnancies compared to singletons. However, despite this greater relative risk, reports of concordance of DS in both dizygotic twins are very rare. Congenital heart disease (CHD) occurs in roughly 40% of individuals with DS, but there can be considerable phenotypic variation. The most common, atrioventricular septal defect accounts for only 40% of CHD seen in DS. There is also a higher incidence of CHD in twins, but also with a low incidence of concordance. There have been only five reported cases of concordant DS in dizygotic twins with confirmed chromosomal analyses; none of which describe concordant congenital heart disease. Here, we describe an unusual case of dizygotic twins of differing genders concordant for both Down syndrome and congenital heart disease of a strikingly similar presentation.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the placental characteristics of monochorionic twin pregnancies with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) classified according to the Gratac\u00f3s classification based on umbilical artery Doppler measurements.\nAll consecutive placentas from monochorionic twin pregnancies with sIUGR, (defined as a birthweight discordance > 25% and/or an estimated fetal weight in one twin <10th centile) examined between May 2002 and February 2018 were included in the study. Each placenta was injected with colored dye to study the angioarchitecture. Primary outcomes were placental share discordance and diameter of the arterio-arterial anastomoses in relation to the umbilical artery Doppler types of sIUGR (Gratac\u00f3s classification).\nOf the 83 sIUGR twins included, 27 were classified as Gratac\u00f3s type I, 24 as type II and 32 as type III. The median gestational age at delivery was 34.3 weeks for type I, compared to 31.2 weeks and 31.6 weeks for type II and type III respectively. A trend towards a higher placental share discordance in type III sIUGR was observed. The median arterio-arterial diameter was 1.7\u202fmm (0.8-2.6) in type I, 1.7\u202fmm (1.2-2.2) in type II and 2.8 (2.0-3.5) mm in type III (p\u202f<\u202f0.01).\nType III sIUGR placentas appear to be characterized by a larger diameter of the arterio-arterial anastomoses and a larger placental share discordance compared to type I and II sIUGR. The insights in the placental architecture of sIUGR placentas may offer new views on the pathophysiology of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Myopia is an increasingly prevalent condition globally. A greater understanding of contemporaneous, early life factors associated with myopia risk is urgently required, particularly in younger onset myopia as this correlates with higher severity and increased complications in adult life.\nAnalysis of a subset of the longitudinal, UK-based Twins Early Development Study (n=1991) recruited at birth between 1994 and 1996. Subjective refraction was obtained from the twin's optometrists; mean age 16.3 years (SD 1.7). Myopia was defined as mean spherical equivalent \u2264-0.75 dioptres. A life course epidemiology approach was used to appropriately weight candidate myopia risk factors during critical periods of eye growth. Adjusted ORs for myopia were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models at each life stage, together with variance explained (r\nFactors significantly associated with myopia included level of maternal education (OR 1.33, 95%\u2009CI 1.11 to 1.59), fertility treatment (OR 0.63, 95%\u2009CI 0.43 to 0.92), summer birth (OR 1.93, 95%\u2009CI 1.28 to 2.90) and hours spent playing computer games (OR 1.03, 95%\u2009CI 1.01 to 1.06).

Consistent associations were observed with socioeconomic status, educational attainment, reading enjoyment and cognitive variables, particularly verbal cognition, at multiple points over the life course.\nThis study identifies known and novel associations with myopia during childhood development; associated factors identified in early life reflect sociological and lifestyle trends such as rates of maternal education, fertility treatment, early schooling and computer games.",

In the mixed-effects model, nearwork difference was a risk factor of discordance in myopic SE (\u03b2 = -0.11 diopter (D)/h, P = 0.009), the overall association between time outdoors difference and SE discordance was not significant (\u03b2 = -0.89 (D)/h, P = 0.120) although an interaction between time spent outdoors difference and age was detected (\u03b2 = 0.07 (D)/h, P = 0.002). Furthermore, difference in nearwork and time outdoors explained about 1.8% and 2.5% of the variation in SE discordance, respectively.\nGiven the very marked genetic similarity of MZ twins, and the small effects of known risk factors on SE discordance, we suggest that the SE discordance across MZ twins largely results from stochastic variations at the genomic or epigenetic levels, or from uncollected environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to revisit the topic of compensatory interactions between maxillary anterior teeth during development advanced by Sofaer et al. (1971). We addressed the hypotheses listed by Sofaer and colleagues using data derived from our Australian twin sample to investigate whether final tooth size in permanent maxillary central incisors and canines showed evidence of developmental compensation for adjacent missing or microdont lateral incisors. Such compensation is one factor interacting in the complex system of dental development.\nA 2D image analysis system was used to measure crown height from the labial view, labiopalatal crown width from the incisal view, and mesiodistal crown width from both the labial (MDl) and incisal (MDi) views of the permanent maxillary central incisors and canines on the dental study model of twins enrolled in a longitudinal study of dental development.\nDevelopmental variations of maxillary lateral incisors influence the morphogenesis of the adjacent teeth. For example, individuals with one missing lateral incisor and one lateral incisor of average dimensions, had significantly larger central incisors than the control group for the MDl and MDi dimensions (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Of the 7 monozygotic twin pairs, 6 were discordant in maxillary anterior hypodontia and microdontia, and 13 out of 14 dizygotic twin pairs were discordant.\nThis study provides further evidence of developmental interactions in the maxillary anterior region, partially supporting Sofaer and colleagues' hypotheses. These interactions are part of a complex adaptive system involving genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this longitudinal analysis of untreated monozygotic twins were to investigate the change of the facial soft tissues during growth, to determine the concordance of soft tissue growth patterns between genetically identical twins, and to assess the genetic component of soft tissue development.\nThe sample consisted of 33 pairs of untreated monozygotic twins (23 male, 10 female) from the Forsyth Moorrees Twin Study (1959-1975); lateral cephalograms taken from 6 to 18\u00a0years of age were analyzed at 3-year intervals. Cephalograms were traced, and longitudinal changes in the soft tissue profile between twins were analyzed with intraclass correlation coefficients and linear regression modelling.\nThe concordance between monozygotic twins at 18\u00a0years of age was moderate to high with intraclass correlation coefficients values between 0.37 and 0.87. Additionally, female twins showed higher concordance at 18\u00a0years of age than did male twins for all included variables. However, about 10% to 46% of the twin pairs had large differences in their soft tissue parameters, even after the growth period.\nAlthough monozygotic twins possess the same genetic material, differences in the soft tissues were found. This supports the complex developmental mechanism of the human face and the varying influence of genetic and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "To compare neonatal and infant mortality rates stratified by gestational age (GA) between singletons and twins and examine the three leading causes of death among them.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study using the U.S. vital statistics datasets. The study was restricted to nonanomalous live births at 24 to 40 weeks delivered in 2005 to 2014. We used multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error variance to examine the association between birth plurality (singleton vs. twin) and mortality outcomes within each GA, while adjusting for confounders. The results were presented as adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nOf 26,292,747 live births, 96.6% were singletons and 3.4% were twins. At 29 to 36 weeks of GA, compared with singletons, twins had a lower risk of neonatal mortality (aRR: 0.37-0.78) and infant mortality (aRR: 0.54-0.86). When examined by GA, the three leading causes of neonatal and infant mortality varied between singletons and twins.\nWhen stratified by GA, the risk of neonatal and infant mortality was lower at 29 to 36 weeks in twins than in singletons, though the cause of death varied.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins, resulting from a single fertilized egg giving rise to two separate embryos, are monozygotic and considered genetically identical. However, discordant phenotypes have been reported in monozygotic twins. We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 155 monochorionic pregnancies (312 twins) with major discordant structural anomalies coded by the ICD-10 system in order to describe the spectrum of anomalies, the management of the pregnancies, and the perinatal outcome. Treatment options included conservative management, selective feticide with bipolar cord coagulation, or complete termination. All survivors underwent at least 24 months of postnatal follow-up. Discordancy was complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome in eight pregnancies (5%) and by selective intrauterine growth restriction in 41 (26%). Major structural anomalies affected one system in 139 cases (90%) and multiple systems in 16 (10%). Median gestational age at diagnosis was 19.1 weeks (IQR 16.4-21.3). The most frequent single-system anomalies involved the nervous and circulatory systems. In total, 72 anomalous twins (46%) and 116 normal co-twins (74%) were delivered at a median gestational age of 34.6 weeks (IQR 31.0-36.3). Neonatal/infant death of the anomalous twin occurred in 22 cases (14%), with an overall survival rate of 32% (50/155). Surviving anomalous twins underwent major surgery in 22/50 cases (44%), four of whom (8%) now suffer from severe neurologic morbidity. This study shows that a wide spectrum of major discordant structural anomalies can be found in monochorionic pregnancies. The outcome for the anomalous twin is poor, while the survival rate for the normal co-twin was 71%, with a favorable overall prognosis.",

    "abstract": "The giant panda, native to mountains of south-west China, is one of the world's rarest bear species and is subject to considerable conservation effort. In captivity, the proportion of twins accounts for 54% of the total number of births. To date, little is known about zygosity in panda populations - specifically, the proportion of monozygotic and dizygotic twins. In this study, we used 10 microsatellite markers for reliable zygosity testing, and the probability of monozygotic twins was 99.963% when all 10 markers were concordant. Out of 43 studied twin pairs, no MZ twins were found, indicating that there may be no identical panda twins (or the incidence is very low). We speculate that the fertilized eggs of giant pandas do not have the capability to split into two identical embryos, or that this ability is very poor, which is likely due to delayed implantation that is common in bear species. The results of this study deepen our understanding of giant panda breeding, yield insight into panda twins' likely mechanism of formation, and reduce the uncertainty of individual identity in wild population surveys.",

    "abstract": "The selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDC) twins causes phenotypic growth discordance, which is correlated with metabolomic pertubations. A global, untargeted identification of the metabolic fingerprint may help elucidate the etiology of sIUGR. Umbilical cord blood and placentas collected from 15 pairs of sIUGR monochorionic twins, 24 pairs of uncomplicated twins, and 14 singletons diagnosed with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolomic analyses. Supervised multivariate regression analysis and pathway analysis were performed to compare control twins with sIUGR twins. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was utilized to explore metabolic differences within sIUGR co-twins. Linear logistic regression was applied to screen metabolites that significantly differed in concentration between control twins and sIUGR twins or IUGR singletons. Umbilical cord blood demonstrated better global metabolomic separation of sIUGR and control twins compared to the placenta. Disrupted amino acid and fatty acid metabolism as well as high levels of exposure to environmental xenobiotics were associated with sIUGR. The metabolic abnormalities in MCDA twins suggested that in utero growth discordance is caused by intrauterine and extrauterine environmental factors, rather than genetics. Thus, this study provides new therapeutic targets and strategies for sIUGR management and prevention.",

    "abstract": "Associations between well-being, resilience to trauma and the volume of grey-matter regions involved in affective processing (e.g., threat/reward circuits) are largely unexplored, as are the roles of shared genetic and environmental factors derived from multivariate twin modelling.\nThis study presents, to our knowledge, the first exploration of well-being and volumes of grey-matter regions involved in affective processing using a region-of-interest, voxel-based approach in 263 healthy adult twins (60% monozygotic pairs, 61% females, mean age 39.69 yr). To examine patterns for resilience (i.e., positive adaptation following adversity), we evaluated associations between the same brain regions and well-being in a trauma-exposed subgroup.\nWe found a correlated effect between increased well-being and reduced grey-matter volume of the pontine nuclei. This association was strongest for individuals with higher resilience to trauma. Multivariate twin modelling suggested that the common variance between the pons volume and well-being scores was due to environmental factors.\nWe used a cross-sectional sample; results need to be replicated longitudinally and in a larger sample.\nAssociations with altered grey matter of the pontine nuclei suggest that basic sensory processes, such as arousal, startle, memory consolidation and/or emotional conditioning, may have a role in well-being and resilience.",

    "abstract": "White matter (WM) microstructure, as determined by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of cognitive function and is also altered in neuropsychiatric disorders. Little is known about genetic and environmental influences on WM microstructure, especially in early childhood, an important period for cognitive development and risk for psychiatric disorders. We studied the heritability of DTI parameters, fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) along 34 tracts, including 10 bilateral fiber pathways and the respective subdivision, using quantitative tractography in a longitudinal sample of healthy children at 1\u2009year (N\u2009=\u2009215) and 2\u2009years (N\u2009=\u2009165) of age. We found that heritabilities for whole brain AD, RD, and FA were 0.48, 0.69, and 0.72 at age 1, and 0.59, 0.77, and 0.76 at age 2 and that mean heritabilities of tract-averaged AD, RD, and FA for individual bundles were moderate (over 0.4). However, the heritability of DTI change between 1 and 2\u2009years of age was not significant for most tracts. We also demonstrated that point-wise heritability tended to be significant in the central portions of the tracts and was generally spatially consistent at ages 1 and 2\u2009years. These results, especially when compared to heritability patterns in neonates, indicate that the heritability of WM microstructure is dynamic in early childhood and likely reflect heterogeneous maturation of WM tracts and differential genetic and environmental influences on maturation patterns.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the cognitive capacities associated with the development of school readiness is indispensable to support children's successful school transition. It has been shown that executive function (EF) in preschoolers is associated with both concurrent preacademic and subsequent academic skills. However, most research has controlled for the effect of general cognitive ability (GCA), and little research has examined non-English speaking children, which hinders the understanding of the development of school readiness in culturally diverse contexts. In addition, behavioral genetic research on the genetic and environmental influences on this association has been conducted with school-age children. Thus, the genetic and environmental influences on associations between GCA, EF, and preacademic skills during preschool age are unknown. We conducted multivariate behavioral genetic analyses on two waves of longitudinal data at 42 and 60 months of age from 171 and 135 pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic Japanese twins. The findings suggested that a genetic factor influenced GCA at 42 months and mediated preacademic ability at 60 months. In addition, another genetic factor emerged by 60 months that genetically mediated EF and math ability, independent of GCA. Preacademic ability at 60 months was affected by shared environments that influenced EF, rather than GCA, at 42 months. Moreover, shared environments that influenced preacademic ability at 42 months affected later GCA at 60 months. Finally, nonshared environments that had emerged by 60 months mediated these relationships, though the magnitude of this effect was modest.

    "abstract": "In June 2018, Mothers and Babies Reducing Risks through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK (MBRRACE-UK) published a Perinatal Surveillance report of an audit between 2013-2016. This noted that the stillbirth rate for twins nearly halved between 2014-2016; whereas the stillbirth rate for singletons remained static. There was a statistically significant reduction in the rate of stillbirth in twins over this period from 11.07 (95%\u00a0CI, 9.78-12.47) to 6.16 (95%\u00a0CI, 5.20-7.24) per 1000 total births. This commentary discusses these observations, the effects of twin chorionicity, and the potential obstetric and neonatal interventions, as well as public health improvements, that may have influenced these findings.",

    "abstract": "Myelomeningocele (MMC) is a common subtype of congenital neural tube defects (NTD). Although congenital malformations including NTD are more common in twins, concordance, especially in dizygotic twins, is extremely rare and is found mostly in same-sex twins. The role of genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of MMC is unclear.\nDizygotic twins of opposite sex were born at term to a 35-year-old woman conceived with in vitro fertilization (IVF) using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Prenatal ultrasonography (US) revealed concordant lumbosacral MMC at 18\u00a0weeks of gestation as well as ventriculomegaly and Arnold-Chiari malformation type II at 28\u00a0weeks. Both twins underwent surgical repair of the MMC within 48\u00a0h after birth and required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in the second week of life.\nThe case presented raises questions concerning the etiology of MMC, since in twins, it is compelling to attribute the etiology to genetic factors. In the literature, 22 pairs of twins with concordant MMC have been reported, and of the 10 dizygotic twins described, four were of opposite sex. However, in monozygotic twins, most of the cases are non-concordant; therefore, the role of genetics remains unclear. In addition, environmental factors such as nutrition, metabolic folic acid deficiency, and assisted conception with IVF and ICSI might play a role as well.\nThe appearance of concordant MMC in opposite-sex dizygotic twins, conceived by IVF using ICSI, intrigues questions concerning the etiology of MMC. In such cases, genetic counseling and evaluation should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Perinatal mortality is higher in twins. Effects of twin order have not previously been studied in the context of single fetal demise. Our objective was to determine whether death of the fetus more proximal to the cervix will result in worse perinatal outcomes. Our population included multiple pregnancies with two viable fetuses confirmed prior to 20 weeks' gestation with the subsequent death of at least one twin. All the pregnancies were managed at The Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne between 2006 and 2014. We excluded pregnancies of higher order multiples, the death of both twins simultaneously, and cases with incomplete outcome data. Maternal and neonatal data were reviewed. Of 46 pregnancies included, in 24 (52%), the dead twin was presenting. Gestational age at delivery was significantly earlier in these cases (mean difference: -5.0 weeks, 95% CI [-7.4, -2.6], p &lt; .001), and emergency cesarean rates were higher 67% versus 32% (OR 4.29, 95% CI [1.25, 14.7], p = .02). There were no differences in the frequency of chorioamnionitis, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, or placental abruption. Survival rates for co-twins were similar in both groups (presenting 83%; not presenting 91%; OR 0.41, 95% CI [0.07, 2.50], p = .29). The increase in neonatal morbidities was related to prematurity rather than to order. Findings were more common in dichorionic twins. Analysis was limited by a small sample size. If the dead twin is presenting, delivery is likely to occur earlier, with associated morbidity for the survivors. This is especially relevant for dichorionic twin pregnancies.",

Investigating cohorts living in different geographical areas across the globe can identify the variation in heritability versus environment.\n(1) To investigate the association between birth weight and anthropometric measurements during adulthood; (2) to study the genetic and environmental influences on body measures including birth weight, weight and height among twins; and (3) to assess the variation in heritability versus environment among two cohorts of twins who lived in different geographical areas.\nTwins were collected from two twin registers. Data on birth weight, adult weight and height in 430 MZ and 170\u2009DZ twins living in two geographically distinct parts of the world were collected. A genetic analysis was performed using MX software.\nBirth weight was associated with weight, height and BMI. Both MZ and DZ twins with low birth weight had shorter height during their adult life (p\u2009=\u20090.001), but only MZ twins with lower birth weight were lighter at adulthood (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Intra-pair differences in birth weight were not associated with differences in adult height (p\u2009=\u20090.366) or weight (p\u2009=\u20090.796). Additive genetic effects accounted for 53% of the variance in weight, 43% in height and 55% in birth weight. The remaining variance was attributed to unique environmental effects (15% for weight, 13% for height and 45% for birth weight and only 16% for BMI). Variability was found to be different in the two cohorts. The best fitting model for birth weight and BMI was additive genetic and non-shared environment and for weight and height was additive genetic, non-shared environment (plus common Environment).\nData suggests that the association between weight at birth and anthropometric measures in later life is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.

    "abstract": "In general, it is extremely problematic to discriminate between monozygotic twins (MZTs), who share the same genomic DNA sequence, using traditional DNA-based identification methods such as short tandem repeat profiling. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have shown potential in forensic applications owing to their low molecular weight, abundant and tissue-specific expression. In this study, we utilized massively parallel sequencing technology to perform genome-wide profiling of miRNAs in the blood from four pairs of healthy MZTs. On average, 158 miRNAs were detected in each individual and 14% of which were differentially expressed within each pair of MZTs. The miRNAs with the most significant differences in expression between the twins were confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our results demonstrated that miRNAs have potential for use as molecular markers in MZTs discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Estimated energy requirement (EER) has not been defined for twin pregnancy. This study was designed to determine the EER of healthy women with dichorionic-diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancies.\nWe aimed to estimate energy deposition from changes in maternal body protein and fat; to measure resting energy expenditure (REE), physical activity level (PAL), and total energy expenditure (TEE) throughout pregnancy and postpartum; and to define the EER based on the sum of TEE and energy deposition for twin gestation.\nThis is a prospective study of 20 women with DCDA twin gestations. Maternal EER, energy deposition, REE, TEE, and PAL were obtained during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy and immediately postpartum. A mixed-effects linear regression model for repeated measures with random intercept was used to test for the effects of BMI groups and time.\nGains in total body protein (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 kg) and fat mass (5.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8 kg) resulted in total energy deposition of 67,042\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025,586 kcal between 0 and 30-32 weeks of gestation. REE increased 26% from 1392\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0162 to 1752\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0172 kcal/d across the 3 trimesters, whereas TEE increased 17% from 2141\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0283 to 2515\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0337 kcal/d. Physical activity decreased steadily throughout pregnancy. Reductions in physical activity did not compensate for the rise in REE and energy deposition, thus requiring an increase in dietary energy intake as pregnancy progressed. EER increased 29% from 2257\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0325 kcal/d in the first trimester to 2941\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0407 kcal/d in the second trimester, and stayed consistent at 2906\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0350 kcal/d in the third trimester.\nIncreased energy intake, on average \u223c700 kcal/d in the second and third trimesters when compared with the first trimester, is required to support gestational weight gain and the rise in energy expenditure of DCDA twin pregnancies.",

The heritability estimate of immediate recall (IR) was 0.37, 95% \u2009CI (0.21 to 0.43).\nThe results demonstrate that familial risk for dementia is reflected in the IR performance of cognitively healthy older persons. The finding of poorer IR performance in non-affected siblings compared with the general population, together with substantial heritability of IR, supports IR as a useful endophenotype for molecular genetic studies of dementia.",

    "abstract": "In complicated mono-chorionic twin pregnancies, vaso-occlusive techniques like bipolar cord coagulation (BPCC), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), interstitial laser ablation (ILA) of cord and fetoscopy guided cord coagulation with lasers are the methods proposed for selective fetal reduction. This study brings forth preliminary data of selective fetal reduction procedures at a tertiary care center in India.\nThis was a prospective observational study of 31 patients with complicated mono-chorionic twin pregnancies. Methods used were ILA, RFA and BPCC. Outcome measures included overall co-twin survival after selective feticide, survival rates with each method, miscarriage (defined as all fetal loss before 24 weeks), early fetal death (<24 hours after procedure) and late fetal death (>24 hours after the procedure) of co-twin.\nTechnical success was achieved in 30/31 (96.8%) of pregnancies. Over all take home baby rate was 63.3%. Live birth rates were 50%, 71.4% and 75% with ILA, RFA and BPCC respectively.\nData from initial cases of selective fetal reduction in complicated mono-chorionic twins suggests that these procedures are feasible but are associated with high adverse perinatal outcome.",

    "abstract": "Genetically identical twins can differ in their self-reported sexual orientations. However, whether the twins' subjective reports reflect valid differences in their sexual orientations is unknown. Measures of sexual orientation, which are free of the limitations of self-report, include genital arousal and pupil dilation while viewing sexual stimuli depicting men or women. We examined these responses in 6 male twin pairs and 9 female twin pairs who reported discordant sexual orientations. Across measures, heterosexual male twins responded more strongly to women than to men. Their homosexual co-twins showed an opposite pattern. Heterosexual female twins responded equally to both sexes, whereas their homosexual co-twins responded somewhat more to women than men. These differences within pairs were similar to differences between unrelated heterosexual and homosexual males and females. Our study provides physiological evidence confirming twins' discordant sexual orientations, thereby supporting the importance of the non-shared environment for the development of sexual orientation and sexual arousal.",

    "abstract": "The study of twins is a well-known and a unique method that is used to investigate the genetic contributions to physical features and diseases in human.\nTo estimate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental influence to observed variations in different dental features or traits.\nThirty twins in the age group of 15-30 years were selected for the study, and the dental caries experience scores, dental anomalies, and morphometric analysis of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins were compared.\nMZ twins unlike DZ twins showed within-pair resemblance in decayed, decayed missing and filled teeth (DMFT), and molar relation. No morphometric analysis parameters and dental anomalies had significant mean difference between the groups. Decay, filling, DMFT, spacing, mandibular irregularity, open bite, and mesiodistal width of the right and left canine showed a higher positive correlation in MZ than DZ twins. Heritability estimate was low for morphometric analysis parameters. There is genetic dominance in decay, DMFT, spacing, molar relation, and diastema. Pearson's correlation revealed a positive and statistically significant correlation among all morphometric analysis parameters for MZ twins, but not DZ twins. Dental caries has a higher concordance rate (87.5%), correlation (71.6%), and heritability (87.8%).\nMost of the dental parameters are significantly heritable with up to 85% of the variance attributable to genetic factors. Environmental factors play a major role in developing malocclusion and causing dental caries. Morphology of canines can be used as a supplementary tool to determine zygosity.",

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to compare the prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) 3 and 12\u00a0months after vaginal vs cesarean delivery of twins after 34\u00a0weeks of gestation.\nThis was a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted at 172 French maternity units and included 2812 primiparous women with twins with no prior history of UI. Participants were enrolled at the time of delivery and followed up to 12\u00a0months postpartum. The primary outcome was the prevalence of UI, both stress and urge, 3\u00a0months postpartum, based on the patient reporting any frequency of urine leakage to the first question of the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF). The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory - Short Form 20 (PFDI-20), Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire - Short Form 7 (PFIQ-7), Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12), and Medical Outcome Study Short Form-12 (SF-12) were also used.\nThe ICIQ-SF was completed by 1155 (39.8%) and 800 (27.5%) women, respectively, at 3 and 12\u00a0months postpartum; 556 (48%) had delivered vaginally and 599 (52%) by cesarean section. The prevalence of UI at 3\u00a0months was 26% overall and was significantly higher in the vaginal delivery group at both 3\u00a0months (35% vs 17% in the cesarean group, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and 12\u00a0months postpartum (38% vs 24%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). UI was predominantly stress or mixed. The risk factors for UI at 3\u00a0months, determined by multivariate modeling, were vaginal delivery [odds ratio (OR) 3.073, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-4.105, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and body mass index >25 in early pregnancy (OR 1.620, 95% CI 1.188-2.209, p\u2009=\u20090.0023).\nVaginal delivery is a risk factor for UI at 3\u00a0months after twin birth.",

The primary end point was the postnatal urinary incontinence rate 3\u00a0months postpartum. The secondary end points were the pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) at 3 and 12\u00a0months based on PFDI-20, PFIQ-7, PISQ-12, and SF-12 responses.\nA total of 2812 patients in 172 French maternity units were recruited between February 2014 and March 2015: 1076 (38%) responded at 3 and 12\u00a0months (61% at 3\u00a0months); 1155 were analyzed at 3\u00a0months (556 VD and 599 CS) and 800 at 12\u00a0months (394 VD and 406 CS).

    "abstract": "The present study investigates the procedure-related fetal loss rate and obstetrical outcomes of selective feticide in dichorionic twins.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the data of 44 cases of dichorionic twins. Two different indications for selective feticide were set: (i) the presence of genetic or congenital anomaly; and (ii) an obstetrical indication specified as a past maternal history of preterm delivery that caused fetal death or cerebral palsy of the child. Primarily, data on procedure-related fetal loss and obstetrical outcomes were retrieved. Additionally, data on obstetrical outcomes by reduction time and by indication of SF were obtained.\nSelective feticide was performed in 44 cases - specifically, in 23 cases with genetic or congenital anomaly and in 21 cases with obstetrical indications. The median gestational age at delivery was 38\u2009+\u20094 weeks. One pregnancy loss (2.3%, 1/44) occurred within 4 weeks after the procedure. The overall pregnancy loss rate throughout the pregnancy term was 2.3% (1/44). When selective feticide was performed at 15\u2009weeks and beyond, the birth weight was significantly decreased compared with when selective feticide was performed earlier than 15\u2009weeks.\nTransabdominal ultrasound-guided selective feticide in dichorionic twins is an effective and safe procedure. If a patient desires to maximize her chances of having a healthy child and decrease the risk of prematurity, the option of selective feticide should be considered in certain cases of twin pregnancies. Selective feticide may be a reasonable alternative to expectant management or termination of the whole twin pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is endemic in many countries worldwide, with a prevalence of 12 million people infected, and an estimated annual incidence of 500 000 visceral leishmaniasis cases. In Europe visceral leishmaniasis is considered endemic mainly in the Mediterranean countries and cases in non-endemic European countries north of the Alps have primarily been reported in returning travellers. The incubation period is typically described between 6\u00a0weeks to 6\u00a0months. The cases presented highlight the occurrence of longer incubation periods and illustrate the individual variability for progression from infection to disease.\nWe report the cases of 18-months-old twin girls living at the German-Swiss border, who developed visceral leishmaniasis 7 and 15\u00a0months after travelling to Tuscany. They presented with fever of unknown origin and pancytopenia. Both had splenomegaly and in the first case haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or leukaemia was initially included in the differential diagnosis. Diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis was confirmed by presence of intracytoplasmic localised leishmania parasites on bone marrow aspirate and/or positive leishmania serology. Both girls responded well to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B. The mother and two older siblings remained uninfected, while the father was diagnosed to be an asymptomatic carrier.\nVisceral leishmaniasis is an important differential diagnosis for fever of unknown origin and pancytopenia in young children living in countries with endemic disease and highlights the importance of obtaining a detailed travel history. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and acute leukaemia present with similar symptoms and consequently are important differential diagnoses. Factors determining progression from infection to disease are not fully understood but younger age seems to be an important risk factor. Screening of siblings from affected individuals therefore may be warranted.",

    "abstract": "Inherited factors and maternal behaviors are thought to play an important role in the etiology of several congenital malformations. Twin studies can offer additional evidence regarding the contribution of genetic and lifestyle factors to common birth anomalies, but few large-scale studies have been reported.\nWe included data from twins (20,803 pairs) from the population-based California Twin Program. We compared concordance in monozygotic (MZ) to dizygotic (DZ) twins for the following birth anomalies: clubfoot, oral cleft, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, deafness, cerebral palsy, strabismus, and congenital heart defects. Each birth anomaly was also examined for the associations with birth characteristics (birthweight and birth order) and parental exposures (age, smoking, and parental education).\nThe overall prevalence of any selected birth anomaly in California twins was 38 per 1,000 persons, with a slightly decreasing trend from 1957-1982. For pairwise concordance in 6,752 MZ and 7,326 like-sex DZ twin pairs, high MZ:DZ concordance ratios were observed for clubfoot (CR 5.91; P = 0.043) and strabismus (CR 2.52; P = 0.001). Among the total 20,803 pairs, parental smoking was significantly associated with risk of spina bifida (OR 3.48; 95% CI, 1.48-8.18) and strabismus (OR 1.61; 95% CI, 1.28-2.03). A significant quadratic trend of increasing risk for clubfoot, spina bifida, and strabismus was found when examining whether father smoked, mother smoked, or both parents smoked relative to non-smoking parents (P = 0.029, 0.026, and 0.0005, respectively).\nOur results provide evidence for a multifactorial etiology underlying selected birth anomalies. Further research is needed to understand the biological mechanisms.",

A significant quadratic trend of increasing risk for clubfoot, spina bifida, and strabismus was found when examining whether father smoked, mother smoked, or both parents smoked relative to non-smoking parents (P = 0.029, 0.026, and 0.0005, respectively).",

    "abstract": "This secondary analysis aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors associated with monozygotic twins (MZTs) after assisted reproductive technology (ART).\nIn this retrospective cohort observational study, the treatment cycles were compared between MZT and non-MZT pregnancies using logistic regression analyses. Of the 11,501 patients with 13,225 pregnancies, 166 MZTs were diagnosed (1.44% in ART pregnant patients; 1.25% in pregnant cycles).\nResults of the logistic analysis revealed that embryo stage at transfer and number of good-quality embryos were independent predictive factors for MZTs. The thresholds for two factors were 3.5 and 3.5. The efficacy of embryo stage at transfer and number of good-quality embryos for MZTs were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic curves. The areas under the curve (AUCs) for these two parameters were 0.708 and 0.633, respectively. Adding number of good quality embryos increased the discriminative ability of the model (AUC\u2009=\u20090.745).\nThe incidence of MZTs, subsequent to ART, is quite high. Extended culture (\u22653.5 days), together with the number of good-quality embryos (\u22653.5), conferred the greatest risk of producing MZTs.",

    "abstract": "More education is associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) and likelihood of being obese. Obesity and BMI also have a strong genetic basis. Given these observations, we investigate whether more education can reduce obesity by attenuating the underlying genetic risk of being obese, through gene-environment (GxE) interactions. We estimate associations between (i) education, (ii) a genetic risk score (GRS) and (iii) GxE interactions between education and the GRS through Ordinary least Squares (OLS) and twins fixed-effect regressions using data on female twins from the TwinsUK database. OLS estimates show that there are significant associations of education and genetics. Female twins with a university education are 14.3 percentage points less likely to be obese compared to twins with less than compulsory education, and a 1 standard deviation increase in the GRS increases the likelihood of being obese by 5.2 percentage points. The GxE interactions are statistically insignificant, suggesting that the marginal association of the GRS with obesity does not differ by educational attainment. When controlling for confounding through twins fixed-effects, we find a smaller role of genetics. The association of the GRS with obesity decreases to 0.040. Associations of educational attainment are substantially reduced and insignificant. GxE interactions also remain insignificant. Overall, we find little evidence of any GxE interactions.",

It may be made of hair (trichobezoar), vegetable or fruit (phytobezoar), or other indigestible materials. Trichobezoars are thought to form due to hair's natural enduring nature, as they get matted and stick together in the gut. We present the case of a young female who was 16-weeks pregnant with twins presenting to the general surgery clinic with abdominal pain, vomiting and a palpable abdominal mass, which eventually turned out to be a massive trichobezoar manifesting as Rapunzel syndrome. Rapunzel syndrome is a large trichobezoar extending from the stomach into the small intestine. This is perhaps the first reported case of Rapunzel syndrome in a patient pregnant with twins.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation arrays are widely used in epigenome-wide association studies and methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) studies. Here, we performed the first genome-wide analysis of monozygotic (MZ) twin correlations and mQTLs on data obtained with the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC array) and compared the performance of the EPIC array to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450 array) for buccal-derived DNA.\nGood-quality EPIC data were obtained for 102 buccal-derived DNA samples from 49 MZ twin pairs (mean age\u2009=\u20097.5\u00a0years, range\u2009=\u20091-10). Differences between MZ twins in the cellular content of buccal swabs were a major driver for differences in their DNA methylation profiles, highlighting the importance to adjust for cellular composition in DNA methylation studies of buccal-derived DNA. After adjusting for cellular composition, the genome-wide mean correlation (r) between MZ twins was 0.21 for the EPIC array, and cis mQTL analysis in 84 twins identified 1,296,323 significant associations (FDR 5%), encompassing 33,749 methylation sites and 616,029 genetic variants. MZ twin correlations were slightly larger (p\u2009<\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nWe conclude that the contribution of familial factors to individual differences in DNA methylation and the effect of mQTLs are larger for novel EPIC probes, especially those within regulatory elements connected to active regions specific to the investigated tissue.",

Differences between MZ twins in the cellular content of buccal swabs were a major driver for differences in their DNA methylation profiles, highlighting the importance to adjust for cellular composition in DNA methylation studies of buccal-derived DNA. After adjusting for cellular composition, the genome-wide mean correlation (r) between MZ twins was 0.21 for the EPIC array, and cis mQTL analysis in 84 twins identified 1,296,323 significant associations (FDR 5%), encompassing 33,749 methylation sites and 616,029 genetic variants.

    "abstract": "Alcohol involvement has familial associations with bulimic symptoms (i.e., binge eating, inappropriate compensatory behaviors), with several studies indicating a genetic overlap between the two. It is unclear whether overlapping familial risk with alcohol involvement extends to other eating disorder symptoms. Understanding the genetic overlap between alcohol involvement and other eating disorder symptoms may aid in more targeted interventions for comorbid alcohol use-eating disorder symptoms. Thus, we investigated associations between alcohol involvement and 2 core eating disorder symptoms: drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction in adolescent female and male twins.\nWe assessed 3 levels of alcohol involvement: alcohol use in the last month, having ever been intoxicated, and alcohol intoxication frequency via self-report. The Eating Disorder Inventory-II assessed drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction. Sex-specific biometrical twin modeling examined the genetic overlap between alcohol involvement and eating disorder symptoms.\nPhenotypic associations between alcohol involvement, drive for thinness, and body dissatisfaction were significantly greater in girls compared with boys. A majority of the associations between alcohol involvement, drive for thinness, and body dissatisfaction in girls, but not boys, met our threshold for twin modeling (phenotypic r\u00a0>\u00a00.20). Moderate genetic correlations were observed between the 3 aspects of alcohol involvement and drive for thinness. Moderate genetic correlations were observed between alcohol use and intoxication frequency and body dissatisfaction.\nTogether with the literature on alcohol involvement and bulimic symptoms, these findings suggest a generalized association between alcohol involvement and eating disorder symptoms in girls, whereas this association may be symptom specific in boys. Genetic correlations indicate that the amount and direction of this genetic overlap differs across specific symptoms. When intervening on comorbid alcohol involvement and eating disorder symptoms, it may be important to target-specific eating disorder symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited disease caused by mutations in genes that are primarily involved in DNA damage response or repair. The disease is often characterized by congenital malformations, progressive bone marrow failure, abnormal skin pigmentation patterns and susceptibility to cancer. The present study describes a pair of 4-year-old male twins, both of whom had been suffering from upper respiratory tract infections for >2 years. There was no indication of discomfort including fever, coughing, bleeding or fatigue from either child when the upper respiratory tract infection disappeared. Physical examination of the twins did not reveal anything significant, and no external anomalies were observed. In order to obtain additional diagnostic evidence, next-generation gene sequencing, chromosome breakage analysis and comet assays were performed. The results revealed double heterozygous mutations in the Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 gene of the twins, therefore providing a conclusive diagnosis of FA. The case highlights how difficulties in clinical diagnosis may be overcome by including genetic screening tests into the range of diagnostic tests, which may also reveal unexpected results.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twinning is a rare congenital malformation, and the resultant huge body wall defects after separation of conjoined twins represent a real challenge to surgeons.\nFrom 2004 to 2009, authors performed body wall reconstruction for 2 pairs of thoraco-omphalopagus twins and 1 pair of ischiopagus tetrapus twins. Before separation, the techniques of tissue expansion and tractive training were adopted to acquire sufficient skin for final coverage. After separation, the defects of thoracic cage and abdominal myofascial system were repaired with synthetic materials. The closure of the wounds was performed with artificial skin temporarily or by the use of local flaps in 1 stage.\nThe first pair of thoraco-omphalopagus twins died of circulatory and respiratory failure after emergency surgery, and the other 2 pairs of conjoined twins survived. The second pair of thoraco-omphalopagus twins had wound dehiscence and partial flap necrosis after surgery. The expanded polytetrafluoroethylene mesh in 1 sister of the ischiopagus twins was removed because of local infection 4 years after surgery.\nCompressive anatomical understandings and advanced skills in plastic surgery are required for body wall reconstruction in the separation of conjoined twins. In addition, the multidisciplinary team approach has an important role for obtaining satisfactory final surgical outcome.",

I examine the effects of birth weight on child health and growth using information from 66 countries. I account for missing data and measurement error using instrumental variables and adopt an identification strategy based on siblings and twins. I find a consistent effect of birth weight on mortality risk, stunting, wasting, and coughing, with some evidence for fever, diarrhoea, and anaemia. Bounds analysis indicates that coefficients may be substantially underestimated due to mortality selection. Improving the pre-natal environment is likely to be important for helping children reach their full potential.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy loss during the late embryonic and early fetal periods influences dairy herd economy. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the effects of a single or double GnRH dose administered at the time of pregnancy diagnosis (28-34 days post-AI) on the pregnancy survival of cows in their third lactation or further carrying live singletons or unilateral twins, and (2) examine the impacts of GnRH treatment on subsequent twin reduction in twin pregnancies. Cows carrying singletons (n = 1,054) or unilateral twins (n = 379) were assigned at the time of pregnancy diagnosis to the following groups: control (no treatment), GnRH (100 \u03bcg GnRH), and 2GnRH (200 \u03bcg GnRH). Pregnancy loss was recorded in 180 of the 1,433 cows (12.6%) at 58-64 days post-AI. Based on the odds ratios, there was a significant (P < 0.0001) interaction between the treatment group and twin pregnancy. This interaction implies that control cows carrying twins were 3.2 times more likely to suffer pregnancy loss than the other cows, whereas the GnRH and 2GnRH treatment groups cows carrying singletons or twins had pregnancy loss rates similar to the control cows carrying singletons. Twin reduction was observed in 35 twin pregnancies (9.2%). Cows in the GnRH and 2 GnRH groups were seven times more likely to show twin reduction than control cows. Our results indicate that GnRH administered at the time of pregnancy diagnosis had no beneficial effects in cows carrying singletons. In contrast, for twin pregnancies, the treatment increased the rate of pregnancy survival and was accompanied by an increase in the twin reduction rate.",

    "abstract": "AML with the RAM immunophenotype is associated with extremely poor prognosis. We report a rare case of monozygotic twins presenting simultaneously at the age of 2\u00a0years with RAM AML. Each twin underwent a myeloablative 7/10 unrelated umbilical cord blood transplant. Pretransplant Twin A's bone marrow was negative for MRD by flow cytometry (<0.01%) unlike Twin B's bone marrow (0.07%). Twin A is alive in remission 3\u00a0years from transplant. Twin B developed primary graft failure, but subsequently rescued with a haploidentical stem cell transplant. However, she relapsed and died 13\u00a0months from diagnosis. The twins' clinical courses demonstrate that upfront intensive chemotherapy to achieve negative MRD, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant as postremission intensification strategy, should be considered in this high-risk AML.",

    "abstract": "Indomethacin is a commonly used medication against preterm delivery. Several reports of fetal ductal constriction have been described after indomethacin use in the literature; however, there are no previously documented reports describing an association between Twin-Twin Transfusion syndrome and a constrictor effect of indomethacin on the ductus arteriosus. Two patients were referred to our department for Twin-Twin Transfusion syndrome and each underwent placental laser surgery. Constriction of the ductus arteriosus occurred as early as 20 and 24 weeks' gestation following maternal use of indomethacin after laser surgery. Spontaneous amelioration was observed after discontinuation of the drug. The constrictor effect of indomethacin on the ductus arteriosus can be observed even after a single dose and as early as 20 weeks of gestation in complicated monochorionic twin pregnancies. We emphasize meticulous use of indomethacin in complicated monochorionic twin pregnancies because the constrictive effect seems to be independent of gestational age.",

Nutritional support is essential to optimize growth and development in the neonatal period; however, very little data exists on the topic in this population. Conjoined twins require individualized nutritional assessment that focuses on the interaction between the metabolic rate, nutrient uptake, and nutrient delivery of each twin in the dyad. This report describes one center's experience with monitoring growth, establishing nutrient requirements, and determining substrate utilization in three sets of conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, constant load bending tests were performed on a nanocrystalline Ni nanowire specimen at different deformation temperatures using molecular dynamics simulation to investigate deformation behavior and mechanisms responsible for fracture. The nature of the fracture occurred in this nanowire specimen is found to transit from brittle to ductile as the temperature rises from 500 to 800\u00a0K. Also, with an increase in temperature, the fracture strain is increased indicating more plastic deformation prior to fracture. In the case of 500\u00a0K and 600\u00a0K deformation temperatures, fracture occurred along the shear band due to slip-twin interaction. On the other hand, at comparatively higher deformation temperatures, such as 700\u00a0K and 800\u00a0K, twinning and detwinning mechanisms are responsible for accommodating large plastic strain before fracture thus imparting plasticity in the specimen. It has also been found that formation and collapse of the stacking fault tetrahedron causes fracture of nanocrystalline Ni nanowire at 800\u00a0K.",

    "abstract": "Increasing numbers of twin pregnancies necessitate investigation of the risk factors associated with obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS). The aims of this study were to establish the incidence of OASIS, and compare women delivering twins to those delivering singletons in risk of OASIS plus maternal, neonatal, and obstetric outcomes.\nA retrospective cohort study was undertaken and included women delivering in a tertiary London maternity unit between 1999 and 2015; 51\u2009957 eligible women with singleton and 261 with twin pregnancies were identified. Women delivering twins were compared to those delivering singletons in the occurrence of maternal, neonatal, and obstetric outcomes using unadjusted relative risks. A secondary analysis was performed, and conditional logistic regression used to derive an adjusted relative risk of OASIS. Women delivering singletons were matched to those delivering twins for age, parity, ethnicity, gestation, and mode of delivery in a ratio of 2:1.\nCompared to the singleton group, mothers delivering twins had significantly more instrumental deliveries (RR [95%CI] 1.92 [1.67-2.27]; P\u2009<\u20090.0001), smaller fetuses (2754.1 vs 3383.8\u2009g; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and were older (32.9 vs 31.0 years; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). The twin group was not significantly different to the singleton group in risk of OASIS (RR 0.61 [0.27-1.33], P\u2009=\u20090.205). The conditional logistic regression demonstrated similar results for the risk of OASIS (adjusted RR\u2009=\u20090.58 [0.22-1.47]; P\u2009=\u20090.253).\nWomen delivering twins vaginally were not at a significantly higher risk of sustaining OASIS compared to those delivering singletons.",

Here we discuss the strategies found to be useful in planning for and responding to distinctive circumstances encountered throughout hospitalization, as well as lessons learned. Areas of focus include ensuring privacy, designing adequate unit accommodations to meet space and equipment needs, staffing considerations and adaptations to typical neonatal intensive care nursing interventions. The utility of a team-based approach to interdisciplinary care coordination is also discussed. With adequate preparation and thoughtful innovation, most tertiary neonatal intensive care units can readily adapt to the unique needs of conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "To compare developmental changes of delta 1 (0.5-2.0\u2009Hz) and delta 2 (2.25-3.75\u2009Hz) power spectra between healthy monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs and among MZ and DZ twin groups during active/REM (AS/REM) and quiet/NREM (QS/NREM) sleep stages at 38th, 46th, and 52nd weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA).\nElectroencephalography (EEG) recordings were analyzed using fast Fourier transforms. Differences in the developmental changes of delta power within twin pairs and between twin groups were estimated by calculating mean absolute differences of relative spectral values in delta 1 (0.5-2\u2009Hz) and delta 2 (2.25-3.75\u2009Hz) frequencies.\nA review of electrodes showed that relative delta 1 power decreased, whereas delta 2 power increased from 38th toward 52nd week of PMA regardless of zygosity, sleep stages, and electrode position. Twin groups did not significantly differ (\nDevelopmental changes of delta 1 and delta 2 power spectra occurred equally in MZ and DZ twin groups during AS and QS sleep stages at 38th, 46th, and 52th PMA. The rhythm of EEG maturation evidenced by the maturation of delta 1 and delta 2 power spectra was not dependent on zygosity.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a common autoimmune disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Epigenome-wide association studies can identify environmentally mediated epigenetic changes such as altered DNA methylation, which may also be influenced by genetic factors. To investigate possible contributions of DNA methylation to the aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis with minimum confounding genetic heterogeneity, we investigated genome-wide DNA methylation in disease-discordant monozygotic twin pairs.\nGenome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in 79 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for rheumatoid arthritis using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (Illumina). Discordant twins were tested for both differential DNA methylation and methylation variability between rheumatoid arthritis and healthy twins. The methylation variability signature was then compared with methylation variants from studies of other autoimmune diseases and with an independent healthy population.\nWe have identified a differentially variable DNA methylation signature that suggests multiple stress response pathways may be involved in the aetiology of the disease. This methylation variability signature also highlighted potential epigenetic disruption of multiple RUNX3 transcription factor binding sites as being associated with disease development. Comparison with previously performed epigenome-wide association studies of rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes identified shared pathways for autoimmune disorders, suggesting that epigenetics plays a role in autoimmunity and offering the possibility of identifying new targets for intervention.\nThrough genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in disease-discordant monozygotic twins, we have identified a differentially variable DNA methylation signature, in the absence of differential methylation in rheumatoid arthritis. This finding supports the importance of epigenetic variability as an emerging component in autoimmune disorders.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study is to explore genetic factors determining difference of cleft side using whole-genome sequencing and evaluation of craniofacial morphology using cephalometric analysis between Japanese monozygotic (MZ) twins with mirror-image cleft lip and palate (CLP).\nWe selected a Japanese MZ twin pair (MZ-A and MZ-B) affected with unilateral CLP who are discordant for cleft side (left/right) and conducted whole-genome sequencing to identify genetic factors determining cleft side. Moreover, we compared their craniofacial morphologies using cephalograms.\nWhole-genome sequencing results suggested that no discordant DNA variants were found between MZ-A and MZ-B. The comparison of craniofacial morphology between the MZ twins revealed that MZ-B had maxillary deficiency and slightly more mandibular protrusion than MZ-A.\nIt is indicated that environmental factors might be a critical factor that influences the determination of difference of cleft side in orofacial clefts. In addition, we found some differences in craniofacial morphology between MZ-A and MZ-B. Our findings suggest that various environmental factors, such as epigenetics, might be a critical factor that influences the determination of difference of cleft side in CLP rather than inherited genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome typically occurs in the second trimester in 10-15% of monochorionic twin pregnancies. Vascular anastomoses of monochorionic placentae are the underlying cause of the development of the syndrome. If a blood flow imbalance occurs, one fetus becomes the so-called donor twin and the other the recipient. If untreated, perinatal mortality is 80-90%. Fetoscopic laser coagulation of the vascular anastomoses destroys the cause of the syndrome and leads to dual twin survival rates of around 70% and more than 90% of pregnancies with at least one survivor. However, unequal placental sharing, intrauterine death, and severe prematurity are still limiting factors for further improvement of survival rates and decreases in long-term morbidity. Prematurity and neurodevelopmental impairment affect the donor and recipient twins, whereas cardiovascular failure and obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract are typical complications of recipients, which can lead to long-term morbidity. In this Review, we summarise the literature on follow-up data for survivors of twin-to-twin-transfusion syndrome after laser therapy, including neurodevelopmental outcomes, cardiovascular outcomes, growth, renal function, and ischaemic events, as well as the potential effects of intrauterine programming on later life.",

    "abstract": "The number of multiple pregnancies has been significantly increased in the last decades due to assisted reproduction techniques development. Compared to singleton, twins and multiple pregnancies are associated to more complications and risks for both mother and children. The objective of this study was to examine the proportion of patients preferring a multiple birth over a singleton after an IVF/ICSI attempt, their reasons and the influence of socio-demographic and clinical parameters on their preference.\nA prospective study was conducted in two different Spanish centers in 2014; a public university hospital and a private clinic, with different populations and embryo transfer policies. In order to evaluate patients and partners attitudes towards twins and singletons, an anonymous 10-question survey was conducted and 399 were invited to participate.\n58.2% of participants preferred having twins to having one child at a time and 4.8% preferred triplets. Primary reasons for preferring twins were \"avoiding a new IVF/ICSI attempt\" (61.6%), \"I like the idea of having twins\" (27.3%), \"avoiding the waiting list\" (5.8%), and \"in my opinion with the latest technology, the rate and severity of complications in multiple pregnancies are low\" (5.2%). The multivariate analysis showed that the only significant parameter related to a preference for multiplets was the transfer of women's own fresh embryos (OR=3.31).\nTwin pregnancy risks are not perceived as important by the majority of IVF/ICSI couples, and many of them specifically prefer twins. In our opinion, much more information is needed highlighting the multiple pregnancy risks and that information should come from medical sources besides general media.",

    "abstract": "Advances in critical care and technology capabilities may lead to new ethical encounters in paediatrics, especially in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). As each patient has unique psychosocial and clinical condition interactions, paediatricians and healthcare providers must develop and adopt a suitable approach for ethical decision-making in the PICU. The healthcare provider needs to balance the four ethical domains of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice, and apply these principles to clinical decision-making. One chief factor for ethical decision-making is to have a patient-centered and family-oriented management that is respectful of cultural background. Healthcare providers also need to observe professional ethical conduct and the applicable national laws. Applying these ethical guidelines in paediatric care ensures a more holistic approach to care, whether in the paediatric wards or the highly technical environment of the PICU. We describe two situations in which the parents of twins with a confirmed lethal disease changed their attitude towards end-of-life from full support to \"do not resuscitate\" and palliative care, after experiencing the palliative care of the first twin, rather than the futile effect of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the other twin.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare occurrence that offer unique challenges and circumstances to therapists. The overall goal of physical and occupational therapy treatment is to provide care that promotes developmental progression to two conjoined individuals with distinct personalities and potentially different physical and medical needs. The unique presentation of conjoined twins must be considered in determining therapeutic goals, interventions and plans of care. Providing therapeutic interventions throughout the NICU stay is a dynamic, evolving process, which challenges the therapy team to work together to find solutions. This paper aims to highlight the considerations, challenges, and strategies used to address barriers in the therapeutic care of conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "The Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM) provides Disinhibition, Boldness, and Meanness scales for assessing the three trait domains of the triarchic model. Here we examined the genetic and environmental etiology of these three domains, including evaluation of potential sex differences.\nA total of 1016 men and women ages 19-20 years were drawn from the University of Southern California Risk Factors for Antisocial Behavior twin study.\nScores for the three TriPM scales were correlated to differing degrees, with the strongest phenotypic correlation between Disinhibition and Meanness. No sex differences were found in the genetic and environmental influences underlying these three domains, suggesting that the same genes and life experiences contribute to these traits in young men and women. For TriPM Disinhibition and Boldness, genetic factors explained about half or less of the variance, with the rest of the variance being explained by non-shared environmental factors. For TriPM Meanness, on the other hand, genetic, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental factors accounted for the variance. The phenotypic correlation between Disinhibition and Meanness was explained in part by common genes (26%), with the remainder attributable about equally to common shared (39%), and non-shared environmental influences (35%).\nThese findings contribute to our understanding of psychopathic personality traits by demonstrating the importance of heritable factors for disinhibition and boldness facets of psychopathy, and the importance of shared environmental influences for the meanness facet.",

    "abstract": "Moyamoya disease (MMD) is characterized by progressive stenosis of intracranial arteries in the circle of Willis with unknown etiology even after the identification of a Moyamoya susceptible gene, RNF213. Recently, differences in epigenetic regulations have been investigated by a case-control study in MMD. Here, we employed a disease discordant monozygotic twin-based study design to unmask potential confounders.\nCirculating genome-wide microRNA (miRNome) profiling was performed in MMD-discordant monozygotic twins, non-twin-MMD patients, and non-MMD healthy volunteers by microarray followed by qPCRvalidation, using blood samples. Differential plasma-microRNAs were further quantified in endothelial cells differentiated from iPS cell lines (iPSECs) derived from another independent non-twin cohort. Lastly, their target gene expression in the iPSECs was analyzed.\nMicroarray detected 309 plasma-microRNAs in MMD-discordant monozygotic twins that were also detected in the non-twin cohort. Principal component analysis of the plasma-microRNA expression level demonstrated distinct 2 groups separated by MMD and healthy control in the twin- and non-twin cohorts. Of these, differential upregulations of hsa-miR-6722-3p/-\u2009328-3p were validated in the plasma of MMD (absolute log2 expression fold change (logFC)\u2009>\u20090.26 for the twin cohort; absolute logFC >\u20090.26, p\u2009<\u20090.05, and q\u2009<\u20090.15 for the non-twin cohort). In MMD derived iPSECs, hsa-miR-6722-3p/-\u2009328-3p showed a trend of up-regulation with a 3.0- or higher expression fold change. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 41 target genes of miR-6722-3p/-\u2009328-3p were significantly down-regulated in MMD derived iPSECs and were involved in STAT3, IGF-1-, and PTEN-signaling, suggesting a potential microRNA-gene expression interaction between circulating plasma and endothelial cells.\nOur MMD-discordant monozygotic twin-based study confirmed a novel circulating microRNA signature in MMD as a potential diagnostic biomarker minimally confounded by genetic heterogeneity. The novel circulating microRNA signature can contribute for the future functional microRNA analysis to find new diagnostic and therapeutic target of MMD.",

Principal component analysis of the plasma-microRNA expression level demonstrated distinct 2 groups separated by MMD and healthy control in the twin- and non-twin cohorts. Of these, differential upregulations of hsa-miR-6722-3p/-\u2009328-3p were validated in the plasma of MMD (absolute log2 expression fold change (logFC)\u2009>\u20090.26 for the twin cohort; absolute logFC >\u20090.26, p\u2009<\u20090.05, and q\u2009<\u20090.15 for the non-twin cohort). In MMD derived iPSECs, hsa-miR-6722-3p/-\u2009328-3p showed a trend of up-regulation with a 3.0- or higher expression fold change. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 41 target genes of miR-6722-3p/-\u2009328-3p were significantly down-regulated in MMD derived iPSECs and were involved in STAT3, IGF-1-, and PTEN-signaling, suggesting a potential microRNA-gene expression interaction between circulating plasma and endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "The management of conjoined twins is complex and requires careful preparation. Pre-birth management includes prenatal counseling, which is important due to the overall poor prognosis. In instances of trial of life, the delivery must be tailored to address the anticipated anatomy based on prenatal imaging and anticipated physiology. A multidisciplinary team is essential to anticipate and address the ergonomic challenges and medical issues related to organ fusion, cross-circulation and associated anomalies. There are several suggested modifications to the current Neonatal Resuscitation Program algorithm including modifications to initial assessment, airway management, administration of chest compressions, obtaining emergency access, and medication dosing. Simulation is essential to address challenges, practice Neonatal Resuscitation Program modifications, delineate clear roles during delivery and practice communication. This paper offers a discussion of unique issues associated with delivery of conjoined twins and recommendations on how to approach these challenges based on our experience and available literature.",

    "abstract": "We sought to assess the incidence of severe neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in monochorionic twins treated for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and compare it to the incidence in uncomplicated monochorionic twins.\nWe included TTTS pregnancies treated by fetoscopic selective laser coagulation (FSLC) or umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) in 2004-2015. Primary outcome was severe NDI defined as cerebral palsy, bilateral blindness or bilateral deafness (ICD-10 diagnoses), and severe cognitive and/or motor delay (assessed by the Ages and Stages Questionnaires [ASQ]).\nA total of 124 children after TTTS and 98 controls were followed up at 25 months of age (SD 11.4). Severe NDI was found in 8.9% of the TTTS children (10.5% [9/86] after FSLC; 5.3% [2/38] after UCO) compared to 3.1% in the control group (p = 0.10). The odds ratio for severe NDI was 1.8 in cases versus controls (p = 0.37). The total ASQ score was significantly lower in the TTTS group than in controls (p = 0.03) after FSLC (p = 0.03) and after UCO (p = 0.14).\nChildren after TTTS appear to have a higher risk of severe NDI and score significantly lower on the ASQ compared to monochorionic twins from uncomplicated pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cerclage treatment for cervical changes at mid trimester is a very controversial topic in twins. The aim of the study was to present our maternal and fetal outcomes of mid-trimester cervical cerclage in twin pregnancies.\nThis study was performed using data extracted from the medical files of the twin pregnancies whom performed emergency cervical cerclage between January 2012 and March 2018 at Trakya University, Facuty of Medicine, Department of Perinatology.\nMean (min.-max.) gestational age at delivery was [27.3 (21-34) weeks]. The median time between cervical cerclage and delivery was 6.4 weeks, while the maximum prolongation of the pregnancy was 11 weeks. The median prolongation period of pregnancy was 4.1 weeks in patients with bulging membranes, but 10 weeks in patients with cervical effacement and cervical shortening. Eight infants died at the neonatal period. Two patients (20%) developed late abortions at 21 and 22 weeks of gestation, and 2 women (20%) delivered extremely premature neonates at the 24th weeks. Overall neonatal mortality rate was 40% (8/20 neonates). Twelve out of twenty were born alive (60%).\nDespite the lack of randomized controlled trials, it seems reasonable to offer emergency cervical cerclage to twin pregnancies with cervical shortening (<15mm). For the twin pregnancies with advanced cervical dilatation and protruding membranes, emergency cervical cerclage should be an option only for carefully selected patients after informing about the complications and low success rate.",

The modality of simulation offers a safe practice environment for a multidisciplinary group consisting of neonatal providers, nurses, respiratory therapists, and surgeons in which to identify and address clinical decision making, procedural, and behavioral plans related to routine and emergency care of these patients. Simulation-based clinical rehearsals (SbCR) provide a unique opportunity to prepare for rare, complex, and patient specific clinical procedures and scenarios. This primer serves as a revisable tool that promotes the development of proper timing, technique, and confidence to allow for an optimal setting for delivery of safe care to conjoined twins.

    "abstract": "In this Letter, we establish and explore a new connection between quantum information theory and classical statistical mechanics by studying the problem of qubit losses in 2D topological color codes. We introduce a protocol to cope with qubit losses, which is based on the identification and removal of a twin qubit from the code, and which guarantees the recovery of a valid three-colorable and trivalent reconstructed color code. Moreover, we show that determining the corresponding qubit loss error threshold is equivalent to a new generalized classical percolation problem. We numerically compute the associated qubit loss thresholds for two families of 2D color code and find that with p=0.461\u00b10.005 these are close to satisfying the fundamental limit of 50% as imposed by the no-cloning theorem. Our findings reveal a new connection between topological color codes and percolation theory, show high robustness of color codes against qubit loss, and are directly relevant for implementations of topological quantum error correction in various physical platforms.",

    "abstract": "Variation in healthy aging and lifespan is ascribed more to various non-genetic factors than to inherited genetic determinants, and a major goal in aging research is to reveal the epigenetic basis of aging. One approach to this goal is to find genomic sites or regions where DNA methylation correlates with biological age. Using health data from 134 elderly twins, we calculated a frailty index as a quantitative indicator of biological age, and by applying the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip technology to their leukocyte DNA samples, we obtained quantitative DNA methylation data on genome-wide CpG sites. We analyzed the health and epigenome data by taking two independent associative approaches: the parametric regression-based approach and a non-parametric machine learning approach followed by GO ontology analysis. Our results indicate that DNA methylation at CpG sites in the promoter region of PCDHGA3 is associated with biological age. PCDHGA3 belongs to clustered protocadherin genes, which are all located in a single locus on chromosome 5 in human. Previous studies of the clustered protocadherin genes showed that (1) DNA methylation is associated with age or age-related phenotypes; (2) DNA methylation can modulate gene expression; (3) dysregulated gene expression is associated with various pathologies; and (4) DNA methylation patterns at this locus are associated with adverse lifetime experiences. All these observations suggest that DNA methylation at the clustered protocadherin genes, including PCDHGA3, is a key mediator of healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "High protein intake in young children is associated with excess gains in weight and body fat, but the specific role of different protein sources has yet to be described. The study aimed to investigate the role of different types of protein in the post-weaning stage on weight, BMI and overweight/obesity at 60 months. Intakes of animal, dairy and plant protein and a dietary pattern characterising variation in protein types at 21 months of age were estimated using a 3-d diet diary in a cohort of 2154 twins; weight and height were recorded every 3 months from birth to 60 months. Longitudinal mixed-effect models investigated the associations between sources of protein intake or dietary pattern scores and BMI, weight and overweight/obesity from 21 months up to 60 months. Adjusting for confounders, dairy protein intake at 21 months was positively associated with greater weight (46 (95 % CI 21, 71) g and BMI up to 60 months (0\u00b704 (95 % CI 0\u00b7004, 0\u00b7070) kg/m2) and the odds of overweight/obesity at 3 years (OR 1\u00b712; 95 % CI 1\u00b700, 1\u00b724). Milk showed associations of similar magnitude. A dietary pattern low in dairy protein and high in plant protein was associated with lower weight gain up to 60 months, but not overweight/obesity. Intake of dairy products in early childhood is most strongly associated with weight gain, compared with other protein sources. A dietary pattern characterised by lower protein intake and greater protein source diversity at 2 years may confer a lower risk of excess weight gain.",

    "abstract": "A recent case of conjoined twins required multiple hospitalizations in the pediatric intensive care unit and led to a difficult situation confronting staff regarding the potential separation where surgery would result in the death of one twin. The hospital ethics committee was consulted. A systematic approach was utilized to examine medical standards, historical precedents, and various ethical and legal frameworks. The ethics committee believed that either proceeding with or forgoing attempted separation surgery would be ethically acceptable. We share our reasoning and lessons learned for others facing this situation in the future.",

    "abstract": "Sharing of the vascular system in conjoined twins creates pharmaceutical dilemmas that require individualization of protocols. One of the major goals for the medical team is to determine how medications should be administered, dosed, and monitored in each set of conjoined twins. In order to achieve these goals, the team must determine the extent of shared circulation, volume of distribution, effectiveness of enteral absorption, renal clearance, and develop processes to ensure medication safety. In this article, we discuss unique challenges in medication practices in conjoined twins and present general principles that can be applied to determine optimal pharmaceutical strategies.",

    "abstract": "In order to investigate the competitive interaction between nanoparticles and twin, the eutectic Si microstructures in Al\u207b10Si (wt. %) base alloys with exclusive and combined addition of Sr and Sb are characterized by combined TEM and atom probe tomography (APT). The chemical short range order in Sb\u207bSb and Sb\u207bSr pairs is revealed by ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, which promotes the formation of clusters and nanoparticles. The coexistence of nanoparticles and twins is observed in Sb containing alloys, with a negative correlation in the corresponding number density, owing to the competitive stacking of precursors and individual atoms at the solid\u207bliquid interface. Large size particles around 70 nm with a uniform distribution of Sr atoms are formed in Al\u207b10Si\u207b0.35Sb\u207b0.015Sr (wt. %) alloys, due to the precursor aggregation and homogeneous nucleation in the droplets that nucleation are depressed. A model for the formation of nanoparticles and their interaction with twins is proposed.",

    "abstract": "Variation in DNA methylation is being increasingly associated with health and disease outcomes. Although DNA methylation is hypothesized to be a mechanism by which both genetic and non-genetic factors can influence the regulation of gene expression, little is known about the extent to which DNA methylation at specific sites is influenced by heritable as well as environmental factors. We quantified DNA methylation in whole blood at age 18 in a birth cohort of 1,464 individuals comprising 426 monozygotic (MZ) and 306 same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. Site-specific levels of DNA methylation were more strongly correlated across the genome between MZ than DZ twins. Structural equation models revealed that although the average contribution of additive genetic influences on DNA methylation across the genome was relatively low, it was notably elevated at the highly variable sites characterized by intermediate levels of DNAm that are most relevant for epigenetic epidemiology. Sites at which variable DNA methylation was most influenced by genetic factors were significantly enriched for DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) effects, and overlapped with sites where inter-individual variation correlates across tissues. Finally, we show that DNA methylation at sites robustly associated with environmental exposures such as tobacco smoking and obesity is also influenced by additive genetic effects, highlighting the need to control for genetic background in analyses of exposure-associated DNA methylation differences. Estimates of the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to DNA methylation at all sites profiled in this study are available as a resource for the research community (http://www.epigenomicslab.com/online-data-resources).",

    "abstract": "We studied whether objectively measured physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) are associated with cognition in Finnish elderly twins.\nThis cross-sectional study comprised twins born in Finland from 1940 to 1944 in the Older Finnish Twin Cohort (mean age, 72.9\u00a0years; 726 persons). From 2014 to 2016, cognition was assessed with a validated telephonic interview, whereas PA was measured with a waist-worn accelerometer.\nIn between-family models, SB and light physical activity had significant linear associations with cognition after adjusting for age, sex, wearing time, education level, body mass index, and living condition (SB: \u03b2-estimate, -0.21 [95% confidence intervals, -0.42 to -0.003]; light physical activity: \u03b2-estimate, 0.30 [95% confidence intervals, 0.02-0.58]). In within-family models, there were no significant linear associations between objectively measured PA and cognition.\nObjectively measured light physical activity and SB are associated with cognition in Finnish twins in their seventies, but the associations were attributable to genetic and environmental selection.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have examined associations between peripheral DNA methylation patterns of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) promoter and symptoms of depression and anxiety. The SLC6A4 promoter methylation has also been associated with frontal-limbic brain responses to negative stimuli. However, it is unclear how much of this association is confounded by DNA sequence variations. We utilized a monozygotic-twin within-pair discordance design, to test whether DNA methylation at specific CpG sites in the SLC6A4 promoter of peripheral cells is associated with greater frontal-limbic brain responses to negative stimuli (sadness and fear), independently of DNA sequence effects. In total 48 pairs of healthy 15-year-old monozygotic twins from the Quebec Newborn Twin Study, followed regularly since birth, underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while conducting an emotion-processing task. The SLC6A4 promoter methylation level was assessed in saliva samples using pyrosequencing. Relative to the co-twins with lower SLC6A4 promoter methylation levels, twins with higher peripheral SLC6A4 methylation levels showed greater orbitofrontal cortical (OFC) activity and left amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left amygdala-right OFC connectivity in response to sadness as well as greater ACC-left amygdala and ACC-left insula connectivity in response to fearful stimuli. By utilising a monozygotic-twin design, we provided evidence that associations between peripheral SLC6A4 promoter methylation and frontal-limbic brain responses to negative stimuli are, in part, independent of DNA sequence variations. Although causality cannot be determined here, SLC6A4 promoter methylation may be one of the mechanisms underlying how environmental factors influence the serotonin system, potentially affecting emotional processing through frontal-limbic areas.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that fetal plasma erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations are significantly increased in growth-restricted fetuses with abnormal umbilical artery (UA) Doppler. During hypoxia in an ovine model, the primary site of fetal EPO synthesis was switched from the kidneys to the placenta. Therefore, we designed this study to evaluate human placental EPO gene expression and the correlation to fetal serum EPO concentration in growth-restricted fetuses in a monochorionic (MC) twin model.\nIn MC twin pairs, selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) was defined as the presence of (i) birth weight discordance of >\u200920% and (ii) a smaller twin with a birth weight less than the 10th percentile. Fetal UA and middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler were checked within 1\u00a0week before delivery. An abnormal UA Doppler was defined as persistently absent or reverse end-diastolic flow. Cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) was defined as MCA-pulsatility index (PI)/UA-PI. Fetal plasma EPO concentrations were measured in cord blood, and EPO gene expression was assayed in each twin's placental territory. The intertwin plasma EPO ratio was calculated as the cord plasma EPO level of the smaller (or sIUGR) twin divided by the EPO concentration of the larger (or appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA)) twin, and the intertwin placental EPO gene expression ratio was calculated similarly.\nTwenty-six MC twins were analyzed, including normal twins (Group 1, n\u2009=\u20099), twins with sIUGR without UA Doppler abnormalities (Group 2, n\u2009=\u20099), and twins with sIUGR and UA Doppler abnormalities (Group 3, n\u2009=\u20098). The CPRs of smaller (sIUGR) fetuses were significantly decreased in Group 3 MC twins (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but not significantly different between Group 1 and Group 2. The highest fetal plasma EPO ratio and placental EPO gene expression ratio were identified in Group 3 MC twins (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The placental EPO gene expression ratios were significantly correlated with the fetal plasma EPO ratios (Pearson's correlation test, p\u2009=\u20090.004).\nThis study provides evidence of increased placental EPO expression in MC twin fetuses with sIUGR and abnormal UA Doppler. Future studies are needed to confirm the similar role of placental EPO in severe IUGR singletons.",

    "abstract": "While their incidence is on the rise, twin pregnancies are associated with risks to the mothers and their babies. This study aims to investigate the likelihood of adverse neonatal outcomes of twins following assisted reproductive technology (ART) compared to non-ART twins.\nA retrospective population study using the Australian National Perinatal Data Collections (NPDC) which included 19,662 twins of \u226520\u00a0weeks gestational age or\u2009\u2265\u2009400\u00a0g birthweight in Australia. Maternal outcomes and neonatal outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight, resuscitation and neonatal death) were compared. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to assess the likelihood of any neonatal outcomes, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) presented. Weinberg's differential rule was used to estimate monozygotic twin rate.\nART mothers were 3.3\u00a0years older than non-ART mothers. The rates of pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes were significantly higher for ART mothers than non-ART mothers (12.2% vs. 8.4%, p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.01) and (9.7% vs. 7.5%, p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.01) respectively. The incidence of monozygotic twins was 2.0% for ART twins and 1.1% for non-ART twins. Compared with non-ART twins, ART twins had higher rates of preterm birth (AOR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.22), low birth weight (AOR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.22), and resuscitation (AOR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.17-1.36). Liveborn ART twins had 28% (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50) increased odds of having any adverse neonatal outcome compared to liveborn non-ART twins, especially for opposite-sex ART twins (AOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.11-1.82).\nAs ART twins had higher rates of adverse outcome, special prenatal care is recommended. Couples accessing ART should be fully informed of the risk of adverse outcome of twin pregnancies.",

The rates of pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes were significantly higher for ART mothers than non-ART mothers (12.2% vs. 8.4%, p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.01) and (9.7% vs. 7.5%, p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.01) respectively. The incidence of monozygotic twins was 2.0% for ART twins and 1.1% for non-ART twins. Compared with non-ART twins, ART twins had higher rates of preterm birth (AOR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.22), low birth weight (AOR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.22), and resuscitation (AOR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.17-1.36). Liveborn ART twins had 28% (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50) increased odds of having any adverse neonatal outcome compared to liveborn non-ART twins, especially for opposite-sex ART twins (AOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.11-1.82).",

    "abstract": "Clinical phenotype variability in MEN1 syndrome exists and evidence for an established genotype-phenotype is lacking. However, a higher aggressiveness of MEN1-associated gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) (neuro)endocrine tumours (NETs) tumours has been reported when MEN1 gene truncating mutations are detected. We found a novel germline truncating mutation of MEN1 gene at exon 10 in a subject with an aggressive clinical behavior of GEP-NETs. Successively, other two mutant-affected familial members have been identified.\nThe aim of this observational study was to investigate genotype-phenotype correlation in these three members, with attention to GPE-NETs behavior over the years.\nThe genetic and clinical data obtained and the follow-up screening program (2012-2016) were according to the International Guidelines in a multidisciplinary academic reference center. The familial history collected strongly suggested MEN1 GEP-NETs in at least other four members from different generations.\nThree MEN1 patients (aged 30-69\u00a0years at MEN1 diagnosis) were clinically screened for MEN1 GEP-NETs, both functioning and nonfunctioning.\nBiochemical, imaging, and nuclear medicine tests and fine-needle agobiopsy were performed, depending on found/emerging clinical symptoms/biochemical abnormalities, and made when necessary.\nOur clinical survey found strong genotype-phenotype correlation with aggressive MEN1 GEP-NETs (G1, G2-NETs, and multiple ZES/gastrinomas) over the years. The familial history strongly suggested ZES/gastrinoma in progenitors from previous generations.\nThis novel MEN1 truncating mutation correlates with an aggressive evolution and behavior of MEN1 GEP-NETs in studied affected subjects, confirming the need for MEN1 individuals to be evaluated by a skilled multidisciplinary team, as also stated by International Guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Renal transplantation between monozygous identical twins provides an opportunity to utilize minimal immunosuppression to maintain stable allograft function, thereby alleviating the toxicities of immunosuppressive therapy. Despite monozygosity, there is a possibility of discordant protein presentation in identical twins that could trigger alloimmune response and lead to graft injury. Therefore, the optimal immunosuppression regimen in this patient population is unknown, and the safety of immunosuppression withdrawal remains controversial. Herein, we describe two patients who underwent successful renal transplantation from monozygotic identical twin donors. Monozygosity was determined using short tandem repeat (STR) analysis. All immunosuppression was successfully discontinued at 2 days and 3 weeks, respectively, after transplantation. Both patients are alive with functioning renal grafts at 1 year and 5 years after transplant, respectively. These two cases suggest that immunosuppression can be withdrawn safely and rapidly in select monozygous identical twin renal transplant recipients.",

    "abstract": "We report on the case of two digestive malformations in dizygotic/dichorionic/diamniotic twins born at 31 weeks of gestation. The mother (gravida 1 para 0) was treated by hydroxychloroquine for systemic lupus erythematosus during pregnancy. Twin A presented an arch-like dilatation on antenatal ultrasounds, characteristic of segmental volvulus. After birth, twin B presented repeated vomiting on feeding, leading us to diagnose ileal atresia despite normal antenatal ultrasounds. Both twins underwent surgery and the postoperative period was uneventful. After 1\u2009year of follow-up, the twins are in excellent health without digestive sequelae. Genetic testing for cystic fibrosis was negative. The placenta showed diffuse signs of hypoxia and ischaemia, indicating that the root cause was vascular. The pathophysiology of intestinal atresia is hypothesised to derive from a vascular incident during fetal development. We are therefore led to believe that an intrauterine vascular event is the most likely cause of the dual malformation.",

    "abstract": "Familial monozygotic (MZ) twinning reports are rare around the world, and we report a four-generation pedigree with seven recorded pairs of female MZ twins. Whole-genome sequencing of seven family members was performed to explore the featured genetic factors in MZ twins. For variations specific to MZ twins, five novel variants were observed in the X chromosome. These candidates were used to explain the seemingly X-linked dominant inheritance pattern, and only one variant was exonic, located at the 5'UTR region of ZCCHC12 (chrX: 117958597, G > A). Besides, consistent mitochondrial DNA composition in the maternal linage precluded roles of mitochondria for this trait. In this pedigree, autosomes also contain diverse variations specific to MZ twins. Pathway analysis revealed a significant enrichment of genes carrying novel SNVs in the epithelial adherens junction-signaling pathway (p = .011), contributed by FGFR1, TUBB6, and MYH7B. Meanwhile, TBC1D22A, TRIOBP, and TUBB6, also carrying similar SNVs, were involved in the GTPase family-mediated signal pathway. Furthermore, gene-set enrichment analysis for 533 genes covered by copy number variations specific to MZ twins illustrated that the tight junction-signaling pathway was significantly enriched (p < .001). Therefore, the novel changes in the X chromosome and the provided candidate variants across autosomes may be responsible for MZ twinning, giving clues to increase our understanding about the underlying mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Handedness effects with respect to regional corpus callosum (CC) anatomy remain open to question. Midsagittal CC tracings were obtained from structural MRIs in 21 female monozygotic twin pairs with discordant handedness (MZHd). The CC was divided into 99 percentile widths which were grouped into seven regions based on Denenberg's (1989, 1991b) factor analysis. Results showed that left handed (LH) twins had significantly larger regional widths in CC region W22-39 compared to right handed (RH) twins, an effect present in 19/21 MZHd pairs. Cross-study analyses revealed CC W22-39 to have the highest variation across female singletons (Cowell et al., 1992, 1993). In the adjacent genu region (W3-18), CC size did not differ between RH and LH twins. However, when twins were reclassified according to handedness direction and consistency to form consistent RH, non-consistent RH, consistent LH and non-consistent LH groups, patterns of CC size in W3-18 closely matched those of singleton women (Cowell et al., 1993). Namely, CC W3-18 was larger in consistent compared to non-consistent RHs. Results support a claim that CC region W22-39, interconnecting premotor cortex in females, provides for environmentally influenced components of handedness, given the difference within MZHd twin pairs. By contrast, CC W3-18, connecting prefrontal cortex, was sensitive to direction and consistency of handedness, both in twins and singletons, a result consistent with combined genetic and environmental effects. Findings highlight the significance of MZHd twin studies in elucidating the developmental mechanisms underpinning structure-function asymmetry, cortical interconnectivity and neurodevelopmental bases of left hand preference.",

    "abstract": "The change of twinning morphology plays an important role in the modification of Al-Si alloys, which are widely used in industrial applications. However, the interpretation of this change is still insufficient. In this work, the microstructure of twins was investigated in two kinds of Al-Si alloys with different additions of Ba using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Unlike the normal {111} twin that exists in Ba-free alloy, discontinuous twins and multiple twins were observed in the Ba-containing alloy. In addition, the 9R structure formed by the dissociation of twins was firstly observed at the turning of discontinuous twins and the intersection of multiple twins in Al-Si alloys.",

    "abstract": "Postzygotic mutations are DNA changes acquired from the zygote stage onwards throughout the lifespan. These changes lead to differences in DNA sequence among cells of an individual, potentially contributing to the etiology of complex disorders. Here we compared whole genome DNA sequence data of two monozygotic twin pairs, 40 and 100 years old, to detect somatic mosaicism. DNA samples were sequenced twice on two Illumina platforms (13X and 40X read depth) for increased specificity. Using differences in allelic ratios resulted in sets of 1,720 and 1,739 putative postzygotic mutations in the 40-year-old twin pair and 100-year-old twin pair, respectively, for subsequent enrichment analysis. This set of putative mutations was strongly (p\u00a0<\u00a04.37e-91) enriched in both twin pairs for regulatory elements. The corresponding genes were significantly enriched for genes that are alternatively spliced, and for genes involved in GTPase activity. This research shows that somatic mosaicism can be detected in monozygotic twin pairs by using allelic ratios calculated from DNA sequence data and that the mutations which are found by this approach are not randomly distributed throughout the genome.",

    "abstract": "Plesiotwins and diperiodic twins have in common the fact of being characterized by a low degree of lattice restoration. Plesiotwins differ from twins by the fact that the relative orientation of the individuals is obtained by a non-crystallographic rotation about the normal to the composition plane, whereas for twins this rotation is crystallographic, apart from possible small deviations coming from metric pseudosymmetries. In the case of plesiotwins, the low degree of lattice restoration comes from a large coincidence site lattice (CSL) in the composition plane. Diperiodic twins, instead, have a small CSL in the composition plane but the second plane of the same family contributing to the overall lattice restoration is too far away from the composition plane to be considered significant. It is shown that plesiotwins can occur as reflection twins if the composition plane is not parallel to the twin plane, and as rotation twins in the case of parallel hemitropy. Diperiodic twins can in principle occur in any category, but either the metric conditions to obtain a diperiodic twin are actually in contrast with the metric pseudosymmetry required for twinning or the result is actually a hybrid twin. This justifies why no confirmed examples of diperiodic twins are known to date.",

    "abstract": "A proposed marker of prenatal androgen exposure is the ratio of the index finger to ring finger (2D:4D). Within each sex, this ratio may be lower for those who were exposed to higher levels of androgens and become attracted to women, as compared to those who were exposed to lower levels of androgens and become attracted to men. We examined these patterns in identical twins with discordant sexual orientations. Because these twins are genetically identical, differences in prenatal androgen exposure, as reflected in their different finger length ratios, might contribute to their discordance. For 18 female twin pairs, non-straight (bisexual or lesbian) twins had significantly lower, or more masculinized, 2D:4D ratios than their straight co-twins, but only in the left hand. For 14 male pairs, non-straight twins had, contrary to our prediction, more masculinized finger length ratios than straight co-twins, but this difference was not significant. A reanalysis of present and previous data (Hall & Love, 2003; Hiraishi, Sasaki, Shikishima, & Ando, 2012) suggested that these patterns were robust. Furthermore, males had more masculinized 2D:4D ratios than females. This sex difference did not vary by sexual orientation.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether Kangaroo care (KC) influences the salivary oxytocin (OT) concentration in preterm infants, and which correlates affect the OT response.\nEleven twin pairs participated in a study in which we collected saliva using cotton swabs twice a day, once during KC and once during baseline conditions (lying in bed or incubator). The total study duration was five days. The saliva of twin siblings were pooled to obtain vials with sufficient volumes of either saliva collected during KC or at baseline. OT levels were measured using a radio-immuno assay. The infants' state of comfort and parent-infant interaction were examined using previously developed Likert-scales, amongst other correlates such as the KC duration, gestational age and birth weight.\nDuring KC, OT was lower compared to baseline (mean 1.39\u202fpg/ml (SD 0.58\u202fpg/ml) versus 2.40\u202fpg/ml (SD 1.64\u202fpg/ml), p\u202f=\u202f 0.03). Comfort at baseline and parent-infant interaction seemed to influence OT responses.\nThe OT concentration in the pooled saliva of preterm infant twins decreased during KC. This response of the OT system might be explained by stress during baseline.",

    "abstract": "Datasets comprising twins and their children can be a useful tool for understanding the nature of intergenerational associations between parent and offspring phenotypes. In the present article we explore structural equation models previously used to analyse Children-of-Twins data, highlighting some limitations and considerations. We then present new variants of these models, showing that extending the models to include multiple offspring per parent addresses several of the limitations discussed. Accompanying the updated models, we provide power calculations and demonstrate with application to simulated data. We then apply to intergenerational analyses of height and weight, using a sub-study of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa); the Intergenerational Transmission of Risk (IToR) project, wherein all kinships in the MoBa data have been identified (a children-of-twins-and-siblings study). Finally, we consider how to interpret the findings of these models and discuss future directions.",

    "abstract": "The presence of a skin-brain connection whereby alterations in the skin can inform on mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases is increasingly recognized. In this study, we used a discovery (n\u00a0=\u00a0321) and replication (n\u00a0=\u00a0147) sample from the Twins UK population to test the association between naevus count and memory function, and its mediation by telomeres. Memory function was assessed in 1999 and 2009 using the paired associates learning test (PAL), while naevus count and leucocyte telomere length (LTL, assessed by the terminal restriction fragment assay) were measured once. Higher baseline naevus count was significantly associated with fewer errors at the baseline and follow-up PAL, as well as with change in PAL score over 10\u00a0years. This association was significantly attenuated after adjustment for LTL. The significant association between naevus count and PAL score was reproduced in the replication sample. These findings suggest that melanocytes might be used as model system to study the biological ageing pathways involved in neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Alport syndrome is an X-linked syndrome that results in nephritis, renal failure, sensorineural hearing loss, and eye deficits. As a result of sensorineural hearing loss, these individuals are likely to experience difficulties in the area of speech and language. While studies in the past have examined the speech and language characteristics of children with syndromic sensorineural hearing loss, to our knowledge there are no previous studies to have documented the speech and language characteristics of these children on a long-term basis. The current study addresses this limitation by reporting speech, language, hearing, and function of twin brothers with X-linked Alport syndrome across a seven-year period. Information was collected by examining the medical records of the participants as well as through a verbal interview with the participants' guardian. Results revealed that the participants' hearing abilities gradually deteriorated over the seven-year period which affected their speech and language development as well. The kidney function tests revealed significant presence of hematuria (blood in the urine) as well as proteinuria (protein in the urine) suggesting chronic kidney dysfunction. This longitudinal study demonstrates the functional relationship between the kidneys and the cochlea, although they appear to be independent of one another. As individuals with Alport syndrome exhibit systemic complications, interdisciplinary collaboration is essential among health care providers including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, nephrologists, and ophthalmologist to promote evidence-based practice.",

    "abstract": "To explore the DNA methylation sites correlated with blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure) in adult twin population.\nA total of 476 twins from the Chinese National Twin Registry were selected as the research population. Questionnaires were used to collect demographic characteristics, lifestyle, disease status and other information, and blood pressure, height, weight and other anthropometric indicators were measured. The genome-wide DNA methylation of whole blood samples was detected by using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. The DNA methylation sites correlated with blood pressure were analyzed by constructing mixed effect model with adjusting potential confounding factors, and the significant level was false discovery rate <0.05.\nAfter data quality control, 465 twins (122 pairs of monozygotic twins, 104 pairs of dizygotic twins, 13 individuals from 13 pairs of twins) aged (44.8\u00b113.2) years were finally enrolled. There were more males and more monozygotic twins, and the current smokers and current regular drinkers both accounted for more than 30%. No significant CpG site was found after multiple testing in the correlation study between genome-wide DNA methylation and blood pressure by using the collected twins. However, the cg07761116 located on chromosome 10 had low P value in the correlation analysis of 3 blood pressure indices (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure), suggesting that this site might be correlated with blood pressure. The other 7 sites had low P value in the correlation analysis of the two blood pressure indices, respectively, which pointed to genes involved in neurological development, protein homeostasis, inflammatory reaction and other pathways.\nThere is no sufficient evidence to support any DNA methylation site correlated with blood pressure, which may be caused by insufficient sample size and other reasons. This study could provide a reference for subsequent similar twin studies, and subsequent studies can focus on the cg07761116 located on chromosome 10 and other sites with low P values.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to estimate heritability of Hwabyung (HB) symptoms in adolescent and young adult twins in South Korea. The sample included 1,601 twins consisting of 143 pairs of monozygotic male (MZM), 67 pairs of dizygotic male (DZM), 295 pairs of monozygotic female (MZF), 114 pairs of dizygotic female (DZF), and 117 pairs of opposite-sex dizygotic (OSDZ) twins and 129 twins with non-participating co-twins (mean age = 19.1 \u00b1 3.1 years; range: 12-29 years). An HB symptom questionnaire was given to twins via a telephone interview. Consistent with the literature of HB, the mean level of HB was significantly higher in females than in males. Maximum likelihood twin correlations for HB were 0.31 (95% CI [0.16, 0.45]) for MZM, 0.19 (95% CI [-0.05, 0.41]) for DZM, 0.50 (95% CI [0.41, 0.58]) for MZF, 0.28 (95% CI [0.11, 0.44]) for DZF, and 0.23 (95% CI [0.05, 0.40]) for OSDZ twins. These patterns of twin correlations suggested the presence of additive genetic influences on HB. Model-fitting analysis showed that additive genetic and individual-specific environmental influences on HB were 44% (95% CI [37, 51]) and 56% (95% CI [49, 63]), respectively. Shared environmental influences were not significant. These parameter estimates were not significantly different between two sexes, and did not change significantly with age in the present sample, suggesting that genetic and environmental influences on HB in both sexes are stable across adolescence and young adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Growing use of in\u00a0vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in an elevated twin birth rate, and a burgeoning population of IVF twins who are now aging into adolescence and beyond. This study tests a model examining whether parental conformity expectations have differential effects on twins' versus singletons' parent-adolescent relationship satisfaction, and if this effect is indirectly associated with relative changes in twins' and singletons' internalizing and externalizing behavior from middle childhood to adolescence. Using a sample of 278 IVF twins and singletons, path models demonstrate that twin status and conformity expectations interact to influence parent-adolescent relationships. Although there was an association between twin status and mother-adolescent relationship satisfaction among parents with high conformity expectations (r\u00a0=\u00a0.25, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01), this relationship was nonsignificant among parents with low conformity expectations (r\u00a0=\u00a0.05, p\u00a0=\u00a0.85). The differential effect of conformity expectations on parent-adolescent relationship satisfaction for twins and singletons was indirectly associated with relative changes in twins' and singletons' externalizing behavior from middle childhood to adolescence. Results demonstrate that higher levels of parental conformity expectations may not have the same effect on adolescent twins and singletons.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether there was an association between the systematic promotion of twin vaginal delivery and an increase in the rates of twin vaginal birth.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study. We implemented a quality improvement initiative promoting twin vaginal delivery at an academic tertiary care center in 2013. The program included a needs assessment, simulation of vaginal twin delivery, online educational material, and the expansion of a dedicated twin clinic. We analyzed rates of twin vaginal birth in pregnancies at or beyond 24 weeks of gestation without a contraindication to labor, prior uterine surgery, or a demise or lethal anomaly of either twin. Using linear regression, we calculated annual adjusted rates of twin vaginal birth from 2010 to 2015 and in the 3 years before and after our intervention. We performed an interrupted time-series analysis estimating rates of change before and after the intervention to account for the influence of secular trend.\nOf 1,574 patients delivering twins, 897 (57%) were included, with 479 in the 3 years before and 418 in the 3 years after the intervention. Adjusted rates of vaginal delivery increased from 32.1% (n=153) to 44.2% (n=185) before and after the intervention (P<.01), with a decrease in elective cesarean delivery from 54.6% (n=479) to 44.3% (n=185) (P<.01). Rates of breech extraction increased after the intervention (5.7% vs 9.3%, P=.04). However, there was no difference in the rate of change in twin vaginal birth in the time period before (1.35% annual increase, P=.76) or after (5.8% annual increase, P=.40) the intervention.\nAlthough we observed an increased rate of twin vaginal birth in the time period after our intervention, because the rates of increase before and after the intervention were not statistically different, the increase is not attributable to our intervention and is more properly attributed to secular trend.",

Two-month-old twins were referred to the paediatric surgery centre with trocar needles lodged in different organs. A radiograph undertaken in one of them because of acute respiratory distress demonstrated needles in the heart and diaphragm which were removed surgically. The second twin, referred one week after his brother, had a needle deep in his liver and it was decided not to operate owing to the possibility of haemorrhage but, sadly, he died unexpectedly and the autopsy concluded that it was owing to sudden infant death syndrome. Because of a number of admissions to different units in the same hospital, there was a delay in the eventual diagnosis. Recurrent admissions to different hospital units should raise the suspicion of fabricated and/or induced illness.",

    "abstract": "Orofacial clefts (OFCs) are common and etiologically complex birth defects. This study explored potential genetic differences in a pair of Japanese monozygotic (MZ) twins with different forms of OFC using whole-genome sequencing.\nOne co-twin (MZ-1) presented with nonsyndromic bilateral cleft lip and palate; the other co-twin (MZ-2) had nonsyndromic bilateral cleft lip and unilateral left-sided cleft alveolus. Neither parent had an OFC. Craniofacial morphologic features and potential genetic differences were compared using standard cephalometry and whole-genome sequencing, respectively.\nMorphologically, MZ-1 had a smaller vertical mandibular height, compared to MZ-2. However, no discordant genetic differences were detected. Moreover, both twins and their parents harbored rare candidate gene variants (GRHL3; TPM1) considered to be associated with OFCs.\nThe observed differences between MZ-1 and MZ-2 in craniofacial morphology assessed by cephalograms might be directly attributable to the effects of the OFC on growth and/or differences in surgical history, given the lack of any differences in genetic background. However, comparisons of discordant MZ twins should continue to identify novel candidates that might control OFC or that might partly explain the missing heritability for this common birth defect, in addition to understanding craniofacial growth and development.",

    "abstract": "Calling variants from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data or discovering discordant sequences between two NGS data sets is challenging. We developed a computer algorithm, ADIScan1, to call variants by comparing the fractions of allelic reads in a tester to the universal reference genome. We then created ADIScan2 by modifying the algorithm to directly compare two sets of NGS data and predict discordant sequences between two testers. ADIScan1 detected >99.7% of variants called by GATK with an additional 724 393 SNVs. ADIScan2 identified \u223c500 candidates of discordant sequences in each of two pairs of the monozygotic twins. About 200 of these candidates were included in the \u223c2800 predicted by VarScan2. We verified 66 true discordant sequences among the candidates that ADIScan2 and VarScan2 exclusively predicted. ADIScan2 detected many discordant sequences overlooked by VarScan2 and Mutect, which specialize in detecting low frequency mutations in genetically heterogeneous cancerous tissues. Numbers of verified sequences alone were >5 times more than expected based on recently estimated mutation rates from whole genome sequences. Estimated post-zygotic mutation rates were 1.68 \u00d7 10-7 in this study. ADIScan1 and 2 would complement existing tools in screening causative mutations of diverse genetic diseases and comparing two sets of genome sequences, respectively.",

    "abstract": "There is a complex interaction between female and male sex hormones and the risk of epilepsy. Whether prenatal exposure to higher levels of sex hormones affects the development of epilepsy in childhood or later in life is not well known. The sex hormone environment of fetuses may be affected by the sex of the co-twin. We estimated the risk of epilepsy for twins with an opposite-sex (OS) co-twin compared with twins with a same-sex (SS) co-twin.\nFrom the Danish Twin Registry, we identified OS female twins (n\u2009=\u200911,078), SS female twins (n\u2009=\u200919,186), OS male twins (n\u2009=\u200911,080), and SS male twins (n\u2009=\u200920,207) born between 1977 and 2009. The SS twins include monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, and twins with unknown zygosity. These children were followed up from day 29 after birth until diagnosis of epilepsy, death, emigration, or end of follow-up (31 December 2011) whichever came first. Information on diagnosis of epilepsy was obtained from the Danish National Patient Registry. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for epilepsy in the OS twins using a Cox proportional hazards regression model compared with the SS twins. To account for the correlation of twins from the same mother when estimating standard errors, we used the cluster option in Stata.\nWe identified 152 OS female twins, 282 SS female twins, 162 OS male twins, and 335 SS male twins diagnosed with epilepsy corresponding to an incidence rate of 9.9 and 9.7 per 10,000 person years for the OS and SS female twins, and 10.6 and 10.9 per 10,000 person years for the OS and SS male twins, respectively. We found a similar risk of epilepsy among the OS and SS female twins [HR\u2009=\u20091.01; 95% CI 0.83-1.24] as well as among the OS and SS male twins [HR\u2009=\u20090.94; 95% CI 0.78-1.14] CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study of Danish twins, we did not find difference in the risk of epilepsy between twins with an OS co-twin and twins with a SS co-twin. This applied to both female and male twins. The study therefore does not support the hypothesis that subtle hormone difference in fetal life due to co-twin may play a role in the development of epilepsy later in life.",

    "results": "We identified 152 OS female twins, 282 SS female twins, 162 OS male twins, and 335 SS male twins diagnosed with epilepsy corresponding to an incidence rate of 9.9 and 9.7 per 10,000 person years for the OS and SS female twins, and 10.6 and 10.9 per 10,000 person years for the OS and SS male twins, respectively. We found a similar risk of epilepsy among the OS and SS female twins [HR\u2009=\u20091.01; 95% CI 0.83-1.24] as well as among the OS and SS male twins [HR\u2009=\u20090.94; 95% CI 0.78-1.14] CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study of Danish twins, we did not find difference in the risk of epilepsy between twins with an OS co-twin and twins with a SS co-twin. This applied to both female and male twins. The study therefore does not support the hypothesis that subtle hormone difference in fetal life due to co-twin may play a role in the development of epilepsy later in life.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading non-infectious cause of death in infants. Monozygotic (MZ) twins share nearly all of their genetic variants before and after birth. Nevertheless, MZ twins are sometimes discordant for common complex diseases. The goal of this study is to identify genomic and epigenomic differences between a pair of twins discordant for a form of congenital heart disease, double outlet right ventricle (DORV).\nA monoamniotic monozygotic (MZ) twin pair discordant for DORV were subjected to genome-wide sequencing and methylation analysis. We identified few genomic differences but 1566 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the MZ twins. Twenty percent (312/1566) of the DMRs are located within 2\u00a0kb upstream of transcription start sites (TSS), containing 121 binding sites of transcription factors. Particularly, ZIC3 and NR2F2 are found to have hypermethylated promoters in both the diseased twin and additional patients suffering from DORV.\nThe results showed a high correlation between hypermethylated promoters at ZIC3 and NR2F2 and down-regulated gene expression levels of these two genes in patients with DORV compared to normal controls, providing new insight into the potential mechanism of this rare form of CHD.",

    "abstract": "Depressive symptoms are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic dysregulation, but the direction of the association remains unclear.\nTo investigate the temporal association between depression and HRV.\nA longitudinal, cross-lagged twin difference study, with baseline assessments from March 2002 to March 2006 (visit 1) and a 7-year follow-up (visit 2) at an academic research center with participants recruited from a national twin registry. Twins (n\u2009=\u2009166) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, who served in the US military during the Vietnam War, and were discordant for depression at baseline were recruited.\nAt both visits, depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and HRV was measured through 24-hour electrocardiogram monitoring. To assess the direction of the association, within-pair differences in multivariable mixed-effects regression models were examined, and standardized \u03b2 coefficients for both pathways were calculated. The associations were evaluated separately in monozygotic and dizygotic twins.\nIn the final analytic sample (N\u2009=\u2009146), all participants were men, 138 (95%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 54 (3) years at baseline. Results showed consistent associations between visit 1 HRV and visit 2 BDI score across all HRV domains and models (\u03b2 coefficients ranging from -0.14 to -0.29), which were not explained by antidepressants or other participant characteristics. The magnitude of the association was similar in the opposite pathway linking visit 1 BDI score to visit 2 HRV, with \u03b2 coefficients ranging from 0.05 to -0.30, but it was largely explained by antidepressant use. In stratified analysis by zygosity, significant associations were observed in monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the path linking visit 1 HRV to visit 2 BDI score, although the associations were slightly stronger in dizygotic twins.\nThe association between depression and autonomic dysregulation, indexed by HRV, is bidirectional, with stronger evidence suggesting that autonomic function affects depression risk rather than vice versa. The opposite causal pathway from depression to lower HRV is mostly driven by antidepressant use. These findings highlight an important role of autonomic nervous system in the risk of depression and contribute new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease.",

Results showed consistent associations between visit 1 HRV and visit 2 BDI score across all HRV domains and models (\u03b2 coefficients ranging from -0.14 to -0.29), which were not explained by antidepressants or other participant characteristics. The magnitude of the association was similar in the opposite pathway linking visit 1 BDI score to visit 2 HRV, with \u03b2 coefficients ranging from 0.05 to -0.30, but it was largely explained by antidepressant use. In stratified analysis by zygosity, significant associations were observed in monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the path linking visit 1 HRV to visit 2 BDI score, although the associations were slightly stronger in dizygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Dizygotic twins share the same type of genetic relationship as non-twin siblings. Whereas monozygotic (MZ) twins are considered to have identical genetic material, they still differ. There is a number of reasons for early MZ twin discordance, including differences in the in utero environment, stochasticity, genetic mosaicism, and epigenetic factors. During gestation, the efficient innate immune system is of utmost importance. Our study was based on immunohistochemical evaluation of the differences in innate immune protein expression (TLR-2, NOD2, and NF-\u03baB) in the 95 placentas between twins. Our study revealed statistical significant differences between diamniotic-dichorionic and monoamniotic-dichorionic twins. Monoamniotic-monochorionic twins exhibited no significant differences in protein expressions. To identify epigenetic factors causing the differences between twins, we made a series of comparisons with clinical data. The study revealed more cases with infections, miscarriages, in vitro fertilization, and premature rupture of membranes within the group with higher differences level of NF-\u03baB, NOD2 and TLR-2 between twins. In case of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, there were no significant differences in innate immune protein expressions between twins. These results show that dissimilar genetic material and separate in utero environment promote discordance in innate immune protein expressions between twins. Moreover, additional blood flow between twins may be favorable in life-threatening conditions ensuring similar microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "We quantitatively assessed placental perfusion using three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler ultrasound for twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) in one twin.\nA prospective cross-sectional study was performed for 104 normal monochorionic diamniotic twins and 30 twins with sIUGR. Twins with sIUGR were divided into two groups: in group I (19 twins), both fetuses had continuous forward end-diastolic blood flow in the umbilical artery; in group II (11 twins), the smaller fetus had a loss or a reverse end-diastolic blood flow in the umbilical artery, but the larger fetus had continuous forward end-diastolic blood flow. Volume data of the placenta was acquired in each twin at the plane where the umbilical cord entered the placenta by 3D power Doppler ultrasound, and imaging software was used to calculate the placental vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization flow index (VFI).\nAmong smaller fetuses, the sIUGR and control groups showed significant differences in VI and VFI, as well as significant differences between sIUGR group II and control group in FI. No such differences in placental perfusion were found among larger fetuses.\n3D power Doppler ultrasound could sensitively display the varying degrees of changes in placental perfusion, which could be used for clinical monitoring of placental perfusion in sIUGR twins.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiota has been demonstrated to be associated with a number of host phenotypes, including obesity and a number of obesity-associated phenotypes. This study is aimed at further understanding and describing the relationship between the gut microbiota and obesity-associated measurements obtained from human participants.\nHere, we utilize genetically informative study designs, including a four-corners design (extremes of genetic risk for BMI and of observed BMI; N = 50) and the BMI monozygotic (MZ) discordant twin pair design (N = 30), in order to help delineate the role of host genetics and the gut microbiota in the development of obesity.\nOur results highlight a negative association between BMI and alpha diversity of the gut microbiota. The low genetic risk/high BMI group of individuals had a lower gut microbiota alpha diversity when compared to the other three groups. Although the difference in alpha diversity between the lean and heavy groups of the BMI-discordant MZ twin design did not achieve significance, this difference was observed to be in the expected direction, with the heavier participants having a lower average alpha diversity. We have also identified nine OTUs observed to be associated with either a leaner or heavier phenotype, with enrichment for OTUs classified to the Ruminococcaceae and Oxalobacteraceae taxonomic families.\nOur study presents evidence of a relationship between BMI and alpha diversity of the gut microbiota. In addition to these findings, a number of OTUs were found to be significantly associated with host BMI. These findings may highlight separate subtypes of obesity, one driven by genetic factors, the other more heavily influenced by environmental factors.",

For individual neonatal outcomes, median ICCs across trials ranged from 0.13 to 0.79 depending on the outcome. An example illustrates how ICCs can be used in sample size calculations for RCTs in women with twin pregnancies.\nThe correlation between neonatal outcomes of twins varies considerably between outcomes and may be lower than expected. Our ICC estimates can be used for designing and analysing RCTs that recruit women with twin pregnancies and for performing meta-analyses that include such RCTs. Researchers are encouraged to report ICCs for neonatal outcomes in twins in their own RCTs.\nCorrelation between neonatal outcomes of twins depends on the outcome and may be lower than expected.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal cardiogenic shock most commonly occurs due to critical congenital heart disease, sepsis, metabolic disorder or arrhythmias. In particular, enterovirus infections are common in the neonatal period, and patients can present with fulminant myocarditis. Early recognition is imperative due to its high morbidity and mortality without prompt and aggressive treatment. We present the successful treatment of fulminant neonatal enteroviral myocarditis in a pair of monochorionic diamniotic twins with cardiopulmonary support, intravenous immunoglobulin and pocapavir, an enteroviral capsid inhibitor. The twins took an almost exact parallel hospital course, including day of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation, day of ECMO decannulation, improvement of cardiac function, discharge and status at follow-up. While it was difficult to assess the relative contribution of each intervention, our case shows promise in the use of pocapavir for treatment of severe enteroviral infections. Remarkably, both twins demonstrated remarkable recovery within 2\u2009weeks, underscoring that early aggressive cardiopulmonary support, and potentially pocapavir, contributed to their recovery.",

In severe cases, maintaining adequate gas exchange aiming to avoid further lung damage and other neonatal morbidities associated with systemic/pulmonary hypoperfusion, prolonged hypoxia, and respiratory acidosis can be challenging and requires in-depth knowledge into the pathophysiology of the disease. Herein, we report on very low birth weight twins who developed early pulmonary interstitial emphysema during noninvasive respiratory support.

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins are typically indistinguishable via forensic DNA profiling. Recently, we demonstrated that epigenetic differentiation of MZ twins is feasible; however, proportions of twin differentially methylated CpG sites (tDMSs) identified in reference-type blood DNA were not replicated in trace-type blood DNA. Here we investigated buccal swabs as typical forensic reference material, and saliva and cigarette butts as commonly encountered forensic trace materials. As an analog to a forensic case, we analyzed one MZ twin pair. Epigenome-wide microarray analysis in reference-type buccal DNA revealed 25 candidate tDMSs with >0.5 twin-to-twin differences. MethyLight quantitative PCR (qPCR) of 22 selected tDMSs in trace-type DNA revealed in saliva DNA that six tDMSs (27.3%) had >0.1 twin-to-twin differences, seven (31.8%) had smaller (<0.1) but robustly detected differences, whereas for nine (40.9%) the differences were in the opposite direction relative to the microarray data; for cigarette butt DNA, results were 50%, 22.7%, and 27.3%, respectively. The discrepancies between reference-type and trace-type DNA outcomes can be explained by cell composition differences, method-to-method variation, and other technical reasons including bisulfite conversion inefficiency. Our study highlights the importance of the DNA source and that careful characterization of biological and technical effects is needed before epigenetic MZ twin differentiation is applicable in forensic casework.",

    "abstract": "Body-stalk anomaly is a sporadic and rare maldevelopment disorder characterised by large abdominal wall defect, spinal deformity and rudimentary umbilical cord. It is considered a lethal condition as there are only few reports of survival but there was at least one case of long-term survival after neonatal surgery.Differential diagnosis includes isolated omphalocele or gastroschisis, short umbilical cord, amniotic band, limb body-wall complex and other polymalformative syndromes.There are few reports about the expectant prenatal management of the body stalk anomaly as the majority of prenatal diagnosed cases undergo early elective termination. Twin pregnancies discordant for the anomaly represent a challenge to prenatal management as a healthy fetus should also be considered.We describe a case of dichorionic-diamniotic twins discordant for body stalk anomaly which underwent selective feticide of the affected fetus late in pregnancy, in accordance with parents' decision focused on the neonatal well-being of the unaffected twin.",

    "abstract": "To compare perinatal outcomes between acute single fetal demise following fetoscopic laser photocoagulation to planned selective reduction (SR) in complicated monochorionic twin pregnancies.\nThis was a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data in complicated monochorionic twin pregnancies from 2 fetal centers from 2011 to 2016. Group 1 included women undergoing fetoscopic laser photocoagulation for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) who experienced a single fetal demise within 24\u00a0hours of the procedure. Group 2 consisted of women undergoing planned selective reduction (SR) with TTTS, and Group 3 SR for indications other than TTTS.\nSurvival of the remaining co-twin at birth was highest in Group 1 (n\u00a0=\u00a077 patients; 95%) compared with that in Group 2 (n\u00a0=\u00a015; 80%) and Group 3 (n\u00a0=\u00a032; 78%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.047). The preterm premature rupture of membrane rate was higher in Group 1 (47%) compared with that in Group 2 (33%) and Group 3 (7%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Group 1 had a lower gestational age at delivery and shorter procedure-to-delivery interval compared with the other 2 groups (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01).\nWhen single fetal demise occurs following fetoscopic laser photocoagulation, the surviving co-twin is more likely to survive to delivery but has higher PPROM rates and a shorter latency period compared with planned selective reduction for TTTS or other indications.",

    "abstract": "Oral microbiome is potentially correlated with many diseases, such as dental caries, periodontitis, oral cancer and some systemic diseases. Twin model, as an effective method for studying human microbiota, is widely used in research of relationship between oral microbiota and dental caries. However, there were few researches focusing on caries discordant twins. In this study, in vitro assays were conducted combined with 16S rRNA sequencing analysis on oral microbiota sampled from twins who presented discordant caries experience and mice model was developed as well. Results showed that oral microbiota from caries-active twin possessed higher metabolic activity and produced more lactic production. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed that more than 80% of family taxa could be transferred into gnotobiotic-mice. Key caries-associated genera were significantly different between twins and the same difference in genus level could be found in mice as well (p\u2009<\u20090.05). This study suggested that oral microbiota of twins could be distinguished from each other despite the similarities in genetic make-up, living environment, and lifestyle. The difference in microbiota was applied to develop a mice model which may facilitate the investigation of core microbiota of dental caries.",

Genetic differences have been proposed to play a role in the development of MPNs. Monozygotic twin pairs with MPNs have been reported in a few case reports, but the MPN concordance pattern in twins remains unknown.\nAll twin pairs born in the period 1900-2010 were identified in the nationwide Danish Twin Registry. Only pairs with both twins alive on January 1, 1977, and those born thereafter were included to allow identification in the Danish National Patient Registry.\nA total of 158 twin pairs were registered with an MPN diagnosis: 36 monozygotic, 104 dizygotic, and 18 pairs with unknown zygosity. MPNs were diagnosed in both twins in 4 pairs. The probandwise concordance rates for monozygotic twin pairs were higher than for dizygotic twin pairs (15 vs. 0%; p = 0.016).\nAn estimated concordance rate of 15% (95% CI 0.059-0.31) is modest, but given the rarity of MPNs this finding is clinically relevant and provides further support for the role of genetic predisposition in the development of MPNs.",

    "abstract": "Twin boundaries (TBs) play an essential role in enhancing the mechanical, electronic and transport properties of polycrystalline materials. However, the mechanisms are not well understood. In particular, we considered that they may play an important role in boron rich boron carbide (BvrBC), which exhibits promising properties such as low density, super hardness, high abrasion resistance, and excellent neutron absorption. Here, we apply first-principles-based simulations to identify the atomic structures of TBs in BvrBC and their roles for the inelastic response to applied stresses. In addition to symmetric TBs in BvrBC, we identified a new type of asymmetric twin that constitutes the phase boundaries between boron rich boron carbide (B13C2) and BvrBC (B14C). The predicted mechanical response of these asymmetric twins indicates a significant reduction of the ideal shear strength compared to single crystals B13C2 and B14C, suggesting that the asymmetric twins facilitate the disintegration of icosahedral clusters under applied stress, which in turn leads to amorphous band formation and brittle failure. These results provide a mechanistic basis towards understating the roles of TBs in BvrBC and related superhard ceramics.",

    "abstract": "The quality of general movements (GMs) has proven to have predictive value for the developmental outcome, but this has not yet been studied in twins.\nOur aim was to analyse the quality of GMs and neurological and developmental outcome in relation to the gestational age (GA), mode of conception and other perinatal risk factors in a group of twins.\nThe documentation of twins referred for follow-up in the period from 1998 to 2016 was studied retrospectively. Data concerning the quality of GMs, perinatal risk factors and developmental outcome were analysed.\nEighty-nine twin pairs, GA from 24 to 38 weeks (median 35.0; IQR 3), birth weight 670\u00a0g-3820\u00a0g (median 2323; IQR 645) were included.\nResults of neurological, psychological and speech/language development and school outcome were analysed.\nGMs at term age and at three to four months postterm age did not differ with regard to the mode of conception. Preterm birth was significantly related to GMs at three to four months postterm age. At term age, GMs were significantly related to neurological outcome, while at three to four months postterm age, GMs were related to both the neurological and psychological outcome. Difficulties in speech/language development were diagnosed in almost half of the children, more frequently in boys and children with lower Apgar scores.\nThe study highlights the value of GMs for predicting the developmental outcome in twins and indicates the importance of developmental, especially speech/language, follow-up in twins.",

    "abstract": "Leukemia is different from solid tumor by harboring genetic rearrangements that predict prognosis and guide treatment strategy. PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and KMT2A-rearrangement are common genetic rearrangements that drive the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). By contrast, rare genetic rearrangements may also contribute to leukemogenesis but are less summarized.\nHere we reported rare fusion genes ZNF717-ZNF37A, ZNF273-DGKA, and ZDHHC2-TTTY15 in a 47-year-old AML-M4 patient with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) discovered by whole genome sequencing (WGS) using the patient's healthy sibling as a sequencing control.\nThis is, to our knowledge, the first case of AML with fusion gene ZNF717-ZNF37A, ZNF273-DGKA, and ZDHHC2-TTTY15.",

    "abstract": "Currently there is a very limited understanding of how mental wellbeing versus anxiety and depression symptoms are associated with emotion processing behaviour. For the first time, we examined these associations using a behavioural emotion task of positive and negative facial expressions in 1668 healthy adult twins. Linear mixed model results suggested faster reaction times to happy facial expressions was associated with higher wellbeing scores, and slower reaction times with higher depression and anxiety scores. Multivariate twin modelling identified a significant genetic correlation between depression and anxiety symptoms and reaction time to happy facial expressions, in the absence of any significant correlations with wellbeing. We also found a significant negative phenotypic relationship between depression and anxiety symptoms and accuracy for identifying neutral emotions, although the genetic or environment correlations were not significant in the multivariate model. Overall, the phenotypic relationships between speed of identifying happy facial expressions and wellbeing on the one hand, versus depression and anxiety symptoms on the other, were in opposing directions. Twin modelling revealed a small common genetic correlation between response to happy faces and depression and anxiety symptoms alone, suggesting that wellbeing and depression and anxiety symptoms show largely independent relationships with emotion processing at the behavioral level.",

    "abstract": "While genetic influences on chronic pain have been repeatedly demonstrated, we do not know whether these effects are stable or dynamic over time.\nTo determine the temporal pattern of genetic and environmental effects to individual differences in chronic pain over 12\u00a0years, we use a sample of n\u00a0=\u00a0961 female twins.\nData on chronic pain were collected in 2004 (T1) and 2016 (T2) using the same comprehensive body map which divides the body into 31 distinct anatomical areas. Multivariate twin analyses for repeated measures were conducted to track changes in genetic and environmental influences.\nHeritability for chronic pain was 63% at baseline and 55% at follow-up. The best-fitting AE Cholesky model revealed one genetic factor explaining 62% of variance in chronic pain at T1 and 11% at T2. No additional genetic factors explaining the variance in chronic pain at T2 could be detected. Furthermore, a unique environmental factor (E1) explaining 37% of the variance in chronic pain at T1 and 12% at T2 and an additional environmental factor (E2) explaining 77% of the variance at T2 were found.\nWe demonstrate for the first time that the same genetic influences are operative over time and that novel environmental factors are important in pain maintenance. The findings highlight the value of more in depth exploration of these non-shared environmental influences that could provide clues to the mechanisms behind remittance and/or maintenance of chronic pain. The identification of important environmental influences could point to novel therapeutic interventions in future.\nThe variability in chronic pain is mainly explained by new environmental factors influencing incidence, aggravation and/or chronic pain remission. Integration of these findings may provide a useful conceptual framework for the treatment and prevention of pain and pain chronification.",

    "abstract": "Morphological and hemodynamic variations of the circle of Willis (CW) may have an important impact on cerebrovascular events. However, the environmental and genetic influence remains unclear. For this reason we studied the variations and hemodynamic parameters of the CW in twins using transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS). Sixty-four twins, 19 monozygotic (MZ) and 13 dizygotic (DZ) pairs from the Italian Twin Registry (average age 45.0\u2009\u00b1\u200913.7\u00a0years) underwent TCCS and risk factor assessment. We examined CW morphology and recorded peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV) and pulsatility index (PI). Raw heritability was determined for hemodynamic parameters, whereas concordance and discordance rates were calculated for CW morphological variants. A normal CW anatomy was observed in the majority of MZ and DZ twins (76.5% and 92.3%, respectively). The most frequent variant was a missing anterior cerebral artery (ACA). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of most CW variants depending on the zigosity. Concordance rates were low regarding the presence of variant CW anatomy both in MZ and DZ groups (0.14 and 0.00, respectively). Women had a significantly higher PI in vertebral arteries (VA) and in the right ACA (p\u2009=\u20090.01, p\u2009=\u20090.02 and p\u2009<\u20090.01, respectively). An inverse correlation was observed between hemodynamic parameters and age. Morphological variants of the CW do not seem to be heritable; they are most likely determined by environmental factors. In contrast, hemodynamic parameters of the CW are moderately heritable and this might have implications in the management and prevention of cerebrovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that boys are born heavier and longer than girls, but it remains unclear whether birth size in twins is affected by the sex of their co-twin. We conducted an individual-based pooled analysis of 21 twin cohorts in 15 countries derived from the COllaborative project of Development of Anthropometrical measures in Twins (CODATwins), including 67,850 dizygotic twin individuals. Linear regression analyses showed that boys having a co-twin sister were, on average, 31\u2009g (95% CI 18 to 45) heavier and 0.16\u2009cm (95% CI 0.045 to 0.274) longer than those with a co-twin brother. In girls, birth size was not associated (5\u2009g birth weight; 95% CI -8 to -18 and -0.089\u2009cm birth length; 95% CI -0.202 to 0.025) with the sex of the co-twin. Gestational age was slightly shorter in boy-boy pairs than in boy-girl and girl-girl pairs. When birth size was standardized by gestational age, the magnitude of the associations was attenuated in boys, particularly for birth weight. In conclusion, boys with a co-twin sister are heavier and longer at birth than those with a co-twin brother. However, these differences are modest and partly explained by a longer gestation in the presence of a co-twin sister.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are more likely to be affected by fetal growth restriction (FGR), preterm birth and perinatal loss. The management of fetal growth restriction in multiple pregnancy, particularly where only one fetus is affected is complicated by the need to consider the interests of both twins. Selective growth restriction in monochorionic (MC) twins is a pathophysiological process distinct from FGR in dichorionic (DC) pregnancies and management demands an understanding of the monochorionic placental structure and interdependent fetal circulations. The introduction of fetal therapy has introduced a range of potential interventions for the antenatal management of sFGR including selective fetal reduction and laser photocoagulation of the placental communicating vessels. This review summarizes up to date evidence on diagnosis, classification and management of sFGR and considers research directions likely to be of benefit in the future.",

    "abstract": "We aim to examine if circulating micro-RNA and cytokine levels associate with dementia diagnosis and cognitive scores. To test our hypothesis, we use plasma donated from 48 monozygotic twin pairs in 1997 and 46 micro-RNAs and 10 cytokines were quantified using microfluidic RT-qPCR and multiplex solid-phase immunoassays, respectively. Micro-RNA and cytokine profiling were examined for associations with dementia diagnoses in a longitudinal registry study or with cognitive scores at baseline. Thirty-six micro-RNAs and all cytokines were detected consistently. Micro-RNA profiles associate with diagnoses and cognitive scores at statistically significant levels while cytokine only showed trends pointing at chronic inflammation in twins having or developing dementia. The most notable findings were decreased miR-106a and miR-210, and increased miR-106b expression in twins with a dementia diagnosis. This pioneering evaluation of micro-RNA and cytokine and dementia diagnosis suggests micro-RNA targets in vasculogenesis, lipoprotein transport, and amyloid precursor protein genes.",

    "abstract": "Many factors may influence a woman's decision to start and maintain breastfeeding. Research aim: This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with breastfeeding cessation in twin infants during the first 6 months after birth and to describe the main reasons for weaning cited by mothers of twins.\nThis is a secondary data analysis of a prospective randomized trial conducted in Brazil. Data were obtained through longitudinal quantitative and qualitative self-reported interviews. One hundred twenty-eight women pregnant with twins and their 256 infants were followed for up to approximately 6 months, during which time breastfeeding data were obtained through face-to-face interviews at three different points after birth: 30 to 40 days (Time 1), 90 days (Time 2), and 180 days (Time 3). The association between weaning and the investigated factors was examined using survival analysis methodologies.\nNonexclusive breastfeeding ( p = .004, Cox proportional hazards regression model), a lack of support during the lactation period ( p = .001), difficulty breastfeeding ( p = .003), a breastfeeding duration shorter than 12 months in a previous pregnancy ( p = .001), and infants' birth weight less than 2,300 g ( p < .001) were the factors associated with breastfeeding cessation. The main reasons for weaning cited by mothers of twins were insufficient human milk supply, infants' behavior, and returning to work.\nWe have identified the factors associated with weaning in twin infants during the first 180 days of life. This knowledge can help improve strategies to increase breastfeeding rates in twins.",

    "abstract": "The aetiology of Crohn's disease is poorly understood. By investigating twin pairs discordant for Crohn's disease, we aimed to assess whether the dysregulated barrier represents a cause or a consequence of inflammation and to evaluate the impact of genetic predisposition on barrier function.\nIleal biopsies from 15 twin pairs discordant for Crohn's disease [monozygotic n = 9, dizygotic n = 6] and 10 external controls were mounted in Ussing chambers to assess paracellular permeability to 51Chromium [Cr]-EDTA and trancellular passage to non-pathogenic E. coli K-12. Experiments were performed with and without provocation with acetylsalicylic acid. Immunofluorescence and ELISA were used to quantify the expression level of tight junction proteins.\nHealthy co-twins and affected twins displayed increased 51Cr-EDTA permeability at 120 min, both with acetylsalicylic acid [p < 0.001] and without [p < 0.001] when compared with controls. A significant increase in 51Cr-EDTA flux was already seen at 20 min in healthy monozygotic co-twins compared with controls [p\u22640.05] when stratified by zygosity, but not in healthy dizygotic co-twins. No difference in E. coli passage was observed between groups. Immunofluorescence of the tight junction proteins claudin-5 and tricellulin showed lower levels in healthy co-twins [p < 0.05] and affected twins [p < 0.05] compared with external controls, while ELISA only showed lower tricellulin in Crohn's disease twins [p < 0.05].\nOur results suggest that barrier dysfunction is a primary defect in Crohn's disease, since changes were predominantly seen in healthy monozygotic co-twins. Passage of E. coli seems to be a consequence of inflammation, rather than representing a primary defect.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twinning occurs in 1/100 of monozygotic twins, 1/50,000 gestations and 1/250,000 live births. It is the consequence of a division event at the primitive streak stage of the human embryonic development, about 13-14 days after fertilisation, in monochorionic monoamniotic gestations. A healthy pregnant woman, Gravida 2 Para 1, was admitted into our Fetal Medicine Unit to perform the first trimester ultrasound. A diagnosis of conjoined parapagus twinning based on ultrasound features was made at 11 weeks of gestation, and the couple decided to terminate the pregnancy. The ultrasound showed two independent skulls and hearts, a shared spine below the thoracic level, and a shared stomach. The pathological findings were slightly different, showing two independent stomachs draining into a common duodenum. The karyotype was 46 XY. Early prenatal ultrasound may provide a window to counsel the family and to offer an early termination of pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins are assumed to have identical genomes. Based on this assumption, phenotypic discordance in monozygotic twins has been previously attributed to environmental factors. However, recent genomic studies have identified characteristic somatic mutations in monozygotic twins discordant for Darier disease, Van der Woude syndrome, and Dravet syndrome. Here, we explored somatic mutations in four pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia or delusional disorder. We analyzed whole exome sequence data obtained from blood samples and identified seven somatic mutations in one twin pair discordant for delusional disorder. All seven of these mutations were validated by independent amplicon sequencing, and five of them were further validated by pyrosequencing. One somatic mutation in the patient with delusional disorder showed a missense variant in ABCC9 with an allele fraction of 7.32%. Although an association between the somatic mutations and phenotypic discordance could not be established conclusively in this study, our results suggest that somatic mutations in monozygotic twins may contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders, and can serve as high-priority candidates for genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we examined early growth characteristics among small-for-gestational-age (SGA) preterm twins compared to their appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) counterparts. A retrospective study evaluated all consecutive twins born between 2008 and 2015 at a tertiary referral center whose gestational age ranged from 30.0 to 34.86 weeks. Included were twins in which one twin was AGA and the other SGA at birth. Changes of \u22652, 1-1.99, and 0-0.99 in z-score between births and 36 weeks post menstrual age (PMA) were respectively defined as severe, moderate, and mild postnatal growth failure (PNGF) in weight or head circumference (HC). Early neonatal morbidities were documented. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to determine conditions associated with PNGF and its severity. Out of 666 sets of twins, 83 met the inclusion criteria. Weight PNGF was similar and mild among the SGA and the AGA groups (0.9 \u00b1 0.46 vs. 0.96 \u00b1 0.44 z-score, respectively, ",

Laparoscopy was implemented in 1 twin at a time, then in both twins simultaneously. Despite insufflation of a single-twin's abdomen, both twins demonstrated hypercapnia and signs of a concomitant respiratory acidosis because of carbon dioxide diffusion through a shared peritoneal membrane. This is the first documented case of simultaneous laparoscopy-induced pneumoperitoneum in pygopagus conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "We present a 31-year-old primigravida with uncorrected pentalogy of Fallot, pregnant with monochorionic-diamniotic twins, undergoing elective lower segment cesarean section at 36 weeks gestation. Preoperative workup included a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a large ventricular septal defect of 1.8 cm with bidirectional shunting, a moderate size atrial septal defect of 1.8 cm with predominant left-to-right shunting, an overriding aorta, moderate right ventricular hypertrophy, and severe pulmonary valve stenosis. Notably, the patient was acyanotic with normal effort tolerance. Preoperative preparation involved the input of cardiologists and obstetric and cardiothoracic anesthetists. Issues such as the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and cardiopulmonary support in the event of cardiac failure were discussed. Autotransfusion postdelivery was also addressed, and plans made for therapeutic venesection should need to arise. Intraoperatively, the planned anesthetic technique was slow and titrated combined spinal-epidural. However, a general anesthetic technique with rapid sequence induction was used in view of extreme patient anxiety. Intravenous induction was performed with ketamine and etomidate, followed by paralysis with succinylcholine. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane on a mixture of air and oxygen. Phenylephrine infusion was titrated according to the patient's blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance. The uterotonic of choice was duratocin given as a slow bolus, followed by a 4-h infusion of oxytocin. The patient was put in a head-up position to prevent venous air embolism and to decrease autotransfusion to central circulation. Postoperatively, she was extubated and sent to the Intensive Care Unit for continuous monitoring with FloTrac",

    "abstract": "Several related and complementary theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain the existence of prosocial behavior, despite its potential fitness cost to the individual. These include kin selection theory, proposing that organisms have a propensity to help those to whom they are genetically related, and reciprocity, referring to the benefit of being prosocial, depending on past and future mutual interactions. A useful paradigm to examine prosociality is to compare mean levels of this behavior between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. Here, we examined the performance of 883 6.5-year-old twins (139 MZ and 302 DZ same-sex 6.5-year-old full twin pairs) in the Differential Productivity Task. In this task, the twins' behaviors were observed under two conditions: working for themselves vs. working for their co-twin. There were no significant differences between the performances of MZ and DZ twins in the prosocial condition of the task. Correlations within the twin dyads were significantly higher in MZ than DZ twins in the self-interested condition. However, similar MZ and DZ correlations were found in the prosocial condition, supporting the role of reciprocity in twins' prosociality towards each other.",

    "abstract": "We used a sub-sample from the Older Australian Twins Study to estimate the heritability of performance on three tests of language ability: Boston Naming Test (BNT), Letter/Phonemic Fluency (FAS) and Category/Semantic Fluency (CFT) Tests. After adjusting for age, sex, education, mood, and global cognition (GC), heritability estimates obtained for the three tests were 0.35, 0.59, and 0.20, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that the genetic correlation were high for BNT and CFT (0.61), but low for BNT and FAS (0.17), and for FAS and CFT (0.28). Genetic modelling with Cholesky decomposition indicated that the covariation between the three measures could be explained by a common genetic factor. Environmental correlations between the language ability measures were low, and there were considerable specific environmental influences for each measure. Future longitudinal studies with language performance and neuroimaging data can further our understanding of genetic and environmental factors involved in the process of cognitive aging.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers of biological aging - DNA methylation age (DNAm age) and leukocyte telomere length (LTL)- correlate strongly with chronological age across the life course. It is, however, unclear how these measures of cellular wear and tear are associated with muscle strength and functional capacity, which are known to decline with older age and are associated with mortality. We investigated if DNAm age and LTL were associated with body composition and physical functioning by examining 48 monozygotic twin sisters.\nWhite blood cell DNAm age (predicted years) was calculated from Illumina 450\u00a0k BeadChip methylation data using an online calculator. DNAm age acceleration was defined from the residuals derived from a linear regression model of DNAm age on chronological age. LTL was measured by qPCR. Total body percentage of fat and lean mass were estimated using bioimpedance. Physical functioning was measured by grip strength, knee extension strength and by 10\u00a0m maximal walking speed test.\nIn all participants, DNAm age (58.4\u2009\u00b1\u20096.6) was lower than chronological age (61.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9\u00a0years). Pairwise correlations of monozygotic co-twins were high for DNAm age (0.88, 95% CI 0.79, 0.97), age acceleration (0.68, 95% CI 0.30, 0.85) and LTL (0.77, 95% CI 0.60, 0.94). Increased age acceleration i.e. faster epigenetic aging compared to chronological age was associated with lower grip strength (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20095.3 SE 1.9 p\u2009=\u20090.011), but not with other measures of physical functioning or body composition. LTL was not associated with body composition or physical functioning.\nTo conclude, accelerated DNAm age is associated with lower grip strength, a biomarker known to be associated with physiological aging, and which predicts decline in physical functioning and mortality. Further studies may clarify whether epigenetic aging explains the decline in muscle strength with aging or whether DNAm age just illustrates the progress of aging.",

    "abstract": "Surveying identical twins allows us to qualitatively separate genetic and environmental factors that may contribute to acne severity.\nTo study a cohort of identical and fraternal twins to identify environmental factors that may influence acne severity.\nA survey was administered to 139 identical and fraternal twin multiples (279 subjects) at the Annual Twins Day Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio on August 6-7, 2016. One set of triplets was included.\nAcne incidence, severity, and triggers were analyzed using the N-1 Chi-squared test and paired, 2-tailed t test.\nThe proportion of concordant pairs was significantly higher in identical (64%) vs fraternal (49%) twins (P=0.04). Acne was found to be associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS; P=0.045), anxiety (P =0.014), and asthma (P=0.026). Identical twin pairs with acne had a higher BMI (P= 0.020) and exercised significantly less (P=0.001) than those without acne. Analyzing concordant twin pairs, the twin with more severe acne was more likely to report aggravation of acne with cosmetic product use (P=0.002) and sugar intake (P=0.048).\nThis twin study further supports that there may be a genetic phenotypic link, though social and environmental factors may also have an influence in the disease process. <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(4):380-382.</em></p>.",

    "abstract": "Vascular ageing is characterized by arterial stiffening, dilation, and arterial wall thickening. We investigated the extent to which these changes are related and their heritability during 5\u2009year follow-up in the Twins UK cohort.\nCarotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVcf), carotid diameter, carotid distensibility, and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) were measured in 762 female twins (mean age 57.9\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6\u2009years) at two time-points over an average follow-up of 4.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u2009years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in a sub-sample of 38 women to measure aortic pulse wave velocity (PWVaorta), diameter, and wall thickness. Heritability of changes in arterial wall properties was estimated using structural equation modelling. Annual increases in PWVcf, carotid diameter, distensibility, and IMT were 0.139\u2009m/s, 0.028\u2009mm, -0.4\u2009kPa-1, and 0.011\u2009mm per year, respectively. In regression analysis, predictors of progression in PWVcf included age, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) at baseline, and progression in MAP, HR, and body mass index (BMI). Predictors of progression in IMT included progression in MAP, BMI, and triglyceride levels. Progression of PWV and distensibility correlated with progression in carotid diameter but not with IMT. Heritability of progression of PWVcf, diameter, and IMT was 55%, 21%, and 8%, respectively. In a sub-sample of women that underwent MRI, aortic wall thickness increased by 0.19\u2009mm/year, but aortic wall thickening was not correlated with an increase in lumen diameter or PWVaorta.\nArterial stiffening, as measured by PWVcf, and dilation are heritable but independent of arterial wall thickening. Genetic and cardiovascular risk factors contribute differently to progression of PWV and IMT.",

    "abstract": "Twin researchers face the challenge of accurately determining the zygosity of twins for research. As part of the annual questionnaire between 1999 and 2006, 8,307 twins from the TwinsUK registry were asked to complete five questions (independently from their co-twin) to ascertain their self-perceived zygosity during childhood on up to five separate occasions. This questionnaire is known as the 'peas in the pod' questionnaire (PPQ), but there is little evidence of its validation. Answers were scored and classified as monozygotic (MZ), dizygotic (DZ), or unknown zygosity (UZ) and were compared with 4,484 twins with genotyping data who had not been selected for zygosity. Of these, 3,859 individuals (46.5% of those who had a zygosity from PPQ) had zygosity classified by both the PPQ and genotyping. Of the 708 individual twins whose answers meant that they were consistently classed as MZ in the PPQ, 683 (96.5%) were MZ within the genotype data. Of the 945 individual twins consistently classed as DZ within questionnaire, 936 (99.0%) were DZ in the genotype data. Where both twins scored MZ consistently across multiple questionnaires, 99.6% were MZ on genotyping, 99.7% were DZ on genotyping if both twins consistently scored DZ. However, for the initial questionnaire, 88.6% of those scoring as MZ were genotypically MZ and 98.7% DZ. For twin pairs where both scored UZ, 94.7% were DZ. Using the PPQ on a single occasion provided a definitive classification of whether the twin was MZ or DZ with an overall accuracy of 86.9%, increasing to 97.9% when there was a consistent classification of zygosity across multiple questionnaires. This study has shown that the PPQ questionnaire is an excellent proxy indicator of zygosity in the absence of genotyping information.",

    "abstract": "Placental mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been proposed to be an indicator for placental hypoxia. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of vascular anastomoses between monochorionic (MC) twins on placental mtDNA.\nIn this study, twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) treated with laser therapy and MC twins without TTTS (without laser therapy) resulting in two live babies were included in this study. The placental mtDNA fold changes (FC) between the small and large twins were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR. TTTS twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) are categorized as group 1, TTTS without sIUGR as group 2, MC twins without TTTS but with sIUGR as group 3, and MC twins without both TTTS and sIUGR as group 4.\nThere were seven cases in group 1, eight in group 2, 26 in group 3, and 24 in group 4 cases. The placental mtDNA FC were significantly higher in group 1 (1.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9) compared to that of the group 3 (0.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6).\nIn MC twin pregnancies with sIUGR, the placental mtDNA FC between the small and large twins are different between cases with and without inter-twin anastomoses. These findings suggest that the inter-twin anastomoses in the MC twins with sIUGR may provide rescue perfusion from the appropriate-for-gestational-age twin to the sIUGR one.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrichosis is a condition in which hair is longer and denser than what is considered normal for an individual based on age, sex, ethnicity, and location on the body and can be classified based on its distribution (generalized vs localized), age of onset (congenital vs acquired), and type of hair (lanugo or vellus vs terminal). We describe a rare case of monozygotic female twins who presented for localized hypertrichosis of the intermammary cleft that developed during puberty. Endocrine examination was unremarkable. Discussion of various treatment modalities should be considered, because localized hypertrichosis may have a considerable psychosocial effect.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to establish the heritability of pain catastrophizing and its subdomains of helplessness, magnification, and rumination and to further explore the genetic and environmental sources that may contribute to pain catastrophizing as well as to its commonly reported psycho-affective correlates, including neuroticism, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of pain. N = 2,401 female twin individuals from the TwinsUK registry were subject to univariate and multivariate twin analyses. Well validated questionnaires including the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale, the Ten Item Personality Index, and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index were used to assess the study variables. Moderate estimates of heritability for pain catastrophizing (36%) and the three subdomains of helplessness (35%), rumination (27%), and magnification (36%) were detected. The high correlations observed between the three subdomains were explained mainly by overlapping genetic factors, with a single factor loading on all three phenotypes. High genetic correlations between pain catastrophizing and its psycho-affective correlates of fear of pain and anxiety sensitivity were found, while the genetic overlap between neuroticism and pain catastrophizing was low. Each measure of negative affect demonstrated relatively distinct environmental contributing factors, with very little overlap. This is the first study to show shared genetic factors in the observed association between pain catastrophizing and other measures of negative affect. Our findings provide deeper insight into the aetiology of pain catastrophizing and confirm that it is at least partially distinct from other measures of negative affect and personality that may influence the development and treatment of chronic pain conditions. Further research in males is warranted to check the comparability of the findings.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies suggest that obesity might have a Mendelian origin, but it is not clear if gene expression patterns observed in obese subjects are secondary to genetic traits or not.\nHere we test a transcriptomic signature of obesity previously identified by our group on a large cohort of twin subjects (TwinsUK).\nThe results show that the signature correlates strongly both with body mass index (BMI) and fat mass. Moreover, in paired transcriptomes of monozygotic twins, changes in signature correlate with changes in BMI and fat mass. We also identify a set of deregulated pathways involved in obesity, from inflammation to metabolism, and show that their pathway deregulation score is strongly correlated with BMI variations in pairs of identical twins.\nTaken together, our results strongly indicate that alterations in gene expression observed in obese subjects are not due to their genetic background, and should therefore primarily be associated with environment and lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of overweight and obesity is growing rapidly in many countries. Socioeconomic inequalities might be important for this increase. The aim of this study was to determine associations of body mass index (BMI), overweight and obesity with educational level and marital status in Chinese twins. Participants were adult twins recruited through the Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR), aged 18 to 79 years, and the sample comprised 10,448 same-sex twin pairs. Current height, weight, educational attainment, and marital status were self-reported. Regression analyses and structural equation models were conducted to evaluate BMI, overweight, and obesity associated with educational level and marital status in both sexes. At an individual level, both educational level and marital status were associated with higher BMI and higher risk of being overweight and obesity in men, while in women the effects of educational level on BMI were in the opposite direction. In within-Monozygotic (MZ) twin-pair analyses, the effects of educational level on BMI disappeared in females. Bivariate structural equation models showed that genetic factors and shared environmental confounded the relationship between education and BMI in females, whereas marital status was associated with BMI on account of significant positive unique environmental correlation apart in both sexes. The present data suggested that marital status and BMI were associated, independent of familiar factors, for both sexes of this study population, while common genetic and shared environmental factors contributed to education-associated disparities in BMI in females.",

    "abstract": "Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is the second most common congenital craniofacial malformation. Although many sporadic and familial cases have been studied to explore the etiology and pathogenesis of HFM, no common understanding has been reached. We aimed to further probe into the etiology of HFM through studying monozygotic twins. Here, we report two cases of pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for HFM, and performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and bioinformatics analysis to help determine the underlying molecular mechanisms. We identified 93 and 83, and 101 and 104 genes containing rare germline mutations in the twins of the two pairs, respectively. No positive gene candidates were found among the samples, and none of the analyses results revealed a clear intersection with previously reported gene candidates. The pathogenesis of HFM twin pairs does not appear to be related to single nucleotide variants or small insertions/deletions. Thus, HFM may be caused by structure variations, epigenetic alterations, and/or instability of short repeat sequences, which requires further investigation in a larger cohort with sequencing technology for verification.",

    "abstract": "The Nineteen and Up study (19Up) assessed a range of mental health and behavioural problems and associated risk factors in a genetically informative Australian cohort of young adult twins and their non-twin siblings. As such, 19Up enables detailed investigation of genetic and environmental pathways to mental illness and substance misuse within the Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Sample (BLTS).\nTwins and their non-twin siblings from Queensland, Australia; mostly from European ancestry. Data were collected between 2009 and 2016 on 2773 participants (age range 18-38, 57.8% female, 372 complete monozygotic pairs, 493 dizygotic pairs, 640 non-twin siblings, 403 singleton twins).\nA structured clinical assessment (Composite International Diagnostic Interview) was used to collect lifetime prevalence of diagnostic statistical manual (4th edition) (DSM-IV) diagnoses of major depressive disorder, (hypo)mania, social anxiety, cannabis use disorder, alcohol use disorder, panic disorder and psychotic symptoms. Here, we further describe the comorbidities and ages of onset for these mental disorders. Notably, two-thirds of the sample reported one or more lifetime mental disorder.In addition, the 19Up study assessed general health, drug use, work activity, education level, personality, migraine/headaches, suicidal thoughts, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptomatology, sleep-wake patterns, romantic preferences, friendships, familial environment, stress, anorexia and bulimia as well as baldness, acne, asthma, endometriosis, joint flexibility and internet use.The overlap with previous waves of the BLTS means that 84% of the 19Up participants are genotyped, 36% imaged using multimodal MRI and most have been assessed for psychological symptoms at up to four time points. Furthermore, IQ is available for 57%, parental report of ADHD symptomatology for 100% and electroencephalography for 30%.\nThe 19Up study complements a phenotypically rich, longitudinal collection of environmental and psychological risk factors. Future publications will explore hypotheses related to disease onset and development across the waves of the cohort. A follow-up study at 25+years is ongoing.",

    "abstract": "Craniopagus twins are conjoined twins fused at the cranium. This is the rarest anomaly seen in conjoined twins and craniopagus twins account for 2- 6% of conjoined twins. Conjoined twins are also extremely rare, with the anomaly seen in about 10-20 subjects per billion births. A female preponderance has been noted. Craniopagus twins can be classified into complete or partial, depending on whether or not they have shared dural venous sinuses. They can be further classified into angular or total depending on the alignment of the inter-twin longitudinal axis. Surgical separation of these cases can be an elective procedure or an emergency, mandated by the death of one of the twins. Surgical separation of craniopagus twins is a complex exercise needing detailed evaluation and planning. For the successful management of these twins, a multi-disciplinary approach involving neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, anesthetists, radiologists, pediatric critical care specialists and ancillary staff is mandatory. We present a case of partially successful elective separation of partial angular craniopagus twins performed in 2002.The surviving twin was managed conservatively for a cerebrospinal fluid leak. The patient subsequently developed a pseudomeningocele, necessitating re-exploration, excision of the gliotic tissue, and repair of the dura and the overlying scalp flap. The patient has a skull defect for which cranioplasty has been deferred. The child is neurologically intact. The post-operative evaluation and the detailed periodic neurological assessment till date (with a follow up of 15 years) have been presented in this study.",

    "abstract": "This article begins with the story of a 51-year-old Los Angeles, California man, Justin Goldberg, whose daughter caught a glimpse of his striking look-alike at a popular market. Many people have so-called doppelg\u00e4ngers, but this occurrence is especially intriguing - the individual in question, born in New York City in the mid-1960s to an unwed mother, was an adoptee placed by the Louise Wise Adoption Agency. This agency, under the guidance of a prominent psychiatrist, decided to place twins in separate homes. Some of these twin children were part of a controversial child development study that was hidden from them and their parents. Next, recent and current twin research on heart transplantation, distinguishing monozygotic co-twins, twin conceptions via oocyte donation and factors affecting craniofacial traits are summarized. The article concludes with highlights on twins in the media, specifically, a triplet delivery in the United Kingdom, self-concept and consciousness in conjoined twins, Colombian twin trainers, skin grafting to save an identical co-twin, lack of physical flaws in Dolly the cloned sheep, possible opposite-sex conjoined twins, and the passing of the remaining twin from the world's longest separated pair.",

    "abstract": "Are there more same-sex (SS) than opposite-sex (OS) pairs among dizygotic twins?\nIn violation of Weinberg's Differential Rule, there are significantly more SS than OS pairs among dizygotic twins in nationally representative samples both in the UK and the USA.\nSince at least 1874, twin researchers have assumed that dizygotic twins were equally likely to be SS or OS (later formalized as Weinberg's Differential Rule). However, recent research on the sex-specific nature of breastmilk suggests that OS twins might be at a developmental disadvantage relative to SS twins. There may therefore be evolutionary selection for the tendency to have SS twins and against the tendency to have OS twins.\nWe analyze two population samples (not subject to Lykken's rule of two-thirds): the National Child Development Study in the UK (n = 17 419) from 1958 to present, and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health in the USA (n = 20 745) from 1994 to present.\nWe performed a one-sample t-test of the proportion of SS dizygotic twins against the theoretical null value of 0.5022.\nThe proportion of SS pairs among dizygotic twins was 0.6043 (t(325) = 3.838, P = 0.00015) in the UK and 0.5739 (t(520) = 3.398, P = 0.00073) in the USA.\nTwin type (monozygotic versus dizygotic) was classified by the mother, not by DNA typing, although supplementary data suggest that misclassification was negligible and supplementary analysis shows that potential misclassifications do not change our main conclusions.\nWeinberg's Differential Rule may be incorrect in its assumption of independence of sexes within dizygotic pairs, and there may be evolutionary selection for SS, and against OS, dizygotic pairs.\nNone.",

    "abstract": "The heritability of nicotine dependence based on family studies is substantial. Nevertheless, knowledge of the underlying genetic architecture remains meager. Our aim was to identify novel genetic variants responsible for interindividual differences in smoking behavior. We performed a genome-wide association study on 1715 ever smokers ascertained from the population-based Finnish Twin Cohort enriched for heavy smoking. Data imputation used the 1000 Genomes Phase I reference panel together with a whole genome sequence-based Finnish reference panel. We analyzed three measures of nicotine addiction-smoking quantity, nicotine dependence and nicotine withdrawal. We annotated all genome-wide significant SNPs for their functional potential. First, we detected genome-wide significant association on 16p12 with smoking quantity (P\u00a0=\u00a08.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether twin pregnancies conceived by different forms of fertility treatments are associated with adverse neonatal outcomes and to examine the difference in maternal and obstetrical characteristics between patients.\nOur study was a retrospective analysis of twin pregnancies conceived by fertility treatments from a prospectively collected database. Treatments were stratified into two groups: group 1 (ART) consisted of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and group 2 (non-ART) included intrauterine insemination (IUI) and ovulation induction (OI). Composite neonatal morbidity included respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, leukomalacia, chronic lung disease, and death prior to discharge.\nThere were 460 neonates in our study; among them, 67% (n\u2009=\u2009310) were in group 1, and 33% (n\u2009=\u2009150) in group 2. Group 1 patients were more likely to be older (p\u2009=\u20090.004), nulliparous (p\u2009=\u20090.01), delivered twins with lower birth weights (2278\u00a0g\u2009\u00b1\u2009605 vs. 2427\u2009\u00b1\u2009519, p\u2009=\u20090.009), and had more deliveries <\u200932\u00a0weeks gestation (p\u2009=\u20090.001). In multivariable Poisson regression model, only neonatal intensive care unit admission rate was increased for group 1 twins (aRR\u2009=\u20091.27, 95% CI 1.003-1.60).\nAfter adjusting for confounders, twins conceived via ART compared to non-ART had similar neonatal outcomes. These data can help when counseling this patient population and assist in planning larger prospective cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic development of lower vertebrates can be influenced by many factors, especially when outside of the mother's body and under the influence of variable abiotic and biotic factors. In this study, the effects of fertilization of post-ovulatory aged (overmature) oocytes of ide Leuciscus idus on the risk of developing anomalies in ide larvae were assessed under controlled conditions. There was a negative effect of delayed fertilization of post-ovulatory aged (overmature) oocytes in the ovary on the quality of offspring, which caused reduced survival 3 days post-fertilization and at the hatching stage (68.3 vs. 81.2% and 47.2 vs. 79.7% for the overmature and mature groups, respectively). It also increased the occurrence of numerous developmental defects (19.3 vs. 0.8% for the overmature and mature groups, respectively), including the development of Siamese twins. This is the first reported case of the occurrence of Siamese twins in ide. The ide Siamese twins look like hen eggs with 2 heads and are different from 'typical' Siamese twins in fish.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) have been associated with vascular risk factors, both of which are under genetic influence. We examined in a monozygotic twin sample whether the association between vascular risk and WMHs is influenced by overlapping genetic factors. We included 195 cognitively normal monozygotic twins (age\u00a0= 70 \u00b1 7 years), including 94 complete pairs. Regional WMH load was estimated using an automated algorithm. Vascular risk was summarized with the Framingham score. The within-twin pair correlation for total WMHs was 0.76 and for Framingham score was 0.77. Within participants, Framingham score was associated with total and periventricular WMHs (r\u00a0= 0.32). Framingham score in 1 twin was also associated with total WMHs in the co-twin (r\u00a0= 0.26). Up to 83% of the relation between both traits could be explained by shared genetic effects. In conclusion, monozygotic twins have highly similar vascular risk and WMH burden, confirming a genetic background for these traits. The association between both traits is largely driven by overlapping genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Abnormalities in affective cognition are putative endophenotypes for bipolar and unipolar disorders but it is unclear whether some abnormalities are disorder-specific. We therefore investigated affective cognition in monozygotic twins at familial risk of bipolar disorder relative to those at risk of unipolar disorder and to low-risk twins.\nSeventy monozygotic twins with a co-twin history of bipolar disorder (n = 11), of unipolar disorder (n\u202f= 38) or without co-twin history of affective disorder (n = 21) were included. Variables of interest were recognition of and vigilance to emotional faces, emotional reactivity and -regulation in social scenarios and non-affective cognition.\nTwins at familial risk of bipolar disorder showed increased recognition of low to moderate intensity of happy facial expressions relative to both unipolar disorder high-risk twins and low-risk twins. Bipolar disorder high-risk twins also displayed supraliminal attentional avoidance of happy faces compared with unipolar disorder high-risk twins and greater emotional reactivity in positive and neutral social scenarios and less reactivity in negative social scenarios than low-risk twins. In contrast with our hypothesis, there was no negative bias in unipolar disorder high-risk twins. There were no differences between the groups in demographic characteristics or non-affective cognition.\nThe modest sample size limited the statistical power of the study.\nIncreased sensitivity and reactivity to positive social stimuli may be a neurocognitive endophenotype that is specific for bipolar disorder. If replicated in larger samples, this 'positive endophenotype' could potentially aid future diagnostic differentiation between unipolar and bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "We describe a case of twins with sporadic Gorlin syndrome. Both twins had common Gorlin syndrome features including calcification of the falx cerebri, multiple jaw keratocysts, and multiple basal cell carcinomas, but with different expressivity. One brother also had benign testicular mesothelioma. We propose this tumor type as a possible new feature of Gorlin syndrome. Gorlin syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by both developmental abnormalities and cancer predisposition, with variable expression of various developmental abnormalities and different types of tumors. The syndrome is primarily caused by mutations in the Patched 1 (PTCH1) gene, although rare mutations of Patched 2 (PTCH2) or Suppressor of Fused (SUFU) genes have also been found. Neither founder mutations nor hot spot locations have been described for PTCH1 in Gorlin syndrome patients. Although de novo mutations of the PTCH1 gene occur in almost 50% of Gorlin syndrome cases, there are a few recurrent mutations. Our twin patients were carriers of a de novo mutation in the PTCH1 gene, c.3364_3365delAT (p.Met1122ValfsX22). This is, to our knowledge, the first Gorlin syndrome-causing mutation that has been reported four independent times in distant geographical locations. Therefore, we propose the location of the described mutation as a potential hot spot for mutations in PTCH1.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a clinical description for a group of motor disorders that are heterogeneous with respect to causes, symptoms and severity. A diagnosis of CP cannot usually be made at birth and in some cases may be delayed until 2-3\u00a0years of age. This limits opportunities for early intervention that could otherwise improve long-term outcomes. CP has been recorded in monozygotic twins discordant for the disorder, indicating a potential role of non-genetic factors such as intrauterine infection, hypoxia-ischaemia, haemorrhage and thrombosis. The aim of this exploratory study was to utilise the discordant monozygotic twin model to understand and measure epigenetic changes associated with the development of CP.\nWe performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip array with DNA from newborn blood spots of 15 monozygotic twin pairs who later became discordant for CP. Quality control and data preprocessing were undertaken using the \nWe identified 33 top-ranked DMPs based on a nominal \nOurs is the first epigenome-wide association study of CP in disease-discordant monozygotic twin pairs and suggests a potential role for immune dysfunction in this condition.",

    "abstract": "The role of general anesthetics as a risk factor for possible neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in humans is unresolved. The investigation of the role of anesthetics in the development of postgeneral anesthesia (anesthesia onward) NDDs has proven to be complicated, partly because of the inherent confounding in clinical cohort studies, and partly by the fact that anesthetics are only one part in the complex process of anesthesia-surgery.\nUtilizing the Swedish databases Child and Adolescent Twins Study in Sweden (CATSS) and National Patient Register (NPR), we investigated twins discordant for anesthesia, born between 1997 and 2004 for traits of NDDs. We identified 68 twin pairs discordant for anesthesia and explored traits of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Learning Disability (LD), and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in them while simultaneously taking congenital abnormalities and systemic disorders (CSDs) into account. We analyzed the possible effect of anesthesia on neurodevelopmental problems, and we analyzed the within-pair differences using conditional linear regression.\nTwins with a recorded episode of anesthesia had higher traits of NDDs than twins without; similarly twins with CSDs had higher mean scores on all traits than twins without CSDs. The within-pair analyses suggested that exposure to anesthesia was associated with higher scores of ADHD (regression coefficient 1.02 and 95% confidence intervals: 0.27-1.78) in monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for anesthesia. This effect remained when adjusting for congenital abnormalities.\nOur finding that traits of ADHD were slightly associated with anesthesia in a genetically sensitive design is in need of replication and warrants further investigation. Future studies should aim to elucidate mechanisms behind this possible association (e.g. anesthetics doses, age at exposure, exposure duration).",

    "abstract": "We aimed to clarify the survival rate without brain abnormalities (BA) after fetoscopic laser photoco-agulation (FLP) for monochorionic diamniotic twin gestations (MCDA) with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) accompanied by abnormal umbilical artery (UA) Doppler waveforms and isolated oligohydramnios in the sIUGR twin.\nThis retrospective study included 52 cases that underwent FLP. The main outcome was survival rate without BA of the twins at age 28 days. BA was defined as severe intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia on postnatal ultrasonography.\nMedian gestational age at FLP was 20 (16-24) weeks. Ten cases were classified as type III based on Doppler for the UA. For all cases, including 20 cases of anterior placenta, FLP was completed without major intraoperative complications. Amnioinfusion was required in 49 cases for better fetoscopic visualization. Fetal loss occurred in 29 sIUGR twins and two larger twins, whereas one larger twin experienced neonatal death. Survival rates without BA were 44% (n = 23) for sIUGR twins and 94% (n = 49) for the larger twins.\nFLP for MCDA with sIUGR presenting with oligohydramnios in the sIUGR twin might be considered a prenatal treatment option.",

Prenatal diagnosis was performed on 290 fetuses of 149 twin pairs, including 150 monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) fetuses (79 pairs) and 140 dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) fetuses (70 pairs). G-Banding karyotyping and/or chromosomal microarray analysis were performed. The types of cardiovascular anomalies and the results of prenatal diagnosis were analyzed.\nFifty percent (79/158) fetuses in MCDA group and 52.1% (73/140) fetuses in DCDA group were diagnosed with cardiovascular anomalies by ultrasound. Primary cardiac structural defects such as septal defects and tetralogy of Fallot were more common in DCDA group than in MCDA group, while acardiac anomaly was the most common in MCDA group. Chromosomal aberrations were identified in 7.7% fetuses (11/142) of MCDA group and in 18.3% fetuses (22/120) of DCDA group by G-banding karyotyping. Except benign copy number variations (CNVs), 37 CNVs (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and variant of uncertain significance) and chromosomal aberrations were detected in 21.3% (32/150) fetuses of MCDA group and 47 CNVs (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and variant of uncertain significance) and chromosomal aberrations were detected in 32.1% (45/140) fetuses of DCDA group by chromosomal microarray analysis.\nMost of cardiovascular anomalies were identified in one fetus of a twin pair no matter in MCDA or DCDA twin. Primary cardiac structural defects were more common in DCDA group. Monozygotic twins may have discordant phenotypes, karyotypes, and CNVs between 2 fetuses of each pair.",

We used a sample of 1586 same-sex twin pairs to test the association between seven measures of social capital and two related measures of neighborhood characteristics with depressive symptoms accounting for uncontrolled selection factors (i.e., genetics and shared environment). All measures of cognitive social capital and neighborhood characteristics were associated with less depressive symptoms in between-twin analysis. However, only measures of cognitive social capital were significantly associated with less depressive symptoms within-pairs. These results demonstrate that cognitive social capital is associated with depressive symptoms free of confounding from genetic and environmental factors shared within twins.",

    "abstract": "I argue that the separation of conjoined twins in infancy or early childhood is unethical (rare exceptions aside). Cases may be divided into three types: both twins suffer from lethal abnormalities, only one twin has a lethal abnormality, or neither twin does. In the first kind of case, there is no reason to separate, since both twins will die regardless of treatment. In the third kind of case, I argue that separation at an early age is unethical because the twins are likely to achieve an irreplaceably good quality of life-the goods of conjoinment-that separation takes away. Evaluation of this possibility requires maturation past early childhood. Regarding the second type, I point out that with conceivable but unrecorded exceptions, these cases will consistently involve sacrifice separation. I present an argument that sacrifice separation is unethical, but in some cases a moral dilemma may exist in which separation and refraining from separation are both unethical. Perhaps in such cases a decision can be made on non-moral grounds; however, the possibility of such a decision serves not to mitigate but to underscore the fact that the separation is unethical. My conclusion, which applies to all three types of cases, is that it is unethical to separate conjoined twins before their developing personalities give some reliable indication as to whether they desire separation and whether they will achieve those goods of conjoinment.",

Eleven cases have been reported in childhood, and we present the first known case of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus in identical twins. Although flares are typically photo-induced, we present an annular eruption typical of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with concurrent pinworm infestation, with recurrence of disease with cutaneous larva migrans. The patient's identical twin had a similar eruption with pinworm infection. This case highlights the possibility of parasitic infestation as a trigger for subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus in genetically susceptible individuals.",

    "abstract": "Our primary objective was to compare neonatal and maternal outcomes in women with twin pregnancies, beyond 32\u2009weeks, having a planned vaginal birth or a planned caesarean section (CS). This was a retrospective cohort study from a single tertiary centre over nine\u2009years. 534 sets of twins\u2009\u226532\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks of gestation were included. 401 sets were planned vaginally and 133 sets were planned by CS. We compared a composite adverse perinatal outcome (perinatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity; five minute APGAR score\u2009\u22644, neurological abnormality and need for intubation) and a composite maternal adverse outcome (major haemorrhage, trauma or infection) between the groups. There were no significant differences. Given the similarity of these results with several other larger studies of twin birth, we sought to look at reasons why there is still a rising rate of CS for twin births. We further make suggestions for keeping this rate to a sensible minimum. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? The largest randomised controlled study comparing planned vaginal birth with planned CSs for lower risk twins between 32 and 39 weeks of gestation, showed no added safety from planned CS. However, in most of the Western countries this conclusion has failed to increase the number of planned vaginal births for lower risk twins. What do the results of this study add? This observational study from a single tertiary centre provides external validation of the twin trial results in a practical day-to-day setting. It also provides insights as to how planned vaginal birth can be developed and maintained, with a key focus on safety and maternal participation in decision making. It does focus on consent and providing accurate data. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? There are good grounds to encourage vaginal birth for low-risk twin pregnancies. The trend of rising caesarean rates in low-risk twin pregnancies worldwide will erode important skills for the conduct of vaginal births without any clear benefit for mothers or babies. The current situation demands careful thought about implementing innovative training opportunities for younger obstetricians. Finally, we need intelligent responses to many non-evidence-based factors which can drive clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare pregnancy outcomes in twin pregnancies after assisted conception and spontaneous conception, according to chorionicity.\nRetrospective cohort study of 1305 twin pregnancies between 1995 and 2015. All spontaneous (n = 731) and assisted conception conceived (n = 574) twin pregnancies with antenatal care and delivery in University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands, a tertiary obstetric care center were studied according to chorionicity.\nMaternal age and incidence of nulliparity were higher among the assisted conception twins. Hypertensive disorders also appeared to be more frequent in assisted conception pregnancies, which could largely be explained by the higher proportion of elderly nulliparous women in this group. Spontaneously conceived twins were born earlier than twins after assisted conception, with subsequent lower birthweights and more admissions to a neonatal intensive care unit with increased neonatal morbidity. Monochorionic twins had worse pregnancy outcomes compared with dichorionic twins, irrespective of mode of conception; monochorionic twins conceived by assisted reproduction had more neonatal morbidity (mainly respiratory distress syndrome and necrotizing enterocolitis) and late neonatal deaths compared with spontaneously conceived monochorionic twins.\nSpontaneously conceived twins have worse pregnancy outcome compared with twins after assisted conception, probably due to a lower incidence of monochorionicity in the assisted conception group. The already increased perinatal risks in monochorionic twins are even higher in monochorionic twins conceived after infertility treatments compared with spontaneously conceived monochorionic twins, which warrants extra attention to these high-risk pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to identify prenatal and postnatal risk factors associated with abnormal newborn hearing screen (NHS) results and subsequently confirmed sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in preterm twin neonates.\nElectronic medical records of 159 twin neonates who were born alive after \u226432 weeks were retrospectively reviewed for hearing loss in both ears. Histopathologic examination of the placenta was performed and clinical data, including method of conception and factors specific to twins, were retrieved from a computerized perinatal database. The main outcome measure was failure to pass the NHS test. The generalized estimation equations model was used for twins.\nThirty-two neonates (20.1%) had a \"refer\" result, and, on the confirmation test, permanent SNHL was identified in 4.4% (7/159) of all neonates. Neonates who had a \"refer\" result on the NHS test were more likely to be of lower birth weight, more likely to have been conceived with the use of in\u00a0vitro fertilization (IVF), and more likely to have higher rates of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, monochorionic placentation, death of the co-twin, or being born first was not associated with a \"refer\" result on the NHS test. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that conception after IVF and the presence of IVH were the only variables to be statistically significantly associated with \"refer\" on the NHS test. No parameters studied were found to be significantly different between the SNHL and no SNHL groups, probably because of the relatively small number of cases of SNHL.\nIn preterm twin newborns, IVF and the presence of IVH were independently associated with an increased risk of abnormal NHS results, whereas the factors specific to twins were not associated with abnormal NHS results.",

    "abstract": "Management of noncephalic second twin delivery rests on the results of population-based retrospective studies of twin births that have shown higher neonatal mortality and morbidity for second twins with noncephalic, compared with cephalic, presentations after vaginal delivery of the first twin. Because these studies are flawed by data of questionable validity, do not report the obstetrical practices at delivery, and do not allow collection of potential confounding variables, we performed a national prospective study specially designed to evaluate the management of twins' delivery.\nWe sought to assess neonatal mortality and morbidity according to second twin presentation after vaginal birth of the first twin.\nThe Jumeaux Mode d'Accouchement study was a nationwide prospective population-based cohort study of twin deliveries performed in 176 maternity units in France from February 2014 through March 2015. The primary outcome was a composite of intrapartum mortality and neonatal mortality and morbidity. Neonatal outcomes of second twins born \u226532 weeks of gestation after vaginal delivery of the first cephalic or breech twin were compared according to the noncephalic or cephalic second twin presentation. Multivariable logistic regression models controlled for potential confounders. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the breech or transverse presentation of the noncephalic second twin, and gestational age at delivery, before or after 37 weeks of gestation.\nAmong 3903 second twins enrolled in the study, 2384 (61.1%) were in cephalic and 1519 (38.9%) in noncephalic presentations, of whom 999 (25.6%) were in breech and 520 (13.3%) in transverse presentation. Composite neonatal mortality and morbidity did not differ between the noncephalic and cephalic group (47/1519 [3.1%] vs 59/2384 [2.5%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.85). No significant difference between groups was shown for the primary outcome in subgroup analyses according to type of noncephalic second twin presentation or gestational age at delivery. Cesarean delivery rates for the second twin were lower in the breech than in the cephalic group (14/999 [1.4%] vs 75/2384 [3.1%], P\u00a0= .003) and lower in the cephalic than in the transverse group (75/2384 [3.1%] vs 35/520 [6.7%], P < .001).\nNoncephalic and cephalic second twin presentations after vaginal delivery of the first twin \u226532 weeks of gestation are associated with similar low composite neonatal mortality and morbidity. Vaginal delivery of noncephalic second twin is a reasonable option.",

Recent studies have also identified single CpGs whose methylation levels are associated with all-cause mortality. In this study, we perform an epigenome-wide study of the association between CpG methylation and mortality in a population of 435 monozygotic twin pairs from three Danish twin studies. The participants were aged 55-90 at the time of blood sampling and were followed for up to 20 years. We validated our results by comparison with results from a British and a Swedish cohort, as well as results from the literature. We identified 2806 CpG sites associated with mortality (false discovery rate ( FDR ) < 0.05 ), of which 24 had an association ",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the heritability of facial skeletal and dental characteristics of the monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. The samples consisted of Korean MZ and DZ twins (n\u200a=\u200a13\u200apairs/each twin; 7 pairs of males and 6 pairs of females; mean age, 39 years, respectively). The linear, angular, and ratio variables, which could describe the size and shape of the facial horizontal and vertical, dental, mandible and cranial base structure, were measured. The Falconer's method was used to calculate the heritability (h; close to or below 0, low heritability; close to or above 1, high heritability). In the facial horizontal and vertical aspects, the highest h values were shown at SNA (degree, 1.53), SNB (degree, 2.12), SN-Pog (degree, 2.19), SN-palatal plane angle (degree, 1.29), SN-mandibular plane angle (degree, 1.59), N-ANS/ANS-Me (1.66), and ANS-Me/N-Me (1.62). In the dental aspects, although L1-occlusal plane angle (degree, 1.38) and SN-occlusal plane angle (degree, 2.09) showed high h values, most of the dental variables showed low h values. In the mandible and cranial base, lower gonial angle, mandibular body length, and cranial base angle showed high h values (N-Go-Gn [degree], 1.07; Go-Pog [mm], 0.92; N-S-Ba [degree], 1.51). The descending order of the overall mean h values was the facial horizontal (1.10), facial vertical (0.71), mandible (0.59), cranial base (0.37), and dental characteristics (-0.11). The shape of facial skeletal structure and location of the occlusal plane within skeletal framework was more influenced by genetic factors than environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "More than 200 million children aged <5 years fail to reach their full cognitive potential, and children born as twins are particularly at risk. In this article, we review studies that examined differences in the neurodevelopmental outcomes of twins compared to singletons. We searched the Medline database for articles on twins, singletons, neuro, and cognitive development. We also inspected bibliographies of relevant publications to identify related articles from 2011 to 2017. Our search criteria yielded 162 studies, 8 of which met the inclusion criteria. Of the eight studies examined, four were prospective follow-up studies, three were cross-sectional studies, and one was a randomized controlled trial. Five of these studies were carried out in developed countries, and they found no statistically significant difference in neurodevelopmental outcomes among twins and singletons. However, two of the three studies carried out in developing countries found a difference with singletons having significantly higher academic ratings than twins. Studies in which neurodevelopmental outcomes were measured early in life (1-5 years) showed no significant twin-singleton differences, while those in which it was measured later in life showed mixed twin-singleton differences. Overall, these studies may have been underpowered and may not have been optimally designed and implemented. There is need for studies with adequate sample sizes, good design, and optimal measurement of all relevant covariates in order to resolve the conflicting reports in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Late Language Emergence (LLE) in the first two years of life is one of the most common parental concerns about child development and reasons for seeking advice from health professionals. LLE is much more prevalent in twins (38%) than singletons (20%). In studies of language development in twins without overt disability, adverse prenatal and perinatal environments have been reported to play a lesser role in the etiology of LLE than adverse postnatal environments. However, there is a lack of population-level evidence about prenatal and perinatal risk factors for LLE in twins. This study investigated the extent to which prenatal and perinatal risk factors were associated with LLE in a population-level sample of twins at age 2 without overt disability.\nThe sample comprised 473 twin pairs drawn from a population sample frame comprising statutory notifications of all births in Western Australia (WA), 2000-2003. Twin pairs in which either twin had a known developmental disorder or exposure to language(s) other than English were excluded. Of the 946 twins, 47.9% were male. There were 313 dizygotic and 160 monozygotic twin pairs. LLE was defined as a score at or below the gender-specific 10th percentile on the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories: Words and Sentences (CDI-WS) (Words Produced). Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate risk factors associated with LLE.\nIn the multivariable model, risk factors for LLE in order of decreasing magnitude were: Gestational diabetes had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 19.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 313.1); prolonged TSR (aOR: 13.6 [2.0, 91.1]); multiparity (aOR: 7.6 [1.6, 37.5]), monozygosity (aOR: 6.9 [1.7, 27.9]) and fetal growth restriction (aOR: 4.6 [1.7, 12.7]). Sociodemographic risk factors (e.g., low maternal education, socioeconomic area disadvantage) were not associated with increased odds of LLE.\nThe results suggest that adverse prenatal and perinatal environments are important in the etiology of LLE in twins at age 2. It is important that health professionals discuss twin pregnancy and birth risks for delayed speech and language milestones with parents and provide ongoing developmental monitoring for all twins, not just twins with overt disability.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare phenomenon with historically poor outcomes after separation. We present a review of 8 sets of conjoined twins operated on in Memphis, Tenn, from 1953-2016. Except for 1 set of twins, before 2010, all experienced at least 1 fatality either before, during, or as a result of separation. Since 2010, we have separated an additional 2 sets of conjoined twins with no mortality related to the separation, although 1 of the first twins had significant cardiac and respiratory abnormalities and died several years after the separation. Each set of twins presented many challenges in reconstruction; however, the use of tissue expansions in the 2 most recent sets of twins proved to be beneficial. Although improvements in imaging, surgical technology, and postoperative monitoring likely have contributed to the increased survival, previous experience and meticulous planning with a multidisciplinary approach may have been the most influential.",

    "abstract": "Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) causes early brain development impairment by affecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we analyze NPCs from three pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins with glutathione synthetase deficiency, progressive retinal dystrophy and cystoid macular edema were followed for foveal changes on optical coherence tomography under different treatment modalities. The purpose of the study is to show the effect of topical dorzolamide in conjunction with systemic acetazolamide in terms of decreasing macular edema in this specific disease. The results showed that systemic acetazolamide alone or in combination with topical dorzolamide decreased CME in both patients for a certain period of time. The result can be temporary sustained after treatment discontinuation. In conclusion, topical dorzolamide, in conjunction with systemic acetazolamide, could reduce cystoid macular edema in GSSD.",

ELISA method was applied to detect the expression of PHLDA2 and IGF2 in two groups of umbilical cord blood.\nThere was a significant difference in two groups of maternal age and neonatal birth weight (P<0.05). Immunohistochemical results: IGF2 in the normal MCDA maternal placenta was high expression. The number of IGF2-positive cells in MCDA-sIUGR group A1 decreased slightly and the staining decreased slightly. The number of IGF2-positive cells in A2 group was significantly decreased, and the staining was weakened. In normal MCDA placenta, PHLDA2 cells were colorless, or occasionally in pale yellow; the number of PHLDA2 positive cells in MCDA sIUGR A1 group was slightly increased, the staining was light yellow or colorless. In A2 group, the number of positive cells increased significantly, the staining was brown or brownish-yellow. ELISA results showed that there were significant differences in the expression of IGF2 and PHLDA2 between cord blood of MCDA sIUGR and neonatal cord blood (P<0.05). The expression of IGF2 in MCDA sIUGR and normal MCDA twins were also significantly different (P<0.01).\nThe differential expression of PHLDA2 and IGF2 may be one of the causes of selective intrauterine growth restriction.",

Although the incidence of late-onset transient adrenal insufficiency in preterm infants has been reported in Japan, reports from Western countries are lacking. In addition, no study has investigated the effect of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in monozygotic twins.\nA pair of extremely low birth weight twins presented with TTTS.\nBoth twins developed late-onset adrenal insufficiency with oliguria, hypotension, hyponatremia, and pulmonary edema at a postnatal age of 24 days and 51 days, respectively.\nTemporary administration of intravenous hydrocortisone was initiated.\nTheir symptoms improved dramatically and they survived the event without any neurologic sequelae after 3 years of follow-up.\nLate-onset circulatory collapse may occur, especially in extremely preterm infants, even at 2 months after birth. Hydrocortisone therapy is an effective treatment to rescue circulatory collapse caused by adrenal insufficiency in preterm infants and may not affect long-term neuromotor and cognitive outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Late preterm infants (born between 34 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation) have been shown to have a higher morbidity and mortality than term infants. Furthermore, twins, both term and preterm, have a higher neonatal morbidity than singletons. The aim of our study was to examine if late preterm twins consequently have twice the neonatal morbidity when both risk factors prematurity and multiple pregnancy are present.\nA retrospective single-centre study was conducted to compare neonatal outcome of late preterm singletons and late preterm twins born between 34 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation as well as term twins with a gestational age from 37 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks. Primary outcome was length of hospitalisation. Secondary outcome was neonatal morbidity.\nA total of 845 infants were included. Late preterm twins (n = 243) were hospitalised significantly longer than term twins (n = 107) (13.5 \u00b1 8.0 vs 6.29 \u00b1 2.0 days, p <0.001) and late preterm singletons (n = 495) (13.5 \u00b1 8.0 vs 12.6 \u00b1 8.6 days, p = 0.011). Hyperbilirubinaemia occurred significantly more often in late preterm singletons than in late preterm twins (49.7 vs 29.2%; p<0.001). Otherwise, no significant differences were detected regarding neonatal morbidities or mortality of late preterm singletons and late preterm twins. Late preterm twins had a significantly higher incidence of most morbidities than term twins.\nLate preterm twins are hospitalised significantly longer than similar-aged singletons, but have otherwise similar neonatal morbidities. Hyperbilirubinaemia is less frequent in late preterm twins than late preterm singletons.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are identical twins with fused bodies, joined in utero. They are rare complications of monochorionic twinning. The purpose of this study is to describe the various types of conjoined twins, the role of imaging and recent advances aiding in their management.\nThis was a twin institutional study involving 3 cases of conjoined twins diagnosed over a period of 6 years from 2010 to 2015. All the 3 cases were identified antenatally by ultrasound. Only one case was further evaluated by MRI.\nThree cases of conjoined twins (cephalopagus, thoracopagus and omphalopagus) were accurately diagnosed on antenatal ultrasound. After detailed counseling of the parents and obtaining written consent, all the three cases of pregnancy were terminated. Delivery of the viable conjoined twins was achieved without any complications to the mothers, and all the three conjoined twins died after a few minutes.\nUltrasound enables an early and accurate diagnosis of conjoined twins, which is vital for obstetric management. MRI is reserved for better tissue characterization. Termination of pregnancy when opted, should be done at an early stage as later stages are fraught with problems. Recent advances, such as 3D printing, may aid in surgical pre-planning, thereby enabling successful surgical separation of conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are among the most rare and challenging congenital malformations. The incidence varies from 1:30 000 to 1:200 000 live births. Pygopagus twins account for about 10 to 18% of all conjoined twins.\nWe report the case of male conjoined pygopagus twins. They shared medullary canal, anal canal and sacrococcygeal region, without any degree of cross circulation. At the moment of the surgery, twin 1 had congenital heart disease without medical treatment. Twin 2 presented craniofacial malformations. The total organic separation was performed electively, by being driven by two teams of anesthesiologists with balanced general anesthesia, intravenous and sequential induction intubation. Non-invasive and invasive monitoring was used for both twins. During the transanesthetic period, twin 1 presented multiple hypercyanotic episodes associated to hypovolemia and hypotension. Twin 2 remained stable. During the final separation acute bleeding and hemodynamic instability showed up, requiring the use of inotropes, vasopressors and blood components. The twins were sent to intensive care where they remained under surveillance for three days. They were discharged a month and a half after the surgical event.\nEach type of siamese has specific characteristics depending on the type of union; comprehensive knowledge of the morphology and physiopathology of the twins is essential for optimal anesthetic management.\nlos gemelos unidos son una de las m\u00e1s raras y desafiantes malformaciones cong\u00e9nitas.

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are very rarely seen. We present a case of thoracopagus that was undiagnosed prior to delivery and combined with eclampsia and obstructed labor in a low-resource setting in sub-Saharan Africa. A 27-year-old pregnant woman was presented to the maternity emergency unit of Princess Christian Maternity Hospital (PCMH) in Freetown at term in labor. Upon admission, the patient was awake and orientated and presented a blood pressure of 180/120\u2009mmHg and a protein value of 3+ on urine dipstick test. Clinical examination-ultrasound was not available-led to the admission diagnosis: obstructed labor with intrauterine fetal death and preeclampsia. Application of Hydralazine 5\u2009mg (i.v.) under close blood pressure monitoring was performed. Under spontaneous progression of labor, one head of the yet unknown conjoined twin was born. The patient developed eclamptic fits. Ceasing of seizures was achieved after implementing the loading dose of the MgSO",

    "abstract": "The objective was to examine the effect of twin-to-twin delivery intervals on neonatal outcome for second twins.\nThis was a retrospective, hospital-based study, performed at a university teaching hospital in Western Sweden. Twin deliveries between 2008 and 2014 at \u226532\u2009+\u20090\u00a0weeks of gestation, where the first twin was delivered vaginally, were included. Primary outcome was a composite outcome of metabolic acidosis, Apgar <\u20094 at 5\u00a0min or peri/neonatal mortality in the second twin. Secondary outcome was a composite outcome of neonatal morbidity.\nA total of 527 twin deliveries were included. The median twin-to-twin delivery interval time was 19\u00a0min (range 2-399\u00a0min) and 68% of all second twins were delivered within 30\u00a0min. Primary outcome occurred in 2.6% of the second twins. Median twin-to-twin delivery interval was 34\u00a0min (8-78\u00a0min) for the second twin with a primary outcome, and 19\u00a0min (2-399\u00a0min) for the second twin with no primary outcome (p\u2009=\u20090.028). Second twins delivered within a twin-to-twin interval of 0-30\u00a0min had a higher pH in umbilical artery blood gas than those delivered after 30\u00a0min (pH\u00a07.23 and pH\u00a07.20, p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.0001). Secondary outcome was not associated with twin-to-twin delivery interval time. The combined vaginal-cesarean delivery rate was 6.6% (n\u2009=\u200935) and the rate was higher with twin-to-twin delivery interval\u2009>\u2009\u00a030\u00a0min (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.0001).\nAn association, but not necessarily a causality, between twin-to-twin delivery interval and primary outcome was seen. An upper time limit on twin-to-twin delivery time intervals may be justified. However, the optimal time interval needs further studies.",

    "abstract": "Use or abuse of opioids and related drugs during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and neonatal morbidities, including increased susceptibility to Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). Severity of NAS is determined by both environmental and genetic factors, but the level of influence each one of them has in determining the severity of NAS is not fully understood. Since the incidence and severity of NAS vary a lot among susceptible infants, twin studies might give us valuable insights into understanding the relative roles of environmental and genetic factors at the onset of the disease and during its progression. Higher concordance of occurrence and severity of NAS in monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins would suggest a genetic role in the pathogenesis of NAS. However, comparable concordance suggests a non-genetic or an environmental basis. In this case series, we report neonatal outcomes including severity of NAS among monozygotic and dizygotic twins.\nA retrospective chart review was performed for all newborn twins who were at risk of developing NAS, were born in our institution between January 2006 and December 2014, and had a gestational age of 30\u2009weeks or greater.\nDuring the study period, we identified seven sets (total of 14 infants) of eligible twins, comprising six dizygotic and one monozygotic twins, from a total of 550 infants who were at risk of developing NAS. Among the seven sets of twins, two sets were concordant for severe NAS and required pharmacological management, three sets of twins were concordant in not having severe NAS and did not require pharmacological management, and the remaining two sets were discordant, where one of the twins required pharmacological treatment.\nFive of the seven sets of twins in our study exhibited concordance and two sets showed discordance in withdrawal severity. Larger studies may help in understanding the roles of genetic and environmental factors in determining the severity of NAS.",

    "abstract": "While both genes and environment contribute to phenotype, deciphering environmental contributions to phenotype is a challenge. Furthermore, elucidating how different phenotypes may share similar environmental etiologies also is challenging. One way to identify environmental influences is through a discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin study design. Here, we assessed differential gene expression in MZ discordant twin pairs (affected vs. non-affected) for seven phenotypes, including chronic fatigue syndrome, obesity, ulcerative colitis, major depressive disorder, intermittent allergic rhinitis, physical activity, and intelligence quotient, comparing the spectrum of genes differentially expressed across seven phenotypes individually. Second, we performed meta-analysis for each gene to identify commonalities and differences in gene expression signatures between the seven phenotypes. In our integrative analyses, we found that there may be a common gene expression signature (with small effect sizes) across the phenotypes; however, differences between phenotypes with respect to differentially expressed genes were more prominently featured. Therefore, defining common environmentally induced pathways in phenotypes remains elusive. We make our work accessible by providing a new database (DiscTwinExprDB: http://apps.chiragjpgroup.org/disctwinexprdb/ ) for investigators to study non-genotypic influence on gene expression.",

We aimed to address two questions about smoking and appearance: (1) does facial appearance alone provide an indication of smoking status, and (2) how does smoking affect the attractiveness of faces? We used faces of identical twins discordant for smoking, and prototypes made by averaging the faces of the twins.

Rate of same sex pregnancies and risk factors for both same sex and sex discordant pregnancies.\nA total of 32,600 cycles were reported to SART CORS during this time period. There were 15,143 pregnancies from which 14,888 were singletons (98.3%), 23 sex discordant (0.15%) multiple pregnancies, 226 (1.5%) sex concordant multiple pregnancies, and 6 (0.01%) pregnancies without sex information. When Weinberg's differential rule was applied, the rate of dizygotic pregnancies was calculated to be 18%. Unexplained infertility was found to be the biggest risk factor for sex discordant multiple pregnancies (adjusted odds ratio 4.33, 95% confidence interval 1.4-13.1), followed by elevated body mass index (BMI). The only risk factor found for sex concordant pregnancies was undergoing a fresh transfer (adjusted odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.95).\nElective single ET improves, but does not completely eliminate the risk of multiple pregnancies. Patients should be counseled that there might be up to a \u223c2% risk of multiple pregnancies, of which up to 18% can be dizygotic. Patients with elevated BMI and unexplained fertility may be at higher risk for sex discordant multiple pregnancies and patients undergoing fresh cycles may be at higher risk for sex concordant multiple pregnancies.",

The Twin Congress, formerly held every three years, now takes place biennially with a single-day meeting organized during the off years. This meeting is the largest gathering of scientific twin researchers, medical personnel, and representatives of multiple birth organizations in the world. This overview is followed by reviews of recent twin research and commentary concerning partner aggression, ABO incompatibility in dizygotic twins, growth discordance in a monoamniotic twin pair and twin implantation. The article closes with summaries of timely topics in the media, namely a father's finding of his long-lost twin children, early results from the NASA twin experiment, twin brothers at the center of the October 2017 Las Vegas attack, retired twin airline pilots, and clips from recent films with twin-based themes.",

    "abstract": "This invited review aimed at presenting the evidence concerning neurodevelopmental outcomes, particularly cerebral palsy (CP), motor disability, cognitive impairment, mental retardation, any major disability, blindness and deafness in cases of twins, conceived after in vitro fertilization, presenting fetal/intrauterine growth restriction (FGR/IUGR) or being prematurely born. FGR/IUGR, prematurity and zygosity affect neurodevelopmental outcome; CP is higher in term infants, those presenting with FGR/IUGR, as well as in survivors of intrauterine co-twin death; cognitive ability of twins versus singletons mainly relates to confounding factors, as FGR/IUGR and prematurity, while evidence for differences in behavioral and psychiatric disorders between twins and singletons is limited. The impact of IVF per se has not been documented. Nevertheless, available literature, usually of heterogeneous and retrospective nature, diverges in the criteria for neurodevelopmental delay. Furthermore, differences in selection/exclusion criteria and small mixed cohorts, including the full range of complications, make comparison of the existing studies difficult. Future studies should focus in confirming the lack of IVF impact on twins' neurodevelopment and general health, in comparing long-term outcome of naturally conceived twins with those conceived following assisted reproduction techniques and in including evaluation of individual, longitudinal trajectories of growth, and development. In this respect, worldwide population-based registries will enable more precise description of neurodevelopmental outcomes among twins.",

    "abstract": "There is a need for well-defined language phenotypes suitable for adolescents in twin studies and other large-scale research projects. Rice, Hoffman, and Wexler (2009) have developed a grammatical judgment measure as a clinical marker of language impairment, which has an extended developmental range to adolescence.\nWe conducted the first twin analysis, along with associated phenotypic analyses of validity, of an abridged, 20-item version of this grammatical judgment measure (GJ-20), based on telephone administration using prerecorded stimuli to 405 pairs of 16-year-olds (148 monozygotic and 257 dizygotic) drawn from the Twins Early Development Study (Haworth, Davis, & Plomin, 2012).\nThe distribution of scores is markedly skewed negatively, as expected for a potential clinical marker. Low performance on GJ-20 is associated with lower maternal education, reported learning disability (age 7 years), and low scores on language tests administered via the Twins Early Development Study (age 16 years) as well as General Certificate of Secondary Education English and Math examination performance (age 16 years). Liability threshold estimates for the genetic influence on low performance on GJ-20 are substantial, ranging from 36% with a lowest 10% criterion to 74% for a lowest 5% criterion.\nThe heritability of GJ-20 scores, especially at more extreme cutoffs, along with the score distribution and association with other indicators of language impairments, provides additional evidence for the potential value of this measure as a clinical marker of specific language impairment.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between preterm birth in a prior pregnancy and preterm birth in a twin pregnancy.\nWe performed a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial evaluating 17-\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in twins. Women were classified as nulliparous, multiparous with a prior term birth, or multiparous with a prior preterm birth. We used logistic regression to examine the odds of spontaneous preterm birth of twins before 35 weeks according to past obstetric history.\nOf the 653 women analyzed, 294 were nulliparas, 310 had a prior term birth, and 49 had a prior preterm birth. Prior preterm birth increased the likelihood of spontaneous delivery before 35 weeks (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-4.66), whereas prior term delivery decreased these odds (aOR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38-0.78) in the current twin pregnancy compared with the nulliparous reference group. This translated into a lower odds of composite neonatal morbidity (aOR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.27-0.53) for women with a prior term delivery.\nFor women carrying twins, a history of preterm birth increases the odds of spontaneous preterm birth, whereas a prior term birth decreases odds of spontaneous preterm birth and neonatal morbidity for the current twin pregnancy. These results offer risk stratification and reassurance for clinicians.",

    "abstract": "To investigate risk factors and pregnancy outcome of spontaneous vs in-vitro fertilization (IVF) twins complicated with preeclampsia.\nA retrospective population-based cohort study comparing maternal and neonatal outcome in IVF vs spontaneously conceived twins was conducted. Deliveries occurred in a tertiary medical center between the years 1988 and 2010. Women who conceived after ovulation induction and those with chronic hypertension were excluded from the study. Multiple logistic regression models were used to control for confounders.\nThe study population included 4428 twin pregnancies, of these 314 (7.1%) had preeclampsia; 64 (20.3%) were IVF twins and 250 (79.7%) were spontaneous twins. Preeclampsia was more common in IVF compare to spontaneous twins (13.8 vs 7.6%, OR\u00a0=\u00a01.81, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.50-2.17, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The mothers of IVF twins were significantly older, and were more likely to be nulliparous. The rate of cesarean delivery was higher among IVF twins. The mean gestational age at delivery and the mean birth weight were significantly lower in IVF twins. While controlling for confounders using a multivariate analysis, IVF was found as an independent risk factor for preterm delivery in twin pregnancies with preeclampsia. However, there was no difference in the perinatal mortality or 5\u00a0min Apgar scores < 7 between the two groups.\nPreeclampsia is more common in IVF twins compared to spontaneous twin pregnancies. IVF twins with preeclampsia are at an increased risk for cesarean delivery, preterm delivery and low birth weight.",

    "abstract": "Lung function is an important predictor of morbidity and mortality, with accelerated lung function decline reported to have immense consequences for the world's healthcare systems. The lung function decline across individual's lifetime is a consequence of age-related changes in lung anatomical structure and combination of various environmental factors; however, the exact molecular mechanisms contributing to this decline are not fully understood. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that changes across individual's lifetime, as well as allows for interplay between environmental and genetic factors. DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulation of gene expression, with increasing evidence linking aberrant DNA methylation levels with a number of common human diseases. In this study, we investigated possible associations between genome-wide DNA methylation levels and lung function in 169 pairs of middle-aged monozygotic twins (86 male pairs: mean age (min-max)\u2009=\u200966\u00a0years (57-79); 83 female pairs: mean age (min-max)\u2009=\u200966\u00a0years (56-78)). The twins were collected from the Danish Twin Registry and were examined at baseline (1998-1999) and follow-up (2008-2011) visits. Using the twin design, we correlated intra-pair differences in cross-sectional and longitudinal lung function with intra-pair blood DNA methylation differences at follow-up by linear regression analyses adjusted for sex, age, BMI, smoking, and blood cell composition measured for each individual with the use of flow cytometry.\nWe identified several differentially methylated CpG sites associated with forced expiratory volume the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Three probes identified for level of FVC were located in \nOur findings suggest that\u00a0epigenetic regulation of immunological- and cancer-related genes, as well as TGF-\u03b2-receptor-related genes, may be involved in the cross-sectional level and longitudinal change in lung function in middle-aged monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Distinction of one twin with respect to the other, based on external appearance, is challenging; nevertheless, facial morphology may provide individualizing features that may help distinguish twin siblings. This study aims at exposing an innovative method for the facial assessment in monozygotic twins for personal identification, based on the registration and comparison of 3D models of faces. Ten couples of monozygotic twins aged between 25 and 69\u202fyears were acquired twice by a stereophotogrammetric system (VECTRA-3D\u00ae M3: Canfield Scientific, Inc., Fairfield, NJ); the 3D reconstruction of each person was then registered and superimposed onto the model belonging to the same person (self-matches), the corresponding sibling (twin-matches) and to unrelated participants from the other couples (miss-matches); RMS (root mean square) point-to-point distances were automatically calculated for all the 220 superimpositions. One-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the differences among miss-matches, twin-matches and self-matches (p\u202f<\u202f.05). RMS values for self-matches, twin-matches and miss-matches were respectively 1.0\u202fmm (SD: 0.3\u202fmm), 1.9\u202fmm (0.5\u202fmm) and 3.4\u202fmm (0.70\u202fmm). Statistically significant differences were found among the three groups (p\u202f<\u202f.01). Comparing RMS values in the three groups, mean facial variability in twin siblings was 55.9% of that assessed between unrelated persons and about twice higher than that observed between models belonging to the same individual. The present study proposed an innovative method for the facial assessment of twin siblings, based on 3D surface analysis, which may provide additional information concerning the relation between genes and environment.",

    "abstract": "Our study analyzed lymphocyte subpopulations of 32 monozygotic twins and compared the level of the catalytic reverse transcriptase protein subunit (hTERT) in T lymphocytes (Tly), helper- (Th), cytotoxic- (Tc) and regulatory T cell (Treg) subgroups. Four variables related to telomere and mitochondrial biology were simultaneously assessed, applying multi-parametric flow cytometry, TRAP-ELISA assay and qPCR standard curve method on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples of genetically matched individuals. Twin data of telomerase activity (TA), hTERT protein level, telomere length (TL) and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) were analyzed for co-twin similarity. The present study has provided novel information by demonstrating very high intraclass correlation (ICC) of hTERT protein level in T lymphocytes (0.891) and in both Th (0.896), Treg (0.885) and Tc (0.798) cell subgroups. When comparing results measured from PBMCs, intraclass correlation was also high for telomere length (0.815) and considerable for mtDNA copy number (0.524), and again exceptionally high for the rate-limiting telomerase subunit, hTERT protein level (0.946). In contrast, telomerase activity showed no co-twin similarity (ICC 0). By comparing relative amounts of hTERT protein levels in different lymphocyte subgroups of twin subjects, in Treg cells significantly higher level could be detected compared to Tly, Th or Tc cell subgroups. This is the first study that simultaneously analyzed co-twin similarity in MZ twins for the above four variables and alongside assessed their relationship, whereby positive association was found between TL and mtDNAcn.",

    "abstract": "Adult height is a function of genetic predispositions and environmental influences during childhood. Hence, any variation in height among monozygotic twins, who share genetic predispositions, is bound to reflect differences in their environmental exposure. Therefore, a height premium in earnings among monozygotic twins also reflects such exposure. In this study, we analyze the height premium over the life cycle among Swedish twins, 10,000 of whom are monozygotic. The premium is relatively constant over the life cycle, amounting to 5-6% higher earnings per decimeter for men and less for women, suggesting that environmental conditions in childhood and youth affect earnings over most of the adult life course. The premium is larger below median height for men and above median height for young women. The estimates are similar for monozygotic and dizygotic twins, indicating that environmentally and genetically induced height differences are similarly associated with earnings.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to assess, in a population of dichorionic twin pregnancies with selective growth restriction, the effect of inter-twin differences by use of Doppler velocimetry and fetal growth discordancy on perinatal outcomes.\nThis was a retrospective study including dichorionic twin pregnancies from January 2008 to December 2015 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Fondazione MBBM. Only dichorionic twin pregnancies affected by selective intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) delivering at \u226524 weeks were included in the study.\nWe found that twin pregnancies with inter-twin estimated fetal weight (EFW) discordance \u226515% were significantly associated with a higher risk of preterm delivery before 32 (P=0.004) and 34 weeks (P=0.04). Similarly, twin pregnancies with inter-twin abdominal circumference (AC) discordance \u226530\u00b0 centiles were associated with a higher rate of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (P=0.02), neonatal resuscitation (P=0.02) and adverse neonatal composite outcome (P=0.04). Of interest, when comparing twin pregnancies according to Doppler study, growth restricted twins had a higher rate of composite neonatal outcome and in multivariate analysis, an abnormal Doppler was an independent risk factor for this outcome.\nOur study associated growth discrepancy with specific pregnancy outcomes, according to defined cut-offs. In addition, we demonstrated that an abnormal umbilical artery Doppler is independently associated with a composite neonatal adverse outcome in growth restricted fetuses.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we determined that genetic and environmental factors contributed equally towards rosacea in twins. To assess an environmental factor, we characterized the malar cheek bacterial microbiome from twins discordant for rosacea. We found no significant difference in facial microbiome alpha and beta diversity between related twins discordant for rosacea. However, the relative percentage abundance of Gordonia and Geobacillus, low-abundant genera, was positively and negatively associated with rosacea severity, respectively. Our data demonstrate a significant correlation between facial microbiome and severity of rosacea in genetically matched twins and importantly that overall microbiome composition is largely unchanged.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins participate in research that partitions variance in health, disease, and behavior into genetic and environmental components. However, there are other innovative roles for twins in medical research. One such way is involving MZ and/or DZ twins in co-twin control-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To our knowledge, no reviews have been conducted that summarizes the involvement of twins in RCTs. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature search using the U.S. Clinical Trials Database, NHS electronic databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO for RCTs on publications involving MZ and/or DZ twins as RCT participants. Out of the 186,027 clinical trials registered in the U.S. clinical trial register ClinicaTrails.gov, only six RCTs used twins as participants. From 1,598 articles identified in our search, 50 peer-reviewed English language publications met our pre-defined inclusion criteria. Sample sizes for RCTs have ranged from a total number of participants from 2 to 1,162; however, 32 (64%) studies had a sample size of 100 or less, and of those, 12 (24%) had fewer than 10. Both MZ and DZ twins have been recruited to the RCTs. In most instances (33/50) each twin from a pair were assigned to different study arms. Most of those studies included MZ twins only. Despite the methodological advantages, the use of MZ and DZ twins as participants in interventional RCTs appeared limited. The continuous development of innovative twin designs, especially RCTs, indicates that twin research can extend beyond the more widely recognized heritability estimates.",

    "abstract": "To examine the association between exposure to surgery and 10-year change in cognitive functioning.\nAmong 2351 middle-aged twins, a 10-year change in composite cognitive scores derived from five cognitive tests was compared between 903 (38%) twins exposed to surgery classified as major, minor, knee and hip replacement, and other, and a reference group of 1448 (62%) twins without surgery, using linear regression models adjusted for socioeconomic factors. Genetic and shared environmental confounding was addressed in intrapair analyses of 48 monozygotic and 74 dizygotic same-sexed twin pairs.\nIn individual-level analyses, twins with major surgery (mean difference,\u00a0-0.37; 95% CI,\u00a0-0.76 to 0.02) or knee and hip replacement surgery (mean difference,\u00a0-0.54; 95% CI,\u00a0-1.30 to 0.22) had a tendency of a negligibly higher rate of decline in cognitive score than the reference group. In the intrapair analyses, the surgery-exposed twin had a higher rate of cognitive decline than the co-twin in 55% (95% CI, 45% to 63%) of the pairs. The mean difference in cognitive decline within pairs was\u00a0-0.21 (95% CI,\u00a0-0.81 to 0.39).\nNo significant associations were found between exposure to surgery and change in cognitive score either in individual-level or in intrapair analyses.",

    "abstract": "To create antenatal gender-specific reference growth charts in uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic twins.\nThis is a prospective longitudinal study in which uncomplicated monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies were included from 23 + 4 weeks of gestation onwards. Estimated fetal weight (EFW) and biometric parameters (biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length) were evaluated in both fetuses every 2 weeks using standardized methodology. Maternal and fetal complications were excluded. Charts were fitted for each biometric parameter and EFW in relation to gestational age and fetal gender using multilevel mixed models.\nThe final analysis included a total of 456 ultrasound examinations in 62 MC twins, with a mean of 7 scans per pregnancy (range 5-8). The mean as well as 5th and 95th percentiles of each biometric parameter and EFW were adjusted in relation to gender and gestational age between 24 and 37 weeks of gestation. Male fetuses have higher reference values than females, and the disparity is larger in the upper centiles of the distribution.\nWe provide gender-specific reference growth charts for MC twins. We suggest that these charts will improve prenatal MC twin assessment and surveillance, with a more accurate classification of normal or growth-restricted fetuses adjusted per sex.",

Possible confounding effects of twinning and zygosity, evident at 2 years, were investigated among other possible predictors of outcomes.\nThe population-based twin sample included 627 twin pairs and 1 twin without a co-twin (197 monozygotic and 431 dizygotic), 610 boys and 645 girls, 1,255 children in total. Nine phenotypes from the same comprehensive direct behavioral assessment protocol were investigated at 4 and 6 years of age. Twinning effects were estimated for each phenotype at each age using general linear mixed models using maximum likelihood.\nTwinning effects decreased from 4 to 6 years; zygosity effects disappeared by 6 years. Heritability increased from 4 to 6 years across all 9 phenotypes, and the heritability estimates were higher than reported previously, in the range of .44-.92 at 6 years. The highest estimate, .92, was for the clinical grammar marker.\nAcross multiple dimensions of speech, language, and nonverbal cognition, heritability estimates are robust. A finiteness marker of grammar shows the highest inherited influences in this early period of children's language acquisition.",

Our twins had a similar onset with the same genetic inheritance, with the same risk factors, with the same comorbidities and with the same treatment.

    "abstract": "Usually, cold working strengthen metals and alloys by introducing large population of dislocations, whereas annealing of cold worked metal recovers the structure, annihilates dislocations, forms new strain-free grains, and results loss of strength. Here, we report annealing-hardening at temperature well below stress relieving and recrystallization temperatures in contrast to the typical behavior. A large amount of structural defects, such as dislocations, grain boundaries, twins, and stacking faults, have been introduced in nanostructured \u03b1-brass by cryorolling. The interaction and rearrangement of these defects upon annealing at 165-200\u2009\u00b0C have been monitored at an interval of 1\u2009minute. Large increase of the yield strength up to 578\u2009MPa has been achieved in annealed specimens, which is 23% higher than that of as-cryorolled, and 425% higher than that of as-cast brass due to the evolution of nano-twins. Our approach shows a new avenue on strengthening fcc crystals by incorporating annealing induced nano-twins.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that cervical incompetence and associated preterm birth confers greater morbidity and mortality on birth outcomes, with an additional increased risk of cervical incompetence in higher order gestations. While the pathophysiology of cervical incompetence has yet to be elucidated, research has identified risk factors and assessed outcomes of numerous interventions. Cervical cerclage has been shown, in certain situations involving singleton pregnancies, to improve outcomes. Conversely, rescue cerclage increases the risk of preterm birth in twin gestations. However, these studies did not consider the unique situation of infertile patients, with known cervical incompetence, who have utilized assisted reproductive technologies to attain pregnancy. This study aims to describe the outcomes of infertile patients with known cervical incompetence, carrying twin gestation, who have undergone cervical cerclage.\nThis case series includes eight infertile patients who have cervical incompetence resulting in fetal loss between 20-24 weeks after in vitro fertilization embryo transfer (IVF-ET). These patients continued with IVF treatments and subsequently conceived twins. All patients underwent prophylactic cervical cerclage placement before 12 weeks. The outcomes of these pregnancies are reviewed.\nAll pregnancies resulted in the delivery of viable twins. Six of the eight pregnancies (75%) were carried beyond 34 weeks. One pregnancy delivered at 31 weeks and one pregnancy delivered at 25 weeks after placental abruption.\nThis data suggest that the use of prophylactic cervical cerclage may be beneficial in improving reproductive outcomes in infertile patients with known cervical incompetence that subsequently conceived twin gestations via IVF-ET treatment.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common birth defects. More than 200 susceptibility loci have been identified for CHDs, yet a large part of the genetic risk factors remain unexplained. Monozygotic (MZ) twins are thought to be completely genetically identical; however, discordant phenotypes have been found in MZ twins. Recent studies have demonstrated genetic differences between MZ twins. We aimed to test whether copy number variants (CNVs) and/or genetic mutation differences play a role in the etiology of CHDs by using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays and whole exome sequencing of twin pairs discordant for CHDs. Our goal was to identify mutations present only in the affected twins, which could identify novel candidates for CHD susceptibility loci. We present a comprehensive analysis for the CNVs and genetic mutation results of the selected individuals but detected no consistent differences within the twin pairs. Our study confirms that chromosomal structure or genetic mutation differences do not seem to play a role in the MZ twins discordant for CHD.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins are valuable in assessing the genetic vs environmental contribution to diseases. In the era of complete genome sequences, they allow identification of mutational mechanisms and specific genes and pathways that offer predisposition to the development of complex diseases including schizophrenia.\nWe sequenced the complete genomes of two pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia (MZD), including one representing a family tetrad. The family specific complete sequences have allowed identification of post zygotic mutations between MZD genomes. It allows identification of affected genes including relevant network and pathways that may account for the diseased state in pair specific patient.\nWe found multiple twin specific sequence differences between co-twins that included small nucleotides [single nucleotide variants (SNV), small indels and block substitutions], copy number variations (CNVs) and structural variations. The genes affected by these changes belonged to a number of canonical pathways, the most prominent ones are implicated in schizophrenia and related disorders. Although these changes were found in both twins, they were more frequent in the affected twin in both pairs. Two specific pathway defects, glutamate receptor signaling and dopamine feedback in cAMP signaling pathways, were uniquely affected in the two patients representing two unrelated families.\nWe have identified genome-wide post zygotic mutations in two MZD pairs affected with schizophrenia. It has allowed us to use the threshold model and propose the most likely cause of this disease in the two patients studied. The results support the proposition that each schizophrenia patient may be unique and heterogeneous somatic de novo events may contribute to schizophrenia threshold and discordance of the disease in monozygotic twins.",

    "results": "We found multiple twin specific sequence differences between co-twins that included small nucleotides [single nucleotide variants (SNV), small indels and block substitutions], copy number variations (CNVs) and structural variations. The genes affected by these changes belonged to a number of canonical pathways, the most prominent ones are implicated in schizophrenia and related disorders. Although these changes were found in both twins, they were more frequent in the affected twin in both pairs. Two specific pathway defects, glutamate receptor signaling and dopamine feedback in cAMP signaling pathways, were uniquely affected in the two patients representing two unrelated families.",

    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been generated from patients with various forms of disease, including Danon disease (DD); however, few reports exist regarding disease-specific iPSCs derived from clinically divergent monozygotic twins.\nWe examined the characteristics of iPSCs and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) generated from clinically divergent monozygotic female twins with DD.\nWe generated iPSCs derived from T-cells isolated from clinically divergent, 18-year-old female twins with DD harboring a mutation in LAMP2 at the intron 6 splice site (IVS6+1_4delGTGA). Two divergent populations of iPSCs could prepare from each twin despite of their clinical divergence: one with wild-type LAMP2 expression (WT-iPSCs) and a second with mutant LAMP2 expression (MT-iPSCs). The iPSCs were differentiated into iPSC-CMs and then autophagy failure was observed only in MT-iPSC-CMs by electron microscopy, tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3 analysis, and LC3-II western blotting. Under these conditions, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) was determined by PCR for the (CAG)n repeat in the androgen receptor gene, revealing an extremely skewed XCI pattern with the inactivated paternal wild-type and maternal mutant X-chromosomes in MT-iPSCs and WT-iPSCs, respectively, from each twin.\nRegardless of their clinical differences, we successfully established two sets of iPSC lines that expressed either wild-type or mutant LAMP2 allele from each monozygotic twin with DD, of which only the populations expressing mutant LAMP2 showed autophagic failure.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of twin pregnancies has increased steadily for the last 40\u00a0years due to assisted reproductive technology and increased maternal childbearing age. Multiple pregnancies, especially monochorionic twin pregnancies, carry a high risk for the mother and the fetuses and require close follow-up. Twins are exposed to a higher risk of perinatal anoxia, in utero fetal demise, preterm birth, congenital malformations, fetal growth restriction, and vascular complications. Compared to singletons, twins are at higher risk of perinatal mortality and impaired neurodevelopmental outcome, justifying a thorough follow-up by pediatricians, including assessment and management of familial and psychosocial impact. This paper discusses the epidemiological, obstetrical, and genetic issues raised by twin pregnancies and reviews the data on the perinatal and neurological long-term outcomes of twins, as well as the psychosocial impact of multiple births on twins and their families.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate cheiloscopic patterns among monozygotic twins (MT), non-twin siblings (NTS) and unrelated individuals (UI). The sample consisted of 20 pairs of monozygotic twins (G1), 20 pairs of non-twin siblings (G2) and 20 pairs of unrelated individuals (G3). Lip thickness, commissures and grooves were evaluated and the latter were classified as: I - clear-cut vertical grooves; I' - incomplete vertical grooves; II - branched grooves; III - intersecting; IV - reticular grooves and V - undetermined, in 8 labial regions (sub-quadrants). The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, with a 5% significance level. Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Kappa coefficient, with a 95% confidence interval, were employed to check for agreement rates between G1, G2 and G3 pairs. There was a weak correlation for lip thickness (<0.90) in the total group, with higher values in G1 (CCC from 0.25 to 0.83 and from 0.34 to 0.86, upper and lower lips, respectively), followed by G2 (CCC from -0.03 to 0.70 and from -0.21 to 0.62, upper and lower lips, respectively) and G3 (CCC from -0.25 to 0.56 and from -0.38 to 0.34, upper and lower lips, respectively). With regard to labial commissures, Kappa statistic values were found to be 1.00 for G1, 0.45 for G2 and -0.24 for G3. As for the main groove pattern by sub-quadrant, Kappa values ranged from 0.48 to 0.87 for G1, from 0.17 to 0.59 for G2, and from -0.18 to 0.19 for G3. Monozygotic twins presented a relevant percentage of cheiloscopic agreements. Similarities were also found among NTS, while UI showed greater differences compared to their pairs, highlighting the influence of hereditary relationships on inherited cheiloscopic features.",

    "abstract": "Childhood gender nonconformity (femininity in males, masculinity in females) predicts a nonstraight (gay, lesbian, or bisexual) sexual orientation in adulthood. In previous work, nonstraight twins reported more childhood gender nonconformity than their genetically identical, but straight, cotwins. However, self-reports could be biased. We therefore assessed gender nonconformity via ratings of photographs from childhood and adulthood. These ratings came from independent observers na\u00efve to study hypotheses. Identical twins with discordant sexual orientations (24 male pairs, 32 female pairs) visibly differed in their gender nonconformity from mid-childhood, with higher levels of gender nonconformity observed in the nonstraight twins. This difference was smaller than the analogous difference between identical twins who were concordant straight (4 male pairs, 11 female pairs) and identical twins unrelated to them who were concordant nonstraight (19 male pairs, 8 female pairs). Further, twins in discordant pairs correlated in their observer-rated gender nonconformity. Nongenetic factors likely differentiated the discordant twins' gender-related characteristics in childhood, but shared influences made them similar in some respects. We further tested how recall of past rejection from others related to gender nonconformity. Rejection generally increased with gender nonconformity, but this effect varied by the twins' sexual orientation. (PsycINFO Database Record",

    "abstract": "In the present case study, we investigated possible emotional connectedness between monozygotic twins by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During the experimental condition, Twin 2 was randomly selected to participate in the neuroimaging protocol while Twin 1 participated in the experimental condition outside the MRI scanner (none of them was aware of the experimental procedure). The experimental condition included two sessions with visual and acoustic stimuli, respectively. Between the two experimental conditions, there was a 2-min break with Twin 1 (i.e., the subject outside the scanner) relaxing with eyes closed. Data analysis revealed significant brain activation in three regions, namely left orbitofrontal gyrus (during visual condition) and left cingulum and precentral gyrus (during the acoustic condition). Our findings denote emotional connectedness between a pair of monozygotic twins using fMRI. Further studies in larger sample sizes are needed to investigate if this is a generalized and systematic phenomenon or an incidental finding.",

    "abstract": "Numerous cross-sectional and observational longitudinal studies show associations between expertise and regional brain anatomy. However, since these designs confound training with genetic predisposition, the causal role of training remains unclear. Here, we use a discordant monozygotic (identical) twin design to study expertise-dependent effects on neuroanatomy using musical training as model behavior, while essentially controlling for genetic factors and shared environment of upbringing. From a larger cohort of monozygotic twins, we were able to recruit 18 individuals (9 pairs) that were highly discordant for piano practice. We used structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to analyze the auditory-motor network and within-pair differences in cortical thickness, cerebellar regional volumes and white-matter microstructure/fractional anisotropy. The analyses revealed that the musically active twins had greater cortical thickness in the auditory-motor network of the left hemisphere and more developed white matter microstructure in relevant tracts in both hemispheres and the corpus callosum. Furthermore, the volume of gray matter in the left cerebellar region of interest comprising lobules I-IV + V, was greater in the playing group. These findings provide the first clear support for that a significant portion of the differences in brain anatomy between experts and nonexperts depend on causal effects of training.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic management of obesity is challenging, hence further elucidating the underlying mechanisms of obesity development and identifying new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets are urgent and necessary. Here, we performed differential gene expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify significant genes and specific modules related to BMI based on gene expression profile data of 7 discordant monozygotic twins.\nIn the differential gene expression analysis, it appeared that 32 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were with a trend of up-regulation in twins with higher BMI when compared to their siblings. Categories of positive regulation of nitric-oxide synthase biosynthetic process, positive regulation of NF-kappa B import into nucleus, and peroxidase activity were significantly enriched within GO database and NF-kappa B signaling pathway within KEGG database. DEGs of NAMPT, TLR9, PTGS2, HBD, and PCSK1N might be associated with obesity. In the WGCNA, among the total 20 distinct co-expression modules identified, coral1 module (68 genes) had the strongest positive correlation with BMI (r\u2009=\u20090.56, P\u2009=\u20090.04) and disease status (r\u2009=\u20090.56, P\u2009=\u20090.04). Categories of positive regulation of phospholipase activity, high-density lipoprotein particle clearance, chylomicron remnant clearance, reverse cholesterol transport, intermediate-density lipoprotein particle, chylomicron, low-density lipoprotein particle, very-low-density lipoprotein particle, voltage-gated potassium channel complex, cholesterol transporter activity, and neuropeptide hormone activity were significantly enriched within GO database for this module. And alcoholism and cell adhesion molecules pathways were significantly enriched within KEGG database. Several hub genes, such as GAL, ASB9, NPPB, TBX2, IL17C, APOE, ABCG4, and APOC2 were also identified. The module eigengene of saddlebrown module (212 genes) was also significantly correlated with BMI (r\u2009=\u20090.56, P\u2009=\u20090.04), and hub genes of KCNN1 and AQP10 were differentially expressed.\nWe identified significant genes and specific modules potentially related to BMI based on the gene expression profile data of monozygotic twins. The findings may help further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of obesity development and provide novel insights to research potential gene biomarkers and signaling pathways for obesity treatment. Further analysis and validation of the findings reported here are important and necessary when more sample size is acquired.",

    "results": "In the differential gene expression analysis, it appeared that 32 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were with a trend of up-regulation in twins with higher BMI when compared to their siblings. Categories of positive regulation of nitric-oxide synthase biosynthetic process, positive regulation of NF-kappa B import into nucleus, and peroxidase activity were significantly enriched within GO database and NF-kappa B signaling pathway within KEGG database. DEGs of NAMPT, TLR9, PTGS2, HBD, and PCSK1N might be associated with obesity. In the WGCNA, among the total 20 distinct co-expression modules identified, coral1 module (68 genes) had the strongest positive correlation with BMI (r\u2009=\u20090.56, P\u2009=\u20090.04) and disease status (r\u2009=\u20090.56, P\u2009=\u20090.04). Categories of positive regulation of phospholipase activity, high-density lipoprotein particle clearance, chylomicron remnant clearance, reverse cholesterol transport, intermediate-density lipoprotein particle, chylomicron, low-density lipoprotein particle, very-low-density lipoprotein particle, voltage-gated potassium channel complex, cholesterol transporter activity, and neuropeptide hormone activity were significantly enriched within GO database for this module. And alcoholism and cell adhesion molecules pathways were significantly enriched within KEGG database. Several hub genes, such as GAL, ASB9, NPPB, TBX2, IL17C, APOE, ABCG4, and APOC2 were also identified. The module eigengene of saddlebrown module (212 genes) was also significantly correlated with BMI (r\u2009=\u20090.56, P\u2009=\u20090.04), and hub genes of KCNN1 and AQP10 were differentially expressed.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Tumor Protein P63 (TP63)-related disorders are known to present with a range of phenotypic features, including ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, cleft lip/palate, Rapp-Hodgkin, Hay-Wells, and limb-mammary syndromes. We present six individuals from three families, including a set of monozygotic twins, with pathogenic TP63 variants who had novel clinical findings. The twins were discordant for cleft lip and palate, and the type of hand malformations, but concordant for choanal atresia, and bilateral volar nail. Both failed newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to T-cell lymphopenia. The second family included three family members across two generations. Two of these three family members had orofacial clefting, but the remaining child had a laryngeal web and hydrocele with no clefting or hand anomalies, highlighting the variable expressivity in TP63-related disorders. The individual from the third family had unilateral cleft lip and palate, hydronephrosis, and bilateral volar nails. Together, these cases illustrate that: there is significant familial variability, including discordant major but concordant minor anomalies in the first ever reported set of molecularly confirmed monozygotic twins with pathogenic variants in TP63; pathogenic variants in TP63 should be considered in individuals with volar nail, which was previously only strongly associated with 4q34 deletion syndrome; and failed SCID newborn screening due to abnormal immune functioning may be part of the phenotypic spectrum of TP63-related disorders, as it was reported in one prior individual and two of the individuals in our case series.",

    "abstract": "Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is a promising measure of long-term hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Previous research has suggested an association between HCC and psychological variables, and initial studies of inter-individual variance in HCC have implicated genetic factors. However, whether HCC and psychological variables share genetic risk factors remains unclear. The aims of the present twin study were to: (i) assess the heritability of HCC; (ii) estimate the phenotypic and genetic correlation between HPA axis activity and the psychological variables perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and neuroticism; using formal genetic twin models and molecular genetic methods, i.e. polygenic risk scores (PRS). HCC was measured in 671 adolescents and young adults. These included 115 monozygotic and 183 dizygotic twin-pairs. For 432 subjects PRS scores for plasma cortisol, major depression, and neuroticism were calculated using data from large genome wide association studies. The twin model revealed a heritability for HCC of 72%. No significant phenotypic or genetic correlation was found between HCC and the three psychological variables of interest. PRS did not explain variance in HCC. The present data suggest that HCC is highly heritable. However, the data do not support a strong biological link between HCC and any of the investigated psychological variables.",

    "abstract": "Twin research has offered evidence that monozygotic (MZ) twins are more socially close than dizygotic (DZ) twins, but has not paid much attention to the way twins compare themselves with their co-twin. The few studies in this area suggest that 'horizontal comparisons' (social comparison motivated by solidarity or communion with others) matter more for MZ twins than for DZ twins, at least when the co-twin is the social comparison standard. Consistent with this view, we predicted higher interest in MZ twins relative to DZ twins to select their co-twin rather than other people in general as the social comparison standard. The Social Comparison Orientation (SCO) scale, which measures the inclination to compare with others in a horizontal rather than vertical mode (comparing either upward or downward), was administered in 90 MZ pairs and 57 same-sex DZ pairs (63% female; average age 18.06 years) from the Netherlands Twin Register. MZ twin pairs showed significantly higher SCO scores than DZ twin pairs (with a large effect size) on the co-twin SCO, whereas the two groups did not differ from each other on the general SCO excluding the co-twin as social comparison standard. In MZ twin pairs, anxiety was associated with social comparison with others in general, not with their co-twin. For both scales, twin resemblance was explained by additive genetic variance. The present findings provide direct evidence that horizontal comparisons with the co-twin are of particular importance for MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) therapy on short-term neonatal outcomes in preterm twins, and further document the influence of the ACS-to-delivery interval.\nEPIPAGE-2 is a nationwide observational multicentre prospective cohort study of neonates born between 22 and 34 completed weeks of gestation.\nAll French maternity units, except in a single administrative region, between March and December\u00a02011.\nA total of 750 twin neonates born between 24 and 31\u00a0weeks of gestation.\nExposure to ACSs was examined in four groups: single complete course, with an ACS administration-to-delivery interval of \u22647\u00a0days; single complete course, with an ACS-to-delivery interval of >7\u00a0days; repeated courses; or no ACS treatment.\nNeonatal outcomes analysed were severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia or intraventricular haemorrhage grade\u00a0III/IV, in-hospital mortality, and a composite indicator of severe outcomes.\nCompared with no ACSs, in multivariable analysis, a single course of ACSs with an administration-to-delivery interval of \u22647\u00a0days was significantly associated with a reduced rate of periventricular leukomalacia or intraventricular haemorrhage grade\u00a0III/IV (aOR 0.2; CI 95% 0.1-0.5), in-hospital mortality (0.3; 0.1-0.6), and the composite indicator (0.1; 0.1-0.3), whereas a single course of ACDs with an administration-to-delivery interval of >7\u00a0days did not significantly reduce the frequency of in-hospital mortality (0.7; 0.3-1.8). No significant differences in terms of benefit or risk were found when comparing repeated courses with a single complete course.\nIn preterm twins, a single complete course of antenatal corticosteroids was associated with an improvement of severe neurological outcome, whereas reduced in-hospital mortality was seen only when the ACS-to-delivery interval was \u22647\u00a0days.\nA single complete course of antenatal steroids reduced severe neurological morbidity in preterm twins (24-31\u00a0weeks).",

    "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is a skin disease with a multifactorial and complex pathology. While several twin studies have estimated that acne has a heritability of up to 80%, the genomic elements responsible for the origin and pathology of acne are still undiscovered. Here we performed a twin-based structural equation model, using available data on acne severity for an Australian sample of 4,491 twins and their siblings aged from 10 to 24. This study extends by a factor of 3 an earlier analysis of the genetic factors of acne. Acne severity was rated by nurses on a 4-point scale (1 = absent to 4 = severe) on up to three body sites (face, back, chest) and on up to three occasions (age 12, 14, and 16). The phenotype that we analyzed was the most severe rating at any site or age. The polychoric correlation for monozygotic twins was higher (r MZ = 0.86, 95% CI [0.81, 0.90]) than for dizygotic twins (r DZ = 0.42, 95% CI [0.35, 0.47]). A model that includes additive genetic effects and unique environmental effects was the most parsimonious model to explain the genetic variance of acne severity, and the estimated heritability was 0.85 (95% CI [0.82, 0.87]). We then conducted a genome-wide analysis including an additional 271 siblings - for a total of 4,762 individuals. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) scan did not detect loci associated with the severity of acne at the threshold of 5E-08 but suggestive association was found for three SNPs: rs10515088 locus 5q13.1 (p = 3.9E-07), rs12738078 locus 1p35.5 (p = 6.7E-07), and rs117943429 locus 18q21.2 (p = 9.1E-07). The 5q13.1 locus is close to PIK3R1, a gene that has a potential regulatory effect on sebocyte differentiation.",

    "abstract": "A case report of monozygotic (MZ) twins with Crouzon syndrome was previously published to highlight variables in clinical presentation. The postnatal and epigenetic causes for this variation are not well understood. An 8-year follow-up discusses their pertinent clinic course with consideration of genetic and nongenetic variables. The phenotypic and symptomatic obstacles encountered since their initial assessment are reviewed, and the use of three-dimensional Medical Modeling (Golden, CO) as a preoperative planning strategy is addressed. Analyzing the longitudinal clinical course of MZ twins with syndromic craniosynostosis will help better predict and provide optimal treatment.",

    "abstract": "Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals report higher levels of depression and anxiety than heterosexual people. Genetic factors may be a 'common cause' of sexual minority status and psychological distress. Alternatively, these may be correlated because of non-genetic environmental factors (e.g. minority stressors). This study investigated minority stressors and distress in monozygotic twins discordant for sexual minority status. This design provides a test of the role of non-shared environmental factors while minimizing differences due to genetics.\nThirty-eight twin pairs in which one was heterosexual and the other was LGB completed a survey. Differences between twin pairs in minority stressors, rumination, psychological distress, and gender non-conformity were examined. Associations between these variables were also tested.\nAlthough there were no significant group differences for distress, LGB twins had higher rumination, a vulnerability factor for distress, than heterosexual co-twins. LGB twins also had higher scores than heterosexual co-twins on expectations of rejection, active concealment, self-stigma, prejudice events, childhood gender non-conformity, and lower scores on sexual orientation disclosure. Differences between twin pairs in rumination were positively associated with differences in acceptance concerns and self-stigma. Finally, self-stigma was positively associated with rumination in the full sample of heterosexual co-twins and microaggressions were positively associated with rumination when looking at exclusively heterosexual co-twins.\nThese results support environmental factors as a causal explanation for disparities in rumination between LGB and heterosexual individuals. These factors likely include minority stressors. Rumination may also be associated with minority stressors in heterosexual MZ co-twins of LGB individuals.",

    "abstract": "The ABCD twin study will elucidate the genetic and environmental contributions to a wide range of mental and physical health outcomes in children, including substance use, brain and behavioral development, and their interrelationship. Comparisons within and between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, further powered by multiple assessments, provide information about genetic and environmental contributions to developmental associations, and enable stronger tests of causal hypotheses, than do comparisons involving unrelated children. Thus a sub-study of 800 pairs of same-sex twins was embedded within the overall Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) design. The ABCD Twin Hub comprises four leading centers for twin research in Minnesota, Colorado, Virginia, and Missouri. Each site is enrolling 200 twin pairs, as well as singletons. The twins are recruited from registries of all twin births in each State during 2006-2008. Singletons at each site are recruited following the same school-based procedures as the rest of the ABCD study. This paper describes the background and rationale for the ABCD twin study, the ascertainment of twin pairs and implementation strategy at each site, and the details of the proposed analytic strategies to quantify genetic and environmental influences and test hypotheses critical to the aims of the ABCD study.",

    "abstract": "Findings from twin studies of musical interests and talent are reviewed as a backdrop to the lives and careers of twin jazz musicians, Peter and Will Anderson. The Anderson twins exemplify many aspects of twin research, namely their matched musical abilities, shared musical interests, and common career. This overview is followed by reviews of studies and case reports of bereavement in families who have lost a preterm multiple birth infant, the conception of conjoined twins following in vitro fertilization (IVF), depression in fathers of twins, and twin-to-twin transfusion incidence in monochorionic-diamniotic IVF twin pairs. Twins highlighted in the media include high-achieving identical female twins with nearly identical academic standing, tennis star Roger Federer's two sets of identical twin children, surgical separation of craniopagus conjoined twins, and the rare delivery of twins to a 23-year-old giant panda.",

    "abstract": "According to kin selection theory, indirect reproductive advantages may induce individuals to care for others with whom they share genes by common descent, and the amount of care, including self-sacrifice, will increase with the proportion of genes shared. Twins represent a natural situation in which this hypothesis can be tested. Twin pairs experience the same early environment because they were born and raised at the same time and in the same family but their genetic relatedness differs depending on zygosity. We compared the degree of willingness to fight and sacrifice for the co-twin among monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) pairs in a sample of 1443 same-sex and opposite-sex twins. We also analyzed the effect of the subject's gender and that of the co-twin on those altruistic behaviors. Results partly supported the postulated explanation. MZ twins (who share nearly their entire genome) were significantly more likely than DZ twins (who on average share half of their segregating genes) to self-sacrifice for their co-twins, but zygosity did not affect willingness to fight for him/her. The genders of the subject and of the co-twin, not genetic relatedness, were the best predictors of aggressive altruistic intentions.",

    "abstract": "Handedness differentiates patterns of neural asymmetry and interhemispheric connectivity in cortical systems that underpin manual and language functions. Contemporary models of cerebellar function incorporate complex motor behaviour and higher-order cognition, expanding upon earlier, traditional associations between the cerebellum and motor control. Structural MRI defined cerebellar volume asymmetries and correlations with corpus callosum (CC) size were compared in 19 pairs of adult female monozygotic twins strongly discordant for handedness (MZHd). Volume and asymmetry of cerebellar lobules were obtained using automated parcellation.CC area and regional widths were obtained from midsagittal planimetric measurements. Within the cerebellum and CC, neurofunctional distinctions were drawn between motor and higher-order cognitive systems. Relationships amongst regional cerebellar asymmetry and cortical connectivity (as indicated by CC widths) were investigated. Interactions between hemisphere and handedness in the anterior cerebellum were due to a larger right-greater-than-left hemispheric asymmetry in right-handed (RH) compared to left-handed (LH) twins. In LH twins only, anterior cerebellar lobule volumes (IV, V) for motor control were associated with CC size, particularly in callosal regions associated with motor cortex connectivity. Superior posterior cerebellar lobule volumes (VI, Crus I, Crus II, VIIb) showed no correlation with CC size in either handedness group. These novel results reflected distinct patterns of cerebellar-cortical relationships delineated by specific CC regions and an anterior-posterior cerebellar topographical mapping. Hence, anterior cerebellar asymmetry may contribute to the greater degree of bilateral cortical organisation of frontal motor function in LH individuals.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to study the global DNA Methylation in monozygotic (MZ) twins with cerebral palsy. Two pairs of twins (a cerebral palsy children, a normal child) admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were selected as subjects. The phenol-chloroform method was used to extract DNA from venous blood and micro satellite DNA genotyping technique was used to identify the eggs of the twins. DNA methylation fragments were enriched by MBD affinity column chromatography, followed by Solexa sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. In this study, we found that there were different DNA hypermethylation regions between each pair of twins and normal children through global DNA methylation analysis technique by analyzing the blood cells of two pairs of monozygotic twins with cerebral palsy and normal infants. The results revealed the region of DNA methylation and the protein coding genes of promoter region of common methylation of cerebral palsy were both higher than normal children. These common promoter hypermethylation genes in cerebral palsy are involved in a variety of biological processes such as membrane protein transport, neuronal development, apoptosis, and metabolism. Moreover, DNA methylation plays an important role in gene expression. We hypothesized that the onset of cerebral palsy in twins is associated with hypermethylation of the promoter which inhibiting the expression of hypermethylation genes in children with cerebral palsy. The current research provided a basis for further study of the large sample of twins and sporadic cerebral palsy.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies are known to carry a high risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) that could lead to miscarriage and perinatal death. Demise of one fetus is frequently associated with co-fetal death. Fetal reduction by interstitial laser therapy is an effective procedure to prevent this outcome, but it may be associated with significant risks for both mother and fetus. Aplasia Cutis Congenita (ACC) may occur in up to 8% cases of fetal reduction by laser therapy. We report ACC in a preterm infant, a survivor of interstitial laser therapy for fetal reduction in MC pregnancy. Despite of massive skin lesions we were able to manage this case conservatively. Follow-up at 5 years of age revealed minimal scarring and no motor function limitations.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a severe type of brain disease affecting movement and posture. Although CP has strong genetic and environmental components, considerable differences in the methylome between monozygotic\u00a0(MZ) twins discordant for CP implicates epigenetic contributors as well. In order to determine the differences in methylation in patients with CP without interference of the interindividual genomic variation, four pairs of MZ twins discordant for CP were profiled for DNA methylation changes using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on the genomic\u2011scale. Similar DNA methylation patterns were observed in all samples. However, MZ twins demonstrated higher correlations and closer evolutionary associations compared with the other samples, indicating a stable methylome of MZ twins. A total of 190\u00a0differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified using Student's t\u2011test, of which 37\u00a0genes were hypermethylated in the CP group while the remainders were hypomethylated compared with control group. The identified DMGs were enriched in several cerebral abnormalities, including cerebral cortical atrophy and cerebral atrophy, suggesting that the occurrence of CP may be associated with the methylation alterations. The neighboring genes of DMGs in the protein\u2011protein interaction network were enriched in numerous important functions in essential processes. The results of the present study identified important genes that may epigenetically contribute to the occurrence and development of CP in MZ twins, suggesting that the different prevalence of CP in identical twins may be associated with DNA methylation alterations.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology behind autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) is poorly understood, and the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors remains unclear. In this study, we examined the heritability of AAD and explored disease-associated autoimmune comorbidity among Swedish twins.\nA population-based longitudinal cohort of 112,100 Swedish twins was used to calculate the heritability of AAD, and to explore co-occurrence of 10 organ-specific autoimmune disorders in twin pairs with AAD. Diagnoses were collected 1964-2012 through linkage to the Swedish National Patient Register. The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register was used for additional diagnostic precision. When available, biobank serum samples were used to ascertain the AAD diagnosis through identification of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies.\nWe identified 29 twins with AAD. Five out of nine (5/9) monozygotic pairs and zero out of fifteen (0/15) dizygotic pairs were concordant for AAD. The probandwise concordance for monozygotic twins was 0.71 (95% CI 0.40-0.90) and the heritability 0.97 (95% CI 0.88-99). Autoimmune disease patterns of monozygotic twin pairs affected by AAD displayed a higher degree of similarity than those of dizygotic twins, with an incidence rate ratio of 15 (95% CI 1.8-116) on the number of shared autoimmune diagnoses within pairs.\nThe heritability of AAD appears to be very high, emphasizing the need for further research on the genetic etiology of the disease. Monozygotic twin concordance for multiple autoimmune manifestations suggests strong genetic influence on disease specificity in organ-specific autoimmunity.",

Amniotic fluid karyotyping showed nonmosaic trisomy 21 in twin 1 (47, XY,\u00a0+21 [20]) and a normal karyotype in twin 2 (46, XY [20]). Short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphism markers revealed that the two fetuses were monozygotic, and the two chromosomes 21 were maternal isodisomy in the trisomy fetus. The chromosomal constitution of placentas in the territory of trisomy 21 cotwin was 47, XY,\u00a0+21 [20] and was a mosaic 47, XY+21 [12]/46, XY [8] in the normal karyotyped twin.\nOur case of monozygotic twin with discordant trisomy 21 might start with a prezygotic maternal meiosis II non-disjunction error-caused trisomy 21 zygote, and after twinning, one remained trisomy 21, and the other twin underwent trisomy rescue and became a mosaic trisomy 21 in morula or early blastocyst stage before the formation of pre-embryo, which subsequently resulted in mosaic trisomy 21 of the placental tissue and normal chromosomal constitution of the fetus.",

    "abstract": "Production of sires with high breeding potential is indispensable for prompt and reliable breeding using their semen in the cattle industry. Currently, in Japan, we aim to further the production of Japanese black sires via a new breeding system that uses genetically homologous monozygotic twins so that better growth performance and carcass traits can be translated to the increased production of beef with higher economic value. Several studies have reported that monozygotic twins are produced by embryo bisection. On the other hand, with the evolution and stabilization of in vitro fertilization technology, it has become possible to produce multiple monozygotic twin calves from blastomeres separated from a cleavage-stage embryo. This review attempts to clarify breeding practices through revalidation of the factors that affect the production efficiency of monozygotic twin calves by embryo bisection. Furthermore, the establishment of a system for monozygotic twin embryo production via the simplified technique of blastomere separation is reviewed while showing data from our previously performed studies.",

    "abstract": "Negative cognitive bias and aberrant neural processing of self-referent emotional words seem to be trait-marks of depression. However, it is unclear whether these neurocognitive changes are present in unaffected first-degree relatives and constitute an illness endophenotype.\nFifty-three healthy, never-depressed monozygotic or dizygotic twins with a co-twin history of depression (high-risk group: n = 26) or no first-degree family history of depression (low-risk group: n = 27) underwent neurocognitive testing and functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) as part of a follow-up cohort study. Participants performed a self-referent emotional word categorisation task and free word recall task followed by a recognition task during fMRI. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing mood, personality traits and coping strategies.\nHigh-risk and low-risk twins (age, mean \u00b1 SD: 40 \u00b1 11) were well-balanced for demographic variables, mood, coping and neuroticism. High-risk twins showed lower accuracy during self-referent categorisation of emotional words independent of valence and more false recollections of negative words than low-risk twins during free recall. Functional MRI yielded no differences between high-risk and low-risk twins in retrieval-specific neural activity for positive or negative words or during the recognition of negative versus positive words within the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex.\nThe subtle display of negative recall bias is consistent with the hypothesis that self-referent negative memory bias is an endophenotype for depression. High-risk twins' lower categorisation accuracy adds to the evidence for valence-independent cognitive deficits in individuals at familial risk for depression.",

    "abstract": "A pair of monozygotic 22-year-old twins with complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by a novel SPG11 mutation is described.\nGenetic testing and thorough clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR-spectroscopy were performed.\nThe twins were compound heterozygous for a known frameshift as well as a novel splice site mutation in the SPG11 gene. Clinically the patients showed a similar spectrum of symptoms but different disease presentation. MRI studies including morphometry and regional microstructural analysis by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the corpus callosum (CC) by 3T MRI revealed marked thinning and corresponding increases of radial diffusivity (RD) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and reduction of the fractional anisotropy (FA) as compared to controls in all CC sections, particularly in the anterior callosal body. There was marked mainly supratentorial white matter reduction and to a lesser extent grey matter reduction in both patients. Involvement of the cortico-spinal tracts was reflected by FA and RD alterations. The more strongly affected patient showed a higher degree of callosal microstructural damage and cervical cord atrophy.\nThis study shows a similar symptom spectrum, but distinct clinical and imaging findings in monozygotic twins suffering from SPG 11, suggesting individual downstream genetic effects and/or non-genetic modifiers.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a growing global health concern, with a rapid increase being observed in morbid obesity. Obesity is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk and earlier onset of cardiovascular morbidity. The growing obesity epidemic is a major source of unsustainable health costs and morbidity and mortality because of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, certain cancers and major cardiovascular diseases. Similar to obesity, hypertension is a key unfavorable health metric that has disastrous health implications: currently, hypertension is the leading contributor to global disease burden, and the direct and indirect costs of treating hypertension are exponentially higher. Poor lifestyle characteristics and health metrics often cluster together to create complex and difficult-to-treat phenotypes: excess body mass is such an example, facilitating a cascade of pathophysiological sequelae that create such as a direct obesity-hypertension link, which consequently increases cardiovascular risk. Although some significant issues regarding assessment/management of obesity remain to be addressed and the underlying mechanisms governing these disparate effects of obesity on cardiovascular disease are complex and not completely understood, a variety of factors could have a critical role. Consequently, a comprehensive and exhaustive investigation of this relationship should analyze the pathogenetic factors and pathophysiological mechanisms linking obesity to hypertension as they provide the basis for a rational therapeutic strategy in the aim to fully describe and understand the obesity-hypertension link and discuss strategies to address the potential negative consequences from the perspective of both primordial prevention and treatment for those already impacted by this condition.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess shared genetic correlations of depressive and anxiety symptoms with concurrent and future estimated cardiovascular risk (CVR) score in Korean twins and family members. For the relationship with Adult Treatment Panel III CVR estimate in subjects aged 30-74 years (n = 1,059, baseline and follow-up after 3.2 \u00b1 1.2 years), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and state and trait anxiety inventory (SAI and TAI) were measured at baseline. A mixed linear model for CVR scores at baseline and follow-up was applied to include depressive and anxiety symptoms, twin and family effects, income, education, alcohol use, exercise, body mass index, and baseline CVR score for follow-up analysis. Higher CES-D scores were associated with higher CVR score at baseline in men, while higher TAI score was associated with higher CVR score at follow-up in women. Heritabilities were 0.245~0.326 for CVR score, 0.320 for CES-D score, 0.367 for TAI score, and 0.482 for SAI score. There were significant common genetic correlations in the relationships of CES-D, TAI, and SAI scores with CVR scores at baseline and follow-up (after adjusting for baseline CV risk score). Shared common environmental correlations were observed in the relationships of CES-D and SAI scores with CVR score at baseline; and SAI score with CVR score at follow-up. In the within-monozygotic twin analysis, there were no associations between CES-D, TAI, and SAI scores, and CVR score. In conclusion, shared genetic and environmental influences were observed in the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms with concurrent and future CVR estimates.",

    "abstract": "Actin is an important component of the cytoskeleton and its polymerization is delicately regulated by several kinases and phosphatases. Heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a potent phosphatase that is crucial for cell proliferation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, signal transduction, cytoskeleton arrangement, and neurodegeneration. To facilitate these varied functions, different regulators determine the different targets of PP2A. Among these regulators of PP2A, the B subunits in particular may be involved in cytoskeleton arrangement. However, little is known about the role of PP2A in actin polymerization in vivo. Using sophisticated fly genetics, we demonstrated a novel function for the fly B subunit, twins, to promote actin polymerization in varied tissue types, suggesting a broad and conserved effect. Furthermore, our genetic data suggest that twins may act upstream of the actin-polymerized-proteins, Moesin and Myosin-light-chain, and downstream of Rho to promote actin polymerization. This work opens a new avenue for exploring the biological functions of a PP2A regulator, twins, in cytoskeleton regulation.",

    "abstract": "Whether monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins differ from each other in a variety of phenotypes is important for genetic twin modeling and for inferences made from twin studies in general. We analyzed whether there were differences in individual, maternal and paternal education between MZ and DZ twins in a large pooled dataset. Information was gathered on individual education for 218,362 adult twins from 27 twin cohorts (53% females; 39% MZ twins), and on maternal and paternal education for 147,315 and 143,056 twins respectively, from 28 twin cohorts (52% females; 38% MZ twins). Together, we had information on individual or parental education from 42 twin cohorts representing 19 countries. The original education classifications were transformed to education years and analyzed using linear regression models. Overall, MZ males had 0.26 (95% CI [0.21, 0.31]) years and MZ females 0.17 (95% CI [0.12, 0.21]) years longer education than DZ twins. The zygosity difference became smaller in more recent birth cohorts for both males and females. Parental education was somewhat longer for fathers of DZ twins in cohorts born in 1990-1999 (0.16 years, 95% CI [0.08, 0.25]) and 2000 or later (0.11 years, 95% CI [0.00, 0.22]), compared with fathers of MZ twins. The results show that the years of both individual and parental education are largely similar in MZ and DZ twins. We suggest that the socio-economic differences between MZ and DZ twins are so small that inferences based upon genetic modeling of twin data are not affected.",

    "abstract": "An association between childhood asthma and IgE sensitization has been established, but our understanding of the genetic and environmental contribution to it is incomplete. Our aim was to estimate the associations and dose-response relationship between asthma and sensitization to airborne allergens in Swedish 9- to 14-year-old twins. Additionally, we aimed to explore the importance of familial confounding from shared genes and environment using co-twin controls.\nIn the STOPPA cohort, 752 same-sex twin children were screened with Phadiatop\u00ae (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden); if positive further analysis of IgE antibodies to airborne allergens of pets (cat, horse, dog), pollens (birch, timothy, mugwort), mites, and mold were performed. The associations between asthma and airborne allergens were assessed with generalized estimating equations. The co-twin control analysis was performed by conditional logistic regression.\nChildren with positive Phadiatop\u00ae had more than doubled odds of asthma (OR 2.53, 95% CI [1.74, 3.70]). Sensitization to pet allergens was associated with increased odds of asthma; for example, cat OR 4.15 (95% CI [2.67, 6.45]), with similar estimates for pollens; for example, birch OR 3.22 (95% CI [2.12, 4.91]). Associations persisted with sensitization as a categorical variable and for trend, indicating a dose-response relationship. Results remained in the co-twin analyses; for example, cat OR 4.75 (95% CI [1.62, 14.0]) and birch OR 5.00 (95% CI [1.45, 17.3]).\nThe association between childhood asthma and sensitization to airborne allergens remains in co-twin analyses, indicating they are not due to confounding from shared environmental or genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Perceived age is an easily accessible biomarker of aging. Here, we studied its relation to DNA methylation age (DNAm age) as introduced in (Horvath, 2013) in 180 elderly Danish twins. We found perceived age and DNAm age to be associated with chronological age (P=0.04 resp. P=2.2e-10) when correcting for gender, but did not see an association between perceived age and DNAm age (P=0.44). Intrapair-analysis showed that the proportion of pairs where the twin with the highest perceived age also had the highest DNAm age was not different from 0.5 (P=1), and we did not see a trend when dividing pairs according to their difference in perceived age (P=0.36). Hence, intrapair analysis did not reveal links between perceived age and DNAm age. Moreover, none of the 353 CpGs underlying DNAm age was individually associated with perceived age after correction for multiple-testing (P>6e-4, FDR>0.21). Finally, when constructing an epigenetic signature based on these CpGs to predict perceived age, we only found a correlation of 0.18 (95%CI: -0.06 to 0.40) and a mean square error of 13.6 years",

    "abstract": "Research has repeatedly suggested genetic and environmental factors in the etiology underlying female sexual dysfunction (FSD). Because sexual functioning is a highly variable trait, epigenetics could provide a promising approach to tackle the origins of FSD and consequently offer a step-change in our understanding of these problems.\nTo identify differentially methylated CpG positions for sexual functioning in a sample of monozygotic twin pairs discordant for sexual functioning.\nThe sample consisted of 33 trait-discordant monozygotic twin pairs (mean age\u00a0= 54.1 years, SD\u00a0=\u00a09.05) from the Twins UK Registry. Phenotypic data on sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain were collected using the Female Sexual Function Index-Lifelong (FSFI-LL). The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 DNA BeadChip was used for epigenome-wide analyses of DNA methylation in whole-blood samples.\nComparison of DNA methylation patterns associated with the FSFI-LL total score and its six subdomains.\nTwo differentially methylated CpG positions (cg09580409 and cg14734994) reaching experiment-wide statistical significance were found for overall sexual functioning, mapping to MGC45800 and the threonine synthase-like 2 gene (THNSL2), respectively. Furthermore, potential biologically relevant candidates for sexual desire (CUB and zona pellucida-like domains 1, CUZD1) and satisfaction (solute carrier family 6 member 19, SLC6A19) were identified.\nTHNSL2 and SLC6A19, which have been linked to weight and adiposity, might represent novel candidates for sexual problems in women.\nThis is the first study to investigate epigenetic mechanisms underlying FSD. The study used a relative small sample of monozygotic female twins. The cutoff to determine discordance in sexual problems was chosen based on a 10% FSFI score difference. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution and need replication in larger clinical samples.\nUnderstanding how genes and environment interact to influence our sexuality might inform clinical practice and lead to new treatments for women experiencing FSD.

    "abstract": "Utilization of laccases in biotechnology and bioremediation has created a strong demand for the characterization of new enzymes and an increase in production of known laccases. Thus, additional research into these enzymes is critically needed. In this study, we report a comparative study of the biochemical and transcriptional properties of two different laccase isozymes from Trametes hirsuta 072 - the constitutive and inducible forms. A recombinant LacC enzyme was expressed in Penicillium canescens to characterize its properties. LacC is single-purpose enzyme, unlike LacA, which can operate efficiently under a wide range of temperatures and pHs (55-70\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 3-5, respectively). LacC has a lower RedOx potential than LacA and does not oxidize substrates containing amine groups. Expression of the lacC gene was selective compared to that of the lacA gene and increased significantly in the presence of complex synthetic compounds such as dyes and xenobiotics. This study shows that laccases from the multigene families of basidiomycetes differ significantly in their properties, thus providing a complementary effect during lignin degradation.",

    "abstract": "To date, it is unclear which factors are associated with parenting stress.\nThere are no studies investigating the association between parenting stress and coping strategies such as coparenting and social support, while simultaneously considering demographic and obstetric factors, in mothers of singletons and twins.\nTo investigate if parenting stress is associated with personal, and obstetric characteristics, the level of coparenting, and the availability of and satisfaction with social support in mothers of singletons and twins until one year postpartum.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 151 singleton mothers and 101 twin mothers were included.\nBoth singleton and twin mothers experiencing lower parenting stress levels indicated a better coparenting relationship quality (\u03b2=-0.253, p<0.01; \u03b2=-0.341, p=0.001). Elevated parenting stress levels positively influenced the level of satisfaction with social support in only mothers of twins (\u03b2=0.273, p<0.01). The availability of social support, personal, and obstetric characteristics were not associated with the level of parenting stress in neither singleton nor twin mothers.\nCoparenting seems to be a significant coping strategy reducing the level of parenting stress in singleton and twin mothers, irrespective of their personal and obstetric characteristics. Large-scale longitudinal research is needed to identify predictors of parenting stress, which may help to develop parenting stress reducing interventions. The acknowledgement and support of an adequate coparenting relationship quality by health care professionals might be an important factor to include in such interventions.",

We compared twins with and without SGA delivered at \u226534 weeks. There were two primary outcomes for this study: a composite of major adverse outcomes (death; cerebral palsy; necrotizing enterocolitis; chronic renal, heart, or lung disease) and a composite of minor adverse outcomes (learning disability, speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy). Regression analysis was performed to control for clustering of outcomes within twin pairs.\n\u2003A total of 712 children were included. Comparing twins with birthweights <10% to \u226510%, there were no significant differences in rates of composite major morbidities (3.2 vs. 1.4%, \n\u2003Twins with SGA <10% born at \u226534 weeks have similar long-term neurodevelopmental and health outcomes compared with twins with normal birthweights. Birthweight less than 5th percentile is associated with an increased risk of major morbidity, specifically cardiac disease, but the absolute risk is low.",

    "abstract": "Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) is an autosomal, dominantly inherited prion disease. In this study, we present different complicated brain pathologies determined postmortem of monozygotic GSS twin sisters. Case 1 showed cerebellar ataxia at the age of 58\u2009years, and died at 66\u2009years. Case 2 became symptomatic at the age of 75\u2009years, and died at 79\u2009years. There was a 17-year difference in the age of onset between the twins. Postmortem examination revealed numerous prion protein (PrP) plaques in the brains of both cases. The spongiform change and brain atrophy in case 1 were more severe compared with those in case 2. Western-blot analysis identified proteinase-resistant PrP (PrPres) at the molecular weight of 21-30\u2009kDa and 8\u2009kDa in the twins. Gel filtration revealed that PrPres was mainly composed of PrP oligomer. PrPres signal patterns were similar between the twins. Additionally, case 1 showed \u03b1-synucleinopathy and case 2 showed Alzheimer disease pathology. These different proteinopathies were involved in the amyloid plaque formations of both cases. The degree of GSS pathology was mainly related to disease duration. The amyloid plaque formations could be decorated by concomitant neuropathological changes such as \u03b1-synucleinopathy and tauopathy.",

Using meta-analytical methodology, the authors compared these molecules.\nRCTs comparing tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine with placebo in Huntington's disease were searched. The authors assessed the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, calculated indirect treatment comparisons, and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.\nThe evidence network for this report comprised 1 tetrabenazine trial and 1 deutetrabenazine trial, both against placebo. Risk of bias was moderate in both. Participants in the tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine trials did not differ significantly on motor scores or adverse events. Depression and somnolence scales significantly favored deutetrabenazine.\nThere is low-quality evidence that tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine do not differ in efficacy or safety.

    "abstract": "Foot impressions are of utmost importance in crime scene investigations. Foot impressions are available in the form of barefoot prints, sock-clad footprints, and as impressions within footwear. Sometimes suspects leave their footwear at the crime scene, and the insole of this footwear may contain the foot impression of the suspect which may be important evidence linking him or her to the crime. The task of identification based on the analysis of footprints can be challenging when the footprints belonging to one of the identical twin is available for examination. The present study is based on the quantitative measures of the foot impressions in the footwear of adult identical twins. The study was conducted on four sets of female monozygotic twins from the United States of America. A total of 17 length and breadth measurements were taken on each foot impression. A combination of Reel Method and Extended Gunn Method was utilized to produce the measurements. The measurements of the foot impressions were compared among the twins on the right and the left side. Differences were found in the various footprint measurements among the twins. The study's sample size was not large enough to apply robust statistical tests, but the study is significant in that it presents the first detailed comparative analysis of a large number of measurements of insole foot impressions of adult twins. The observations derived from the study are likely to assist forensic investigations in cases involving the foot impressions of the twins.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the major chronic liver disease in many countries. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial, but twin and familial studies indicate significant heritability, which is not fully explained by currently known genetic susceptibility loci. Notably, mutations in genes encoding nuclear lamina proteins, including lamins, cause lipodystrophy syndromes that include NAFLD. We hypothesized that variants in lamina-associated proteins predispose to NAFLD and used a candidate gene-sequencing approach to test for variants in 10 nuclear lamina-related genes in a cohort of 37 twin and sibling pairs: 21 individuals with and 53 without NAFLD. Twelve heterozygous sequence variants were identified in four lamina-related genes (ZMPSTE24, TMPO, SREBF1, SREBF2). The majority of NAFLD patients (>90%) had at least one variant compared to <40% of controls (P < 0.0001). When only insertions/deletions and changes in conserved residues were considered, the difference between the groups was similarly striking (>80% versus <25%; P < 0.0001). Presence of a lamina variant segregated with NAFLD independently of the PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism. Several variants were found in TMPO, which encodes the lamina-associated polypeptide-2 (LAP2) that has not been associated with liver disease. One of these, a frameshift insertion that generates truncated LAP2, abrogated lamin-LAP2 binding, caused LAP2 mislocalization, altered endogenous lamin distribution, increased lipid droplet accumulation after oleic acid treatment in transfected cells, and led to cytoplasmic association with the ubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1.\nSeveral variants in nuclear lamina-related genes were identified in a cohort of twins and siblings with NAFLD; one such variant, which results in a truncated LAP2 protein and a dramatic phenotype in cell culture, represents an association of TMPO/LAP2 variants with NAFLD and underscores the potential importance of the nuclear lamina in NAFLD.

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are identical twins that have incompletely separated in utero. The prognosis for conjoined twins is poor and management in a skilled tertiary care centre is paramount for definitive care. We describe our experience with a telemedical consultation on conjoined twins in The Dominican Republic from our eHealth centre in Valhalla, NY. The patients were two month old, female, pygopagus conjoined twins. A multidisciplinary teleconference was initiated with the patients, their family, the referring paediatrician and our team. Based on this teleconsultation, the team felt as though the twins may be amenable to a surgical separation. They presented to our centre in Valhalla, NY, for a detailed physical examination and series of imaging studies. Soon after, the patients underwent a successful 21\u2009h separation procedure and were discharged 12 weeks later. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of an international teleconsultation leading to a successful conjoined twin separation procedure.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative assessment of tissue anatomy and accurate surgical planning is crucial in conjoined twin separation surgery. We developed a new method that combines three-dimensional (3D) printing, assembling, and casting to produce anatomic models of high fidelity for surgical planning. The related anatomic features of the conjoined twins were captured by computed tomography (CT), classified as five organ groups, and reconstructed as five computer models. Among these organ groups, the skeleton was produced by fused deposition modeling (FDM) using acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene. For the other four organ groups, shell molds were prepared by FDM and cast with silica gel to simulate soft tissues, with contrast enhancement pigments added to simulate different CT and visual contrasts. The produced models were assembled, positioned firmly within a 3D printed shell mold simulating the skin boundary, and cast with transparent silica gel. The produced phantom was subject to further CT scan in comparison with that of the patient data for fidelity evaluation. Further data analysis showed that the produced model reassembled the geometric features of the original CT data with an overall mean deviation of less than 2\u2009mm, indicating the clinical potential to use this method for surgical planning in conjoined twin separation surgery.",

    "abstract": "Nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (OFCs) are complex traits characterized by multifactorial inheritance and wide phenotypic variability. Numerous studies have shown subtle differences in the faces of unaffected relatives from cleft families compared to controls, the implication being that such outward differences are an incomplete expression reflecting an underlying genetic predisposition. Twins discordant for OFCs provide a unique opportunity to further test this idea, as the unaffected co-twin shares on average 50% (for dizygotic twins) and 100% (for monozygotic twins) of the genetic risk factors as the affected twin. We used 3D surface imaging and spatially-dense morphometry to compare facial shape in a sample of 44 unaffected co-twins and age- and sex-matched unaffected controls (n\u2009=\u2009241). Unaffected co-twins showed statistically significant differences in the midface, lateral upper face, and forehead regions, compared to controls. Furthermore, co-twins were characterized by a distinct pattern of midfacial retrusion, broader upper faces, and greater protrusion of the mandible and brow ridges. This same general facial pattern was shown in both unaffected monozygotic and dizygotic co-twin subsets. These results provide additional support that altered facial shape is a phenotypic marker for OFC susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Microdeletions of 20q11.2 are rare but have been associated with characteristic clinical findings. A 1.6\u2009Mb minimal critical region has been identified that includes three OMIM genes: GDF5, EPB41L1, and SAMHD. Here we describe a male monozygotic, monochorionic-diamniotic twin pair with discordant phenotypes, one with multiple findings that overlap with those reported in 20q11.2 deletions, and the other unaffected. Microarray analysis revealed mosaicism for a 363\u2009Kb deletion encompassing GDF5 in the peripheral blood of both twins, which was confirmed by FISH. Subsequent FISH on buccal cells identified the deletion only in the affected twin. The blood FISH findings were interpreted as representing chimerism resulting from anastomosis and the blood exchange between the twins in utero. The implications of this finding are discussed, as is the contribution of GDF5 to the associated clinical findings of 20q11.2 deletions.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the possible effects of genetic and environmental factors on dentofacial complex using monozygotic twins.\nThe study sample was made of 21 pairs of monozygotic twins (14 female pairs and seven male pairs) between 10 and 25 years. Pretreatment lateral cephalo-grams were used which were traced and digitized, and various landmarks to determine the anteroposterior and vertical proportions were marked. Samples were divided into two groups. The correlation between groups was found by calculating Pearson's product moment correlation coefficients.\nThe range of the correlation coefficient was from 0.705 to 0.952. Gonial angle showed the highest correlation coefficient (0.952), while saddle angle showed the lowest correlation coefficient (0.705).\nThe growth and development of craniofacial complex is under mutifactorial control. However, genetic influences do tend to play a dominant role.\nBy studying identical twins, we can study about the interaction of the environment with the genes and how it affects the growth and development of the body in general and dentofacial complex in particular. By utilizing twin studies, we can identify whether a particular trait, disease, or disorder is influenced more strongly by genetics or by the environment. Success of orthodontic treatment depends on a proper diagnosis of the problem including its etiological factors. Genetic studies let the orthodontists to understand the effects of genetic and environmental factors in the growth and development of dentofacial complex better and allows to prevent or treat malocclusions and skeletal anomalies in better ways.",

    "abstract": "\u2003We hypothesized that utilization of a twin-specific nomograms, when compared with one based on singleton data, is less likely to classify twins as having abnormal growth and more likely to identify perinatal morbidity and mortality.\n\u2003Data were culled from seven Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) studies, the included twin gestations in their study population. Each newborn twin's birth weight percentile was categorized using Alexander et al (singleton data) and Ananth et al (twin data) nomogram. Logistic regression models were adjusted for maternal race and body mass index, neonatal sex, study, and twin correlation.\n\u2003More twins were categorized as small for gestational age (SGA) when singleton nomogram was used (33%) compared with twin nomogram (4%). The use of singleton nomogram revealed a higher composite neonatal morbidity (CNM) and stillbirth rates among SGA twins but a similar neonatal mortality rate when compared with appropriate for gestational age. Correspondingly, when twin-specific nomogram was utilized, the CNM, odds of stillbirth, and neonatal mortality were higher among SGA twins. The rate of large for gestational age among twins was increased with the use of twin-specific nomograms.\n\u2003Utilization of twin-specific nomogram is less likely to categorize twins as SGA and more likely to identify those at risk for stillbirth and neonatal mortality.",

    "abstract": "To assess the clinical characteristics of fetal aneuploidy between dichorionic twins (DCT) and monochorionic twins (MCT) undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis.\nTwin fetuses undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis were enrolled in this study. All twin fetuses were classified into 2 groups according to chorionicity. The rates of fetal aneuploidy in different groups were compared.\nThis study included 1,714 fetuses (857 sets of twin pairs); among them, 1,190 were DCT and 524 were MCT. Overall, the rate of aneuploidy was 4.7% (56/1,190) in DCT and 3.4% (18/524) in MCT. Sixty-four (86.5%, 64/74) fetal aneuploidies occurred in only one fetus of the twin pairs. In DCT, the most common aneuploidy was trisomy 21 (53.6%, 30/56), followed by trisomy 18 (21.4%, 12/56) and trisomy 13 (8.9%, 5/56), while in MCT, the most common aneuploidy was Turner syndrome (33.3%, 6/18), followed by trisomy 21 (27.7%, 5/18) and 47,XYY (11.0%, 2/18).\nAneuploidy mostly occurred in only one fetus in the twin pairs. The most common aneuploidy was trisomy 21 in DCT and Turner syndrome in MCT. Dual amniocentesis should be performed when discordant monozygotic twins are suspected.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins share the same STR profile, demonstrating a practical problem in forensic casework. DNA methylation has provided a suitable resource for MZ twin differentiation; however, studies addressing the forensic feasibility are lacking. Here, we investigated epigenetic MZ twin differentiation from blood under the forensic scenario comprising i) the discovery of candidate markers in reference-type blood DNA via genome-wide analysis, ii) the technical validation of candidate markers in reference-type blood DNA using a suitable targeted method, and iii) the analysis of the validated markers in trace-type DNA. Genome-wide methylation analysis in blood DNA from 10 MZ twin pairs resulted in 19-111 twin-differentially methylated sites (tDMSs) per pair with >0.3 twin-to-twin differences. Considering all top three candidate tDMSs across all pairs in the technical validation based on methylation-specific qPCR, 67.85% generated >0.1 twin-to-twin differences. Of the validated tDMSs, 68.4% showed >0.1 twin-to-twin differences with qPCR in trace-type DNA across 8 pairs. Using an updated marker selection strategy, 8 additional candidate tDMSs were obtained for an example MZ pair, of which 7 showed >0.1 twin-to-twin differences in both reference- and trace-type DNA. Lastly, we introduce a high-resolution melting curve analysis of the entire fragment that can complement the proposed approach. Overall, our study demonstrates the general feasibility of epigenetic twin differentiation in the forensic context and highlights that the number of informative tDMSs in the final trace DNA analysis is crucial, as some candidate markers identified in reference DNA were shown not informative in the trace DNA due to various, including technical, reasons. Future studies will need to address the optimal number of epigenetic markers required for reliable identification of MZ twin individuals including statistical considerations.",

    "abstract": "Young children's behavioral control predicts a broad range of developmental outcomes in child- and adulthood. It is therefore important to study how individual differences in behavioral control arise. Previous studies suggest that there are both genetic and environmental influences, which were estimated in the current study using a sample of mono- and dizygotic same-sex twins. Furthermore, we examined the associations between indicators of a stressful family environment like household chaos, parenting daily hassles, and parental depressive symptoms and children's behavioral control in 2 samples. Children of the same twin pair were randomly divided over 2 samples; a test (N = 201, 48.3% boys, M age 46.53 months) and replication sample (N = 201, 49.8% boys, M age 46.06 months). Both parents reported on their children's effortful control via the Child Behavior Questionnaire and children's cheating behavior was observed during a throwing game. We found that AE models fitted the data for effortful control (A = 31%, E = 69%) and cheating (A = 16%, E = 84%) best. Path analyses revealed that children of parents experiencing more parenting daily hassles and depressive symptoms had lower levels of effortful control in the test sample. Furthermore, we found that children growing up in more chaotic households (parent report) had an increased risk of being in the cheating group versus the possible intention to cheat group in the test sample. These results were partially replicated. We suggest that the role of stressful family environments in the development of behavioral control should be considered when setting up prevention and intervention programs targeting children's behavioral control.

    "abstract": "Increased telomerase expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and, since the primary cause of lung cancer is smoking, an association between telomerase reactivation and tobacco smoke has been proposed. In this work an investigation has been performed to assess the relationship between tobacco smoke exposure and telomerase activity (TA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy smokers. The methylation status of the catalytic subunit of telomerase hTERT was concurrently investigated to assess the possible association between epigenetic modifications of hTERT and TA. Besides, the association between smoke and telomere length (TL) has been evaluated. Healthy monozygotic twins with discordant smoking habits were selected as study population to minimize inter-individual differences because of demographic characteristics and genetic heterogeneity. Statistically significant higher values of TA and TL were observed in smokers compared to nonsmoker co-twins. The multivariate analysis of data showed, besides smoking habits (P\u2009=\u20090.02), an influence of gender (P\u2009=\u20090.006) and BMI (P\u2009=\u20090.001) on TA and a borderline effect of gender (P\u2009=\u20090.05) on TL. DNA methylation analysis, focused on 100 CpG sites mapping in hTERT, highlighted nine CpG sites differentially methylated in smokers. When co-twins were contrasted, selecting as variables the intra-twin difference in TA and hTERT DNA methylation, a statistically significant inverse correlation (P\u2009=\u20090.003) was observed between TA and DNA methylation at the cg05521538 site. In conclusion, these results indicate an association of tobacco smoke with TA and TL and suggest a possible association between smoke-induced epigenetic effects and TA in healthy smokers. Environ.

    "abstract": "Twins play an important role in the deformation of nanocrystalline (NC) metals. The size effects of {[Formula: see text]} tensile/{[Formula: see text]} compressive lamellar twins on the tensile strength and deformation mechanisms of NC hcp cobalt have been investigated by a series of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Unlike the size effects of twins on the strength for polycrystalline fcc metals, the strength of NC hcp cobalt with lamellar tensile/compressive twins monotonically increases with decreasing twin boundary spacing (TBS) and no softening stage is observed, which is due to the consistent deformation mechanisms no matter TBS is large or small. These consistent deformation mechanisms can be categorized into four types of strengthening mechanisms: (i) Partial basal dislocations nucleated from grain boundaries (GBs) or twin boundaries (TBs) intersecting with TBs/GBs; (ii) Phase transformation from hcp to fcc; (iii) <c\u2009+\u2009a> partial edge dislocations nucleated from TBs intersecting with basal partial dislocations; (iv) Growth of the newly formed secondary tensile twins inside the primary compressive/tensile twins. The observed multiple twinning in MD simulations has also been confirmed by TEM after tensile testing in NC cobalt processed by severe plastic deformation.",

    "abstract": "Since the 19th century, and in every field of medicine, monozygotic twins have been studied to assess the involvement of genetic and environmental factors in phenotypic expression. The phenotype/genotype relationship remains the leading problem in contemporary biology. In dentofacial orthopedics, this relationship is of relevance in the three-dimensional approach to the face, in both diagnosis and treatment. The present study of two monozygotic twins presenting skeletal class III malocclusions which were genetic yet different is a clear illustration of the interaction of genotype and epigenetic factors with environmental influences. We will demonstrate that treatment can reduce phenotypic differences.",

    "abstract": "Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hyperpyrexia, anhidrosis, pain insensitivity, self-inflicted injuries, and intellectual disability. The anesthetic management of these patients is challenging owing to the high risk of perioperative complications resulting from their autonomic dysfunction, such as hyperthermia, hypotension, and bradycardia, which result from autonomic nervous system dysfunction.\nTwo 3-year-old Han Chinese identical male twins (weighing 13.5 kg and measuring 93 cm tall) were previously diagnosed as having congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis based on clinical features and genetic screening. According to the presence of loud snoring and heavy breathing during sleep and neck radiograph findings, they were diagnosed as having tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy and needed adenotonsillectomy. Because of innate analgesia, some reports suggested that patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis do not require perioperative pain control. Accordingly, our patients did not receive opiates. We describe the general anesthetic management of these patients using sevoflurane and propofol, but without opiates, for adenotonsillectomy. Remarkable tachycardia and hypertension occurred during airway manipulation and when the surgical stimuli increased, and their temperatures increased from 36 \u00b0C and 36.8 \u00b0C to 37.8 \u00b0C and 38.5 \u00b0C, respectively. Patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis lack pain sensation, but they may have tactile hyperesthesia. Surgical noxious stimuli may therefore produce a stress response and unpleasant sensations, leading to hemodynamic fluctuation and temperature increase.\nOn the basis of these findings, we suggest that careful intraoperative opiate titration may be justified to blunt the surgical stress response and promote hemodynamic and temperature stability in similar patients; we also recommend the preparation of warming and cooling devices and continuous temperature monitoring in these patients. Since anesthetic management of these patients is not simple, careful attention is required.",

    "abstract": "Preterm twins have a higher morbidity rate of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) than do singletons. However, the effect of multiple births on maturation of the ductus arteriosus (DA) has not been reported. Because intimal thickening (IT) is required for DA anatomical closure, we examined IT development in the DA of preterm twins and singletons. Sheep DA tissues obtained from preterm fetuses were subjected to elastica van Gieson staining to evaluate IT. The total IT score in each DA was the sum of the IT scores obtained from six evenly divided parts of the DA, which was positively correlated with gestational ages in singletons. Total IT scores were smaller in preterm twins than in singletons, although no difference in gestational age, birth weight, or gender ratio was observed. These data suggest that IT development of the DA is attenuated in sheep preterm twins, which may affect the higher morbidity of PDA.",

    "abstract": "Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soda, have been shown to play an important role in weight gain. Although soda consumption has been associated with body mass index (BMI) in many studies, it has been difficult to ascertain a true causal relationship between soda consumption and BMI for two reasons. First, findings have been based largely on observational and cross-sectional studies, with much less evidence from randomized controlled trials. Second, the reported relationships may be confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors that affect both soda consumption and BMI. In the present study, we used the twin design to better understand the relationship between soda consumption and BMI by accounting for measured and unmeasured confounds in non-experimental data. Associations from genetically informed tests in twins are considered \"quasi-causal,\" suggesting that our confidence in the causal underpinning of the association between soda consumption and BMI has been strengthened. We hypothesized that the association between soda consumption and BMI would be significant both between and within twins.\nThis was a cross sectional study of 5787 same sex adult twin pairs (18-97\u00a0years, 66% female) from the community based Washington State Twin Registry. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to investigate associations between soda consumption and BMI in the population (the phenotypic association between exposure and outcome among all twins treated as individuals) and within pairs of identical and fraternal twins (the quasi-causal association controlling for between pair genetic and environmental confounds).\nAmong all twins, there was a significant phenotypic association between soda consumption and BMI that held when controlling for age, sex, race, annual household income, and education level (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In the quasi-causal model, however, the effect of soda consumption on BMI was greatly reduced and no longer significant, with a large genetic confound in both men and women (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nAmong a large group of adult twin pairs, increased soda consumption was associated with increased BMI; however, the observed association was mediated by a genetic background common to both.",

    "abstract": "SorCS1, SorCS2 and SorCS3 belong to the Vps10p-domain family of multiligand receptors. Genetic and functional studies have linked SorCS receptors to psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes, demonstrating critical roles in neuronal functionality and metabolic control. Surprisingly, their structural composition has so far not been studied. Here we have characterized SorCS1, SorCS2 and SorCS3 using biochemical methods and electron microscopy. We found that their purified extracellular domains co-exist in stable dimeric and monomeric populations. This was supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, where membrane-bound dimers were successfully pulled down from cell lysate. While dimers were virtually unbreakable, dimerization of the monomeric population was promoted through enzymatic deglycosylation. We conclude that post-translational modifications, specifically the degree and pattern of glycosylation, regulate the oligomeric state of the protein. Hence, cells may dictate ligand specificity by controlling the ratio between monomers and dimers and, therefore, regulate the multiple functions of SorCS receptors.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we aimed to explore gender differences in infant mortality and neonatal morbidity in mixed-gender twin pairs. Data were obtained from the US National Center for Health Statistics Linked Birth-Infant Death Cohort. A total of 108,038 pairs of mixed-gender twins were included in this analysis. Among the mixed-gender twins, no significant difference in the odds of fetal mortality between male twins (1.05%) and female co-twins (1.04%). However, male twins were at increased odds of neonatal mortality (adjusted OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.37, 1.85) and overall infant mortality (adjusted OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.27, 1.61) relative to their female co-twins. Congenital abnormalities (adjusted OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.27, 1.50) were identified significantly more frequently in male than female twins. Moreover, increased odds of having low 5-minute Apgar score (<7) (adjusted OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.05, 1.26), assistant ventilation >30\u2009minutes (adjusted OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.17, 1.47), and respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.26, 1.66) were identified in male twins relative to their female counterparts. The results of our study indicated that in mixed-gender twin pairs, the odds of infant mortality and neonatal morbidity were higher in male twins than their female co-twins.",

    "abstract": "Multiple loci or genes have been identified using genome-wide association studies mainly in western countries but with inconsistent results. No similar studies have been conducted in the world's largest and rapidly aging Chinese population. The paper aimed to identify the specific genetic variants associated with cognitive function in middle and old-aged Chinese dizygotic twins (DZ). Cognitive function was measured on 139 pairs of DZ by Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The subjects were genotyped at 1048575 SNP positions. Regression-based mixed-effect kinship model of GWAS was conducted to test the SNPs. Gene-based analysis was performed on VEGAS2. The statistically significant genes were then subject to gene set enrichment analysis to further identify the specific biological pathways associated with cognitive function. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance although there were 13 SNPs of suggestive significance (P\u00a0<\u00a010",

    "abstract": "Negotiations are inherently dyadic. Negotiators' individual-level characteristics may not only make them perform better or worse in general, but also may make them particularly well- or poorly-suited to negotiate with a particular counterpart. The present research estimates the extent to which performance in a distributive negotiation is affected by (a) the negotiators' individual-level characteristics and (b) dyadic interaction effects that are defined by the unique pairings between the negotiators and their counterparts. Because negotiators cannot interact multiple times without carryover effects, we estimated the relative importance of these factors with a new methodology that used twin siblings as stand-ins for each other. Participants engaged in a series of 1-on-1 negotiations with counterparts while, elsewhere, their cotwins engaged in the same series of 1-on-1 negotiations with the cotwins of those counterparts. In these data, dyadic interaction effects explained more variation in negotiation economic outcomes than did individual differences, whereas individual differences explain more than twice as much of the variation in subjective negotiation outcomes than did dyadic interaction effects. These results suggest dyadic interaction effects represent an understudied area for future research, particularly with regard to the economic outcomes of negotiations. (PsycINFO Database Record",

    "abstract": "The genetic and environmental impacts on correlations between hearing and cognitive functions have not been well studied. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Hearing function was assessed by audiometric pure-tone hearing thresholds at different frequencies, including 0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, 8 kHz, and 12.5 kHz, with the lower hearing thresholds indicating better hearing function. Cognitive and hearing functions were measured on 379 complete twin pairs (240 monozygotic and 139 dizygotic pairs) with a median age of 50 years (range: 40-80 years). Bivariate twin models were fitted to quantify the genetic and environmental components of the correlations between hearing and cognitive functions. The analysis showed significantly high genetic correlation between 2 kHz of hearing and cognition (r G = -1.00, 95% CI [-1.00, -0.46]) and moderate genetic correlation between 4 kHz of hearing and cognition (r G = -0.62, 95% CI [-1.00, -0.14]). We found no significant genetic correlations between low as well as high frequencies of hearing and cognition. Low to moderate common and unique environmental correlations were shown between low frequencies of hearing and cognition (-0.13 to -0.39) and the common environmental correlation between 8 kHz, one of the high frequencies of hearing, and cognition (-0.22). The middle frequencies of hearing and cognitive functions may have a shared genetic basis. Low frequencies of hearing and cognition may share similar common and unique environmental factors. At 8 kHz, the high frequency of hearing and cognition may share similar common environment. This twin study detected a significant genetic and environmental basis in the phenotype correlation between cognition and hearing, which differed across frequencies.",

    "abstract": "CDKN1C and KCNQ1OT1 are imprinted genes that might be potential regulators of placental development. This study investigated placental expressions of CDKN1C and KCNQ1OT1 in monozygotic twins with and without selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR). Seventeen sIUGR and fifteen normal monozygotic(MZ) twin pairs were examined. Placental mRNA expressions of CDKN1C and KCNQ1OT1 were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. CDKN1C protein expression was detected by immunohistochemical assay and Western-blotting. In the sIUGR group, smaller fetuses had a smaller share of the placenta, and CDKN1C protein expression was significantly increased while KCNQ1OT1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased. The CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 mRNA ratio was lower in the larger fetus than in the smaller fetus (p < .05). In the control group, CDKN1C protein expression showed no difference between larger and smaller fetuses, while KCNQ1OT1 mRNA expression was significantly lower in the larger fetus, and the CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 mRNA ratio was higher in the larger fetus than in the smaller fetus (p < .05). Our findings showed that pathogenesis of sIUGR may be related to the co-effect of the up-regulated protein expression of CDKN1C and down-regulated mRNA expression of KCNQ1OT1 in the placenta.",

The boy had the homozygous deletion of SMN1, a typical type 1 SMA course, and died at the age of eight months. His twin sister, asymptomatic at the time of the diagnosis in her brother, had the same genetic defect but she developed clinical and electrophysiological signs of type 2 SMA. The reduction of tendon reflexes was the first clinical sign at the age of 4 months, followed within few weeks, by a mild decrement in the amplitude of the compound motor action potentials. After the age of 9 months, she showed a sudden clinical and electrophysiological deterioration. Among molecular tests, we determined SMN2 copy number, SMN2 and Plastin 3 transcript levels in peripheral blood, and observed no relevant differences between twins.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating late-onset neurodegenerative disorder in which only a small proportion of patients carry an identifiable causative genetic lesion. Despite high heritability estimates, a genetic etiology for most sporadic ALS remains elusive. Here we report the epigenetic profiling of five monozygotic twin pairs discordant for ALS, four with classic ALS and one with the progressive muscular atrophy ALS variant, in whom previous whole genome sequencing failed to uncover a genetic basis for their disease discordance. By studying cytosine methylation patterns in peripheral blood DNA we identified thousands of large between-twin differences at individual CpGs. While the specific sites of differences were mostly idiosyncratic to a twin pair, a proportion involving GABA signalling were common to all ALS individuals. For both idiosyncratic and common sites the differences occurred within genes and pathways related to neurobiological functions or dysfunctions, some of particular relevance to ALS such as glutamate metabolism and the Golgi apparatus. All four classic ALS patients were epigenetically older than their unaffected co-twins, suggesting accelerated aging in multiple tissues in this disease. In conclusion, widespread changes in methylation patterns were found in ALS-affected co-twins, consistent with an epigenetic contribution to disease. These DNA methylation findings could be used to develop blood-based ALS biomarkers, gain insights into disease pathogenesis, and provide a reference for future large-scale ALS epigenetic studies.",

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that the risk of neonatal morbidity among late-preterm twins is similar to that of late-preterm singletons.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of all women with twin or singleton pregnancy who gave birth during the late-preterm period in a single tertiary center between 2008 and 2015. Neonatal outcomes of low-risk, late-preterm twins were compared with those of low-risk, late-preterm singletons. The primary outcome was the same primary composite respiratory morbidity variable that was used in the randomized controlled trial of Gyamfi-Bannerman et al on the administration of antenatal corticosteroids during the late-preterm period.\nA total of 922 singleton and 721 twin late-preterm neonates met the inclusion criteria. The rates of composite respiratory morbidity and severe composite respiratory morbidity were similar for twins and singletons (8.3% compared with 7.4%, P=.5 and 6.8% compared with 6.0%, P=.5, respectively), but were lower than the rates of the same composite respiratory morbidity variable in the randomized controlled study described previously. The odds for respiratory morbidity were similar for twins and singletons for both composite respiratory morbidity (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.48-1.12) and severe composite respiratory morbidity (adjusted OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.50-1.24).\nThe risk of respiratory morbidity among late-preterm twins is similar to that of late-preterm singletons. Still, the low absolute rates of the composite respiratory morbidity in our population suggest that administration of antenatal corticosteroids may be mostly justified among neonates born closer to 34 weeks of gestation.",

    "abstract": "To report the outcome of dichorionic (DC) triplet pregnancies reduced to DC twins by laser ablation of the pelvic vessels of one of the monochorionic (MC) twins.\nIntrafetal laser embryo reduction (ER) from DC triplets to DC twins was carried out in 61 pregnancies at 11 + 0 to 14 + 3 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy outcome was examined.\nIntrafetal laser was successfully carried out in all cases, but ultrasound examination within 2 weeks of the procedure demonstrated that the MC cotwin had died in 28 (45.9%) cases and was alive in the other 33 (54.1%). In the DC group, there was one miscarriage at 23 weeks, one neonatal death after delivery at 26 weeks and in the other 31 cases there were two live births at a median gestational age of 35.3 (range, 30.4-38.4) weeks. In the 28 cases in which both MC fetuses died, there was one miscarriage at 16 weeks and in the other 27 cases the separate triplet was liveborn at a median gestation of 38.2 (range, 32.2-42.1) weeks. The overall rate of miscarriage was 3.3% (2/61) and that of preterm birth (PTB) at <\u200933 weeks was 6.8% (4/59).\nIn the management of DC triplet pregnancies, ER to DC twins by intrafetal laser ablation is associated with lower rates of miscarriage or early PTB, compared with expectant management or ER by fetal intracardiac injection of potassium chloride. However, about half of the pregnancies result in the birth of one rather than two babies. Copyright \u00a9 2017 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Tooth loss is a common health concern in older adults. We aimed to estimate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to the variation in the number of teeth in middle-aged and older populations using a population-based cohort of Danish twins. The study included 5,269 Danish middle-aged or older twins who provided data on the number of teeth at baseline by structured interviews. The data were analyzed using univariate liability threshold modeling, stratified by sex and age, to estimate familial risk of tooth loss as well as estimates of heritability. In the whole cohorts, 23% of participants were edentate and 53% had retained 20 or more teeth. A statistical model including additive genetic factors and environmental factors partly shared by co-twins and partly unique to each individual twin gave the best statistical fit for the number of teeth in both age categories as well as in men and women. Overall, additive genetic factors explained 36% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23% to 49%), common environmental factors 20% (95% CI: 9% to 31%), and unique environmental factors 44% (95% CI: 40% to 48%) of the total variation of the number of teeth. This study indicates that a substantial part of the variation in tooth loss is explained by genetic as well as environmental factors shared by co-twins. Our results implied that family background importantly affects tooth loss in both the middle-aged and the older populations. Family history is thus an important factor to take into account in dental health care.",

    "abstract": "Prematurity is associated with adverse outcomes. However, there are less data regarding long-term outcomes of twins based on gestational age at delivery. Our objective was to identify the association between gestational age at delivery and long-term outcomes in twins.\nAll patients with a twin pregnancy \u226524 weeks delivered by a single Maternal Fetal Medicine practice from 2005 to 2014 were surveyed regarding pediatric outcomes at or after 2 years of life. We excluded twins with aneuploidy or major fetal anomalies. The survey was mail-based, with phone follow-up for nonresponses or for clarification. Using logistic regression analysis, we compared long-term outcomes between twins born in four gestational age groups: 24 to 27-6/7 weeks, 28 to 31-6/7 weeks, 32 to 35-6/7 weeks, and 36 weeks or later.\nSix hundred fifty-three twin deliveries met inclusion criteria and 425 (65.1%) mothers responded. Mean age at the time of survey completion was 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4 years. Earlier gestational age was significantly associated with neonatal death (14, 2, 0, and 0% in the four groups, respectively, p\u2009<\u2009.001). Prematurity was associated with a composite of major adverse outcomes (death; cerebral palsy; necrotizing enterocolitis; chronic renal, heart, or lung disease) (14, 7, 4, and 2% in the four groups, p\u2009=\u2009.036), as well as minor adverse outcomes (learning disability; need for speech, occupational, or physical therapy) (83, 69, 54, and 38%, p\u2009<\u2009.001).\nLong-term morbidity in twin pregnancies is inversely related to gestational age at delivery. However, for twins born after 28 weeks, neonatal death and severe long-term morbidity are rare.",

    "abstract": "Primary invasive cutaneous aspergillosis is a rare fungal infection that occurs mostly in immunocompromised patients. Newborns of very low birth weight present a high risk for this type of infection due to an immaturity of the cutaneous barrier and of the immune system.\nWe describe here a case of simultaneous invasive cutaneous aspergillosis in two preterm twins.\u00a0Two male preterm bichorionic biamniotic twins (A & B) were born at a general hospital by spontaneous normal delivery at 24\u00a0weeks and 6\u00a0days of gestation. They were transferred to our hospital where they receive surfactant, antibiotics and hydrocortisone. Six days later, twin A showed greenish lesions in the umbilical region. The spectrum of antibiotic therapy was broadened and fluconazole was added. The umbilical catheters of the two twins were removed and replaced by epicutaneo-cava venous catheters and the cultures were positive for Aspergillus fumigatus. Fluconazole was replaced in both twins by liposomal amphotericin B and the incubators were changed. The serum galactomannan was also positive for both twins. At day 10, yellowish lesions appeared in the abdominal region in twin B. He died on day 18 following complications related to his prematurity. Concerning the twin A, serum galactomannan was negative on day 30; liposomal amphotericin B was stopped 1 week later, with a relay by econazole (cream). His condition improved and on day 66 he was transferred for follow-up at the general hospital where he was born.\nThe source of contamination by A. fumigatus was not identified, but other similar cases from the literature include construction work at or near the hospital, oximeter sensors, latex finger stalls, non-sterile gloves, humidifying chambers of incubators, bedding and adhesive tapes. The skin fragility of preterm newborns is an excellent potential entry point for environmental fungal infections. These cases highlight the importance of suspecting primary cutaneous aspergillosis in extremely low birth weight neonates with rapidly progressive necrotic lesions.",

    "abstract": "Societal gender inequality and a preference for male children has been shown to be detrimental to girls' health. This is despite females' innate biological advantage early in life. The negative effects of gender inequity on female health are most pronounced in resource-poor countries, where cultural norms supporting a preference for male children are strongest. However, most of what is known about gender inequality and child health comes from studies of singleton births. There is little evidence for how, or if, the disadvantages associated with gender bias and son preference extend to multiple births, a population inherently at risk for a number of health challenges. This analysis examines whether gender bias in health outcomes exists for twins. Data on live twin births from 38 Demographic and Health Surveys were compiled (n=11,528 individuals) and twins were categorized as girl/girl, girl/boy, boy/girl or girl/girl. Gender inequality was measured via the Gender Inequality Index. Multilevel logistic regression models examined associations between twin sex composition, gender inequality and eight outcomes of infant and child morbidity, mortality and mother's treatment-seeking behaviours. Twin pairs containing girls had significantly lower odds of first-year mortality. Higher country-level gender inequality was associated with higher odds of reporting diarrhoea and fever/cough, as well as an increased odds of post-neonatal mortality. Results suggest that the biological advantage for females may be stronger than son preference and gender inequality in the first year of life. Understanding these relationships has the potential to inform efforts to curb the influence of gender preference on the health of female children in resource-poor settings.",

    "abstract": "We report cases of gestational and congenital malaria with twin prematurity, low birth weight and bacterial co-infection. Congenital malaria is often misdiagnosed for lack of specific symptoms and a general lack of awareness of this presumably uncommon condition, and its diagnosis and prognosis become even more complex in the event of bacterial co-infections.\nA 35-weeks pregnant woman with sickle-cell disease and a history of spontaneous abortions was admitted at Vanga Hospital in DR Congo. She had fever (38.9\u00b0C) and microscopy-confirmed \nThis is a case of gestational and congenital malaria with prematurity, low birth weight and bacterial co-infection, but the patients were initially only treated for malaria based on their malaria-positive blood smears at birth.\nIn malaria-endemic areas, babies should be screened for congenital malaria. Even with a confirmed malaria infection in the new-born, it is important consider the possibility of bacterial co-infections.",

    "abstract": "Early and frequent cannabis use are associated with an increased likelihood of major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours. We identify associations between aspects of cannabis use, MDD, and suicidal thoughts and behaviours and examine whether such associations persist after accounting for those predisposing factors, including genetic liability and early family environment, that are shared by identical twins who are discordant for cannabis exposure. Any residual association in such identical pairs might be indicative of individual-specific pathways that might be of a causal nature.\nWe did a logistic regression analysis of cannabis use from retrospective data on same-sex male and female twin pairs drawn from 3 studies that had recruited twins from the Australian Twin Registry, 1992-93 (sample 1), 1996-2000 (sample 2), and 2005-09 (sample 3). We studied associations between early use and frequent use of cannabis and MDD, suicidal ideation (ever and persistent), and suicide plan and attempt in the full sample as well as in pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic twins that were discordant for each measure of cannabis involvement at a single timepoint. Significant monozygotic associations were further adjusted for covariates, such as early alcohol or nicotine use, early dysphoric or anhedonic mood, conduct disorder, and childhood sexual abuse. Interactions between each cannabis measure and sex, sample or study effects, and birth year category were also examined as covariates.\nIn 13\u2008986 twins (6181 monozygotic and 7805 dizygotic), cannabis use ranged from 1345 (30\u00b74%) of 4432 people in sample 1 to 2275 (69\u00b70%) of 3299 in sample 3. Mean age of first cannabis use ranged from 17\u00b79 years (SD 3\u00b73) in sample 3 to 21\u00b71 years (5\u00b72) in sample 1, and frequent use (\u2265100 times) was reported by 214 (15\u00b79%) of 1345 users in sample 1 and 499 (21\u00b79%) of 2275 in sample 3. The prevalence of suicidal ideation ranged from 1102 (24\u00b79%) of 4432 people in sample 1 to 1644 (26\u00b73%) of 6255 people in sample 2 and 865 (26\u00b72%) of 3299 people in sample 3. Prevalence of MDD ranged from 901 (20\u00b73%) people in sample 1 to 1773 (28\u00b73%) in sample 2. The monozygotic twin who used cannabis frequently was more likely to report MDD (odds ratio 1\u00b798, 95% CI 1\u00b711-3\u00b753) and suicidal ideation (2\u00b747, 1\u00b719-5\u00b710) compared with their identical twin who had used cannabis less frequently, even after adjustment for covariates. For early cannabis use, the monozygotic point estimate was not significant but could be equated to the significant dizygotic estimate, suggesting a possible association with suicidal ideation.\nThe increased likelihood of MDD and suicidal ideation in frequent cannabis users cannot be solely attributed to common predisposing factors.\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.",

    "abstract": "Associations between parenting and child outcomes are often interpreted as reflecting causal, social influences. However, such associations may be confounded by genes common to children and their biological parents. To the extent that these shared genes influence behaviours in both generations, a passive genetic mechanism may explain links between them. Here we aim to quantify the relative importance of passive genetic v. social mechanisms in the intergenerational association between parent-offspring relationship quality and offspring internalizing problems in adolescence.\nWe used a Children-of-Twins (CoT) design with data from the parent-based Twin and Offspring Study of Sweden (TOSS) sample [909 adult twin pairs and their offspring; offspring mean age 15.75 (2.42) years], and the child-based Swedish Twin Study of CHild and Adolescent Development (TCHAD) sample [1120 adolescent twin pairs; mean age 13.67 (0.47) years]. A composite of parent-report measures (closeness, conflict, disagreements, expressions of affection) indexed parent-offspring relationship quality in TOSS, and offspring self-reported internalizing symptoms were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in both samples.\nA social transmission mechanism explained the intergenerational association [r = 0.21 (0.16-0.25)] in our best-fitting model. A passive genetic transmission pathway was not found to be significant, indicating that parental genetic influences on parent-offspring relationship quality and offspring genetic influences on their internalizing problems were non-overlapping.\nThese results indicate that this intergenerational association is a product of social interactions between children and parents, within which bidirectional effects are highly plausible. Results from genetically informative studies of parenting-related effects should be used to help refine early parenting interventions aimed at reducing risk for psychopathology.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of perinatal outcomes often involves datasets with some multiple births. These are datasets mostly formed of independent observations and a limited number of clusters of size two (twins) and maybe of size three or more. This non-independence needs to be accounted for in the statistical analysis. Using simulated data based on a dataset of preterm infants we have previously investigated the performance of several approaches to the analysis of continuous outcomes in the presence of some clusters of size two. Mixed models have been developed for binomial outcomes but very little is known about their reliability when only a limited number of small clusters are present.\nUsing simulated data based on a dataset of preterm infants we investigated the performance of several approaches to the analysis of binomial outcomes in the presence of some clusters of size two. Logistic models, several methods of estimation for the logistic random intercept models and generalised estimating equations were compared.\nThe presence of even a small percentage of twins means that a logistic regression model will underestimate all parameters but a logistic random intercept model fails to estimate the correlation between siblings if the percentage of twins is too small and will provide similar estimates to logistic regression. The method which seems to provide the best balance between estimation of the standard error and the parameter for any percentage of twins is the generalised estimating equations.\nThis study has shown that the number of covariates or the level two variance do not necessarily affect the performance of the various methods used to analyse datasets containing twins but when the percentage of small clusters is too small, mixed models cannot capture the dependence between siblings.",

    "abstract": "Two cases of devastating fetal malformations associated with vanished monochorionic twins were identified upon review of pathology files. A 35-year-old G1P0 woman and 36-year-old G3P1 woman were both diagnosed with an intrauterine twin gestation via transvaginal ultrasound at 10 weeks. The spectrum of fetal anomalies ranged from omphalocele, bilateral upper extremity, and unilateral lower extremity hypoplasia, to craniofacial malformation with diaphragmatic hernia. On histopathologic examination, the placentas demonstrated vascular anastomoses between the surviving co-twin and the \"vanished\" fetal sac. We propose anastomotic placental vasculature as a contributing factor to the observed fetal malformations. Additionally, genetic or teratogenic factors may have been attributed to the demise of the first twin and the anomalies seen in the other twin. While such instances are rare, they are important to consider when counseling patients regarding outcomes associated with a monochorionic vanished twin.",

We report a case of a spontaneously conceived pregnancy who presented with first-trimester ultrasound finding of umbilical cord cyst and increased nuchal translucency in Twin A and no abnormalities in Twin B. Amniocentesis revealed 47,XY,+13 karyotype in Twin A and 46,XY karyotype in Twin B. Selective fetal reduction was performed for Twin A. Twin B was delivered at 32 weeks gestation with normal phenotype. Peripheral blood karyotype revealed 15% mosaicism for trisomy 13 and skin fibroblast revealed 46,XY karyotype. The surviving twin will be monitored for potential complication of uniparental disomy 13 and mosaic trisomy 13. This case reinforces the need for early ultrasound and nuchal translucency measurements, especially in twin gestations.",

    "abstract": "Using a qualitative monozygotic (MZ) twin differences design we explored whether adolescent MZ twins report discordant peer relationships and, if so, whether they perceive them as causes, consequences or correlates of discordant behaviour. We gathered free-response questionnaire data from 497 families and conducted in-depth telephone interviews with 97 of them. Within this dataset n = 112 families (23% of the sample) described discordant peer relationships. Six categories of discordance were identified (peer victimisation, peer rejection, fewer friends, different friends, different attitudes to friendship and dependence on co-twin). Participants described peer relationship discordance arising as a result of chance occurrences, enhanced vulnerability in one twin or discordant behaviour. Consequences of discordant peer relationships were seen as discordance in self-confidence, future plans, social isolation, mental health and interests. In all cases the twin with worse peer experiences was seen as having a worse outcome. Specific hypotheses are presented.",

    "abstract": "Neuroticism, a 'Big Five' personality trait, has been associated with sub-clinical traits of both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The objective of the current study was to examine whether causal overlap between ASD and ADHD traits can be accounted for by genetic and environmental risk factors that are shared with neuroticism. We performed twin-based structural equation modeling using self-report data from 12 items of the Neo Five-Factor Inventory Neuroticism domain, 11 Social Responsiveness Scale items, and 12 Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale items obtained from 3,170 young adult Australian individual twins (1,081 complete pairs). Univariate analysis for neuroticism, ASD, and ADHD traits suggested that the most parsimonious models were those with additive genetic and unique environmental components, without sex limitation effects. Heritability of neuroticism, ASD, and ADHD traits, as measured by these methods, was moderate (between 40% and 45% for each respective trait). In a trivariate model, we observed moderate phenotypic (between 0.45 and 0.62), genetic (between 0.56 and 0.71), and unique environmental correlations (between 0.37and 0.55) among neuroticism, ASD, and ADHD traits, with the highest value for the shared genetic influence between neuroticism and self-reported ASD traits (r g = 0.71). Together, our results suggest that in young adults, genetic, and unique environmental risk factors indexed by neuroticism overlap with those that are shared by ASD and ADHD.",

    "abstract": "The late neurologist and author, Oliver Sacks, published an insightful 1986 review of Marjorie Wallace's book, The Silent Twins, in the New York Times. Taking exception to his assertion about Sir Francis Galton, I wrote a letter to the Times' editor. The letter was unpublished, but it brought a wonderful response from Sacks himself that is reproduced and examined. Next, brief reviews of twin research concerning the vanishing twin syndrome (VTS), discordant sex in a monozygotic (MZ) twin pair, and multiple pregnancy outcomes from assisted reproductive technology (ART) are presented. This section is followed by popular coverage of superfetated twins, smoking-discordant co-twins, twins in fashion, Yale University twin hockey players, and a visiting professor who was a conjoined twin.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated an association between congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and microcephaly; however, to date, there have been no reports on the consequences of ZIKV infection on fetuses in twin pregnancies. Herein, we reported on the first case of a monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancy having ZIKV-related microcephaly. Our findings suggested that, in an MCDA twin pregnancy, the ZIKV may cause infection in both fetuses, resulting in severe abnormalities in the central nervous system due to neural cell destruction and the disruption of the normal development processes of the brain. This case report and other similar twin cases may help to understand the pathogenesis and to confirm the etiology of ZIKV as a teratogenic microorganism.",

    "abstract": "New born babies could suffer from multiple craniofacial abnormalities, such as Pierre Robin syndrome, which consists of micrognathia and relative macroglossia with or without cleft palate. Although Pierre Robin syndrome is well described in literature, only a few have mentioned its occurrence in identical twins. This paper presents a rare incident of full-term twin babies born with the sequence of Pierre Robin syndrome, which consists of micrognathia, cleft palate, and glossoptosis. Although it is a rare coincidence, Pierre Robin syndrome still can occur in identical twin babies. The treatment is a step-by-step approach, but all procedures are mainly directed to widening the pharyngeal space.",

    "abstract": "Craniopagus is a very rare congenital anomaly that tends to affect females more often than males. It is classified as partial or total. Most affected twins are either stillborn or die during the perinatal period. Those who survive birth should undergo detailed radiological evaluations soon after their condition becomes stable so that the precise anatomy of the conjoined part can be defined and surgery can be planned in detail by a multidisciplinary team. Recommendations for decreasing the risk of unsuccessful surgery include performing surgery on an elective basis after extensive preoperative radiological evaluations as well as when the twins are at an acceptable age and weight for a complex surgical separation, generally as staged procedures. In addition, the operation should be performed by a well-equipped expert multidisciplinary team. When one of the conjoined twins dies, however, surgical separation cannot be postponed because the shared circulatory system predisposes the alive child to life-threatening complications, including coagulopathy. The authors report on the successful separation of craniopagus twins performed on an emergency basis at 32 weeks of gestational age because of the sudden death of one of them. At the time of separation surgery, the twins each weighed 1250 g. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the youngest age and lowest weight yet reported for successful surgical separation. The surviving twin developed a pseudomeningocele, which required a second operation and placement of a cystoperitoneal shunt 4 months after the operation. Additional surgery is planned to repair a cranial defect that resulted from the pseudomeningocele, but his general physical and mental condition was otherwise good at latest follow-up (12 months after separation surgery).",

    "abstract": "Massive perivillous fibrinoid deposition (MFD) and maternal floor infarction (MFI) are lesions of unknown etiology associated with poor perinatal outcomes, including fetal intrauterine growth restriction and neurodevelopmental injury, high risks of pregnancy loss, and recurrence in subsequent gestations. MFI comprises massive intervillous fibrinoid deposition concentrated at the maternal floor. MFD is a similar lesion but is diffuse within the parenchyma. MFD/MFI lesions represent a spectrum of severity of cloak-like perivillous fibrinoid deposition, and there is mounting evidence that, often, they represent sequelae of immune-mediated phenomena and/or an imbalance in factors that normally maintain the fluidity of blood in the maternal space. There are only a handful of reported instances of discordant MFD/MFI occurrence in twin placentas. We present a fourth such occurrence in a fused, dichorionic diamniotic twin placenta and submit that our dizygotic twin gestation case provides additional supportive evidence that immune-mediated mechanisms are involved in the formation of pathological accumulations of fibrinoid, at least in some cases.",

    "abstract": "Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is the most common primary malignant neoplasm of the lung in children that is associated with a germline mutation in DICER1. In this report, we share an interesting case of a pair of monozygotic twins: one of them developed PPB when she was 4-year old, while the other developed acute transient hepatitis when she was 5-year old. Next-Gen sequencing for DICER1 mutations of their family revealed that both twins and their mother had c.C3675A mutation. The mother also had a history of multinodular goiter. Identification of DICER1 mutation carriers and close surveillance of individuals at risk for DICER1 syndrome may allow early detection and hence better outcome.",

    "abstract": "Incidental findings on structural cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are common in healthy subjects, and the prevalence increases with age. There is a paucity of data regarding incidental cerebral findings in twins. We examined brain MRI data acquired from community-dwelling older twins to determine the prevalence and concordance of incidental cerebral findings, as well as the associated clinical implications. Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0400) were drawn from the Older Australian Twins Study. T1-weighted and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) cerebral MRI scans were systematically reviewed by a trained, blinded clinician. Incidental findings were recorded according to pre-determined categories, and the diagnosis confirmed by an experienced neuroradiologist. Periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were scored visually. WMH heritability was calculated for those with the twin pair included in the study (n\u00a0=\u00a0320 individuals; monozygotic (MZ) =\u00a092 twin pairs,\u00a0dizygotic (DZ) =\u00a068 twin pairs). Excluding infarcts and WMH, a total of 47 (11.75%) incidental abnormalities were detected. The most common findings were hyperostosis frontalis interna (8 participants; 2%), meningiomas, (6 participants; 1.5%), and intracranial lipomas (5 participants; 1.25%). Only 3% of participants were referred for follow-up. Four twin pairs, all monozygotic, had lesions concordant with their twin. Periventricular WMH was moderately heritable (0.61, CI 0.43-0.75, p\u00a0=\u00a07.21E-08) and deep WMH highly heritable (0.80, CI 0.66-0.88, p\u00a0=\u00a01.76E-13). As in the general population, incidental findings on cerebral MRI in older twins are common, although concordance rates are low. Such findings can alter the clinical outcome of participants, and should be anticipated by researchers when designing trials involving cerebral imaging.",

Our rare case demonstrates striking similarities in both the timing and type of clinical manifestation, as well as in the underlying anatomy and the distribution of coronary artery disease. When premature coronary artery disease is found in one of a monozygotic twin pair, evaluating the other twin is a reasonable approach.",

    "abstract": "Single fetal death in a monochorionic twin pregnancy is more frequent than in a dichorionic twin gestation. Due to inter-twin vascular anastomosis in the monochorionic common placenta, the death of one twin causes a drop in blood pressure due to a shift of blood from the survivor to the dead fetus. If the drop of blood pressure is abrupt and serious, the survivor will die soon after (as occurs in 15% of cases). If the drop is less serious, the survivor may sustain ischemic injury (in about 26% of the cases) and if the drop in blood pressure is subtle, the survivor will be intact. Thus, 30% of survivors will sustain serious, mainly brain, injury - a significantly higher incidence than was previously reported. The diagnosis of single fetal demise in a monochorionic twin pregnancy is usually reached at an unknown interval from the co-twin's death and hence, damage has already occurred and there is no need for an untimely delivery of the survivor.",

    "abstract": "Contraction twinning in magnesium alloys leads to new grains that are misoriented from the parent grain by a rotation (56\u00b0, a). The classical shear theory of deformation twinning does not specify the atomic displacements and does not explain why contraction twinning is less frequent than extension twinning. The paper proposes a new displacive model in line with our previous work on martensitic transformations and extension twinning. A continuous angular distortion matrix that transforms the initial hexagonal close-packed (h.c.p.) crystal into a final h.c.p. crystal is determined such that the atoms move as hard spheres and reach the final positions expected by the orientation relationship. The calculations prove that the distortion is not a simple shear when it is considered in its continuity. The ({0{\\overline 1}1}) plane is untilted and restored, but it is not fully invariant because some interatomic distances in this plane evolve during the distortion process; the unit volume also increases up to 5% before coming back to its initial value when the twinning distortion is complete. Then, the distortion takes the form of a simple shear on the ({0{\\overline 1}1}) plane with a shear along the direction [{18,{\\overline 5},{\\overline 5}}] of amplitude 0.358. Experiments are proposed to validate or disprove the model.",

    "abstract": "We used quantitative genetic methods to evaluate whether sleep quality, pain, and depression symptoms share a common genetic diathesis, to estimate the genetic and environmental sources of covariance among these symptoms, and to test for possible causal relationships.\nA community sample of 400 twins from the University of Washington Twin Registry completed standardized self-report questionnaires. We used biometric modeling to assess genetic and environmental contribution to the association between sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, pain measured by the Brief Pain Inventory, and depression symptoms measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory. Trivariate Cholesky structural equation models were used to decompose correlations among the phenotypes.\nHeritability was estimated at 37% (95% confidence interval = 20%-51%) for sleep quality, 25% (9%-41%) for pain, and 39% (22%-53%) for depression. Nonshared environmental influences accounted for the remaining variance. The genetic correlation between sleep quality and pain had an rg value of .69 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33-0.97), rg value of .56 (95% CI = 0.55-0.98) between pain and depression, and rg value of .61 (95% CI = 0.44-0.88) between depression and sleep quality. Nonshared environmental overlap was present between pain and sleep quality as well as depression and sleep quality.\nThe link between sleep quality, pain, and depression was primarily explained by shared genetic influences. The genetic factors influencing sleep quality and pain were highly correlated even when accounting for depression. Findings support the hypothesis of a genetic link between depression and pain as well as potential causality for the association of sleep quality with pain and depression.",

    "abstract": "In France, an addictovigilance network is responsible for evaluating drug dependence, by drawing on pharmacoepidemiological studies, clinical studies and by assessing healthcare professionals' reports on problematic consumption.\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether zolpidem and zopiclone have different dependence profiles, based on healthcare professionals' reports, and to identify various consumer dependence profiles among zolpidem users and among zopiclone users. Dependence in reports was assessed using the EGAP scale; a scale developed using the DSM diagnostic dependence criteria.\nThe comparison of dependence profiles for zolpidem and zopiclone showed differences both in total EGAP score and EGAP item positivity. The descriptive analysis showed that EGAP scores were higher for zolpidem than for zopiclone, suggesting more severe problematic consumption with zolpidem. For zolpidem 2 subpopulations of consumers were identified, with one subpopulation's consumption being more severe than the other, with a significantly higher total EGAP score and more harmful consequences. No subpopulation was highlighted for zopiclone.\nThese results were in favour of a higher prevalence of physical and compulsive signs of dependence and of harmful consequences of dependence, with zolpidem than with zopiclone.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a common disorder with a high heritability, but its genetic architecture is still elusive. We implemented whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of 8 families with monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia to assess potential association of de novo mutations (DNMs) or inherited variants with susceptibility to schizophrenia. Eight non-synonymous DNMs (including one splicing site) were identified and shared by twins, which were either located in previously reported schizophrenia risk genes (p.V24689I mutation in TTN, p.S2506T mutation in GCN1L1, IVS3+1G\u00a0>\u00a0T in DOCK1) or had a benign to damaging effect according to in silico prediction analysis. By searching the inherited rare damaging or loss-of-function (LOF) variants and common susceptible alleles from three classes of schizophrenia candidate genes, we were able to distill genetic alterations in several schizophrenia risk genes, including GAD1, PLXNA2, RELN and FEZ1. Four inherited copy number variations (CNVs; including a large deletion at 16p13.11) implicated for schizophrenia were identified in four families, respectively. Most of families carried both missense DNMs and inherited risk variants, which might suggest that DNMs, inherited rare damaging variants and common risk alleles together conferred to schizophrenia susceptibility. Our results support that schizophrenia is caused by a combination of multiple genetic factors, with each DNM/variant showing a relatively small effect size.",

    "abstract": "Resting heart rate (RHR) possibly has a hereditary component and is associated with longevity. We used the classical biometric twin study design to investigate the heritability of RHR in a population of middle-aged and elderly twins and, furthermore, studied the association between RHR and mortality.\nIn total, 4282 twins without cardiovascular disease were included from the Danish Twin Registry, hereof 1233 twin pairs and 1816 'single twins' (twins with a non-participating co-twin); mean age 61.7 (SD 11.1) years; 1334 (31.2%) twins died during median 16.3 (IQR 13.8-16.5) years of follow-up assessed through Danish national registers. RHR was assessed by palpating radial pulse.\nWithin pair correlations for RHR adjusted for sex and age were 0.23 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.32) and 0.10 (0.03 to 0.17) for RHR in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, respectively. Overall, heritability estimates were 0.23 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.30); 0.27 (0.15 to 0.38) for males and 0.17 (0.06 to 0.28) for females. In multivariable models adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary function, smoking, physical activity and zygosity, RHR was significantly associated with mortality (eg, RHR >90\u2009vs 61-70 beats per min: all-cause HR 1.56 (95% CI 1.21 to 2.03); cardiovascular 2.19 (1.30 to 3.67). Intrapair twin comparison revealed that the twin with the higher RHR was significantly more likely to die first and the probability increased with increase in intrapair difference in RHR.\nRHR is a trait with a genetic influence in middle-aged and elderly twins free of cardiovascular disease. RHR is independently associated with longevity even when familial factors are controlled for in a twin design.",

    "abstract": "In different pathophysiological conditions plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) plasma concentrations are elevated. As dietary patterns are considered to influence PAI-1 concentration, we aimed to determine active PAI-1 plasma concentrations and mRNA expression in adipose tissue before and after consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) and the impact of additive genetic effects herein in humans. For 6 weeks, 46 healthy, non-obese pairs of twins (aged 18-70) received a normal nutritionally balanced diet (ND) followed by an isocaloric HFD for 6 weeks. Active PAI-1 plasma levels and PAI-1 mRNA expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue were assessed after the ND and after 1 and 6 weeks of HFD. Active PAI-1 plasma concentrations and PAI-1 mRNA expression in adipose tissue were significantly increased after both 1 and 6 weeks of HFD when compared to concentrations determined after ND (p < .05), with increases of active PAI-1 being independent of gender, age, or changes of BMI and intrahepatic fat content, respectively. However, analysis of covariance suggests that serum insulin concentration significantly affected the increase of active PAI-1 plasma concentrations. Furthermore, the increase of active PAI-1 plasma concentrations after 6 weeks of HFD was highly heritable (47%). In contrast, changes in PAI-1 mRNA expression in fatty tissue in response to HFD showed no heritability and were independent of all tested covariates. In summary, our data suggest that even an isocaloric exchange of macronutrients - for example, a switch to a fat-rich diet - affects PAI-1 concentrations in humans and that this is highly heritable.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the associations between night work, sleep and disability pension (DP) due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), while controlling for several confounding factors including both genetic factors and shared family background.\nThe study sample consisted of 27 165 Swedish twin individuals born in 1935-58 with comprehensive survey data on sociodemographic, health and lifestyle factors. Night work was assessed as years of working hours at night at least every now and then, and categorized into 'not at all, 1-10 years and over 10 years'. Data on DP with MSD (ICD-diagnoses M00-M99) were obtained from the National Social Insurance Agency. Follow-up was from the time of the interview in 1998-2003 until 2013. Information on the length and quality of sleep was available for a sub-sample of twins (n = 1684). Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nDuring the follow-up, 1338 (5%) participants were granted DP due to MSD. Both 1-10 years (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17-1.53) and over 10 years of night work (HR 1.39 95% CI 1.18-1.64) increased the risk of future DP. The associations were not affected by health, lifestyle or sleep factors. In the discordant twin pair analysis, the associations between night work and DP due to MSD attenuated.\nNight work was associated with increased risk of DP due to MSD independently from health and lifestyle factors. Familial confounding could not be ruled out.",

    "abstract": "One of the important challenges in surrogate pregnancies is the early bonding of genetic mother with her infant and the establishment of breastfeeding. A combination of pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods is often used for the induction of lactation. Reports of induced lactation in surrogacy are limited and scattered. In this report, we present a case of induced lactation and initiation of breastfeeding in preterm twins by the genetic mother, through her novel approach after a gestational surrogate pregnancy. Thematic approach of maternal account is summarized with context and rigor. We reviewed the reported literature of induced lactation in similar cases with an aim to address the various methods adopted.",

    "abstract": "We describe monozygotic twin girls with genetic variation at two separate loci resulting in a blended phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome and Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. These girls were diagnosed in early infancy with Prader-Willi syndrome, but developed an atypical phenotype, with apparent intellectual deficiency and lack of obesity. Array-comparative genomic hybridization confirmed a de novo paternal deletion of the 15q11.2q13 region and exome sequencing identified a second mutational event in both girls, which was a novel variant c.145+1G>A affecting a TCF4 canonical splicing site inherited from the mosaic mother. RNA studies showed that the variant abolished the donor splicing site, which was accompanied by activation of an alternative non-canonical splicing-site which then predicts a premature stop codon in the following exon. Clinical re-evaluation of the twins indicated that both variants are likely contributing to the more severe phenotypic presentation. Our data show that atypical clinical presentations may actually be the expression of blended clinical phenotypes arising from independent pathogenic events at two loci.",

    "abstract": "The current systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancies following multifetal pregnancy reduction (MPR) compared with non-reduced triplet pregnancies. All studies comparing perinatal outcome of twin pregnancies following MPR to non-reduced triplet pregnancies were considered. MEDLINE, non-indexed MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science were searched for relevant published articles up to August 2016. The search yielded 653 publications of which 92 were assessed for eligibility. A total of 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the outcomes of pregnancies following MPR were better compared with expectantly managed triplets. The MPR group delivered at a later gestational age and was less likely to be delivered before 32 or 28 weeks' gestation. Newborns in the MPR group had significantly higher birthweight at delivery (mean difference 500\u2009g [95% CI 439.95, 560.04]). Rates of pregnancy loss before 24 weeks' gestation and overall infant survival were comparable between the groups. This meta-analysis suggests that MPR of triplet pregnancies to twins is associated with improved perinatal outcome compared with non-reduced triplets. Should primary prevention of high order multiple pregnancy fail, MPR is an appropriate alternative to minimize the perinatal morbidity and mortality of triplet pregnancies.",

Intrafetal size discordance was defined as a difference between the actual gestational age calculated by ovum pickup (OPU) date and the evaluated gestational age by crown-rump length (CRL), for each twin. Intertwin size discrepancy was defined as a difference in CRL between the twins. The primary outcome was the number of live-born fetuses; the secondary outcome measures were gestational age at birth, birth weight percentile, and birth weight discordancy.\nA total of 277 women met the study criteria and were divided into three groups by outcome: 218 (78.7%) live-born twins, 41 (14.8%) live-born singleton, and 19 (6.5%) non-live-born pregnancy. Among the smaller than expected twin, the association of CRL-OPU differences with the primary outcome was significant for twin live-born delivery (-1.43\u00a0day), singleton live-born delivery (-4.12\u00a0days), and non-live-born pregnancy (-6.72\u00a0days). For the relatively larger twin, the association was significant for non-live-born pregnancy (-4.33\u00a0days) compared with any live-born delivery, either singleton (-0.95\u00a0days) or twin (-0.21\u00a0days).\nAmong IVF conceived twin gestations, a CRL-OPU gap was associated with an increased risk of a negative pregnancy outcome.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twinning is an embryological anomaly rarely reported in wild mammals and with only two previous records in Chiroptera. Here, we report a case of dicephalic parapagus conjoined twins in the Neotropical phyllostomid genus Artibeus. These twins are males and present separated heads and necks, but a conjoined trunk with an expanded upper thoracic region. They developed two complete forelimbs and two complete hindlimbs, all laterally to the trunk. There is a volume in the upper midback and between the heads that resembles a third rudimentary medial forelimb, but X-ray images only suggest the presence of medial skeletal elements of the pectoral girdle (clavicle and scapulae) in this region. The X-ray images also show that vertebral columns run separated from head until the base of lumbar region, where they form a single structure. Using ultrasound images, we detected the presence of two similarly sized and apparently separated hearts. The accumulation of study cases like this will help in the understanding of patterns and process behind this phenomena, and collection material plays a key role in this context.",

This case report presents three-dimensional (3D) palatal rugae analysis in monozygotic twins utilizing digital models obtained directly by scanning the maxillary dental arch with the iTero\u00ae intraoral digital scanner. The results show that the rugae patterns contain related but not identical features between the pair of identical twins. Dental study models taken on a regular basis for diagnosis and treatment planning in dentistry include the palatal rugae, which could be valuable to forensics in identical twin identification cases.",

    "abstract": "Cryptorchidism represents one of the most common human congenital anomalies. In most cases, its etiology remains unclear and seems to be multifactorial. In the present study, a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for cryptorchidism was identified. Twin zygosity was confirmed by microsatellite genotyping. Whole exome sequencing and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) of DNA extract from leucocytes were performed to, respectively, evaluate their exomes and epigenomes. No differences in exome sequencing data were found between the twins after validation. MeDIP-Seq analysis detected 5,410 differentially hypermethylated genes and 2,383 differentially hypomethylated genes. Bioinformatic analysis showed that these genes belonged to several biological processes and signaling pathways, including regulation of actin cytoskeleton, which has been previously implicated in the etiology of cryptorchidism. The findings of the present study suggest that non-genetic factors might contribute to the pathogenesis of cryptorchidism.",

    "abstract": "Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is known to occur in families. The reported overall incidence of familial cases is 7.6%, with a higher incidence of 15-21% in total colonic aganglionosis and 50% in the rare total intestinal aganglionosis. HSCR is extremely rare in twins. The aim of this study was to systematically analyse the patterns of HSCR in twins published in the literature.\nElectronic databases Pubmed and Medline were screened for relevant articles using the keywords \"Hirschsprung's disease\", \"aganglionosis\", \"twins\", \"monozygotic\", and \"dizygotic\". Examining reference lists identified further relevant papers.\nTwelve studies with a total of 18 twin pairs were included in this analysis. 67% twins were discordant. HSCR was found in 24 out of 36 twin subjects (67%), of which 83% affected were male. Rectosigmoid type was reported in 71% of patients, long-segment disease in 21, and 8% presented with a total aganglionosis. Three twin pairs had at least one family member affected with HSCR.\nHSCR was found in two-thirds of twin subjects with a male predominance. Rectosigmoid aganglionosis was the most common variant. Disease discordance was identified, where environmental insults were postulated to be predisposing factors to disease expression. Future studies investigating the disease-associated mutations in the already identified HSCR genes should provide insights into the genetic basis of HSCR in twins.",

    "abstract": "The choice of a growth curve determines the screening for small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses and little data is available on SGA twins. Our aim was to evaluate small-for-gestational-age (SGA) detection rate in twin pregnancies and assess whether the use of a customized curve allowed better identification of SGA fetuses.\nRetrospective study including all twins between 2010 and 2013. Two groups were formed: the SGA and the non-SGA group. Four curves were compared: Hadlock's curve, a customized curve, EPOP\u00e9 M0 and EPOP\u00e9 M1. We defined a composite neonatal complication criterion (transfer to intensive care unit, respiratory distress and death).\n472 fetuses were included with a 34.3% prevalence of SGA. Hadlock's curve showed better sensitivity for the detection of SGA <10th percentile (67.3% vs. 63%, 59.9% and 57.4% respectively). Diagnostic Odd Ratio were comparable for the detection of SGA. For the composite variable, there was a significant difference between the 2 groups using a customized curve adjusted for fetal sex (EPOP\u00e9 M1).\nThe EPOP\u00e9 (M0 and M1) and customized curves do not improve screening for SGA infants below the 10th percentile. The reduced effectiveness of customized curves can be related to the greater impact of placentation or cord insertion on the potential for fetal growth.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we use new data on Danish monozygotic (MZ) twins to analyze the effect of cultural capital on educational success. We report three main findings. First, cultural capital has a positive direct effect on the likelihood of completing the college-bound track in Danish secondary education. Second, cultural capital leads teachers to form upwardly biased perceptions of children's academic ability, but only when their exposure to children's cultural capital is brief (as in oral and written exams) rather than long (as in grades awarded at the end of the school year). Third, we find that the positive direct effect of cultural capital on educational success is higher for children from high-socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds than for those from low-SES backgrounds. This result suggests that high-SES children are more likely to be in schooling contexts that enable them to convert cultural capital into educational success.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to compare the placental weight and birth weight/placental weight ratio for intrauterine growth-restricted and non-intrauterine growth-restricted monochorionic and dichorionic twins.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of placentas from twin pregnancies. Placental weight and the birth weight/placental weight ratio were compared in intrauterine growth-restricted and non-intrauterine growth-restricted monochorionic and dichorionic twins. The association between cord insertion type and placental lesions in intrauterine growth-restricted and non-intrauterine growth-restricted monochorionic and dichorionic twins was also investigated.\nA total of 105 monochorionic (intrauterine growth restriction=40; non-intrauterine growth restriction=65) and 219 dichorionic (intrauterine growth restriction=57; non-intrauterine growth restriction=162) placentas were analyzed. A significantly lower placental weight was observed in intrauterine growth-restricted monochorionic (p=0.022) and dichorionic (p<0.001) twins compared to non-intrauterine growth-restricted twins. There was no difference in the birth weight/placental weight ratio between the intrauterine growth restriction and non-intrauterine growth restriction groups for either monochorionic (p=0.36) or dichorionic (p=0.68) twins. Placental weight and the birth weight/placental weight ratio were not associated with cord insertion type or with placental lesions.\nLow placental weight, and consequently reduced functional mass, appears to be involved in fetal growth restriction in monochorionic and dichorionic twins. The mechanism by which low placental weight influences the birth weight/placental weight ratio in intrauterine growth-restricted monochorionic and dichorionic twins needs to be determined in larger prospective studies.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease resulting from the trans-placental passage of maternal anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La, and less frequently anti-RNP antibodies to the foetus. At the time of diagnosis 50% of mothers are asymptomatic. Neonatal manifestations of this multisystem disease may include congenital heart block, cutaneous lesions and haematological abnormalities. We present the case of congenital neonatal lupus erythematosus in non-identical twins, showing variability in clinical manifestation of this disease,despite receiving the same level of antibodies from the mother. This case adds to the growing body of evidence about the role of genetics and other feto-maternal contributing factors in addition to the presence of auto antibodies. It raises interesting questions about discordant disease expression in offspring's of the same mother.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-eight-week-old preterm monochorionic-diamniotic twins were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit secondary to low birth weight and mild respiratory distress syndrome. A low fibrinogen level of less than 0.5\u2009g/L was detected following an abnormal full blood count. They required fibrinogen transfusions until 32 weeks corrected gestation to maintain adequate fibrinogen levels. Parental screening revealed that their mother had a previously undiagnosed hypofibrinogenaemia. Of note, her only symptom was menorrhagia. This may have implications on further pregnancies as it can be associated with spontaneous miscarriage and post-partum haemorrhage. Congenital hypofibrinogenaemia is a rare disorder and there are no reported cases from Ireland. A higher degree of suspicion for screening is required to detect new cases and demonstrates the benefits of checking parental levels in such situations.",

    "abstract": "Previous research shows that, besides risk factors in adult life, the early-life environment can influence blood pressure and hypertension in adults. However, the effects of residential traffic exposure and residential greenness in the early-life on blood pressure in young adulthood are currently unknown.\nAmbulatory (24-h) blood pressures of 278 twins (132 pairs) of the East Flanders Prospective Twins Study were obtained at the age of 18 to 25\u00a0years. Prenatal and adulthood residential addresses were geocoded and used to assign prenatal and postnatal traffic and greenness indicators. Mixed modelling was performed to investigate blood pressure in association with greenness while adjusting for potential confounding factors.\nNight-time systolic blood pressure was inversely associated with greenness at the residential address in twins living at the same address their entire life (non-movers, n\u00a0=\u00a097, 34.9%). An interquartile increase in residential greenness exposure (1000\u00a0m radius) was associated with a 3.59\u00a0mmHg (95% CI: -6.0 to -1.23; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) lower adult night systolic blood pressure. Among twins who were living at a different address than their birth address at time of the measurement (n\u00a0=\u00a0181, 65.1%), night-time blood pressure was inversely associated with residential surrounding greenness at adult age as well as with residential greenness in early-life. However after additional adjustment for residential greenness exposure in adulthood, only residential greenness exposure in early-life was significantly associated with night systolic blood pressure. While no significant effect of adult residential greenness with adult blood pressure was observed, while accounting for the early-life greenness exposure.\nLower residential greenness in the early-life environment was independently associated with a higher adult blood pressure. This indicates that residential greenness has persistent effects on blood pressure.",

    "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa has the world's highest under-5 and neonatal mortality rates as well as the highest naturally occurring twin rates. Twin pregnancies carry high risk for children and mothers. Under-5 mortality has declined in sub-Saharan Africa over the last decades. It is unknown whether twins have shared in this reduction.\nWe pooled data from 90 Demographic and Health Surveys for 30 sub-Saharan Africa countries on births reported between 1995 and 2014. We used information on 1\u2008685\u2008110 singleton and 56\u2008597 twin livebirths to compute trends in mortality rates for singletons and twins. We examined whether the twin-singleton rate ratio can be attributed to biological, socioeconomic, care-related factors, or birth size, and estimated the mortality burden among sub-Saharan African twins.\nUnder-5 mortality among twins has declined from 327\u00b77 (95% CI 312\u00b70-343\u00b75) per 1000 livebirths in 1995-2001 to 213\u00b70 (196\u00b77-229\u00b72) in 2009-14. This decline of 35\u00b70% was much less steep than the 50\u00b76% reduction among singletons (from 128\u00b76 [95% CI 126\u00b74-130\u00b78] per 1000 livebirths in 1995-2001 to 63\u00b75 [61\u00b76-65\u00b73] in 2009-14). Twins account for an increasing share of under-5 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa: currently 10\u00b77% of under-5 mortality and 15\u00b71% of neonatal mortality. We estimated that about 315\u2008000 twins (uncertainty interval 289\u2008000-343\u2008000) die in sub-Saharan African each year. Excess twin mortality cannot be explained by common risk factors for under-5 mortality, including birthweight. The difference with singletons was especially stark for neonatal mortality (rate ratio 5\u00b70, 95% CI 4\u00b75-5\u00b76). 51\u00b77% of women pregnant with twins reported receiving medical assistance at birth.\nThe fate of twins in sub-Saharan Africa is lagging behind that of singletons. An alarming one-fifth of twins in the region dies before age 5 years, three times the mortality rate among singletons. Twins account for a substantial and growing share of under-5 and neonatal mortality, but they are largely neglected in the literature. Coordinated action is required to improve the situation of this extremely vulnerable group.\nNone.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that for twin pregnancies with a cephalic presenting first twin, planned vaginal delivery is not associated with adverse short-term neonatal outcomes, as compared to planned cesarean delivery. Our objective was to compare long-term outcomes in twins, based on planned mode of delivery.\nThis was a prospective, observational cohort of twin pregnancies delivered by a single MFM practice. All the patients with a twin pregnancy >34 weeks delivered from 2005-2014 were surveyed regarding pediatric outcomes at or after 2 years of life. The survey was mail-based, with phone follow-up for nonresponses or for clarification of answers. Using chi-square, Student's t-tests, and regression analysis we compared outcomes between women who planned a vaginal (with active management of the second stage) versus cesarean delivery. The main outcome measures were: (1) a composite of major adverse outcomes (death, cerebral palsy, necrotizing enterocolitis, chronic renal, heart, or lung disease); (2) a composite of minor adverse outcomes (learning disability, speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy).\nFive hundred and thirty-two women met inclusion criteria and 354 (66.5%) responded. 178 (50.3%) women planned to have a cesarean delivery (100% of whom had a cesarean delivery) and 176 (49.7%) women planned to have a vaginal delivery (83% of whom had a vaginal delivery). The average age of the children at the time of the survey was 5.9 years. There were no differences in any pediatric outcomes between the two groups. After controlling for maternal age, IVF, obesity, and preeclampsia, the planned mode of delivery was not associated with a composite of major adverse outcomes (aOR 0.673, 95% CI 0.228, 1.985), nor a composite of minor adverse outcomes (aOR 0.767, 95% CI 0.496, 1.188).\nPlanned vaginal delivery with active management of the second stage of labor in twin pregnancies >34 weeks is not associated with adverse childhood outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To identify novel genetic and epigenetic factors associated with Myasthenia gravis (MG) using an identical twins experimental study design.\nThe transcriptome and methylome of peripheral monocytes were compared between monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant and concordant for MG, as well as with MG singletons and healthy controls, all females. Sets of differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated CpGs were validated using RT-PCR for expression and target bisulfite sequencing for methylation on additional samples.\n>100 differentially expressed genes and \u223c1800 differentially methylated CpGs were detected in peripheral monocytes between MG patients and controls. Several transcripts associated with immune homeostasis and inflammation resolution were reduced in MG patients. Only a relatively few genes differed between the discordant healthy and MG co-twins, and both their expression and methylation profiles demonstrated very high similarity.\nThis is the first study to characterize the DNA methylation profile in MG, and the expression profile of immune cells in MZ twins with MG. Results suggest that numerous small changes in gene expression or methylation might together contribute to disease. Impaired monocyte function in MG and decreased expression of genes associated with inflammation resolution could contribute to the chronicity of the disease. Findings may serve as potential new predictive biomarkers for disease and disease activity, as well as potential future targets for therapy development. The high similarity between the healthy and the MG discordant twins, suggests that a molecular signature might precede a clinical phenotype, and that genetic predisposition may have a stronger contribution to disease than previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twin pregnancies are at increased risk of complications due to sharing a single placenta and potentially developing unbalanced vascular anastomoses. Complications include twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) which affects 10-15% monochorionic twins, and if untreated has a 70-90% perinatal loss rate. We are currently unable to predict which twins will develop complications or to what severity. We have previously shown differences in angiogenic and placental growth factors in maternal blood in pregnancies complicated by TTTS compared to twin pregnancies not complicated by TTTS but matched for gestation. There is also evidence to suggest that abnormal ultrasound measurements recorded in the first trimester (nuchal translucency and crown-rump length) may be associated with severe TTTS later in pregnancy, however the detection rate is only reported as 52%. We hypothesize that if these changes precede the development of the clinical syndrome, this may increase the sensitivity and specificity of detecting adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nThis cohort study has retrospective and prospective elements. In the retrospective cohort we will measure factors (decided based on preliminary work and a systematic review and meta-analysis) in stored maternal blood samples taken in the first-trimester, extract first-trimester ultrasound measurements and match these to pregnancy outcome. The prospective cohort will be divided into a \"screening\" cohort and \"complicated\" cohort. The screening cohort will undergo serial maternal blood sampling at 12, 16 and 20 weeks; we will extract ultrasound measurements and match to pregnancy outcome. The complicated cohort will comprise of women referred to the Fetal Medicine Centre with complications of monochorionicity. If the decision is taken to undergo fetoscopic laser ablation we will take maternal blood samples and amniotic fluid samples pre- and post-laser treatment. The same factors will be measured in the prospective cohort as informed by the retrospective study.\nThis study aims to increase knowledge surrounding the pathology of complications in monochorionic twins, to aid future diagnosis and management.\nISRCTN 13114861 (retrospectively registered).",

Here, in a patient from a consanguineous family, we identified a homozygous mutation (c.G4343A, p.R1448Q) in SPAG17 by whole-exome sequencing. The encoded protein, SPAG17, localizes to the axonemal central apparatus and is considered essential for flagellar waveform. In silico analysis revealed that R1448Q is a potential pathogenic mutation. Immunostaining and western blot assays showed that the R1448Q mutation may exert a negative effect on the steady-state of the SPAG17 protein. Therefore, SPAG17 may be a new pathogenic gene causing AZS.",

    "abstract": "Forensic association of hair shaft evidence with individuals is currently assessed by comparing mitochondrial DNA haplotypes of reference and casework samples, primarily for exclusionary purposes. Present work tests and validates more recent proteomic approaches to extract quantitative transcriptional and genetic information from hair samples of monozygotic twin pairs, which would be predicted to partition away from unrelated individuals if the datasets contain identifying information. Protein expression profiles and polymorphic, genetically variant hair peptides were generated from ten pairs of monozygotic twins. Profiling using the protein tryptic digests revealed that samples from identical twins had typically an order of magnitude fewer protein expression differences than unrelated individuals. The data did not indicate that the degree of difference within twin pairs increased with age. In parallel, data from the digests were used to detect genetically variant peptides that result from common nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes expressed in the hair follicle. Compilation of the variants permitted sorting of the samples by hierarchical clustering, permitting accurate matching of twin pairs. The results demonstrate that genetic differences are detectable by proteomic methods and provide a framework for developing quantitative statistical estimates of personal identification that increase the value of hair shaft evidence.",

    "abstract": "A 200\u223c240\u2009kb SH2B1-containing deletion region on 16p11.2 is associated with early-onset obesity and developmental delay. Here, we describe monozygotic twin brothers with discordant clinical presentations. Intrauterine fetal growth restriction was present in both twins. Additionally, twin A exhibited coarctation of aorta, left ventricular noncompaction, atrial septal defect, pericardial effusion, left hydronephrosis, and moderate developmental delay, whereas twin B exhibited single umbilical artery. Chromosome microarray analysis was performed on both twins and their parents. An identical 244\u2009kb microdeletion on 16p11.2 including 9 Refseq genes, including SH2B1, was identified in the twins. The novel findings in monozygotic twins may expand the phenotypic spectrum of 16p11.2 microdeletion. Further studies are needed to strengthen the correlation between genotypes and abnormal clinical features.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the etiology of anorexia nervosa (AN). The co-twin control design is one of the most powerful methods available to evaluate environmental factors that could contribute to differences between monozygotic (MZ) twins who are discordant for AN. Using available data from a unique and rare sample of 22 Swedish female MZ pairs discordant for AN, we compared personality, life events, comorbidity, and health factors. Twins with AN had significantly higher perfectionism scores than unaffected co-twins and reported younger ages at first diet than unaffected co-twins who had dieted. Consistent with previous literature, more twins with AN reported gastrointestinal problems than unaffected co-twins. Although not significant due to low statistical power, more unaffected co-twins reported experiencing emotional neglect than twins with AN. Early dieting may be a harbinger of the development of AN or an early symptom. Higher perfectionism may represent a risk factor, sequela, or both. Sibling perception of neglect is noteworthy given the impact of an ill child with AN on family function and wellbeing. The health and wellbeing of siblings should be addressed clinically when one child in the family suffers from AN.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed our hospital protocol of vaginal delivery for twins and evaluated whether trial of vaginal delivery (unless contraindicated) was as safe as elective cesarean. Risk factors leading to failed trial of labor (TOL) were characterized to improve our ability to advise patients and select cases for TOL.\nThis retrospective, cohort study included women >32 weeks gestation, with twin A in cephalic presentation and no contraindications for vaginal delivery. Controls were women with twin pregnancy and planned cesarean delivery (PCD). Maternal and neonatal morbidity between TOL and PCD were compared. TOL group was subcategorized by vaginal or cesarean delivery to characterize pre-labor risk factors for failed TOL.\nOf the 411 twins, 215 had TOL and 196 had PCD. Among TOL, 196/215 (91%) delivered vaginally. TOL was more likely to have spontaneous pregnancy, pregnancy complications and tended to deliver earlier. More TOL had postpartum hemorrhage (p\u2009<\u2009.05), although transfusion rates in each group were similar. Neonatal outcomes between groups did not differ. Induction and gestational age at delivery were risk factors for failed TOL.\nThe results support the contemporary practice of TOL for twins at term when the first is in cephalic presentation with no other contraindications.",

    "abstract": "We examined the association between cognitive ability in young adulthood and dementia in Danish men, brothers, and male twins.\nIn total, 666,986 men born between 1939 and 1959 were identified for dementia diagnosis in national registries from 1969 to 2016. The association between cognitive ability from draft board examination and dementia was examined using Cox regression.\nDuring a 44-year follow-up, 6416 (0.96%) men developed dementia, 1760 (0.26%) and 970 (0.15%) of which were classified as Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, respectively. Low cognitive ability was associated with increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR]\nLow early-life cognitive ability increases the risk of dementia before the age of 78 years. The association is partly explained by shared family factors.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of Kawasaki disease (KD) remains unknown. However, many studies have suggested that specific genetic factors and/or some infectious agents underlie the onset of KD. Previous studies have suggested that human adenovirus (HAdV) is one of the triggering pathogens of KD. Here, we report monozygotic twin boys who sequentially developed KD in conjunction with acute HAdV type 3 (HAdV-3) infection.\nThe patients were four-year-old monozygotic twin boys. The elder brother developed a high fever and was diagnosed with HAdV infection with an immunochromatographic kit for HAdV (IC-kit). He was transferred to our institute after persistent fever for 7\u00a0days. On admission, he already fulfilled all the diagnostic criteria for KD. His laboratory data were as follows: WBC, 9700/\u03bcl; CRP, 2.42\u00a0mg/dl; IFN-\u03b3, 99.8\u00a0pg/ml; and TNF-\u03b1, 10.9\u00a0pg/ml. He received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin and responded well, with no coronary artery abnormalities. The younger brother, who was also IC-kit-positive, was hospitalized on the same day as his elder brother after persistent fever for 3\u00a0days. His data on admission were as follows: WBC, 12,600/\u03bcl; CRP, 5.54\u00a0mg/dl; IFN-\u03b3, 105.0\u00a0pg/ml; and TNF-\u03b1, 33.6\u00a0pg/ml. Although he developed all of the typical KD symptoms by day 4, his fever subsided spontaneously on day 6 without IVIG or aspirin. However, he developed a dilation of the coronary artery in the region of the left circumflex artery bifurcation on day 10. His coronary artery dilation had resolved 3\u00a0months after onset. HAdV-3 DNA was detected with PCR in stool samples from both patients, and HAdV3 was isolated from the younger brother's stool sample. Serum neutralizing antibodies to AdV3 were also significantly elevated in both patients, suggesting seroconversion.\nThere have been few reports of the simultaneous development of KD in monozygotic twins. Notably, both twins had an acute HAdV-3 infection immediately before they developed KD. These cases strongly suggest that KD was triggered by HAdV-3 infection, and they indicate that specific immune responses to some pathogens (such as HAdV-3), arising from genetic susceptibility, play a critical role in the pathogenesis of KD.",

To emphasize the congenital theory, we report a pair of identical twins both with atlantoaxial dislocation and os odontoideum, which is believed to be a congenital defect.\nWe present two 14-year-old identical twins with atlantoaxial dislocation and os odontoideum. Neither of the twins had history of trauma in head nor cervical spine. We reviewed and compared the cervical radiographs of the identical twins. Posterior atlantoaxial reduction, pedicle screw fixation and atlantoaxial fusion were performed for the two twins.\nRadiological examination showed the identical twins had typical atlantoaxial dislocation and os odontoideum. The twins had high similarity in the appearance of atlantoaxial dislocation and os odontoideum. The etiology of the os odontoideum in the twins is believed to be congenital. Both the twins had improvement in neurological function after surgery.\nAlthough a great number of cases with os odontoideum have been reported to be traumatic, there are some cases believed to be congenital.",

    "abstract": "Tryptophan metabolism plays a crucial role in mediating gastrointestinal function. Here, in order to absolutely quantify tryptophan and its metabolites, a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based targeted metabolomics approach was developed using N-dimethyl-/N-diethyl-amino naphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride (Dns/Dens-Cl) as twins labeling (TL) reagents. Dns-Cl is famous in amine and phenol derivations, and structure is similar with Dens-Cl. The introduction of easily protonated moiety of tertiary ammonium-containing part in the derivatives from Dns to tryptophan and its metabolites not only improved the LC separation but also enhanced their MS response. In addition, the Dens labeled standards were used as internal standards to compensate for matrix effects and ensure accurate quantifications. With the proposed method, twelve metabolites in tryptophan pathway could be detected at sub-ng/mL levels using only 20\u03bcL rat serum (the limit of detection could reach 3pg/mL for tryptamine, N-acetyl-serotonin and 6-hydroxymelatonin). The sensitivity was enhanced about 1-2 orders of magnitude compared with non-derivatization method. Focusing on tryptophan pathway, the method was successfully applied to determine the absolute serum concentrations of twelve tryptophan metabolites in a vincristine-induced ileus rat model. A significant down-regulation of the tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway and up-regulation of serotonin pathway were uncovered. Our findings provide a deeper insight into the mechanism of gastrointestinal dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "To investigate longitudinal associations of smoking and a change in smoking status with leisure-time physical inactivity. In addition, to control whether familial confounding (genetics and shared environment) influences the associations.\nData were based on the population-based Finnish Adult Twin Cohort of 5254 twin individuals born in 1945-1957 (41% men) and who participated in all four surveys over a 35-year follow-up (1975-2011). Logistic and conditional logistic regression models with multiple covariates were used for analyses.\nCompared to never-smokers, long-term daily smokers (1975-1990) had the highest likelihood for both long-term inactivity and to change into inactive by 2011. Recurrent smoking was associated with long-term inactivity. Instead, in comparison to persistent daily smokers, quitting smoking decreased the likelihood of becoming physically inactive at leisure time. The associations remained in the analyses which accounted for multiple covariates and/or familial confounding.\nDaily smoking increases the likelihood of remaining or becoming physically inactive over the decades. Our results emphasize not only the importance of preventing smoking initiation, but also to support early smoking cessation in promotion of lifelong physical activity.",

    "abstract": "To explore the hypothesis that selective placental pathology affecting the nonpresenting twin is a significant contributory factor mediating the smaller size at birth of nonpresenting dichorionic twins.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of all dichorionic twin deliveries in a single tertiary center between 2002 and 2015 where by departmental policy, all placentas from multifetal gestations are routinely sent for pathologic examination. Maternal charts, neonatal charts, and pathology reports were reviewed. Placental abnormalities were classified into lesions associated with maternal vascular malperfusion, fetal vascular malperfusion, placental hemorrhage, and chronic villitis. Comparison of neonatal outcomes and placental abnormalities was made between all nonpresenting and all presenting twins as well as within twin pairs.\nA total of 1,322 women with dichorionic twins were studied. Nonpresenting twins were smaller at birth compared with the presenting cotwin starting at 32 weeks of gestation (birth weight [\u00b1standard deviation] 2,224\u00b1666 g compared with 2,278\u00b1675 g, P=.036). Nonpresenting twins had smaller placentas (361\u00b1108 g compared with 492\u00b1129 g, P<.001) as early as 24 weeks of gestation. Nonpresenting twins had higher odds for any placental abnormality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.63-2.23), small placenta (adjusted OR 4.69, 95% CI 3.75-5.88), and maternal vascular malperfusion (OR 2.75, 95% CI 2.32-3.27) compared with their presenting cotwins. In nonpresenting twins, the presence of maternal vascular malperfusion pathology was associated with lower birth weight compared with their presenting cotwin during the third trimester.\nThe lower birth weight of nonpresenting fetuses in dichorionic twin pregnancies is correlated with a higher rate of placental maternal vascular malperfusion pathology.",

    "abstract": "Hall (Embryologic development and monozygotic twinning. Acta Geneticae Medicae et Gemellologiae, Vol. 45, 1996, pp. 53-57) hypothesized that chromosomal aberrations can lead to monozygotic (MZ) twinning. However, twinning and chromosomal aberrations increase prenatal mortality and could reduce the prevalence of chromosomal aberrations in live-born twins. We compared prevalence proportion ratios (PPR) of chromosomal aberrations and trisomy 21 (T21) in live-born twins versus singletons born in Denmark during 1968-2009.\nWe linked the Danish Twin Registry and a 5% random sample of all singletons to the Danish Cytogenetic Central Register and calculated PPR adjusted for maternal age for MZ, dizygotic (DZ), and all twins versus singletons. Zygosity was based on questionnaires or genetic markers.\nNo overall difference in risk of chromosomal aberrations or T21 in twins versus singletons was found. PPR in MZ and DZ twins was 0.87 (95% CI [0.60, 1.27]) and 1.05 (95% CI [0.88, 1.27]), respectively. For T21 there was a tendency to a lower prevalence in MZ twins compared to singletons (PPR: 0.29, 95% CI [0.07, 1.14]), whereas PPR was significantly increased in DZ twins (1.62, 95% CI [1.20, 2.19]). The observed proportion of MZ twin pairs among twin pairs with aberrations (0.22, 95% CI [0.16, 0.28]) was significantly lower than the proportion expected from the Weinberg method (0.32, 95% CI [CI, 0.26, 0.39]).\nBased on databases providing complete national coverage on twins with chromosomal aberrations, we found no overall difference in risk of chromosomal aberrations or T21 in twins versus singletons. Around conception twins may have an increased risk of chromosomal aberrations, but loss of especially MZ embryos could lead to similar risk among live-born twins and singletons.",

Around conception twins may have an increased risk of chromosomal aberrations, but loss of especially MZ embryos could lead to similar risk among live-born twins and singletons.",

PPR in MZ and DZ twins was 0.87 (95% CI [0.60, 1.27]) and 1.05 (95% CI [0.88, 1.27]), respectively. For T21 there was a tendency to a lower prevalence in MZ twins compared to singletons (PPR: 0.29, 95% CI [0.07, 1.14]), whereas PPR was significantly increased in DZ twins (1.62, 95% CI [1.20, 2.19]). The observed proportion of MZ twin pairs among twin pairs with aberrations (0.22, 95% CI [0.16, 0.28]) was significantly lower than the proportion expected from the Weinberg method (0.32, 95% CI [CI, 0.26, 0.39]).",

    "abstract": "The comparison of traits in twins from opposite-sex (OS) and same-sex (SS) dizygotic twin pairs is considered a proxy measure of prenatal hormone exposure. To examine possible prenatal hormonal influences on anthropometric traits, we compared mean height, body mass index (BMI), and the prevalence of being overweight or obese between men and women from OS and SS dizygotic twin pairs.\nThe data were derived from the COllaborative project of Development of Anthropometrical measures in Twins (CODATwins) database, and included 68,494 SS and 53,808 OS dizygotic twin individuals above the age of 20\u00a0years from 31 twin cohorts representing 19 countries. Zygosity was determined by questionnaires or DNA genotyping depending on the study. Multiple regression and logistic regression models adjusted for cohort, age, and birth year with the twin type as a predictor were carried out to compare height and BMI in twins from OS pairs with those from SS pairs and to calculate the adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for being overweight or obese.\nOS females were, on average, 0.31\u00a0cm (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20, 0.41) taller than SS females. OS males were also, on average, taller than SS males, but this difference was only 0.14\u00a0cm (95% CI 0.02, 0.27). Mean BMI and the prevalence of overweight or obesity did not differ between males and females from SS and OS twin pairs. The statistically significant differences between OS and SS twins for height were small and appeared to reflect our large sample size rather than meaningful differences of public health relevance.\nWe found no evidence to support the hypothesis that prenatal hormonal exposure or postnatal socialization (i.e., having grown up with a twin of the opposite sex) has a major impact on height and BMI in adulthood.",

OS males were also, on average, taller than SS males, but this difference was only 0.14\u00a0cm (95% CI 0.02, 0.27).

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins are at risk of severe complications including twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) and acute peripartum TTTS. The pathophysiology is based on inter-twin blood transfusion through placental vascular anastomoses. Areas covered: This review focuses on the incidence, management and outcome of neonatal hematological complications at birth in TTTS, TAPS and acute peripartum TTTS. Expert commentary: Hematological disorders are often present at birth in monochorionic twins and include acute or chronic anemia, polycythemia and thrombocytopenia. Routine measurement of complete blood counts in all complicated monochorionic twins is strongly recommended. Increased awareness on these disorders and correct diagnostic tests will lead to prompt and adequate management at birth.",

    "abstract": "Sotos syndrome is a congenital overgrowth disorder characterized by facial gestalt, excessively rapid growth, acromegalic features and a non-progressive cerebral disorder with intellectual disability.\nThe identical male twins showed somewhat different clinical, cognitive and behavioural phenotypes. Abnormal clinical manifestations including seizures, scoliosis, enlarged ventricles, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were found in the proband (first twin), but not in the sibling (second twin). We used diagnostic exome sequencing (DES) to identify a heterozygous de novo mutation of the NSD1 gene in monozygotic twins with Sotos syndrome.\nDES revealed a novel nonsense mutation c.2596G>T (p.Glu866*) of the NSD1 gene in the proband, the first of monozygotic twins. Sanger sequencing analysis of the proband and his family members showed that this nonsense mutation was present in the proband and his sibling, but was absent in their parents, indicating that it occurred with de novo origin.\nThis finding expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with variable expression of the Sotos syndrome caused by NSD1 mutation, and it adds further support for postconceptual mutation, epigenetic change and/or an environmental factor involved in the cause of the Sotos syndrome.",
