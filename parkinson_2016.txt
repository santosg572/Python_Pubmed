    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic debilitating disease affecting approximately 1% of the population over the age of 60. The severity of PD is correlated to the degree of dopaminergic neuronal loss. Apomorphine has a similar chemical structure as the neurotransmitter dopamine and has been used for the treatment of advanced PD patients. In PD patients, apomorphine is normally administered subcutaneously with frequent injections because of the compound's extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism. There is, hence, a large unmet need for alternative administrative routes for apomorphine to improve patient compliance. The present review focuses on the research and development of alternative delivery of apomorphine, aiming to highlight the potential of non-invasive apomorphine therapy in PD, such as sublingual delivery and transdermal delivery.",

    "abstract": "Objective measures of Parkinson's disease (PD) are needed for purposes of diagnosis and prognostication, as well as identification of those at risk of PD. In this qualitative review, we provide an overview of the current state of the field of PD biomarker development, delineate challenges, and discuss how the field is evolving.\nA search of PubMed was conducted for articles pertaining to objective biomarkers for PD. Articles were selected based on relevance and methodology; where available, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and comprehensive qualitative review articles were preferentially referenced.\nThere are several potential sources of objective PD biomarkers including biofluids, peripheral tissue, imaging, genetics, and technology based objective motor testing. Approaches to biomarker identification include the candidate biomarker approach and unbiased discovery methods, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Several emerging techniques hold promise in each of these areas. Advances in technology and bioinformatics, and the increasing availability of biobanks, are expected to facilitate future PD biomarker development.\nThe field of objective biomarkers for PD has made great progress but much remains to be done in translating putative biomarkers into tools useful in the clinic and for research. Multimodal biomarker platforms have the potential to capitalize on the utility and strengths of individual biomarkers. Rigorous methodology and standards for replication of findings will be key to meaningful progress in the field.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) may benefit from objective quantification of the separate movement components of bradykinesia (i.e., velocity, amplitude, and rhythm). This study evaluated the sensitivity and reliability of parameters derived from recently available optical hand tracking techniques for patient-friendly, automated quantification of bradykinesia of the upper extremity in PD.\nFifty-seven patients with PD and 57 healthy individuals (controls) performed repetitive finger tapping (RFT), alternating hand movements (AHM), and alternating forearm movements (AFM). Movement components of bradykinesia (i.e., velocity, frequency, amplitude, hesitations, and halts) were quantified using optical hand tracking. Reliability was quantified using intraclass correlation coefficients in a subgroup of 12 patients with PD and 12 controls (test-retest) and in all 57 controls (intra-trial).\nRFT and AHM were successfully recorded in 94% of all participants. Movement components differed between patients with PD and controls and were correlated with clinical ratings. Velocity and halt duration appeared to be most useful (i.e., the largest difference between the PD and control groups, good reliability) for the quantification of RFT, whereas frequency appeared to be most useful for the quantification of AHM. Other variables, such as frequency and amplitude of RFT, showed poor test-retest reliability, because they were susceptible to changes in movement strategy. AFM was excluded from the analysis because of problems with hand recognition.\nNovel optical hand tracking techniques yield promising results for patient-friendly quantification of bradykinesia of the upper extremity in PD. Future work should aim to optimize optical hand tracking and reduce susceptibility to changes in strategy.",

    "abstract": "In our clinical experience, people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) and their caregivers have difficulty understanding the complexities of the disease, which has a multitude of symptoms and involved therapies. We undertook a needs assessment to understand the need for, and to guide the development of, an educational tool.\nWe invited PwP, caregivers and health care providers (HCP) from across Canada to participate in an online survey to determine the need and desired content for such a tool.\nRespondents included 450 PwP, 335 caregivers, and 96 HCP from across Canada. 86.5% of HCP reported that it was \"very important\" for patients to understand issues in PD and 84.4% would use a visual aid to explain these issues. Results showed that 81.9-95.7% of caregivers and PwP were not \"very satisfied\" with the explanations of all domains in PD. Non-motor symptoms and cognitive issues were highly ranked by all groups as difficult to understand or explain. Older PwP (those with PD for less than 5\u00a0years and those who reported that their HCP spent less than 15\u00a0minutes counselling in each clinic visit) were less likely to fully understand and be satisfied with the explanations of most issues in PD.\nThere is a need for better patient education when discussing PD issues in the clinical setting. Older PwP that have been recently diagnosed have the greatest educational needs. Potential users indicate that a visual aid would help and non-motor symptoms, particularly cognitive issues, need to be a focus of such a tool.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and their partners report deterioration in their sexual life. Sexual dysfunction (SD), an important and often ignored aspect, is common in PD. Motor and nonmotor symptoms are involved in limiting pleasure and disturbing function. Sexual dissatisfaction is more common in men that in women. Frequently, both patients and partners have SD associated with PD, and both need suitable treatment. These issues need to be evaluated by neurologists or PD nurses and by specialized sex therapists. The objectives of this study were to describe the complexity and multidimensional nature of sexual problems in PD, enable practitioners to assess and treat sexual difficulties of their patients, and increase awareness of the role of sex therapy in the therapeutic process of PD.\nBased on clinical experience of over 30 years in movement disorder clinics and a review of the literature, the authors suggest practical approaches, including an \"Open Sexual Communication\" module, prescribing medications, and/or referring to specialists.\nThe longitudinal nature of treating neurologic patients puts physicians in an important position to introduce sexual issues and to assess and plan the interventions and follow-up needed to ensure that sexual difficulties are resolved. The management of hypersexuality requires a thoughtful distinction between lack of opportunities for sexual expression, limited ability to perform, and true hypersexuality. Sex therapists have a major role in the assessment and treatment of the multiple factors that may underlie sexual dissatisfaction in PD, differentiating between hypersexual behaviors and other sexual preoccupation behaviors, and training the professional team.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be challenging early in the disease course, when motor features are subtle. The objective of this study was to explore the diagnostic value of combining acute levodopa challenge and olfactory testing to predict PD.\nData from 210 patients with a recent onset of parkinsonism who had at least 2 years of follow-up and underwent acute levodopa challenge for the clinical prediction of long-term dopaminergic response and had olfactory testing with Sniffin' Sticks Test were evaluated. Single and combined diagnostic measures were analyzed.\nAfter 2 years of follow-up, a PD diagnosis was confirmed in 157 patients who fulfilled United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria and was ruled out in 53. Sensitivity and specificity of acute levodopa challenge to predict PD diagnosis were 0.71 and 0.94, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of olfactory tests were calculated according to the total olfactory score for hyposmia (0.61 and 0.77 respectively), the hyposmia identification subscore (0.63 and 0.74, respectively), and the anosmia score (0.40 and 0.85, respectively). The best combination identified was response to acute levodopa challenge together with hyposmia according to the total olfactory score (sensitivity, 0.90; specificity, 0.74; positive predictive value, 0.91; negative predictive value, 0.72; accuracy, 0.86).\nThe combination of response to acute levodopa challenge with hyposmia according to the total olfactory score improved sensitivity for the early diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "The majority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have handwriting abnormalities. Micrographia (abnormally small letter size) is the most commonly reported and easily detectable handwriting abnormality in patients with PD. However, micrographia is perhaps the tip of the iceberg representing the handwriting abnormalities in PD. Digitizing tablet technology, which has evolved over the last 2 decades, has made it possible to study the pressure and kinematic features of handwriting. This has resulted in a surge of studies investigating graphomotor impairment in patients with PD.\nThe objectives of this study were to review the evolution of the kinematic analysis of handwriting in PD and to provide an overview of handwriting abnormalities observed in PD along with future directions for research in this field. Articles for review were searched from the PubMed and SCOPUS databases.\nDigitizing tablet technologies have resulted in a shift of focus from the analysis of only letter size to the analysis of several kinematic features of handwriting. Studies based on the kinematic analysis of handwriting have revealed that patients with PD may have abnormalities in velocity, fluency, and acceleration in addition to micrographia.

    "abstract": "Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) were developed as standard tools to rate Parkinson's disease (PD) and drug-induced dyskinesias of PD. As these scales have become widely used, there is a need for translation to non-English languages. Here we present the standardization for the Turkish translations.\nThe scales were translated into Turkish and then back-translated to English. These back-translations were reviewed by the MDS team. After cognitive pretesting, movement disorder specialists from nine centers tested 352 patients for MDS-UPDRS, and 250 patients for UDysRS. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were used to determine if the factor structures for the reference standards could be confirmed in the Turkish data. The comparative fit indexes (CFIs) for the scales were required to be 0.90 or higher. Exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) were conducted to explore the underlying factor structure without the constraint of a pre-specified factor structure.\nFor both scales, the CFIs were 0.94 or greater as compared to the reference standard factor structures. The factor structures were consistent with that of reference standards, although there were some differences in some areas as compared to the EFA of the reference standard dataset. This may be due to the inclusion of patients with different stages of PD and different cultural properties of raters and patients.\nThese results demonstrate that the Turkish translations of MDS-UPDRS and UDysRS have adequate clinimetric properties. They are established as the official translations and can be reliably used in Turkish speaking populations.",

    "abstract": "The cause of PD at present remains unknown. A number of epidemiological studies have been conducted across the globe to ascertain the disease burden and the possible risk factors. In this review, we analyze the various studies from East and West with an aim to observe the important similarities and differences in the disease occurrence and risk factor profile.\nA comprehensive search of descriptive and analytical epidemiological studies was undertaken. The descriptive studies and meta-analysis providing the standardised population rates were selected. The demographics, ethnicity and geographical differences between East and West were analysed. In analytical epidemiology, more established and well-studied non-genetic risk factors for PD were reviewed utilising the prospective cohort studies, case control studies and meta-analysis where available.\nPD is more common with increasing age and shows male predominance, which is more obvious in Western studies. The PD prevalence and incidence rates are slightly lower in the East compared to the West. Incidence studies on different ethnic populations in the same country have also found a lower occurrence of PD amongst Easterners compared to Westerners. Setting methodological differences aside, studies from East and West suggest a role for both environmental and genetic risk factors in PD causation. Smoking, caffeine intake and pesticide exposure are well-established risk factors across regions. There is a robust data for dairy product consumption, urate levels and physical activity in the West while studies on certain risk factors like head injury and alcohol show conflicting and mixed results.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) successfully protects against dopaminergic neuronal death in the nigrostriatal pathway of a Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration; however, the mechanism has yet to be identified. Therefore, in this study we used two-dimensional electrophoresis to investigate the effects of KRG on the changes in protein expression in the substantia nigra (SN) of MPTP-treated mice.\nMale C57BL/6 mice (9 wk old) were intraperitoneally administered MPTP (20\u00a0mg/kg) four times at 2-h intervals, after which KRG (100\u00a0mg/kg) was orally administered once a day for 5 d. Two hours after the fifth KRG administration, a pole test was conducted to evaluate motor function, after which the brains were immediately collected. Survival of dopaminergic neurons was measured by immunohistochemistry, and protein expression was measured by two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blotting.\nKRG alleviated MPTP-induced behavioral dysfunction and neuronal toxicity in the SN. Additionally, the expression of eight proteins related to neuronal formation and energy metabolism for survival were shown to have changed significantly in response to MPTP treatment or KRG administration. KRG alleviated the downregulated protein expression following MPTP administration, indicating that it may enhance neuronal development and survival in the SN of MPTP-treated mice.\nThese findings indicate that KRG may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of patients with PD.",

Sleep related problems received little attention until the last three decades. Sleep disorders seen in PD patients include insomnia, excessive sleepiness, restless legs syndrome, REM sleep behavior disorder. Some of these can have significant impact and lower the quality of life in these patients. An understanding of sleep issues in PD can help identify them early and result in optimal management.",

    "abstract": "Early in the course of Parkinson disease (PD), treatment usually goes well. However, after five to ten years, things start to change as treatment requires higher doses of medications and side effects become more problematic. One of the most difficult problems is the development of hallucinations or delusions. Throughout the 20th century, treatment options were unproven and unsatisfactory, but the past 20 years have brought important changes. Two medications that are well tolerated in PD have now proved efficacious in randomized, controlled trials, and others are in development. Here I summarize this history briefly and provide a general plan for treating the patient with PD complicated by psychotic symptoms.\nFrue dum la evoluado de malsano de Parkinson (MP), traktado kutime sukcesas. Tamen, post kvin a\u016d dek jaroj, la stato komencas \u015dan\u011di pro tio, ke la paciento bezonas pli altaj dozoj de medikamentoj, kaj kromefikoj fari\u011das pli problemaj. Unu el la plej seriozaj problemoj estas la apero de halucinoj a\u016d iluzioj. Dum la 20-a jarcento, kuracadoj estis nepruvita kaj nekontentiga, sed la pasintaj 20 jaroj alportis gravajn \u015dan\u011dojn.

    "abstract": "Differences between standard dysarthria treatment and the same treatment with the integration of neurodynamic techniques tailored to the severity of dysarthria in patients with Parkinson's disease were examined.\nIn total, 10 subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and rigid-hypokinetic dysarthria were enrolled in this quasi-randomized, controlled, single-blind, pre-post study. In each of 12 therapy sessions the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a05) received standard dysarthria treatment (usual care), while the intervention group (n\u00a0=\u00a05) received the same treatment with the addition of integrated neurodynamic treatment (special care).\nThere was no significant difference between the two groups for either the pre-test (p\u00a0=\u00a00.739) or the post-test (p\u00a0=\u00a00.156) results. However, significant differences between the pre-test and post-test results within each group (intervention group p\u00a0=\u00a00.001; control group p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) were found.\nThe significant differences in the pre-post comparison within the groups may indicate a high probability of a positive effect of standard dysarthria treatment on the severity of dysarthria. In between-group comparisons, the study results indicated no evidence of a significant difference between standard dysarthria treatment with or without neurodynamics. Due to the small sample size, the effectiveness of the integration of neurodynamics into speech therapy cannot be definitively concluded for now. In order to be able to have generalized applicability, future studies with larger numbers of participants are required.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to characterize risk in children with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome by comparing those who had experienced a life-threatening event (LTE) with a control population.\nChildren with WPW syndrome are at risk of sudden death.\nThis retrospective multicenter pediatric study identified 912 subjects\u00a0\u226421 years of age with WPW syndrome, using electrophysiology (EPS) studies. Case subjects had a history of LTE: sudden death, aborted sudden death, or atrial\u00a0fibrillation (shortest pre-excited RR interval in atrial fibrillation [SPERRI] of\u00a0\u2264250 ms or with hemodynamic compromise); whereas subjects did not. We compared clinical and EPS data between cases and subjects.\nCase subjects (n\u00a0= 96) were older and less likely than subjects (n\u00a0= 816) to have symptoms or documented tachycardia. Mean age at LTE was 14.1 \u00b1 3.9 years of age. The LTE was the sentinel symptom in 65%, consisting of rapidly conducted pre-excited atrial fibrillation (49%), aborted sudden death (45%), and sudden death (6%). Three risk components were considered at EPS: SPERRI, accessory pathway effective refractory period (APERP), and shortest paced cycle length with pre-excitation during atrial pacing (SPPCL), and all were shorter in cases than in control subjects. In multivariate analysis, risk factors for LTE included male sex, Ebstein malformation, rapid anterograde conduction (APERP, SPERRI, or SPPCL\u00a0\u2264250 ms), multiple pathways, and inducible atrial fibrillation. Of case subjects, 60 of 86 (69%) had\u00a0\u22652 EPS risk stratification components performed; 22 of 60 (37%) did not have EPS-determined high-risk characteristics, and 15 of 60 (25%) had neither concerning pathway characteristics nor inducible atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia.\nYoung patients may experience LTE from WPW syndrome without prior symptoms or markers of high-risk on EPS.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to develop an algorithm that automatically quantifies motor states (off, on, dyskinesia) in Parkinson's disease (PD), based on accelerometry during a hand pronation-supination test. Clinician's ratings using the Treatment Response Scale (TRS), ranging from -3 (very Off) to 0 (On) to +3 (very dyskinetic), were used as target. For that purpose, 19 participants with advanced PD and 22 healthy persons were recruited in a single center open label clinical trial in Uppsala, Sweden. The trial consisted of single levodopa dose experiments for the people with PD (PwP), where participants were asked to perform standardized wrist rotation tests, using each hand, before and at prespecified time points after the dose. The participants used wrist sensors containing a three-dimensional accelerometer and gyroscope. Features to quantify the level, variation, and asymmetry of the sensor signals, three-level discrete wavelet transform features, and approximate entropy measures were extracted from the sensors data. At the time of the tests, the PwP were video recorded. Three movement disorder specialists rated the participants' state on the TRS. A Treatment Response Index from Sensors (TRIS) was constructed to quantify the motor states based on the wrist rotation tests. Different machine learning algorithms were evaluated to map the features derived from the sensor data to the ratings provided by the three specialists. Results from cross validation, both in tenfold and a leave-one-individual out setting, showed good predictive power of a support vector machine model and high correlation to the TRS. Values at the end tails of the TRS were under and over predicted due to the lack of observations at those values but the model managed to accurately capture the dose-effect profiles of the patients. In addition, the TRIS had good test-retest reliability on the baseline levels of the PD participants (Intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.83) and reasonable sensitivity to levodopa treatment (0.33 for the TRIS). For a series of test occasions, the proposed algorithms provided dose-effect time profiles for participants with PD, which could be useful during therapy individualization of people suffering from advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop new methods to automatically detect the onset and duration of freezing of gait (FOG) in people with Parkinson disease (PD) in real time, using inertial sensors. We first build a physical model that describes the trembling motion during the FOG events. Then, we design a generalized likelihood ratio test framework to develop a two-stage detector for determining the zero-velocity and trembling events during gait. Thereafter, to filter out falsely detected FOG events, we develop a point-process filter that combines the output of the detectors with information about the speed of the foot, provided by a foot-mounted inertial navigation system. We computed the probability of FOG by using the point-process filter to determine the onset and duration of the FOG event. Finally, we validate the performance of the proposed system design using real data obtained from people with PD who performed a set of gait tasks. We compare our FOG detection results with an existing method that only uses accelerometer data. The results indicate that our method yields 81.03% accuracy in detecting FOG events and a threefold decrease in the false-alarm rate relative to the existing method.",

    "abstract": "Evidence endorses the benefits of more vigorous exercise for people with Parkinson's, particularly following diagnosis, yet is not clear which style is optimal. The authors share perspectives and decisions made as a physiotherapist (assisted by a sports and exercise science student) and a novice runner with Parkinson's in his late 50s, respectively. The exercise goal chosen by the runner (the case report participant) to minimize the degenerative effects of the progressive condition was to complete a marathon.\nThis coauthored report evaluates the participant's progress utilizing physical fitness assessment data plus reflections on his training regime and notes from training diaries for the year before and after the marathon.\nThe participant received nutritional advice for weight management as exercise increased and physiotherapy for injuries from mounting activity level on Parkinsonian muscle tone. Fitness and function improved or were maintained (leg power, flexibility, timed functional walking, and balance). Most, however, returned to baseline within 6 months following the marathon as training intensity dropped.\nPhysical function can be improved or maintained in individuals with neurodegenerative conditions with correct exercise and nutritional advice. The participant's choice of running was based on recommendations for condition maintenance and not enjoyment, so adherence and completion of the marathon goal required professional, family, and technological support.",

    "abstract": "Persistent psychotic symptoms will develop in up to 60% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). The initial approach to the management of PD psychosis (PDP) begins with addressing concurrent systemic conditions associated with psychotic behavior, such as delirium, medical conditions (eg, infections), psychiatric disorders (eg, major depression with psychotic symptoms, mania, schizophrenia), and substance misuse or withdrawal. A review of current medications is recommended, and medications that may trigger psychotic symptoms should be eliminated. If possible, antiparkinson medications should be reduced to the minimum therapeutic dose or discontinued in a sequential manner. Generally, dose reduction or discontinuation of anticholinergics is attempted first, followed by that of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, amantadine, dopamine agonists, catechol-",

    "abstract": "No disease modifying therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) have been found effective to date. To properly power clinical trials for discovery of such therapies, the ability to predict outcome in PD is critical, and there is a significant need for discovery of prognostic biomarkers of PD. Dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT imaging is widely used for diagnostic purposes in PD. In the present work, we aimed to evaluate whether longitudinal DAT SPECT imaging can significantly improve prediction of outcome in PD patients. In particular, we investigated whether radiomics analysis of DAT SPECT images, in addition to use of conventional non-imaging and imaging measures, could be used to predict motor severity at year 4 in PD subjects. We selected 64 PD subjects (38 male, 26 female; age at baseline (year 0): 61.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3, range [46,78]) from the Parkinson's Progressive Marker Initiative (PPMI) database. Inclusion criteria included (i) having had at least 2 SPECT scans at years 0 and 1 acquired on a similar scanner, (ii) having undergone a high-resolution 3\u00a0T MRI scan, and (iii) having motor assessment (MDS-UPDRS-III) available in year 4 used as outcome measure. Image analysis included automatic region-of-interest (ROI) extraction on MRI images, registration of SPECT images onto the corresponding MRI images, and extraction of radiomic features. Non-imaging predictors included demographics, disease duration as well as motor and non-motor clinical measures in years 0 and 1. The image predictors included 92 radiomic features extracted from the caudate, putamen, and ventral striatum of DAT SPECT images at years 0 and 1 to quantify heterogeneity and texture in uptake. Random forest (RF) analysis with 5000 trees was used to combine both non-imaging and imaging variables to predict motor outcome (UPDRS-III: 27.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.7, range [3,77]). The RF prediction was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Our results demonstrated that addition of radiomic features to conventional measures significantly improved (",

    "abstract": "The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is used to assess individual mobility. It evaluates static and dynamic balance by means of the total time required to complete the test, usually measured by a stopwatch. In recent years tools based on portable inertial measurement units (IMU) for clinical application are increasingly available on the market. More specifically, a tool (hardware and dedicated software) to quantify the TUG test based on IMU is now available. However, it has not yet been validated in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, the aim of this study is to compare measurements from instrumented TUG tests (or iTUG) acquired by an IMU with those obtained using an optoelectronic system (the gold standard) and by a stopwatch, to gain an in-depth understanding of IMU behavior in computing iTUG in subjects with PD. To do this, three TUG test trials were carried out on 30 subjects with PD and measured with all three systems simultaneously. System agreements were evaluated using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient and Bland-Altman plots. The device tested showed excellent reliability, accuracy and precision in quantifying total TUG test duration. Since TUG is a widely used test in rehabilitation settings, its automatic quantification through IMUs could potentially improve the quality of assessments in the quantification of PD gait ability.",

    "abstract": "Psychosis is among the most disabling complications of Parkinson's disease (PD). The chronicity of PD psychosis remains understudied and the relative importance of dopaminergic therapy versus the disease process itself in engendering psychosis remains unclear.\nTo examine pharmacologic and motoric correlates of PD psychosis onset and remission in a longitudinally monitored PD cohort.\nWe analyzed data from 165 participants enrolled in a longitudinal PD study through the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Center of Excellence at Johns Hopkins University. Evaluations included formal psychiatric assessment and were conducted at two-year intervals. Regression with generalized estimated equations (GEE) was used to produce unadjusted and adjusted estimates for time-varying longitudinal associations between psychosis and putative risk factors.\nSixty-two participants (37.6%) were diagnosed with psychosis during at least one evaluation. Of forty-nine participants with psychosis followed over multiple evaluations, 13 (26.5%) demonstrated remission despite significant Hoehn & Yahr stage increase (p=0.009); two of these cases later relapsed. Multivariable regression with GEE identified dementia diagnosis, akinesia-rigidity, anticholinergic usage, and levodopa-carbidopa dose to be significantly associated with psychosis, while disease duration was not. A sub-analysis of 30 incident psychosis cases suggested that dopamine agonist dose was lowered after psychosis onset with a compensatory increase in levodopa-carbidopa dosage.\nOur findings suggest that in the context of standard therapy, PD-related psychotic disorder can remit at a frequency of approximately 27%. Additionally, akinetic-rigid motor impairment was more strongly associated with psychosis than disease duration, independent of cognitive impairment and medications.",

    "abstract": "Blood pressure abnormalities are frequently observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and are associated with cerebrovascular diseases such as white matter hyperintensities and carotid atherosclerosis. We assessed the relationship between blood pressure abnormalities and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), a marker of cerebral small vessel disease, in 128 patients with PD. We examined supine and orthostatic blood pressures and used 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to assess the presence or absence of orthostatic hypotension (OH), supine hypertension (SH), nocturnal hypertension (NH), and loss of nocturnal blood pressure dips (non-dipping). CMBs were found in 13 (10.2%) patients, and the median number of CMBs was 1 (range: 1 to 10). Six of these patients had deep or infratentorial CMBs, six had strictly lobar CMBs, and one had mixed CMBs. Linear regression analysis indicated that presence of both OH and SH was independently associated with greater numbers of CMBs in deep or infratentorial regions, independent of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and white matter hyperintensities. NH and non-dipping were not associated with CMBs in deep or infratentorial regions, and there was no association between blood pressure and CMBs in lobar regions. Our results suggest that the presence of both OH and SH may be related to deep or infratentorial CMBs in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms can fluctuate and may not be accurately reflected during a clinical evaluation. In addition, access to movement disorder specialists is limited for many with PD. The objective was to assess the impact of motion sensor-based telehealth diagnostics on PD clinical care and management.\nEighteen adults with PD were randomized to control or experimental groups. All participants were instructed to use a motion sensor-based monitoring system at home one day per week, for seven months. The system included a finger-worn motion sensor and tablet-based software interface that guided patients through tasks to quantify tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia. Data were processed into motor symptom severity reports, which were reviewed by a movement disorders neurologist for experimental group participants. After three months and six months, control group participants visited the clinic for a routine appointment, while experimental group participants had a videoconference or phone call instead.\nHome based assessments were completed with median compliance of 95.7%. For a subset of participants, the neurologist successfully used information in the reports such as quantified response to treatment or progression over time to make therapy adjustments. Changes in clinical characteristics from study start to end were not significantly different between groups.\nIndividuals with PD were able and willing to use remote monitoring technology. Patient management aided by telehealth diagnostics provided comparable outcomes to standard care. Telehealth technologies combined with wearable sensors have the potential to improve care for disparate PD populations or those unable to travel.",

    "abstract": "[Purpose] Parkinson's disease (PD) patients often freeze in actual daily living but seldom in clinical setting. This study aimed to identify the factors contributing to freezing of gait (FOG). [Subjects and Methods] The participants included 28 adults with PD. Principal component analysis was used to investigate the characteristics of 14 common FOG situations adopted from previous studies. Cluster analysis classified the subjects into four groups. Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to compare the PD Questionnaire-39 mobility dimension between the groups. [Results] The major variables of the first principal component in 14 FOG situations were unfamiliar places, unpredictable schedule changes, entering an automatic door, when another person suddenly crossed, and change in the walking surface. These situations were unrelated to the second principal component. Getting on/off a public transport and crowded places were major variables for the second principal component, and related to both the first and second principal components. Although fatigue was the most frequent FOG situation, not all principal components were influenced. The values of the PD Questionnaire-39 revealed significant differences between the groups. [Conclusion] Actual FOG situations may be categorized into (1) task complexity, (2) both task complexity and emotional factors, and (3) fatigue as decreased attentional resources.",

    "abstract": "Discriminating the two subtypes of tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) at early stage is highly valuable and crucial for progression treatment of disease for caregivers. However, there is no objective method or a subtype-specific biomarker yet available for identifying these two subtypes. A computational approach in frequency domain could be a good candidate to introduce biomarker since PD tremor had frequency range of 3-7 Hz. By using frequency component of the whole body Center Of Pressure (COP) signal, we propose a ratio between high and low frequency range. To evaluate this ratio, COP data of ten PD patients were utilized. The results suggest that identifying PD subtypes is attainable by using the frequency information of COP signals.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the relation between clinical features and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). One hundred and fifty-six PD patients were enrolled. Their clinical features [body mass index (BMI), age, disease duration, and disease stage] and ECG parameters [RR, PR, QRS, and QT intervals, and heart rate-corrected QT (QTc)] were analyzed. BMI was positively correlated with the PR and QRS intervals in patients with PD. The QRS interval was positively correlated with disease duration and Hoehn and Yahr stage, and the QT interval and QTc were positively correlated with age. Clinical features and ECG parameters are likely to be closely associated with each other. Several ECG parameters reflect autonomic dysfunction or disease progression. Clinicians should pay more attention to ECG parameters in the treatment of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is a common and disabling problem in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and there is currently no satisfactory treatment. As acupuncture has been reported to be effective in fatigue related to other conditions, we sought to evaluate its efficacy in PD.\nThis was a single center, randomized, sham-controlled study. Forty PD patients with moderately severe fatigue were randomized to receive 5\u00a0weeks of biweekly real or sham acupuncture. The primary outcome was change on the General Fatigue score of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-GF) at 5\u00a0weeks. Secondary outcomes included MFI-Total score, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor score (UPDRS Motor), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ 39), Geriatrics Depression Scale (GDS), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale ESS). All outcome measures were evaluated at baseline, 5 and 9\u00a0weeks.\nBoth groups showed significant improvements in MFI-GF and MFI-Total scores at 5 and 9\u00a0weeks, but there were no significant between-group differences. There were no improvements from baseline for PDQ 39, GDS, and ESS. Although improvements were noted for the UPDRS Motor score in the real acupuncture group, no between-group difference could be demonstrated.\nBoth real and sham acupuncture are equally effective in improving PD-related fatigue, and it is likely that this is due to nonspecific or placebo effects.",

    "abstract": "Models of hallucinations emphasize imbalance between sensory input and top-down influences over perception, as false perceptual inference can arise when top-down predictions are afforded too much precision (certainty) relative to sensory evidence. Visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease (PD) are associated with lower-level visual and attentional impairments, accompanied by overactivity in higher-order association brain networks. PD therefore provides an attractive framework to explore contributions of bottom-up versus top-down disturbances in hallucinations.\nWe characterized sensory processing during perceptual decision making in patients with PD with (n\u00a0= 20) and without (n\u00a0= 25) visual hallucinations and control subjects (n\u00a0= 12), by fitting a hierarchical drift diffusion model to an attentional task. The hierarchical drift diffusion model uses Bayesian estimates to decompose task performance into parameters reflecting drift rates of evidence accumulation, decision thresholds, and nondecision time.\nWe observed slower drift rates in patients with hallucinations, which were less sensitive to changes in task demand. In contrast, wider decision boundaries and shorter nondecision times relative to control subjects were found in patients with PD regardless of hallucinator status. Inefficient and less flexible sensory evidence accumulation emerges as a unique feature of PD hallucinators.\nWe integrate these results with evidence accumulation and predictive coding models of hallucinations, suggesting that in PD sensory evidence is less informative and may therefore be down-weighted, resulting in overreliance on top-down influences. Considering impaired drift rates as an approximation of reduced sensory precision, our findings provide a novel computational framework to specify impairments in sensory processing that contribute to development of visual hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and prevalence increases with age. Normal physiological changes that occur during the aging process reflect the pathological characteristics of Parkinson's disease. It is also recognized that age related changes significantly interact with the pathological mechanisms that underlie the neurodegeneration in PD and perpetuate the disease process. Despite the fact that aging is considered to be a primary risk factor for developing PD, the use of aged animal models are still under-utilized in pre-clinical research, thus reducing the translatability of experimental findings. Here, we use a natural compound astaxanthin (AXT) with multiple biological activities to attenuate neurotoxicity in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease in both young and aged mice. We observed that AXT preserved neurons in the substantia nigra of both young and aged mice that were exposed to the MPTP neurotoxin. However, AXT was less efficacious in the aged animals, as AXT was not able to protect against the MPTP induced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) throughout the aged nigro-striatal circuit. This disparity in the neuroprotective effect of AXT suggests that aging is a critical factor to consider during the development of novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases and should be more rigorously evaluated in preclinical models.",

    "abstract": "The objective was to assess dynamic functional connectivity (FC) and local/global connectivity in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and with normal cognition (PD-NC). The sample included 35 PD patients and 26 healthy controls (HC). Cognitive assessment followed an extensive neuropsychological battery. For resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) analysis, independent component analysis (ICA) was performed and components were located in 7 networks: Subcortical (SC), Auditory (AUD), Somatomotor (SM), visual (VI), cognitive-control (CC), default-mode (DMN), and cerebellar (CB). Dynamic FC analysis was performed using the GIFT toolbox. FC differences between groups in each FC state were analysed with the network-based statistic (NBS) approach. Finally, a graph-theoretical analysis for local/global parameters was performed. The whole sample showed 2 dynamic FC states during the rs-fMRI. PD-MCI patients showed decreased mean dwell time in the hypo-connectivity state (",

    "abstract": "Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease which can be associated with many pathologies including degenerative neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Studies have suggested the possibility of cross-immune responses through \"epitope spreading\". Bullous dermatosis has been reported to be secondary to neurological disease, at intervals ranging from a few months to a maximum of a few years. Then is it an unusual association or a causation? It has been suggested that drug consumption, decubitus lesions, traumatic events as well as reduced immunity can be triggers for BP in patients with neurological disease. We report the case of a 93-year old patient with a 10-year history of advanced Parkinson's disease, hospitalized for the treatment of a common bullous pemphigoid confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry. The patient was treated with oral corticosteroids. After a week of treatment, the patient died due to septic shock. Neurological disorders represent a real risk factor for BP. BP could be considered as a marker for neurological disorder. These associations are of broad interest, because they can play a role in the etiopathogenesis of BP and contribute to a complete understanding of the causes of these neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to compare optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of retinal thickness (RT) and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients to those of healthy subjects, and to investigate whether there is any relationship between the severity of the disease and the RNFLT values. This prospective study was included 25 IPD patients and 29 healthy controls. In the IPD group, the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) were performed. Intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity (VA), spherical equivalent, axial length (AL), and central corneal thickness (CCT) were measured using OCT in both groups. The RT was measured in the central retinal (RTc), nasal (RTn), and temporal (RTt) segments. Nasal (RNFLTn), nasal superior (RNFLTns), nasal inferior (RNFLTni), temporal (RNFLTt), temporal superior (RNFLTts), and temporal inferior (RNFLTti) measurements were made and mean RTFLT was calculated (RNFLTg) for each individual. In the patient group, IOP and VA values were statistically significantly lower The RTn and RNFLTg were significantly thinner in the patient group. There was no statistically significant relationship between the severity of IPD and these findings. In our study, RNFLTg and RTn were found to be thinner in the IPD group, which may have caused lower VA scores. The effects of retinal dopamine depletion on RT and RNFLT, and lower IOP values in the non-glaucomatous IPD patients should be further investigated.",

Among them, 3 cases were developmental dysplasia of hip, 3 cases were femoral head necrosis and 12 cases were femoral neck fracture. All patients manifested with obvious pain and limitation of stepping ability. Postoperative complications were observed and Harris score were used to compare hip joint function after operation.\nThe incision were healed well, and pain were alleviated or disappeared, and hip joint function were improved. Eighteen patients were followed up from 1 to 3 years with an average of 2.3 years. At the latest follow up, 14 cases recovered freedom-walk, 2 cases could walk with walking stick, 1 case could walk with walking aid and 1 case was died. Among 18 patients, 2 cases were occurred dislocation, and 1 case were died for cardiac disease at 3 months after operation. Four patients were occurred slight pain. There were significant differences in Harris scores among preoperative (41.7\u00b11.4), 6 months after operation(80.1\u00b15.4) and the final follow-up (83.4\u00b12.1), and 10 cases got excellent result, 4 good, 1 fair and 2 poor.\nApplication of hip replacement for hip-joint diseases with Parkinson disease is a safe and effective clinical therapy, and has advantages of less complications and rapid recovery of hip joint function.",

    "abstract": "Reduced foot clearance when walking may increase the risk of trips and falls in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Changes in foot clearance in people with PD are likely to be associated with temporal-spatial characteristics of gait such as walking slowly which evokes alterations in the temporal-spatial control of stepping patterns. Enhancing our understanding of the temporal-spatial determinants of foot clearance may inform the design of falls prevention therapies. Thirty-six people with PD and 38 age-matched controls completed four intermittent walks under two conditions: self-selected and fast gait velocity. Temporal-spatial characteristics of gait and foot (heel and toe) clearance outcomes were obtained using an instrumented walkway and 3D motion capture, respectively. A general linear model was used to quantify the effect of PD and gait velocity on gait and foot clearance. Regression evaluated the temporal and spatial gait predictors of minimum toe clearance (MTC). PD walked slower regardless of condition (p\u202f=\u202f.016) and tended to increase their step length to achieve a faster gait velocity. Step length and the walk ratio consistently explained the greatest proportion of variance in MTC (>28% and >33%, respectively) regardless of group or walking condition (p\u202f<\u202f.001). Our results suggest step length is the primary determinant of MTC regardless of pathology. Interventions that focus on increasing step length may help to reduce the risk of trips and falls during gait, however, clinical trials are required for robust evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested associations between primary headache and neurodegenerative diseases; however, the relationship between tension-type headache (TTH), which is the most common type of primary headache, and Parkinson's disease (PD) remains controversial. Hence, in this nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study, we explored the temporal association between TTH and PD.\nUsing claims data in the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, we evaluated 12,309 subjects aged \u226520 years who were newly diagnosed with TTH from 2000 to 2005. The non-TTH group included 49,236 randomly selected sex- and age-matched patients without TTH. Subjects were followed up until the end of 2011, diagnosis of PD, or death. The incidence of PD was compared between the two groups. A Cox multivariable proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the risk of PD.\nThe overall incidence of PD (per 1,000 person-years) in the TTH and non-TTH groups was 3.01 and 1.68, respectively. After adjustment for sex, age, and comorbidities, the association between TTH and PD remained statistically significant (adjusted HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.19-1.57). The TTH group had a higher risk of PD than the non-TTH group did, regardless of subjects' sex, age, and comorbidity status.\nThese findings demonstrate that patients diagnosed with TTH exhibit an increased risk of PD. Additional studies should investigate the potential shared pathophysiological mechanisms of TTH and PD. Clinicians should be aware that TTH is a potential risk factor for PD.",

All subjects underwent 1.5-T MRI examinations, and WMH detected by T2-weighted images or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were semiquantified according to the Fazekas method. Medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) was visually assessed by the MTA score.\nWMH were more prominent in AD, DLB, and PDD patients than in PDND patients and normal controls (NCs). DLB as well as AD showed more severe WMH than PDD. Visual assessment of medial temporal lobe atrophy showed that AD patients had the most severe atrophy, followed by DLB, PDD, and PDND patients, and NC subjects in that order. MTA scores showed significant correlations with WMH severity.\nOur results indicated that DLB was more similar to AD than to PDD in terms of MRI findings, suggesting that WMH in DLB may reflect mainly AD-related pathology rather than atherosclerotic cerebrovascular changes.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of sporadic Parkinson's disease is (PD) still not understood but it is believed that a complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors could trigger the pathology. Pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1 is released by activated microglia and is up-regulated in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients; TNF-\u03b1 modulates neuroinflammation and can activate the molecular mechanisms that lead to neurotoxicity and neuronal death. We analyzed two functional SNPs within the TNF-\u03b1 gene promoter (rs361525 and rs1800629) in 354 Italian PD patients and 443 healthy controls (HC). In our cohort of patients, no significant associations could be observed between rs361525 and rs1800629 SNPs and either PD onset risk or PD-associated clinical parameters including age at onset of fluctuations, UPDRS-ME (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-Motor Examination), Schwab & England, Hohen & Yahr stage scale, and MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score. Conflicting results on the role played by TNF-\u03b1 rs1800629 SNP on PD onset risk are present in the literature. We could not find any association between TNF-\u03b1 rs361525 and rs1800629 and PD.",

The prevalence of symptomatic OH was 18%, asymptomatic OH was 4%, while 78% were patients without OH. Factors associated with symptomatic OH were age (OR, 95%CI: 1.06, 1.003-1.115, p=0.038) and hypertension (OR, 95%CI: 6.16, 1.171-32.440, p=0.032).

    "abstract": "Postural abnormalities are refractory complications observed in mid- to late-stage Parkinson's disease (PD).\nWe analyzed the effects of istradefylline, a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, on posture in 21 levodopa-treated PD patients from the subanalysis of a three-month open-label study.\nThe subitem score of posture (3.13) on the Movement Disorder Society revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III significantly improved following istradefylline treatment (baseline, 1.3\u00b11.0 points vs 3months, 0.9\u00b10.9 points; p<0.05). Among 18 patients who had postural abnormalities at baseline, defined as 1 point or greater on MDS-UPDRS part III subitem 3.13, posture improved in 9 (50%) and was unchanged in 9 (50%) patients after istradefylline treatment. Improved and unchanged groups did not show differences in baseline characteristics, except for tendency for a higher rate of Hoehn and Yahr stage IV and V (Off state) observed in the improved group. Changes in scores of posture (3.13) did not correlate with those of other MDS-UPDRS part III items, PD Questionnaire-8, PD Sleep Scale-2 and Epworth Sleepiness Scale.\nBased on our preliminary findings, istradefylline could be an effective treatment option for postural abnormalities in mid-stage PD patients.",

Among 18 patients who had postural abnormalities at baseline, defined as 1 point or greater on MDS-UPDRS part III subitem 3.13, posture improved in 9 (50%) and was unchanged in 9 (50%) patients after istradefylline treatment. Improved and unchanged groups did not show differences in baseline characteristics, except for tendency for a higher rate of Hoehn and Yahr stage IV and V (Off state) observed in the improved group. Changes in scores of posture (3.13) did not correlate with those of other MDS-UPDRS part III items, PD Questionnaire-8, PD Sleep Scale-2 and Epworth Sleepiness Scale.",

    "abstract": "To determine the impact of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) infusion on different subtypes of freezing of gait (FoG) classified according to levodopa responsiveness in advanced Parkinson disease (PD) patients.\nWe retrospectively assessed the presence and severity of FoG in 32 advanced PD patients based on the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) item 14 score. Different FoG subtypes were inferred from the score variation with oral dopaminergic medications. Modifications following long-term LCIG infusion were analysed. Motor symptoms and motor complications were assessed by UPDRS part III and IV respectively.\nFoG related UPDRS score varied from 2.6\u00b10.9 in OFF condition to 0.9\u00b10.8 in the ON condition at baseline and improved to 0.6\u00b10.7 with LCIG infusion (p=0.027). After a mean of 2.59\u00b11.12years of continuous LCIG infusion, Pseudo-ON-FoG improved to a greater extent with LCIG infusion than with oral therapy in 12 patients (38%) and equally well in 8 patients (25%), OFF-type-FoG was controlled equally well in 8 patients (25%) and worsened slightly in 3 patients (9%). Unresponsive-FoG, present in one patient (3%), was unmodified by LCIG infusion.\nEven though limited by the subjective simple measure of FoG, this study suggests that patients undergoing LCIG infusion maintain a good long-term control of FoG. Pseudo-on-FoG improves in a considerable percentage of patients and OFF-type-FoG remains well controlled with LCIG infusion. Further studies with a larger number of patients and objective measures of FoG are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and late-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) are neurodegenerative movement disorders resulting in different postural instability and falling symptoms. IPD falls occur usually forward in late stage, whereas PSP falls happen in early stages, mostly backward, unprovoked, and with high morbidity. Self-triggered, weighted movements appear to provoke falls in IPD, but not in PSP. Repeated self-triggered lifting of a 0.5-1-kg weight (<2% of body weight) with the dominant hand was performed in 17 PSP, 15 IPD with falling history, and 16 controls on a posturography platform. PSP showed excessive force scaling of weight and body motion with high-frequency multiaxial body sway, whereas IPD presented a delayed-onset forward body displacement. Differences in center of mass displacement apparent at very small weights indicate that both syndromes decompensate postural control already within stability limits. PSP may be subject to specific postural system devolution. IPD are susceptible to delayed forward falling. Differential physiotherapy strategies are suggested.",

    "abstract": "It is now increasingly appreciated that glial cells play a critical role in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Impairment of these properties might lead to dysfunction of iron metabolism and neurodegeneration of neurons. We have previously shown that dysfunction of glia could cause iron deposit and enhance iron-induced degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). There also has been a substantial growth of knowledge regarding the iron metabolism of glia and their effects on iron accumulation and degeneration of DA neurons in PD in recent years. Here, we attempt to describe the role of iron metabolism of glia and the effect of glia on iron accumulation and degeneration of DA neurons in the substantia nigra of PD. This could provide evidence to reveal the mechanisms underlying nigral iron accumulation of DA neurons in PD and provide the basis for discovering new potential therapeutic targets for PD.",

    "abstract": "Motor fluctuations complicate the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease receiving levodopa. Extended-release carbidopa-levodopa has a pharmacokinetic profile that provides a more continuous levodopa serum concentration. Patients taking this formulation can expect longer duration of action and fewer doses per day, similar clinical improvement when compared to other levodopa formulations, and with a theoretically lower risk of developing motor fluctuations. Several studies, including three randomized control trials provide evidence for the efficacy, safety and tolerability of extended release carbidopa-levodopa in patients with both early and advanced Parkinson's disease are reviewed here. Also provided is guidance for dosing of and conversion to extended release carbidopa-levodopa as well as a discussion of its place in the clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Pain is a common and disabling non-motor symptom of Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) but its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. There is evidence to suggest that altered pain sensitivity may contribute to the experience of pain in PD patients, but clinical studies investigating this have yielded inconsistent results.\nTo examine whether pain thresholds are altered in PD patients compared to normal healthy controls (HC), via the use of systematic review and meta-analysis.\nA systematic search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE library from 1966 to April 2015.\nStudies that compared pain thresholds in PD patients versus HC were included in the systematic review. Additionally, data comparing PD patients off dopaminergic medications (PD\nHeat pain threshold, cold pain threshold, electrical pain threshold, nociceptive withdrawal reflex threshold, pressure pain threshold, and pain ratings.\n22 studies were reviewed, comprising of 616 PD and 451 HC. In the comparison of PD\nPD patients are more sensitive to noxious stimuli compared to HC when tested in the off medication state. This increase in pain sensitivity is observed across all modalities, but is not as apparent when PD patients are administered Levodopa, suggesting that dopamine deficient states may contribute to hyperalgesia.

    "abstract": "SNCA missense mutations are a rare cause of autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, 6\u00a0missense mutations in SNCA have been nominated as causal. Here, we assess the frequency of these 6\u00a0mutations in public population databases and PD case-control data sets to determine their true pathogenicity. We found that 1 of the 6 reported SNCA mutations, His50Gln, was consistently identified in large population databases, and no enrichment was evident in PD cases compared to controls. These results suggest that His50Gln is probably not a pathogenic variant. This information is important to provide counseling for His50Gln carriers and has implications for the interpretation of His50Gln \u03b1-synuclein functional investigations.",

The L-test is an extended version of the Timed up and Go test, incorporating a longer walking distance and turns in two directions.\nCross-sectional.\nCommunity.\n16 participants (13 male), mean age 75 (SD 6.7) mean duration since diagnosis 7.1 years (\u00b12.8). Disease severity was mild to moderate on the Hoehn and Yahr scale (mean 2.1; mode 2; range 1-3). 14 participants (12 male) completed the study.\nNot applicable.\nA Bland and Altman plot examined the agreement between first and second testing occasion of the L-test. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) assessed the test-retest reliability. Concurrent validity was established by correlating the L-test with the Timed up and Go test (TUG). The Minimal Detectable Change with 95% confidence interval (MDC95) was calculated to determine the true change not due to chance.\nThe L-test showed excellent test-retest reliability on the Bland & Altman plot and the ICC. There was a high degree of agreement between measurements taken on days 1 and 2. The L-test correlated strongly with the Timed up and Go test on both measurement days with r=0.97 (p<0.001) and r=0.96 (p<0.001). The MDC95 was 5.31seconds.\nThe L-test is a reliable and valid outcome measurement for the assessment of walking ability in participants with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Several factors determine the choice of medications in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to analyze the pattern of prescription of drugs in patients with PD before attending a tertiary-care center.\nThe study included chart review of 800 PD patients attending the Department of Neurology of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in Bangalore, India.\nThe mean age at onset was 51.1\u00b111.8 years. The mean duration of illness was 41.7\u00b143.6 months. At first visit, 79.4% (group 1, n=635) of patients were on medications, 10% (group 2, n=80) were on medications but later discontinued, and 10.6% (group 3, n=85) were drug-na\u00efve. Overall, levodopa was prescribed in 94.8%, trihexyphenidyl in 40.4%, dopamine agonists in 23.2%, and amantadine in 17.2% either as monotherapy or in combination. In group 1, 37.8% were on monotherapy, with levodopa being the most commonly used agent (33.1%), followed by trihexyphenidyl (2.2%), dopamine agonists (1.6%), and amantadine (0.6%). Among those on polytherapy, levodopa plus trihexyphenidyl was the preferred combination (23.9%). In group 2, levodopa monotherapy was also most common (72.5%), followed by trihexyphenidyl monotherapy (7.5%).\nLevodopa and trihexyphenidyl were the most commonly prescribed drugs in our patients. A higher use of trihexyphenidyl could be due to its easy availability, low cost, and better tolerability in our patients, who were relatively young at the time of onset of their disease. The choice of antiparkinsonian medications at the primary and secondary care levels in India may be inappropriate, and newer guidelines tailored to the Indian context are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common degenerative disorder of the central nervous system in the elderly. It is characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, as well as by motor dysfunction. Although the causes of PD are not well understood, aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in neurons contributes to this disease. Current therapeutics for PD provides satisfactory symptom relief but not a cure. Treatment strategies include attempts to identify new drugs that will prevent or arrest the progressive course of PD by correcting disease-specific pathogenic process. Betulin is derived from the bark of birch trees and possesses anticancer, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential for betulin to ameliorate PD features in Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans) models. We demonstrated that betulin diminished \u03b1-syn accumulation in the transgenic C. elegans model. Betulin also reduced 6-hydroxydopamine-induced dopaminergic neuron degeneration, reduced food-sensing behavioral abnormalities, and reversed life-span decreases in a pharmacological C. elegans model. Moreover, we found that the enhancement of proteasomes activity by promoting rpn1 expression and downregulation of the apoptosis pathway gene, egl-1, may be the molecular mechanism for betulin-mediated protection against PD pathology. Together, these findings support betulin as a possible treatment for PD and encourage further investigations of betulin as an antineurodegenerative agent.",

    "abstract": "In this case report, we describe a Parkinson's disease (PD) patient with limb-kinetic apraxia (LKA) in whom degeneration of the corticofugal tract (CFT) from the supplementary motor area (SMA) was observed in diffusion tensor tractography (DTT).\nA 63-year-old woman presented with a loss of dexterity in both upper extremities, which indicated LKA, and typical PD-related symptoms, including a gait disturbance with a short step, resting tremor in both upper extremities, and rigidity, and these symptoms had been present for 2 years. The F-florinated-N-3-fluoropropyl-2-\u03b2-carboxymethoxy-3-\u03b2-(4-lodophenyl) nortropane positron emission tomography scanning findings were consistent with PD. Based on the clinical symptoms and imaging findings, we diagnosed the patient with PD. In a coin-rotation test that was used to evaluate the severity of the LKA, the patient's results significantly decreased compared to the results of the normal controls.\nThe DTT showed that the CFTs from the SMAs in both hemispheres were partially torn and thinned. The fractional anisotropy values and CFT volumes in both SMAs were >2 standard deviations lower than those of the normal controls.\nThe patient was treated with an initial dose of 150/37.5\u200amg/day of levodopa/benserazide, and the dose was gradually increased to 400/100\u200amg/day.\nAfter treatment, although the bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor of the patient significantly decreased, the dexterity of the patient's hands did not improve.\nThese observations indicated degeneration of the CFTs from the SMAs in both hemispheres in the patient. This degeneration might have, at least in part, contributed to the patient's LKA. The results of this study suggest that CFT degeneration could be one of the pathological mechanisms underlying LKA in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "As a multisystemic neurodegenerative disorder, Parkinson disease (PD) has a broad spectrum of symptoms including motor and nonmotor symptoms (NMS). As shown in studies, NMS can also impact patient's quality of life, and many of them often go untreated. Chinese herbal medicines with multiconstituent may alleviate NMS in PD patients. This research is carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of a Chinese herbal formula for NMS, with its Chinese name acronym of SQJZ.\nIt will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Idiopathic PD with a Hoehn and Yahr scale score \u22644, aged 18 to 80 years, will be involved. About 240 patients will be randomly assigned to either SQJZ or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. There is a 2-week run-in period before the randomization, and the follow-up will be 24 weeks, including 12-week treatment period, with visit once every 4 weeks and 12-week washout follow-up. All participants are asked to maintain the regular medication schedule. SQJZ formula will consist of Chinese herbs with effects for insomnia, constipation, anxiety, and so on. The primary outcome will be measured using NMS scale, and secondary outcomes will include unified PD rating scale, PD sleep scale, the Parkinson fatigue scale, the constipation severity instrument, and PD Questionnaire-39. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat method, and mixed-model repeated-measures analyses will be used.\nThe findings from this research might provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of SQJZ Chinese herbal formula for treating NMS in PD patients. The results will sustain the broader use of SQJZ formula in PD.",

    "abstract": "Rehabilitation interventions represent an alternative strategy to pharmacological treatment in order to slow or reverse some functional aspects of disability in Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying rehabilitation-mediated improvement in PD patients are still poorly understood. Interestingly, growing evidence has highlighted a key role of the glutamate in neurogenesis and brain plasticity. The brain levels of glutamate, and of its precursor glutamine, can be detected in vivo and noninvasively as \"Glx\" by means of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS). In the present pilot study, 7 PD patients with frequent falls and axial dystonia underwent 8-week rehabilitative protocol focused on sensorimotor improvement. Clinical evaluation and Glx quantification were performed before and after rehabilitation. The Glx assessment was focused on the basal ganglia in agreement with their key role in the motor functions. We found that the rehabilitation program improves the static and dynamic balance in PD patients, promoting a better global motor performance. Moreover, we observed that the levels of Glx within the left basal ganglia were higher after rehabilitation as compared with baseline. Thus, we posit that our sensorimotor rehabilitative protocol could stimulate the glutamate metabolism in basal ganglia and, in turn, neuroplasticity processes. We also hypothesize that these mechanisms could prepare the ground to restore the functional interaction among brain areas deputed to motor controls, which are affected in PD.",

Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurological disorder of the central nervous system. Differentiation between MSA-P and PD is important because treatments, complications, and prognoses differ. The bulbocavernosus reflex (BCR) tests the afferent and efferent signals of the pudendal nerve as well as the sacral cord. In this study, we investigated differences in BCR parameters between MSA-P and PD patients. Thirty-eight MSA-P patients and 32 PD patients were selected to participate in our electrophysiological investigations. The Keypoint EMG/EP system was used to induce the BCR, and latencies and amplitudes were recorded for systematic statistical analyses. Area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic was used to assess the specificity and sensitivity of the BCR parameters. A BCR was elicited in 76.32% of MSA-P patients and 93.75% of PD patients. The BCR latencies of the MSA-P group were longer than those of the PD group (",

Human dermal (skin) fibroblasts are accessible peripheral cells that constitute a patient-specific system, which potentially recapitulates the PD chronological and epigenetic aging history. Here, we compared primary skin fibroblasts obtained from individuals diagnosed with late-onset sporadic PD, and healthy age-matched controls. These fibroblasts were studied from fundamental viewpoints of growth and morphology, as well as redox, mitochondrial, and autophagic function. It was observed that fibroblasts from PD subjects had higher growth rates, and appeared distinctly different in terms of morphology and spatial organization in culture, compared to control cells. It was also found that the PD fibroblasts exhibited significantly compromised mitochondrial structure and function when assessed via morphological and oxidative phosphorylation assays. Additionally, a striking increase in baseline macroautophagy levels was seen in cells from PD subjects. Exposure of the skin fibroblasts to physiologically relevant stress, specifically ultraviolet irradiation (UVA), further exaggerated the autophagic dysfunction in the PD cells. Moreover, the PD fibroblasts accumulated higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) coupled with lower cell viability upon UVA treatment. In essence, these studies highlight primary skin fibroblasts as a patient-relevant model that captures fundamental PD molecular mechanisms, and supports their potential utility to develop diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for the disease.",

    "abstract": "REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), a form of parasomnia, is characterized by motor and/or speech activity during sleep corresponding to the dream content. RBD is currently considered as a marker of onset of neurodegenerative diseases (sinucleinopathies) and as a most specific early symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). The authors describe a clinical case of a patient with the combination of essential tremor, initial signs of PD and RBD. A polysomnographic study has confirmed clinical signs of RBD and determined the disturbances of sleep architecture: the increase in falling asleep, number of awakenings, wakefulness during sleep, the absence of deep slow-wave sleep. The particular features of the patient were essential tremor and sleep walking.\n\u0420\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0444\u0430\u0437\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043d\u0430 (\u0420\u041f\u0411\u0421) \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438/\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0432\u043e \u0441\u043d\u0435, \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439. \u0420\u041f\u0411\u0421 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0435\u0440 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 - \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0443\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0439, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430\u0438\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0444\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f). \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0441 \u0441\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u044d\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430, \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u041f \u0438 \u0420\u041f\u0411\u0421. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043b\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0420\u041f\u0411\u0421, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b \u0441\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u044b\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u0441\u043d\u0430, \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043d\u0430. \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044f \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u0443 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u044d\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043d\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) is a complication of the dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD); it is manifested as a compulsive medication use and may have negative impact on patients' social, psychological, and physical functioning. An effect of deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus (DBS STN) on DDS is not fully understood. Therefore, the degree of DDS during DBS STN in PD patients was evaluated in the study.\nThe main group included 15 patients with DDS symptoms in the preoperative period. The comparison group consisted of 15 patients without DDS symptoms and the control group consisted of 15 patients who did not undergo surgery.\nThe severity of motor disturbances in the surgery groups has decreased significantly (by 45%). Motor complications during DBS STN in patients with DDS have decreased by 50%; a decrease in the reduction of doses of dopaminergic preparations was noted as well.\n\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0421\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0434\u043e\u0444\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0438\u0438 (\u0421\u0414\u0414) \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0434\u043e\u0444\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f);

    "abstract": "Huntington's and Parkinson's Diseases (HD and PD) are neurodegenerative disorders that share some pathological features but are disparate in others. For example, while both diseases are marked by aberrant protein aggregation in the brain, the specific proteins that aggregate and types of neurons affected differ. A better understanding of the molecular similarities and differences between these two diseases may lead to a more complete mechanistic picture of both the individual diseases and the neurodegenerative process in general. We sought to characterize the common transcriptional signature of HD and PD as well as genes uniquely implicated in each of these diseases using mRNA-Seq data from post mortem human brains in comparison to neuropathologically normal controls. The enriched biological pathways implicated by HD differentially expressed genes show remarkable consistency with those for PD differentially expressed genes and implicate the common biological processes of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, transcriptional dysregulation, and neuron-associated functions. Comparison of the differentially expressed (DE) genes highlights a set of consistently altered genes that span both diseases. In particular, processes involving nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) and transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) are the most prominent among the genes common to HD and PD. When the combined HD and PD data are compared to controls, relatively few additional biological processes emerge as significantly enriched, suggesting that most pathways are independently seen within each disorder. Despite showing comparable numbers of DE genes, DE genes unique to HD are enriched in far more coherent biological processes than the DE genes unique to PD, suggesting that PD may represent a more heterogeneous disorder. The complexity of the biological processes implicated by this analysis provides impetus for the development of better experimental models to validate the results.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder, but current therapies are only symptomatic. A promising alternative to address the neurodegenerative process is the use of neurotrophic factors, such as the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). However, its clinical use has been limited due to its short half-life and rapid degradation after in vivo administration, in addition to difficulties in crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This barrier is a limiting factor in brain drug development, making the future progression of neurotherapeutics difficult. In the past few years, intranasal drug delivery has appeared as an alternative non-invasive administration route to bypass the BBB and target drugs directly to the CNS. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the in vivo neuroprotective effect of intranasally administered GDNF, encapsulated in chitosan-coated nanostructured lipid carrier (CS-NLC-GDNF), in a 6-OHDA partially lesioned rat model. The developed CS-NLC-GDNF showed a particle size of approximately 130 nm and high encapsulation efficiency. The in vitro study in PC-12 cells demonstrated the ability of the encapsulated GDNF to protect these cells against 6-OHDA toxin. After two weeks of daily intranasal administration of treatments, the administration of CS-NLC-GDNF achieved a behavioral improvement in rats, as well as a significant improvement in both the density of TH+ fibres in the striatum and the TH+ neuronal density in the SN. Thus, it can be concluded that the nose-to-brain delivery of CS-NLC-GDNF could be a promising therapy for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common devastating neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. The precise molecular and cellular basis underlying PD still remains uncertain; however, accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal cell death is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Over the previous two decades, more than 20 genes have been identified as the cause of and/or risk for PD. Because sporadic and familial forms of PD have many similarities in clinical and neuropathological features, common molecular pathways, such as aberrant mitochondrial and protein homeostasis, are likely to exist in both conditions. Of the various genes and proteins involved in PD, the versatile DnaJ/Hsp40 co-chaperones have attracted particular attention since several genes encoding this protein family have been successively identified as the cause of the familial forms of PD/Parkinsonism. In this review, we will introduce the current knowledge regarding the integratory and modulatory effect of DnaJ/Hsp40 in various cellular functions and argue how the failure of these proteins may initiate and/or facilitate of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most widespread motor-affecting disease affecting majorly middle- and late age population. Thus, in the current study, we intended to explore the neuroprotective effect of protodioscin (Proto) against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rat model.\nAfter induction of PD with the injection of 6-OHDA, the different dose of Proto was administered for the duration of experimental protocol (2 months). We have scrutinized the consequence of Proto on the cognitive behaviours via Moris water maze (MWM), and recognition of novel objects and its location tasks. The effect of Proto was also investigated on the expression of Nrf2 in human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells via western blot analysis.\nThe results showed significant decrease in travelled distance as compared by the lesion treated group. Further significant difference was revealed in the latency time to detect the platform that is visible and it confirmed that, there were no noteworthy dissimilarity was observed in the visual and motor function ability. The result also suggests that, the activation of Nrf2 is the possible mechanism of neuroprotection of Proto against PD.\nAs a concluding remark, the present study confirmed the neuroprotective role of Proto against PD both in in vitro and in vivo models.",

    "abstract": "Conventional medical treatments of Parkinson's disease (PD) are effective on motor disturbances but may have little impact on nonmotor symptoms, especially psychiatric ones. Thus, even when motor symptomatology improves, patients might experience deterioration in their quality of life. We have shown that 3 years of active theatre is a valid complementary intervention for PD as it significantly improves the well-being of patients in comparison to patients undergoing conventional physiotherapy. Our aim was to replicate these findings while improving the efficacy of the treatment. We ran a single-blinded pilot study lasting 15 months on 24 subjects with moderate idiopathic PD. 12 were assigned to a theatre program in which patients underwent \"emotional\" training. The other 12 underwent group physiotherapy. Patients were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of their treatments, using a battery of eight clinical and five neuropsychological scales. We found that the emotional theatre training improved the emotional well-being of patients, whereas physiotherapy did not. Interestingly, neither of the groups showed improvements in either motor symptoms or cognitive abilities tested by the neuropsychological battery. We confirmed that theatre therapy might be helpful in improving emotional well-being in PD.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered a robust therapeutic tool in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, although it has been reported to potentially cause cognitive decline in some cases. We here provide an in-depth and critical review of the current literature regarding cognition after DBS in PD, summarizing the available data on the impact of STN and GPi DBS as monotherapies and also comparative data across these two therapies on 7 cognitive domains. We provide evidence that, in appropriately screened PD patients, worsening of one or more cognitive functions is rare and subtle after DBS, without negative impact on quality of life, and that there is very little data supporting that STN DBS has a worse cognitive outcome than GPi DBS.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies reported an association between gut microbiota composition and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, we know little about the relationship between microbiome dysbiosis and the pathogenesis of PD. The objective of this study was to describe the evolution of fecal microbiota using an oral rotenone model of PD from a longitudinal study over a period of 4 weeks. Gastrointestinal function was assessed by measuring fecal pellet output, motor functions was assessed by open-field and pole tests every week. \u03b1-synuclein pathology, inflammation and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neuron loss from the middle brain were also analyzed. Fecal samples were collected every week followed by 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. We reported that chronically oral administered rotenone caused gastrointestinal dysfunction and microbiome dysbiosis prior to motor dysfunction and central nervous system (CNS) pathology. 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal microbiome showed rotenone-treated mice exhibited fecal microbiota dysbiosis characterized by an overall decrease in bacterial diversity and a significant change of microbiota composition, notably members of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with an increase in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio after 3 weeks of rotenone treatment. Moreover, rotenone-induced gastrointestinal and motor dysfunctions were observed to be robustly correlated with changes in the composition of fecal microbiota. Our results demonstrated that gut microbiome perturbation might contribute to rotenone toxicity in the initiation of PD and brought a new insight in the pathogenesis of PD. Novel therapeutic options aimed at modifying the gut microbiota composition might postpone the onset and following cascade of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Aging muscle atrophy is in part a neurodegenerative process revealed by denervation/reinnervation events leading to motor unit remodeling (i.e., myofiber type grouping). However, this process and its physiological relevance are poorly understood, as is the wide-ranging heterogeneity among aging humans. Here, we attempted to address 1) the relation between myofiber type grouping and molecular regulators of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) stability; 2) the impact of motor unit remodeling on recruitment during submaximal contractions; 3) the prevalence and impact of motor unit remodeling in Parkinson's disease (PD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease; and 4) the influence of resistance exercise training (RT) on regulators of motor unit remodeling. We compared type I myofiber grouping, molecular regulators of NMJ stability, and the relative motor unit activation (MUA) requirement during a submaximal sit-to-stand task among untrained but otherwise healthy young (YA; 26 yr, n = 27) and older (OA; 66 yr, n = 91) adults and OA with PD (PD; 67 yr, n = 19). We tested the effects of RT on these outcomes in OA and PD. PD displayed more motor unit remodeling, alterations in NMJ stability regulation, and a higher relative MUA requirement than OA, suggesting PD-specific effects. The molecular and physiological outcomes tracked with the severity of type I myofiber grouping. Together these findings suggest that age-related motor unit remodeling, manifested by type I myofiber grouping, 1) reduces MUA efficiency to meet submaximal contraction demand, 2) is associated with disruptions in NMJ stability, 3) is further impacted by PD, and 4) may be improved by RT in severe cases. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Because the physiological consequences of varying amounts of myofiber type grouping are unknown, the current study aims to characterize the molecular and physiological correlates of motor unit remodeling. Furthermore, because exercise training has demonstrated neuromuscular benefits in aged humans and improved innervation status and neuromuscular junction integrity in animals, we provide an exploratory analysis of the effects of high-intensity resistance training on markers of neuromuscular degeneration in both Parkinson's disease (PD) and age-matched older adults.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FoG) is a disabling symptom associated with falls, with little or no responsiveness to pharmacological treatment. Current protocols used for rehabilitation are based on the use of external sensory cues. However, cued strategies might generate an important dependence on the environment. Teaching motor strategies without cues [i.e., action observation (AO) plus Sonification] could represent an alternative/innovative approach to rehabilitation that matters most on appropriate allocation of attention and lightening cognitive load. We aimed to test the effects of a novel experimental protocol to treat patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and FoG, using functional, and clinical scales. The experimental protocol was based on AO plus Sonification. 12 patients were treated with 8 motor gestures. They watched eight videos showing an actor performing the same eight gestures, and then tried to repeat each gesture. Each video was composed by images and sounds of the gestures. By means of the Sonification technique, the sounds of gestures were obtained by transforming kinematic data (velocity) recorded during gesture execution, into pitch variations. The same 8 motor gestures were also used in a second group of 10 patients; which were treated with a standard protocol based on a common sensory stimulation method. All patients were tested with functional and clinical scales before, after, at 1\u2009month, and 3\u2009months after the treatment. Data showed that the experimental protocol have positive effects on functional and clinical tests. In comparison with the baseline evaluations, significant performance improvements were seen in the NFOG questionnaire, and the UPDRS (parts II and III). Importantly, all these improvements were consistently observed at the end, 1\u2009month, and 3\u2009months after treatment. No improvement effects were found in the group of patients treated with the standard protocol. These data suggest that a multisensory approach based on AO plus Sonification, with the two stimuli semantically related, could help PD patients with FoG to relearn gait movements, to reduce freezing episodes, and that these effects could be prolonged over time.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by resting tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. Dopaminergic medications such as L-dopa treat these motor symptoms, but can have complex effects on cognition. Impulse control is an essential cognitive function. Impulsivity is multifaceted in nature. Motor impulsivity involves the inability to withhold pre-potent, automatic, erroneous responses. In contrast, cognitive impulsivity refers to improper risk-reward assessment guiding behavior. Informed by our previous research, we anticipated that dopaminergic therapy would decrease motor impulsivity though it is well known to enhance cognitive impulsivity. We employed the Go/No-go paradigm to assess motor impulsivity in PD. Patients with PD were tested using a Go/No-go task on and off their normal dopaminergic medication. Participants completed cognitive, mood, and physiological measures. PD patients on medication had a significantly higher proportion of Go trial Timeouts (i.e., trials in which Go responses were not completed prior to a deadline of 750 ms) compared to off medication (",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is prevalent worldwide but mainly affects the elderly and is rarely seen in women of child-bearing age. The clinical signs and symptoms, the physiological changes of pregnancy, and drug interactions, pose unique challenges for the anaesthetic management of patients with Parkinson's disease who present for delivery. A 36-year-old primigravid woman at 36\u202fweeks' gestation, with Parkinson's disease, presented for pre-anaesthesia assessment prior to elective caesarean section. Her Parkinson's disease had been diagnosed four years previously and was treated with Sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa) and pramipexole. Despite maximum allowable drug doses in pregnancy, she reported disease progression, with right-sided weakness in the upper and lower limbs and an altered gait. Spinal anaesthesia for elective Caesarean section was performed in the sitting position, using 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine, morphine 150\u202f\u00b5g and fentanyl 25\u202f\u00b5g. The anaesthesia and Caesarean section were uneventful. She was discharged home with a healthy baby on the fourth postoperative day.",

The speech and communication problems resulted in restricted communicative participation for between a quarter and a third of the respondents, and their speech caused embarrassment sometimes or more often to more than half. Forty-five percent of the respondents had received speech-language pathology services.\nMost respondents reported both speech and language symptoms, and many experienced restricted communicative participation. Access to speech-language pathology services is still inadequate. Services should also address cognitive/linguistic aspects to meet the needs of people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Neutral sphingomyelinase is known to be implicated in growth arrest, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Although previous studies have reported the involvement of neutral sphingomyelinase in hippocampus physiopathology, its behavior in the hippocampus during Parkinson's disease remains undetected. In this study, we show an upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and a downregulation of neutral sphingomyelinase in the hippocampus of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine- (MPTP-) induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the stimulation of neutral sphingomyelinase activity with vitamin 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 reduces specifically saturated fatty acid sphingomyelin by making sphingomyelin a less rigid molecule that might influence neurite plasticity. The possible biological relevance of the increase of neutral sphingomyelinase in Parkinson's disease is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the common neurodegenerative disease. \u03b1-Synuclein (ASN), main aggregating protein in neural cells of CNS in PD, was found in peripheral fluids. Testing ASN in plasma is potential test for diagnose PD, but previous studies are controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate if plasma ASN level may be a valuable biomarker, is the level of plasma ASN concentration different in various motor subtypes of diseases, is there a relation between the level of plasma ASN and the severity of motor symptoms.\nPatients with PD hospitalized in Neurology Department, Medical College were performed sequencing the 8th and 9th exon of GBA gene. Next plasma ASN level was tested in 58 patients with sequenced GBA gene and in 38 healthy volunteers (HV), matched by the age (respectively 68.43 vs. 64.57 years of age) and sex (female %, respectively: 43.10 vs.44.74). Patients were assessed with the scales: UPDRS (II, III, IV), Hoehn-Yahr (HY) and qualified to PIGD or TD subtype. For homogeneity of the group patients with GBA mutation were excluded from the analysis.\nThe ASN level did not differ between patients and HV (respectively: 4.53 vs. 3.73ng/ml) and between patients with different subtypes. There was inverse correlation between ASN and HY in PIGD subtype.\nPlasma ASN level is not valuable marker of the disease. It does not differ in subtypes of the disease. There is relation between plasma ASN level and the severity of the disease in PIGD subtype.",

    "abstract": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and late-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) are neurodegenerative movement disorders resulting in different postural instability and falling symptoms. IPD falls occur usually forward in late stage, whereas PSP falls happen in early stages, mostly backward, unprovoked, and with high morbidity. Postural responses to sensory anteroposterior tilt illusion by bilateral dorsal neck vibration were probed in both groups versus healthy controls on a static recording posture platform. Three distinct anteroposterior body mass excursion peaks (P1-P3) were observed. 18 IPD subjects exhibited well-known excessive response amplitudes, whereas 21 PSP subjects' responses remained unaltered to 22 control subjects. Neither IPD nor PSP showed response latency deficits, despite brainstem degeneration especially in PSP. The observed response patterns suggest that PSP brainstem pathology might spare the involved proprioceptive pathways and implies viability of neck vibration for possible biofeedback and augmentation therapy in PSP postural instability.",

    "abstract": "Affective dysfunctions are common in patients with Parkinson's disease, but the underlying neurobiological deviations have rarely been examined. Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra resulting in impairment of motor and non-motor basal ganglia-cortical loops. Concerning emotional deficits, some studies provide evidence for altered brain processing in limbic- and lateral-orbitofrontal gating loops. In a second line of evidence, human premotor and inferior parietal homologs of mirror neuron areas were involved in processing and understanding of emotional facial expressions. We examined deviations in brain activation during processing of facial expressions in patients and related these to emotion recognition accuracy.\n13 patients and 13 healthy controls underwent an emotion recognition task and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurement. In the Emotion Hexagon test, participants were presented with blends of two emotions and had to indicate which emotion best described the presented picture. Blended pictures with three levels of difficulty were included. During fMRI scanning, participants observed video clips depicting emotional, non-emotional, and neutral facial expressions or were asked to produce these facial expressions themselves.\nPatients performed slightly worse in the emotion recognition task, but only when judging the most ambiguous facial expressions. Both groups activated inferior frontal and anterior inferior parietal homologs of mirror neuron areas during observation and execution of the emotional facial expressions. During observation, responses in the pars opercularis of the right inferior frontal gyrus, in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule and in the bilateral supplementary motor cortex were decreased in patients. Furthermore, in patients, activation of the right anterior inferior parietal lobule was positively related to accuracy in the emotion recognition task.\nOur data provide evidence for a contribution of human homologs of monkey mirror areas to the emotion recognition deficit in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an effective surgical approach for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia and essential tremor (ET). Traditionally, DBS is performed using frame-based stereotactic technique. Recently, image guided surgery (IGS) using neuronavigation has gained popularity in neurosurgical procedures. We aim to investigate whether DBS using neuronavigation is capable of improving patient's outcome and minimize its complications.\nFrom February 2011 to October 2016, 20 patients with PD and 6 patients with ET were enrolled in the study. Patients aged between 18 to 70 years, were included and they underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for deep brain nucleus volumetry. Among PD patients, 14 cases underwent subthalamic nucleus (STN) implantation, while other 6 cases underwent globus pallidus internus (GPi) implantation. Furthermore, ventral intermediate nucleus (VIN) implantation was performed for ET patients, all with IGS using neuronavigation system. Patients were assessed by unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) for PD and tremor scores for ET in their follow ups. Authors utilized Butson model for volume of tissue activated (VTA) assessment. In addition, detailed tractography was performed to evaluate white matter circuits radiating from deep nucleuses.\nPD patients with GPi volume of more than 600mm\nIGS using neuronavigation allowed more accurate deep nucleus targeting, minimized intra- and post-operative complications and improved clinical outcome in DBS candidate patients. Our study revealed that increased white matter connections with remote parts of the brain would suggest that isolated deep nucleus stimulation could not explain symptom recovery and that patients' specific white matter stimulation by tractography coupled with IGS should be in priority.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, with the clinical main symptoms caused by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, corpus striatum and brain cortex. Over 90% of patients with PD have sporadic PD and occur in people with no known family history of the disorder. Currently there is no cure for PD. Treatment with medications to increase dopamine relieves the symptoms but does not slow down or reverse the damage to neurons in the brain. Increasing evidence points to inflammation as a chief mediator of PD with inflammatory response mechanisms, involving microglia and leukocytes, activated following loss of dopaminergic neurons. Oxidative stress is also recognized as one of the main causes of PD, and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species can lead to dopaminergic neuron vulnerability and eventual death. MicroRNAs control a range of physiological and pathological functions, and may serve as potential targets for intervention against PD to mitigate damage to the brain. Several studies have demonstrated that microRNAs can regulate oxidative stress and prevent ROS-mediated damage to dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that specific microRNAs may be putative targets for novel therapeutic strategies in PD. Recent human and animal studies have identified a large number of dysregulated microRNAs in PD brain tissue samples, many of which were downregulated. The dysregulated microRNAs affect downstream targets such as SNCA, PARK2, LRRK2, TNFSF13B, LTA, SLC5A3, PSMB2, GSR, GBA, LAMP-2A, HSC. Apart from one study, none of the studies reviewed had used agomirs or antagomirs to reverse the levels of downregulated or upregulated microRNAs, respectively, in mouse models of PD or with isolated human or mouse dopaminergic cells. Further large-scale studies of brain tissue samples collected with short postmortem interval from human PD patients are warranted to provide more information on the microRNA profiles in different brain regions and to test for gender differences.",

    "abstract": "Several researchers have demonstrated the positive benefits of auditory and visual cueing in the gait improvements among individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, few studies have evaluated the role of vibrotactile cueing when compared to auditory and visual cueing. This paper compares how these stimuli affect the risk of falling while walking on six types of soil (concrete, sand, parquet, broken stone, two types of carpet).\nAn instrumented Timed Up and Go (iTUG) test served to evaluate how audio, visual and vibrotactile cueing can affect the risk of falling of elderly. This pilot study proposes 12 participants with PD (67.7\u2009\u00b1\u200910.07\u2009years) and nine age-matched controls (66.8\u2009\u00b1\u20098.0\u2009years). Both groups performed the iTUG test with and without cueing. The cueing frequency was set at 10% above the cadence computed at the lower risk level of falling (walking over the concrete). A computed risk of falling (ROFA) index has been compared to the TUG time (total TUG duration).\nThe index for evaluating the risk of falling appears to have a good reliability (ICC >\u20090.88) in this pilot study. In addition, the minimal detectable change (MDC) suggests that the proposed index could be more sensitive to the risk of falling variation compared to the TUG time. Moreover, while using the cueing, observed results suggest a significant decrease in the computed risk of falling compared to 'without cueing' for most of types of soil, especially for deformable soils, which can lead to falls.\nWhen compared to other cueing, it seems that audio could be a better neurofeedback for reducing the risk of falling over different walking surfaces, which represent important risk factors for persons with gait disorder or lost functional autonomy.",

    "abstract": "This hypothesis discusses exposure and response to various stressors as cause for chronic neurodegeneration. Predisposing genetic and environmental factors in conjunction with exposure to exogenous and endogenous toxins cause stress, which consumes dopamine and related biogenic amines. To compensate monoamine exhaustion, conversion of endogenous levodopa to dopamine by tyrosine hydroxylase is up regulated. Concomitantly, tyrosine mediated levodopa degradation to dopaquinone is reduced. Dopaquinone is the essential precursor of neuromelanin. Its deficiency may cause irreversible nigral fading as initial feature of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The present pilot study investigated the effect of karate (according to the rules of the German Karate Federation) and dance training compared to an inactive control group in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 65 patients were recruited. At the end, 37 patients completed the post-test. From those 37 patients, 16 had chosen the karate training, 9 the dance training and 12 the waiting control group. Before and after the whole training phase cognitive performance, emotional well-being and balance were measured. The results showed that both, karate and dance training groups, improved balance. Furthermore, the mood dropped only in the waiting control group receiving no training at all, whereas it remained stable in patients who attended the karate and dance group. The training adherence was higher in the karate than the dance group indicating a high acceptability in PD patients for karate. In sum, karate can have the same positive effects as dance for PD patients. Further studies with larger samples and more rigorous methodologies are required to investigate the reported effects in more detail.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common motor neurodegenerative disorder. In most cases the cause of the disease is unknown, while in about 10% of subjects, it is associated with mutations in a number of different genes. Several different mutations in 15 genes have been identified as causing familial forms of the disease, while many others have been identified as risk factors. A striking number of these genes are either involved in the regulation of mitochondrial function or of endo-lysosomal pathways. Mutations affecting one of these two pathways are often coupled with defects in the other pathway, suggesting a crosstalk between them. Moreover, PD-linked mutations in genes encoding proteins with other functions are frequently associated with defects in mitochondrial and/or autophagy/lysosomal function as a secondary effect. Even toxins that impair mitochondrial function and cause parkinsonian phenotypes, such as rotenone, also impair lysosomal function. In this review, we explore the reciprocal relationship between mitochondrial and lysosomal pathways in PD. We will discuss the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on the lysosomal compartment and of endo-lysosomal defects on mitochondrial function, and explore the roles of both causative genes and genes that are risk factors for PD. Understanding the pathways that govern these interactions should help to define a framework to understand the roles and mechanisms of mitochondrial and lysosomal miscommunication in the pathophysiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases is of paramount importance for successful treatment. Lack of sensitive and early biomarkers for diagnosis of diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD) is a handicapping problem for all movement disorders specialists. Using serum autoimmune antibodies (AIAs) against neural proteins is a new promising strategy to diagnose brain disorders through non-invasive and cost-effective method. In the present study, we measured the level of AIAs against \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), which is an important protein involved in the pathogenesis of PD. In our study patients with PD (46 patients), Alzheimer's disease (AD) (27 patients) and healthy controls (20 patients) were evaluated according to their sera \u03b1-syn AIAs levels. Interestingly, \u03b1-syn AIAs were significantly elevated in PD group compared to AD and healthy controls, which advocates their use for diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Miniaturized and wearable sensor-based measurements enable the assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) motor-related features like never before and hold great promise as non-invasive biomarkers for early and accurate diagnosis, and monitoring the progression of PD. High-fidelity human movement reconstruction and simulation can already be conducted in a clinical setting with increasingly precise and affordable motion technology enabling access to high-quality labeled data on patients' subcomponents of movement (kinematics and kinetics). At the same time, body-worn sensors now allow us to extend some quantitative movement-related measurements to patients' daily living activities. This era of patient movement \"cognification\" is bringing us previously inaccessible variables that encode patients' movement, and that, together with measures from clinical examinations, poses new challenges in data analysis. We present herein examples of the application of an unsupervised methodology to classify movement behavior in healthy individuals and patients with PD where no specific knowledge on the type of behaviors recorded is needed. We are most certainly leaving the early stage of the exponential curve that describes the current technological evolution and soon will be entering its steep ascent. But there is already a benefit to be derived from current motion technology and sophisticated data science methods to objectively measure parkinsonian impairments.",

    "abstract": "Data from the World Health Organization (National Institute on Aging, 2011) and the National Institutes of Health (He et al., 2016) predicts that while today the worldwide population over 65 years of age is estimated around 8.5%, this number will reach an astounding 17% by 2050. In this framework, solving current neurodegenerative diseases primarily associated with aging becomes more pressing than ever. In 2017, we celebrate a grim 200th anniversary since the very first description of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its related symptomatology. Two centuries after this debilitating disease was first identified, finding a cure remains a hopeful goal rather than an attainable objective on the horizon. Tireless work has provided insight into the characterization and progression of the disease down to a molecular level. We now know that the main motor deficits associated with PD arise from the almost total loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta. A concomitant loss of cholinergic cells entails a cognitive decline in these patients, and current therapies are only partially effective, often inducing side-effects after a prolonged treatment. This review covers some of the recent developments in the field of Basal Ganglia (BG) function in physiology and pathology, with a particular focus on the two main neuromodulatory systems known to be severely affected in PD, highlighting some of the remaining open question from three main stand points: - Heterogeneity of midbrain dopamine neurons. - Pairing of dopamine (DA) sub-circuits. - Dopamine-Acetylcholine (ACh) interaction. A vast amount of knowledge has been accumulated over the years from experimental conditions, but very little of it is reflected or used at a translational or clinical level. An initiative to implement the knowledge that is emerging from circuit-based approaches to tackle neurodegenerative disorders like PD will certainly be tremendously beneficial.",

    "abstract": "The motor subscale of the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III) has limited applicability for the assessment of motor fluctuations in the home setting.\nTo assess whether a self-administered, tablet-based application can reliably quantify differences in motor performance using two-target finger tapping and forearm pronation-supination tasks in the ON (maximal dopaminergic medication efficacy) and OFF (reemergence of parkinsonian deficits) medication states, we recruited 11 Parkinson disease (PD) patients (age, 60.6 \u00b1 9.0 years; disease duration, 12.8 \u00b1 4.1 years) and 11 healthy age-matched controls (age, 62.5 \u00b1 10.5 years). The total number of taps, tap interval, tap duration, and tap accuracy were algorithmically calculated by the application, using the more affected side in patients and the dominant hand in healthy controls.\nCompared to the OFF state, PD patients showed a higher number of taps (84.2 \u00b1 20.3 vs. 54.9 \u00b1 26.9 taps; \nA self-administered, tablet-based application can reliably distinguish between OFF and ON states in fluctuating PD patients and may be sensitive to additional motor phenomena, such as accuracy, not captured by the MDS-UPDRS-III.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a growing concern as the longevity of the world's population steadily increases. Both ageing and Parkinson's disease have an impact on dopamine neurotransmission. It is therefore important to investigate their relative impact on the fronto-striatal reward system. There has been little investigation of reward processing in terms of anticipation and reward outcome in Parkinson's disease. Abnormal responses during reward processing have previously been demonstrated in whole-brain analysis of Parkinson's patients with mild lateralized disease, but the exact impact in regions specific to reward processing is still unknown.\nHere we aim to investigate the impact of Parkinson's disease on the orbitofrontal ventral striatal reward system in patients with moderate to severe clinical symptoms.\nWe utilized a monetary incentive delay (MID) task in 17 Parkinson's patients who were compared to two control groups stratified by age. The MID paradigm reliably activates the ventral striatum during reward anticipation and the orbitofrontal cortex during reward outcome processing.\nRelative to the two control groups, Parkinson's disease patients had abnormal task related activity during both reward anticipation in the ventral striatum and reward outcome in the orbitofrontal cortex. There were no effects of ageing.\nThese findings demonstrate abnormalities in anticipatory as well as reward outcome processing while treated primarily with levodopa. The orbitofrontal dysfunction during reward outcome processing may have specificity in Parkinson's disease, as it has been shown to be relatively unaffected by normal ageing.",

    "abstract": "Depression is an important non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that significantly impacts the daily activities of affected patients. Furthermore, the stooped posture that characterizes patients with PD has also been associated with depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the presence of depressive symptoms and body posture in patients with PD.\nForty-six patients with mild-to-moderate PD were recruited. The patients were divided into depression and no depression groups based on Beck Depression Inventory scores. All patients underwent kinematic analysis conducted in the upright standing posture with a motion capture system.\nThere were no differences in clinical characteristics between the depression (n\u202f=\u202f22) and no depression groups (n\u202f=\u202f24). In the standing position, patients with depression showed anterior tilting of the head from the pelvis and an increased distance between head and pelvis. The severity of depression was correlated with the degree of flexion at the lower trunk level and the degree of anterior tilting of the head, neck, and trunk from the pelvis and base of support.\nPatients with PD and depression showed increased flexion at pelvis level, which caused the trunk to tilt anteriorly. In addition, the severity of depression was correlated with the degree of anterior tilting of the head and trunk. These findings suggest that stooped posture, especially from the pelvis level, could be a marker of depression in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Dyskinesia is a troublesome complication of long-term dopaminergic medications in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Many factors are reported to be associated with dyskinesia in PD.\nTo investigate the association between sleep quality and dyskinesia in patients with PD.\nFour hundred twenty-five patients with PD were enrolled in this study. Demographic information was collected. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) stage scale were also performed. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were applied to evaluate daytime sleepiness and overall nighttime sleep quality, respectively, in PD patients.\nPatients with dyskinesia tended to have a longer duration of disease, higher daily levodopa-equivalent dose (LED), H-Y stage, UPDRS II and PSQI score, and a higher percentage of levodopa treatment than those without dyskinesia. After adjusting for age, sex, age at onset of PD, disease duration, UPDRS I, UPDRS II, UPDRS III, cigarette smoking, use of different antiparkinsonian drugs, phenotype, daily LED, and restless leg syndrome (RLS), PSQI score was still associated with dyskinesia, with corresponding ORs 1.111 (95% CI, 1.004-1.229) as a continuous variable, and 2.469 (95% CI, 1.051-5.800) as a categorical variable, respectively. Further analysis of PSQI components showed that subjective sleep quality and sleep latency were associated with dyskinesia in PD patients.\nOur data showed that poor nighttime sleep is positively associated with dyskinesia in PD patients. Attention to the management of nighttime sleep quality may be beneficial to dyskinesia in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "The somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold (STDT), defined as the shortest time interval required for two tactile stimuli to be perceived as separate, is longer in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In this review, we discuss STDT findings in healthy subjects and in PD patients and the relationship between altered STDT and motor disturbances.\nA search was conducted on PubMed for papers dealing with PD and temporal discrimination published from January 1990 to July 2017.\nAbnormal STDT in PD correlates with disease duration, disease severity and degree of nigrostriatal dopamine loss, and responds to dopaminergic medication. In PD, a prolonged STDT does not correlate, or only marginally correlates, with clinically assessed bradykinesia of finger tapping. By contrast, a prolonged STDT correlates with the variability in amplitude and speed of finger tapping as assessed by means of neurophysiological techniques and may contribute to impaired finger dexterity in PD.\nWe suggest that abnormal temporal processing of sensory information in PD generates incorrect signals for the execution and control of voluntary movements.\nThis review sheds light on unsolved questions regarding the relationship between STDT alterations and motor disturbances in PD and proposes directions for future research on this topic.",

    "abstract": "Much effort has been devoted to the discovery of specific mechanisms between drugs and single targets to date. However, as biological systems maintain homeostasis at the level of functional networks robustly controlling the internal environment, such networks commonly contain multiple redundant mechanisms designed to counteract loss or perturbation of a single member of the network. As such, investigation of therapeutics that target dysregulated pathways or processes, rather than single targets, may identify agents that function at a level of the biological organization more relevant to the pathology of complex diseases such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in PD have identified common variants underlying disease susceptibility, while gene expression microarray data provide genome-wide transcriptional profiles. These genomic studies can illustrate upstream perturbations causing the dysfunction in signaling pathways and downstream biochemical mechanisms leading to the PD phenotype. We hypothesize that drugs acting at the level of a gene expression module specific to PD can overcome the lack of efficacy associated with targeting a single gene in polygenic diseases. Thus, this approach represents a promising new direction for module-based drug discovery in human diseases such as PD.\nWe built a framework that integrates GWAS data with gene co-expression modules from tissues representing three brain regions-the frontal gyrus, the lateral substantia, and the medial substantia in PD patients. Using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) software package in R, we conducted enrichment analysis of data from a GWAS of PD. This led to the identification of two over-represented PD-specific gene co-expression network modules: the Brown Module (Br) containing 449 genes and the Turquoise module (T) containing 905 genes. Further enrichment analysis identified four functional pathways within the Br module (cellular respiration, intracellular transport, energy coupled proton transport against the electrochemical gradient, and microtubule-based movement), and one functional pathway within the T module (M-phase). Next, we utilized drug-protein regulatory relationship databases (DMAP) and developed a Drug Effect Sum Score (DESS) to evaluate all candidate drugs that might restore gene expression to normal level across the Br and T modules. Among the drugs with the 12 highest DESS scores, 5 had been reported as potential treatments for PD and 6 hold potential repositioning applications.\nIn this study, we present a systems pharmacology framework which draws on genetic data from GWAS and gene expression microarray data to reposition drugs for PD. Our innovative approach integrates gene co-expression modules with biomolecular interaction network analysis to identify network modules critical to the PD pathway and disease mechanism. We quantify the positive effects of drugs in a DESS score that is based on known drug-target activity profiles. Our results illustrate that this modular approach is promising for repositioning drugs for use in polygenic diseases such as PD, and is capable of addressing challenges of the hindered gene target in drug repositioning approaches to date.",

    "abstract": "We applied rhythmic binaural sound to Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients to investigate its influence on several symptoms of this disease and on Electrophysiology (Electrocardiography and Electroencephalography (EEG)). We conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled study in which rhythmic binaural beats and control were administered over two randomized and counterbalanced sessions (within-subjects repeated-measures design). Patients ([Formula: see text], age [Formula: see text], stage I-III Hoehn & Yahr scale) participated in two sessions of sound stimulation for 10[Formula: see text]min separated by a minimum of 7 days. Data were collected immediately before and after both stimulations with the following results: (1) a decrease in theta activity, (2) a general decrease in Functional Connectivity (FC), and (3) an improvement in working memory performance. However, no significant changes were identified in the gait performance, heart rate or anxiety level of the patients. With regard to the control stimulation, we did not identify significant changes in the variables analyzed. The use of binaural-rhythm stimulation for PD, as designed in this study, seems to be an effective, portable, inexpensive and noninvasive method to modulate brain activity. This influence on brain activity did not induce changes in anxiety or gait parameters; however, it resulted in a normalization of EEG power (altered in PD), normalization of brain FC (also altered in PD) and working memory improvement (a normalizing effect). In summary, we consider that sound, particularly binaural-rhythmic sound, may be a co-assistant tool in the treatment of PD, however more research is needed to consider the use of this type of stimulation as an effective therapy.",

To determine a dependence on the aging process requires the joint probability distribution of disease onset and lifespan. For human Parkinson's disease, such a joint distribution is not available, because the disease cuts lifespan short. To acquire a joint distribution, we resorted to an established ",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be effectively used in cases where continuous observation of patients is required, such as Parkinson's disease. This is due to the characteristics of the IoT (Internet of Things), which allows data to be measured and transmitted at any time, anywhere. In this study, we developed a health data collection platform that stores and transmits the foot pressure data of Parkinson patients using FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). The platform can be used to collect the foot pressure of a large number of Parkinson's patients. Based on the accumulated data, it is possible to identify abnormal behaviors such as walking pattern, tilt and instability of stride length in patients with Parkinson's disease. Based on the results of this study, accurate diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease can be made.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease rehabilitation can be long and boring being difficult to maintain patient engagement on therapy programs. Novel technologies are allowing computer games to be played throught natural interfaces. This paper presents the development and assessment of a system of serious games for fine motor skills rehabilitation using natural interfaces. The games were assessed throught a questionnaire that evaluated the game experience through seven components: immersion, flow, competence, tension, challenge and positive and negative affect. In addition, a conceptual framework for development of serious games for fine motor skills rehabilitation was proposed. The results from the quantitative questionnaire suggested that the player experience was positive on all components assessed. Also, player experience between the three games was statistically the same, implying that the games can be used with consistency in a physical therapy rehabilitation program.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to test if EEG responses to novel events reliably dissociated individuals with Parkinson's disease and controls, and if this dissociation was sensitive and specific enough to be a candidate biomarker of cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.\nParticipants included N\u202f=\u202f25 individuals with Parkinson's disease and an equal number of well-matched controls. EEG was recorded during a three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm both ON and OFF medication.\nWhile control participants showed reliable EEG habituation to novel events over time, individuals with Parkinson's did not. In the OFF condition, individual differences in habituation correlated with years since diagnosis. Pattern classifiers achieved high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating patients from controls, with a maximum accuracy of 82%. Most importantly, the confidence of the classifier was related to years since diagnosis, and this correlation increased as the time course of differential habituation increasingly distinguished the groups.\nThese findings identify systemic alteration in an obligatory neural mechanism that may contribute to higher-level cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.\nThese findings suggest that EEG responses to novel events in this rapid, simple, and inexpensive test have tremendous promise for tracking individual trajectories of cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "A common motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) is micrographia, characterized by a decrease in writing amplitude. Despite the relevance of this impairment for activities of daily living, the underlying neural network abnormalities and the impact of cueing strategies on brain connectivity are unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effects of visual cues on visuomotor network interactions during handwriting in PD and healthy controls (HCs). Twenty-eight patients with early disease, ON dopaminergic medication, and 14 age-matched controls performed a pre-writing task with and without visual cues in the scanner. Patients displayed weaker right visuo-parietal coupling than controls, suggesting impaired visuomotor integration during writing. Surprisingly, cueing did not have the expected positive effects on writing performance. Patients and controls, however, did activate similar networks during cued and uncued writing. During cued writing, the stronger influence of both visual and motor areas on the left superior parietal lobe suggested that visual cueing induced greater visual steering. In the absence of cues, there was enhanced coupling between parietal and supplementary motor areas (SMA) in line with previous findings in HCs during uncued motor tasks. In conclusion, the present study showed that patients with PD, despite their compromised brain function, were able to shift neural networks similar to controls. However, it seemed that visual cues provided a greater accuracy constraint on handwriting rather than offering unequivocal beneficial effects. Altogether, the results suggest that the effectiveness of using compensatory neural networks through applying external stimuli is task dependent and may compromise motor control during writing.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder characterized by dopaminergic nigrostriatal neuron degeneration and the formation of Lewy bodies (LB), pathological inclusions containing fibrils that are mainly composed of \u03b1-synuclein. Dopaminergic neurons, for their intrinsic characteristics, have a high energy demand that relies on the efficiency of the mitochondria respiratory chain. Dysregulations of mitochondria, deriving from alterations of complex I protein or oxidative DNA damage, change the trafficking, size and morphology of these organelles. Of note, these mitochondrial bioenergetics defects have been related to PD. A series of experimental evidence supports that \u03b1-synuclein physiological action is relevant for mitochondrial homeostasis, while its pathological aggregation can negatively impinge on mitochondrial function. It thus appears that imbalances in the equilibrium between the reciprocal modulatory action of mitochondria and \u03b1-synuclein can contribute to PD onset by inducing neuronal impairment. This review will try to highlight the role of physiological and pathological \u03b1-synuclein in the modulation of mitochondrial functions.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of vascular parkinsonism (VP) is based on a series of clinical criteria and neuroimaging findings. An increase in transcranial Doppler ultrasonography pulsatility index (PI) has been described as a frequent finding in patients with VP. We aimed to confirm this association and to determine the PI value with the highest sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of VP.\nPI was determined in all patients admitted to Hospital Universitari i Polit\u00e8cnic La Fe due to parkinsonism between January 2012 and June 2016. We assessed the probability of having VP based on PI values in patients with a definite diagnosis of either VP or idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). A ROC curve was created to determine the PI value with the highest sensitivity and specificity.\nWe assessed a total of 146 patients with suspected parkinsonism; 54 (37%) were diagnosed with IPD and 15 (10%) with VP. Patients with VP were significantly older than those with IPD (mean age of 79 vs 68.5, P=.00144) and had a higher PI (median of 1.29 [IQR: 1.09-1.38] vs 0.96 [IQR: 0.89-1.16], P=.01328). In our sample, a PI of 1.09 conferred 84% sensitivity and 70% specificity.\nIn our series, the PI was significantly higher in patients with VP than in those with IPD. We therefore support the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography for the initial assessment of elderly patients with akinetic-rigid syndrome.",

The behavioral deficits of PD rat were ameliorated by the transplantation of OECs-Nurr1-Ngn2/VMCs.\nThese results suggest that OECs-Nurr1-Ngn2 exhibits substantial neuroprotective, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects against PD via the up-regulation of the neurotrophic factor-TrkB pathway.",

    "abstract": "RNF146 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that specifically recognizes and polyubiquitinates poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR)-conjugated substrates for proteasomal degradation. RNF146 has been shown to be neuroprotective against PAR polymerase-1 (PARP1)-induced cell death during stroke. Here we report that RNF146 expression and RNF146 inducers can prevent cell death elicited by Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated and PARP1-activating stimuli. In SH-SY5Y cells, RNF146 expression conferred resistance to toxic stimuli that lead to PARP1 activation. High-throughput screen using a luciferase construct harboring the RNF146 promoter identified liquiritigenin as an RNF146 inducer. We found that RNF146 expression by liquiritigenin was mediated by estrogen receptor activation and contributed to cytoprotective effect of liquiritigenin. Finally, RNF146 expression by liquiritigenin in mouse brains provided dopaminergic neuroprotection in a 6-hydroxydopamine PD mouse model. Given the presence of PARP1 activity and RNF146 deficits in PD, it could be a potential therapeutic strategy to restore RNF146 expression by natural compounds or estrogen receptor activation.",

    "abstract": "Transmembrane or membrane-associated protein dysfunction is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism of pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous genome-wide association studies and their meta-analysis in PD genes have identified several risk foci in transmembrane protein-encoding genes. Herein, we investigated the effect of 4 such PD-associated genetic variants reported in Caucasians, including discs-large membrane-associated guanylate kinase scaffolding protein 2 (DLG2 rs3793947), transmembrane protein 229B (TMEM229B rs1555399), glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB rs199347), and integrin subunit alpha 8 (ITGA8 rs7077361). A total of 1185 Taiwanese subjects comprising 592 PD patients and 593 unrelated age-matched controls were genotyped. DLG2 rs3793947 AA genotype showed a significantly lower prevalence in female PD patients compared to the female controls (p\u00a0= 0.019). The recessive model analysis also demonstrated a reduced PD risk for females in AA genotype (odds ratio\u00a0= 0.573, 95% confidence interval: 0.379-0.868, p\u00a0= 0.008). The frequencies of TMEM229B rs1555399 and GPNMB rs199347 genotypes and alleles were similar in PD patients and controls. ITG8 rs7077361 was not polymorphic in all subjects of this study. These data suggested that DLG2, but not TMEM229B, GPNMB, and ITGA8, influenced the risk of PD in Taiwan.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies showed the loss of dopaminergic neurons directly leads to both changes in firing rate and neuronal synchrony in the striatum by pharmacogenetic approach, but physiological observation of striatal neurons in awake animal is rare up to now due to the limitation of recording methods. We use multichannel in vivo recording system, to record the activity pattern of both medium spiny projecting neurons (MSNs) and fast spiking interneurons (FSIs) in awake mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD), created by injection of 6-hydroxyl-dopamine (6-OHDA) into dorsolateral striatum bilaterally and unilaterally. The abnormal discharge of neurons, including oscillations, burst activity and firing rate were systematically observed, and we used these index together to comprehensively analyse the functional change of striatal neurons in PD mouse model. We found that PD mouse model exhibited elevated synchronized oscillatory activity in \u03b2 frequency band and decreased firing rate of FSIs during movement. The firing rate and burst activity of MSNs clearly reduced during movement after bilateral dopamine depletion. The present study has novelly shown the firing pattern changes of the MSNs and FSIs in DL striatum in awake PD mouse model, by combination of electrophysiology with molecular biological technology. Our results may help to reveal a new circuitry mechanism of movement disorders in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a type of progressive neurodegenerative disorder that has affected a large part of the population till now. Several symptoms of PD include tremor, rigidity, slowness of movements and vocal impairments. In order to develop an effective diagnostic system, a number of algorithms were proposed mainly to distinguish healthy individuals from the ones with PD. However, most of the previous works were conducted based on a binary classification, with the early PD stage and the advanced ones being treated equally. Therefore, in this work, we propose a multiclass classification with three classes of PD severity level (mild, moderate, severe) and healthy control. The focus is to detect and classify PD using signals from wearable motion and audio sensors based on both empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and empirical wavelet packet transform (EWPT) respectively. The EWT/EWPT was applied to decompose both speech and motion data signals up to five levels. Next, several features are extracted after obtaining the instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies from the coefficients of the decomposed signals by applying the Hilbert transform. The performance of the algorithm was analysed using three classifiers - K-nearest neighbour (KNN), probabilistic neural network (PNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed approach had the ability to differentiate PD from non-PD subjects, including their severity level - with classification accuracies of more than 90% using EWT/EWPT-ELM based on signals from motion and audio sensors respectively. Additionally, classification accuracy of more than 95% was achieved when EWT/EWPT-ELM is applied to signals from integration of both signal's information.",

    "abstract": "About 15% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) have family history and 5-10% have a monogenic form of the disease with Mendelian inheritance. To date, at least 23 loci and 19 disease-causing genes for parkinsonism have been found, but many more genetic risk loci and variants for sporadic PD phenotype have been identified in various association studies. Investigating the mutated protein products has uncovered potential pathogenic pathways that provide insights into mechanisms of neurodegeneration in familial and sporadic PD. To commemorate the 200th anniversary of Parkinson's publication of An Essay on the Shaking Palsy, we provide a comprehensive and critical overview of the current clinical, neuropathological, and genetic understanding of genetic forms of PD. We also discuss advances in screening for genetic PD-related risk factors and how they impact genetic counseling and contribute to the development of potential disease-modifying therapies.",

    "abstract": "Studies showed that 50-80% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have been reported with abnormal glucose tolerance. Alterations in glucose and energy metabolism serve as the early molecular event in PD. Although evidences support that the insulin resistance plays a major role in motor and non-motor complications of PD, the underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of PD is unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the alterations in major components of insulin signaling in nuclear fraction (NF) and whole tissue homogenate (TH) of substantia nigral (SN) region obtained from postmortem PD brain and their age-matched controls. Pathway components include insulin receptor \u03b2 (IR\u03b2), IR substrate-1 (IRS1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 (PI3K p85), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt1/2/3) and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2). Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of insulin signaling cascade was also studied. A significant decrease in nuclear PI3K p85, Akt1/2/3 and PIP3 levels and significant increase in nuclear PTEN and GSK3\u03b2 levels were observed in SN region of PD brain when compared to the age-matched controls. Consistently, significant decrease in IR\u03b2, IRS1, PI3K p85, Akt1/2/3 and PIP3 levels and increased GSK3\u03b2 level were observed in TH obtained from SN region of PD brain compared to the control brain. Data from the study suggest that alterations in insulin signaling may play a vital role in the pathogenesis/progression of PD and other related complications. Thus, decreasing nuclear accumulation of PTEN and/or restoring insulin signaling cascade may halt the neurodegeneration in PD.",

    "abstract": "Putaminal diffusivity in brain magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is increased in patients with the parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) compared to Parkinson disease (PD) patients.\nWe performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of DWI to distinguish MSA-P from PD.\nStudies on DWI were identified through a systematic PubMed and Clarivate Analytics\u00ae Web of Science\u00ae Core Collection search. Papers were selected based on stringent inclusion criteria; minimum requirement was the inclusion of MSA-P and PD patients and documented true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative rates or overall sample size and reported sensitivity and specificity. Meta-analysis was performed using the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics curve approach.\nThe database search yielded 1678 results of which 9 studies were deemed relevant. Diagnostic accuracy of putaminal diffusivity measurements were reported in all of these 9 studies, whereas results of other regions of interest were only reported irregularly. Therefore, a meta-analysis could only be performed for putaminal diffusivity measurements: 127 patients with MSA-P, 262 patients with PD and 70 healthy controls were included in the quantitative synthesis. The meta-analysis showed an overall sensitivity of 90% (95% confidence interval (CI): 76.7%-95.8%) and an overall specificity of 93% (95% CI: 80.0%-97.7%) to distinguish MSA-P from PD based on putaminal diffusivity.\nPutaminal diffusivity yields high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish clinically diagnosed patients with MSA-P from PD. The confidence intervals indicate substantial variability. Further multicenter studies with harmonized protocols are warranted particularly in early disease stages when clinical diagnosis is less certain.",

    "abstract": "As microglial activation is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), drugs that target this process may help to prevent or delay the development of PD. The present study investigated the effects of dl\u20113\u2011n\u2011butylphthalide (NBP) on microglia in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PD mouse model. The mice were randomly divided into a blank control group, LPS control group and NBP + LPS treatment group. Mice in the treatment group were given an intragastric infusion of 120\u00a0mg/kg NBP daily for 30\u00a0days during the establishment of the PD mouse model. At 4 and 28\u00a0weeks post\u2011treatment, the motor behaviours of the mice in each group were observed using the rotarod test and the open field test. In addition, immunohistochemical staining was performed to determine the levels of activated microglia, tumour necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1 and \u03b1\u2011synuclein, and the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)\u2011positive cells in the substantia nigra. NBP significantly improved dyskinesia, reduced microglial activation, decreased nuclear \u03b1\u2011synuclein deposition and increased the survival of TH\u2011positive cells in the substantia nigra of LPS\u2011induced PD model mice. These findings suggested that NBP may exert its therapeutic effect by reducing microglial activation in a mouse model of PD.",

The independent effect of STN-DBS on trunk posture was assessed comparing Medication-Off (presurgery) vs Stimulation-On/Medication-Off (post-surgery). The combined effect of STN-DBS plus levodopa was evaluated comparing Medication-On (presurgery) vs Stimulation-On/Medication-On (post-surgery). Analyses were conducted considering both the entire cohort of patients and the subgroup with camptocormia (CMC) and Pisa syndrome (PS).\nThe independent effect of STN-DBS resulted in a 41.4% improvement in abnormal trunk posture severity (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), with 78.2% of patients (n\u00a0=\u00a079) reporting an improvement of at least 1 point.

    "abstract": "Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI) is increasingly used in Parkinson's disease (PD), notably in patients contraindicated for subthalamic deep brain stimulation. Although it has been suggested that CSAI is safe regarding cognition, few studies have actually investigated its effect, especially on cognitive control which is a crucial process for goal-directed behavior. More specifically, its impact on the dynamics of cognitive action control, as reflected by the activation and suppression of impulsive responses, has yet to be investigated, which is the objective of the present study.\nWe compared cognitive action control between baseline (M0) and 6\u00a0months (M6) after the start of add-on CSAI by administering an oculomotor Simon task to 20 patients with mild to moderate PD. We used the activation-suppression model to determine whether CSAI had an effect on either the impulsive errors made in conflict situations or the suppression of these responses.\nWe found no difference between M0 and M6 in the congruence effect regarding either reaction time or accuracy, indicating that overall conflict resolution was not influenced by CSAI. Furthermore, the rate of fast errors in the conflict situation and the last slope of the delta plots (reflecting the strength of impulsive response suppression) were unaffected by the treatment. The 95% confidence intervals calculated for the treatment effect on both of these measures fell below the range of usual meaningful effects.\nWe found no difference between M0 and M6, which strongly suggests that CSAI does not impair the dynamics of cognitive action control.",

The lack of means for early diagnosis of PD has elicited interest in searching for its risk factors, which, by now, are almost obtained at a single time point in PD process, and little developing risk factors, obtained from completely normal situation to the onset or even advanced stage of PD in individual person which could monitor the progress of PD, are present. Here we have detected some potential factors in the blood of MPTP induced PD monkeys along with the progress of the disease. All the PD monkeys showed mild PD symptoms since the 9",

    "abstract": "Comorbidity of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and schizophrenia is an uncommon and rare scenario, which often poses a difficult and challenging situation for management. Both the disorders have completely opposite pathophysiology and treatment of one disorder with available pharmacological agents can pose a threat to the other disorder. The situation becomes graver and risk of adverse side effects increases when an individual presents at a later age with both these disorders along with compromised physical and mental health. Of all the available psychopharmacological agents, clozapine has been found to be quite helpful for the management of psychosis without deterioration of existing movement problems of Parkinson's disease. In this case report, we present the case of a 60-year-old female with long-standing paranoid schizophrenia for the last 30 years, who later developed IPD and discuss the various management issues encountered during her treatment.",

    "abstract": "Advances in radionuclide tracers have allowed for more accurate imaging that reflects the actions of numerous neurotransmitters, energy metabolism utilization, inflammation, and pathological protein accumulation. All of these achievements in molecular brain imaging have broadened our understanding of brain function in Parkinson's disease (PD). The implementation of molecular imaging has supported more accurate PD diagnosis as well as assessment of therapeutic outcome and disease progression. Moreover, molecular imaging is well suited for the detection of preclinical or prodromal PD cases. Despite these advances, future frontiers of research in this area will focus on using multi-modalities combining positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging along with causal modeling with complex algorithms.",

The intervention study 2 was a prescribed exercise program consisting of sessions lasting 60 min, two times a week over a 6-month period. The control group followed the same protocol which derived the same cardiorespiratory parameters, except that they were instructed to aim for a cadence of ~60 revolutions per minute and the unloaded phase lasted 3 min with an initial step of 25 W.\nStepwise incremental exercise test to volitional exhaustion was the primary outcome measure.\nStudy 1 showed higher maximum values for heart rate (HR), VO\nAn abnormal cardiovascular response to exercise was observed in pwP compared to controls. After the exercise programme, metabolic deficiencies remained for pwP. These observations add to the pathogenic understanding of PD, acknowledge an underling metabolic contribution and support that certain cardiovascular symptoms may improve as a result of this type of exercise.",

To compare the biological activity of \u03b1-synuclein prions in MSA and Parkinson's disease (PD), we developed nine \u03b1-synuclein-YFP cell lines expressing point mutations responsible for inherited PD. MSA prions robustly infected wild-type, A30P, and A53T \u03b1-synuclein-YFP cells, but they were unable to replicate in cells expressing the E46K mutation. Coexpression of the A53T and E46K mutations was unable to rescue MSA prion infection in vitro, establishing that MSA \u03b1-synuclein prions are conformationally distinct from the misfolded \u03b1-synuclein in PD patients. This observation may have profound implications for developing treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Wrist actigraphy is a form of objective sleep measurement that has gained a central role in sleep research and clinical settings. Guidelines for actigraphy recommend placing the monitor on the non-dominant wrist, however, this potentially will be the most involved limb for someone with Parkinson disease, and so alternative placement would be preferred. To-date, there is little published about sleep actigraphy use in Parkinson disease (PD). This study examines the degree of sleep actigraphy score variation in persons with PD when monitors are placed simultaneously on all four limbs. In this study, four participants wore a sleep actigraph on each limb for seven nights. Data from the four actigraphs was compared within each participant to determine the degree of consistency. We found that all of the participants' sleep efficiency and total sleep time scores were higher in the lower limb than upper limb. There was no notable difference in sleep variables between the dominant arm and non-dominant arm. We concluded that simultaneous actigraphy measurement did not notably vary between dominant and non-dominant arms. However, a discrepancy was seen between upper limbs and lower limbs actigraph scores. Further study is warranted to develop guidelines for sleep actigraphy use in this population.",

    "abstract": "Dysautonomia is a frequent and disabling complication of PD, with an estimated prevalence of 30-40% and a significant impact on the quality of life.\nTo evaluate the rate of progression of dysautonomia and, in particular, orthostatic hypotension, in a cohort of unselected PD patients, and assess the extent to which the progression of dysautonomia affects activities of daily living, health-related quality of life, and health care utilization in PD.\nWe recruited 131 consecutive patients into a 12-month, prospective, observational cohort study. Clinical measures included the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society/UPDRS, the Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson Disease-Autonomic, the Orthostatic Hypotension Symptoms Assessment, and orthostatic blood pressure measurements. Health care utilization was quantified as the number of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and outpatient clinic evaluations.\nThe overall severity of autonomic symptoms, as measured by the the Orthostatic Hypotension Symptoms Assessment total score, worsened by 20% over 12 months (P\u2009<\u20090.001), with an overall increase in orthostatic hypotension prevalence from 31.1% to 46.7% (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Worsening of autonomic symptoms was independently associated with deterioration in daily living activities (P\u2009=\u20090.021) and health-related quality of life (P\u2009=\u20090.025) adjusting for disease duration, cognitive impairment, and motor severity. Regardless of symptomatic status, orthostatic hypotension was associated with greater deterioration in daily living activities, health care utilization, and falls (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.009) compared to patients without orthostatic hypotension.\nThe severity of autonomic symptoms progressed by 20% over 1 year and was independently associated with impairments in daily living activities and health-related quality of life. Symptomatic and asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension were both associated with increased prevalence of falls and health care utilization. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Delayed gastric emptying may impair l-dopa absorption, contributing to motor fluctuations. We evaluated the effect of camicinal (GSK962040), a gastroprokinetic, on the absorption of l-dopa and symptoms of PD.\nPhase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomized to receive camicinal 50\u2009mg once-daily (n\u2009=\u200938) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200920) for 7 to 9 days.\nl-dopa exposure was similar with coadministration of camicinal compared to placebo. Median time to maximum l-dopa concentration was reduced, indicating more rapid absorption of l-dopa. Camicinal resulted in significant reduction in OFF time (-2.31 hours; 95% confidence interval: -3.71, -0.90), significant increase in ON time (+1.88 hours; 95% confidence interval: 0.28, 3.48) per day, and significant decrease in mean total MDS-UPDRS score (-12.5; 95% confidence interval: -19.67, -5.29). Camicinal treatment was generally well tolerated.\nPD symptom improvement with camicinal occurred in parallel with more rapid absorption of l-dopa. This study provides evidence of an improvement of the motor response to l-dopa in people with PD treated with camicinal 50\u2009mg once-daily compared with placebo, which will require further evaluation. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

The overall prevalence of antipsychotic use was 9.8% (29 of 296); 95.5% (28 of 29) of the patients had dementia when initiating antipsychotics. The most frequent indication (71.4%; 20 of 28) was psychosis or behavior threatening to the patient or others.\nThe prevalence of antipsychotic use in patients with PD is lower than expected from previously reported cumulative incidences. Dementia is highly prevalent in those starting antipsychotics.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting 10 million people worldwide, but the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are still unclear. The disease is characterised by dopamine nerve cell loss in the mid-brain and intra-cellular accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein that results in motor and non-motor dysfunction. In this review, we discuss the neuroprotective effects of the stomach hormone, ghrelin, in models of Parkinson's disease. Recent findings suggest that it may modulate mitochondrial function and autophagic clearance of impaired organelle in response to changes in cellular energy balance. We consider the putative cellular mechanisms underlying ghrelin-action and the possible role of ghrelin mimetics in slowing or preventing Parkinson's disease progression. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Metabolic Impairment as Risk Factors for Neurodegenerative Disorders.'",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a wide array of motor and non-motor symptoms. It remains unclear whether neurodegeneration in discrete loci gives rise to discrete symptoms, or whether network-wide atrophy gives rise to the unique behavioural and clinical profile associated with PD. Here we apply a data-driven strategy to isolate large-scale, multivariate associations between distributed atrophy patterns and clinical phenotypes in PD. In a sample of N\u202f=\u202f229 de novo PD patients, we estimate disease-related atrophy using deformation based morphometry (DBM) of T1 weighted MR images. Using partial least squares (PLS), we identify a network of subcortical and cortical regions whose collective atrophy is associated with a clinical phenotype encompassing motor and non-motor features. Despite the relatively early stage of the disease in the sample, the atrophy pattern encompassed lower brainstem, substantia nigra, basal ganglia and cortical areas, consistent with the Braak hypothesis. In addition, individual variation in this putative atrophy network predicted longitudinal clinical progression in both motor and non-motor symptoms. Altogether, these results demonstrate a pleiotropic mapping between neurodegeneration and the clinical manifestations of PD, and that this mapping can be detected even in de novo patients.",

    "abstract": "Past animal and human studies robustly report that the cholinergic system plays an essential role in both top-down and bottom-up attentional control, as well as other aspects of cognition (see Ballinger et\u00a0al., 2016 for a recent review). However, current understanding of how two major cholinergic pathways in the human brain (the basal forebrain-cortical pathway, and the brainstem pedunculopontine-thalamic pathway) contribute to specific cognitive functions remains somewhat limited. To address this issue, we examine how individual variation in the integrity of striatal-dopaminergic, thalamic-cholinergic, and cortical-cholinergic pathways (measured using Positron Emission Tomography in patients with Parkinson's disease) was associated with individual variation in the initial goal-directed focus of attention, the ability to sustain attentional performance over time, and the ability to avoid distraction from a highly-salient, but irrelevant, environmental stimulus. Compared to healthy controls, PD patients performed similarly in the precision of attention-dependent judgments of duration, and in sustaining attention over time. However, PD patients' performance was strikingly more impaired by the distractor. More critically, regression analyses indicated that only cortical-cholinergic integrity, not thalamic-cholinergic or striatal-dopaminergic integrity, made a specific contribution to the ability to resist distraction after controlling for the other variables. These results demonstrate that the basal forebrain cortical cholinergic system serves a specific role in executing top-down control to resist external distraction.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the current ethical issues in relation to recognizing and managing Parkinson disease (PD) from the patient's perspective.\nTwelve patients living with PD who were from the medical school's Patients as Educators program were recruited. Semistructured interviews were conducted to record patient experiences in order to identify potential ethical issues in relation to recognizing and managing PD. Thematic analysis was applied to the interview transcripts.\nFour key themes emerged from the interviews. These were information giving, coping, identity, and future medical treatment. These data indicate variable experiences in relation to communication between patient and health-care professional, better support for both planning end-of-life decisions and in coping with the disease's impacts on their identity. Patients with PD also struggle with access to support services and support for main carer.\nTo ensure ethical practice in supporting patients with PD, these emerging themes need further investigation; and management guidelines relevant to PD must be informed by research in this area to ensure ethical care of patients with PD, their carers, and families.",

    "abstract": "Stereological analysis is the optimal tool for quantitative assessment of brain morphological and cellular changes induced by neurotoxic lesions or treatment interventions. Stereological methods based on random sampling techniques yield unbiased estimates of particle counts within a defined volume, thereby providing a true quantitative estimate of the target cell population. Neurodegenerative diseases involve loss of specific neuron types, such as the midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease and in animal models of nigrostriatal degeneration. Therefore, we applied an established automated physical disector principle in a fractionator design for efficient stereological quantitative analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of hemiparkinsonian rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions. We obtained reliable estimates of dopamine neuron numbers, and established the relationship between behavioral asymmetry and dopamine neuron loss on the lesioned side. In conclusion, the automated physical disector principle provided a useful and efficient tool for unbiased estimation of TH-positive neurons in rat midbrain, and should prove valuable for investigating neuroprotective strategies in 6-OHDA model of parkinsonism, while generalizing to other immunohistochemically-defined cell populations.",

    "abstract": "Although Parkinson's disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide, its cost in Brazil - South America's largest country - is unknown.\nThe goal of this study was to calculate the average annual cost of Parkinson's disease in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil), with a focus on disease-related motor symptoms.\nThis was a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis using a bottom-up approach (ie, from the society's perspective). Patients (N=260) at two tertiary public health centers, who were residents of the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area, completed standardized questionnaires regarding their disease-related expenses. We used simple and multiple generalized linear models to assess the correlations between total cost and patient-related, as well as disease-related variables.\nThe total average annual cost of Parkinson's disease was estimated at US$5,853.50 per person, including US$3,172.00 in direct costs (medical and nonmedical) and US$2,681.50 in indirect costs. Costs were directly correlated with disease severity (including the degree of motor symptoms), patients' age, and time since disease onset.\nIn this study, we determined the cost of Parkinson's disease in Brazil and observed that disease-related motor symptoms are a significant component of the costs incurred on the public health system, patients, and society in general.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) results in severe limitation in ambulation caused by abnormality of gait and posture. The rate of complications, including fractures and dislocation after total hip arthroplasty (THA), can be higher among these patients. The goal of this study was to investigate the long-term outcomes of primary and revision THAs with cementless dual mobility implants.\nThis retrospective study examines 59 PD patients who had surgery between 2002 and 2012. All the primary cases were performed for osteoarthritis and all patients received cementless acetabular implants with dual mobility bearing surface. The femoral stem was cemented in 4 patients who underwent revision surgery. The mean follow-up time was 8.3 years (4-14 years).\nGood to excellent pain relief was achieved in 53 of 57 patients at the 2-year follow-up and in 40 of 47 patients at their latest follow-up. The most common medical complication was cognitive impairment (12 of 57 patients). One patient sustained an intraprosthetic hip dislocation 9 years after surgery, which required revision. Four patients sustained periprosthetic femoral fractures with well-fixed stem, requiring open reduction and internal fixation. The disability had increased in 68% of the patients in the latest follow-up visit.\nOur study shows that elective primary or revision THA using cementless implants with dual mobility bearing surface in patients with PD provides satisfactory long-term outcomes, although many of these patients may see a general worsening of their activities over time due to PD.",

    "abstract": "Declines in simultaneous performance of a cognitive and motor task are present in Parkinson's disease due to compromised basal ganglia function related to information processing. The aim of this project was to determine if biomechanical measures of arm swing could be used as a marker of gait function under dual-task conditions in Parkinson's disease patients.\nTwenty-three patients with Parkinson's disease completed single and dual-task cognitive-motor tests while walking on a treadmill at a self-selected rate. Multiple cognitive domains were evaluated with five cognitive tests. Cognitive tests were completed in isolation (single-task) and simultaneously with gait (dual-task). Upper extremity biomechanical data were gathered using the Motek CAREN system. Primary outcomes characterizing arm swing were: path length, normalized jerk, coefficient of variation of arm swing time, and cognitive performance.\nPerformance on the cognitive tasks were similar across single and dual-task conditions. However, biomechanical measures exhibited significant changes between single and dual-task conditions, with the greatest changes occurring in the most challenging conditions. Arm swing path length decreased significantly from single to dual-task, with the greatest decrease of 21.16%. Jerk, characterizing smoothness, increased significantly when moving from single to dual-task conditions.\nThe simultaneous performance of a cognitive and gait task resulted in decrements in arm swing while cognitive performance was maintained. Arm swing outcomes provide a sensitive measure of declines in gait function in Parkinson's disease under dual-task conditions. The quantification of arm swing is a feasible approach to identifying and evaluating gait related declines under dual-task conditions.",

The features were tested on a dataset of 652 [\nCross-validation results based on SVM have shown that, individually, the features that generated the highest accuracies were the length of the striatal region (96.5%), the putaminal binding potential (95.4%) and the striatal binding potential (93.9%) with no statistically significant differences among them. The highest classification accuracy was obtained using all features simultaneously (accuracy 97.9%, sensitivity 98% and specificity 97.6%). Generally, slightly better results were obtained using the SVM with no statistically significant difference to the other classifiers for most of the features.\nThe length of the striatal region uptake is clinically useful and highly valuable to confirm dopaminergic degeneration \"in vivo\" as an aid to the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. It compares fairly well to the standard uptake ratio-based features, reaching, at least, similar accuracies and is easier to obtain automatically. Thus, we propose its day to day clinical use, jointly with the uptake ratio-based features, in the computer-aided diagnosis of dopaminergic degeneration in Parkinson's disease.",

The cohort comprised of 3,852 PD inpatients and 19,260 non-PD inpatients, and 5,217 PD outpatients and 26,085 non-PD outpatients. Referent subjects were matched to PD patients by age at initial hospital admissions or visits, gender, and county of residence using systematic random-sampling method.\nCompared to non-PD inpatients, PD inpatients were at higher risks for dementia (relative risk [RR] 2.29; 95% CI 2.14-2.45), mood disorders (RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.44-1.70), gastrointestinal disorders (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.06-1.25), and urinary tract infections (RR 1.33; 95% CI 1.22-1.45), while PD outpatients had higher risks for spondylosis (RR 1.23; 95% CI 1.09-1.38), genitourinary disorders (RR 1.48; 95% CI 1.29-1.69), gastrointestinal disorders (RR 1.59; 95% CI 1.38-1.84), and dementia (RR 2.83; 95% CI 2.38-3.37) than non-PD outpatients.\nThe findings highlight PD as a multisystem neurodegenerative disorder, and this information is crucial for creating strategies to better prevent and manage PD complications.",

    "abstract": "Semantic abstract reasoning(SAR) is an important executive domain that is involved in semantic information processing and enables one to make sense of the attributes of objects, facts and concepts in the world. We sought to investigate whether Parkinson's disease subjects(PDs) have difficulty in SAR and to examine the associated pattern of gray matter morphological changes.\nEighty-six PDs and 30 healthy controls were enrolled. PDs were grouped into PD subjects with Similarities preservation(PDSP, n\u202f=\u202f62) and PD subjects with Similarities impairment(PDSI, n\u202f=\u202f24)according to their performance on the Similarities subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Brain structural images were captured with a 3T MRI scanner. Surface-based investigation of cortical thickness and automated segmentation of deep gray matter were conducted using FreeSurfer software.\nPDs performed notably worse on the Similarities test than controls(F\u202f=\u202f13.56, P\u202f<\u202f0.001).In the PDSI group, cortical thinning associated with Similarities scores was found in the left superior frontal, left superior parietal and left rostral middle frontal regions. Notable atrophy of the bilateral hippocampi was observed, but only the right hippocampus volume was positively correlated with the Similarities scores of the PDSI group.\nPDs have difficulty in SAR, and this limitation may be associated with impaired conceptual abstraction and generalization along with semantic memory deficits. Cortical thinning in the left frontal and parietal regions and atrophy in the right hippocampus may explain these impairments among Chinese PDs.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a genome-wide association study of a Caucasian population identified variant rs3794087 in intron 4 of the SLC1A2 gene, which may increase the risk of essential tremor (ET). Considering the overlap in the pathological features and clinical manifestations of ET and Parkinson's disease (PD), several studies on the association between rs3794087 and PD were later performed in other populations. However, results about the role of SLC1A2 rs3794087 in PD were inconsistent. We thus performed a case-control study in a Chinese Han population to investigate the role of SLC1A2 rs3794087 in Chinese patients with PD. Overall, 1096 subjects comprising 546 patients with PD and 550 control subjects were genotyped. A meta-analysis of the data obtained from the current sample-set and those available from prior studies was performed. Taking all patients and controls into consideration, rs3794087 was found to have no significant effect on PD susceptibility in analyses using allelic (p\u202f=\u202f.486), genotype (p\u202f=\u202f.736), additive (p\u202f=\u202f.764), dominant (p\u202f=\u202f.438), and recessive (p\u202f=\u202f.878) genetic models. The results of the meta-analysis were in agreement with our findings (the pooled OR was 0.97 and 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.85, 1.10). Our study suggested that rs3794087 does not lead to an increased risk of PD in the Chinese Han population. The role of single nucleotide polymorphism rs3794087 in the development of PD remains to be further studied.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidences suggest that neuroinflammation is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). MicroRNAs have been recently recognized as crucial regulators of inflammatory responses. Here, we found significant downregulation of microRNA-30e (miR-30e) in SNpc of MPTP-induced PD mice. Next, we employed miR-30e agomir to upregulate miR-30e expression in MPTP-treated mice. Our results showed that delivery of miR-30e agomir remarkably improved motor behavioral deficits and neuronal activity, and inhibited the loss of dopamine neurons. Moreover, the increased \u03b1-synuclein protein expression in SNpc of MPTP-PD mice was alleviated by the upregulation of miR-30e. Further, miR-30e agomir administration also attenuated the marked increase of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, COX-2, iNOS, and restored the decreased secretion of BDNF in SNpc. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time that miR-30e directly targeted to Nlrp3, thus suppressing Nlrp3 mRNA and protein expression. Finally, miR-30e upregulation significantly inhibited the activation of Nlrp3 inflammasome as evident from the decreased Nlrp3, Caspase-1 and ASC expressions and IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 secretions. Taken together, our study demonstrates that miR-30e ameliorates neuroinflammation in the MPTP model of PD by decreasing Nlrp3 inflammasome activity. These findings suggesting that miR30e may be a key inflammation-mediated molecule that could be a potential target for PD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pathologic alterations in resting-state brain activity patterns exist among individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Since physical exercise alters resting-state brain activity in non-PD populations and improves PD symptoms, we assessed the acute effect of exercise on resting-state brain activity in exercise-trained individuals with PD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was collected twice for 17 PD participants at the conclusion of an exercise intervention. The acute effect of exercise was examined for PD participants using the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) before and after a single bout of exercise. Correlations of clinical variables (i.e., PDQ-39 quality of life and MDS-UPDRS) with ALFF values were examined for the exercise-trained PD participants. RESULTS An effect of acute exercise was observed as an increased ALFF signal within the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), left ventrolateral PFC, and bilaterally within the substantia nigra (SN). Quality of life was positively correlated with ALFF values within the vmPFC and vlPFC. CONCLUSIONS Given the role of the SN and PFC in motor and non-motor symptoms in PD, the acute increases in brain activity within these regions, if repeated frequently over time (i.e., exercise training), may serve as a potential mechanism underlying exercise-induced PD-specific clinical benefits.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have difficulty performing self-initiated movements. The neural mechanism of this deficiency remains unclear. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the functional connectivity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during self-initiated movement in patients with PD.\nfMRI were acquired from patients with PD and age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects during a self-initiated right hand tapping task. We selected the bilateral sensorimotor subregions of the STN as regions of interest for our connectivity analysis.\nWe found that the STN contralateral to voluntary hand movement exhibited enhanced connectivity with the midbrain, thalamus, putamen, and so on in patients with PD compared to control subjects. In contrast, the STN ipsilateral to the hand movement exhibited enhanced connectivity with the midbrain and insula in PD patients compared to control subjects. Connectivity between the STN contralateral to the hand movement and the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area was positively correlated with the severity of bradykinesia. Our findings suggest that STN-related connectivity in the hyperdirect and indirect basal ganglia pathways is strengthened during self-initiated movement in patients with PD. These disrupted network connections may contribute to bradykinesia.",

    "abstract": "Progressive neuronal death in brainstem nuclei and widespread accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein are neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reduction of \u03b1-synuclein levels is therefore a potential therapy for PD. However, because \u03b1-synuclein is essential for neuronal development and function, \u03b1-synuclein elimination would dramatically impact brain function. We previously developed conjugated small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences that selectively target serotonin (5-HT) or norepinephrine (NE) neurons after intranasal administration. Here, we used this strategy to conjugate inhibitory oligonucleotides, siRNA and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), with the triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor indatraline (IND), to selectively reduce \u03b1-synuclein expression in the brainstem monoamine nuclei of mice after intranasal delivery. Following internalization of the conjugated oligonucleotides in monoamine neurons, reduced levels of endogenous \u03b1-synuclein mRNA and protein were found in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), and locus coeruleus (LC). \u03b1-Synuclein knockdown by \u223c20%-40% did not cause monoaminergic neurodegeneration and enhanced forebrain dopamine (DA) and 5-HT release. Conversely, a modest human \u03b1-synuclein overexpression in DA neurons markedly reduced striatal DA release. These results indicate that \u03b1-synuclein negatively regulates monoamine neurotransmission and set the stage for the testing of non-viral inhibitory oligonucleotides as disease-modifying agents in \u03b1-synuclein models of PD.",

In spite of greater survival, women with PD used home health and skilled nursing facility care more often, and had less outpatient physician contact than men throughout the study period.\nWomen experience a unique health trajectory after PD diagnosis as suggested by differing comorbid disease burden and health care utilization compared to men. Future studies of sex differences in care needs, care quality, comorbidity related disability, PD progression, and non-clinical factors associated with disability are needed to inform research agendas and clinical guidelines that may improve quality survival for women with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons due to intracytoplasmic inclusions composed predominantly of a synaptic protein called \u03b1-synuclein. Accumulations of \u03b1-synuclein are thought to 'mask' acetylation sites on histone proteins, inhibiting the action of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes in their equilibrium with histone deacetylases (HDACs), thus deregulating the dynamic control of gene transcription. It is therefore hypothesised that the misbalance in the actions of HATs/HDACs in neurodegeneration can be rectified with the use of HDAC inhibitors, limiting the deregulation of transcription and aiding neuronal homeostasis and neuroprotection in disorders such as PD. Here we quantify histone acetylation in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in the brains of control, early and late stage PD cases to determine if histone acetylation is a function of disease progression. PD development is associated with Braak-dependent increases in histone acetylation. Concurrently, we show that as expected disease progression is associated with reduced markers of dopaminergic neurons and increased markers of activated microglia. We go on to demonstrate that in vitro, degenerating dopaminergic neurons exhibit histone hypoacetylation whereas activated microglia exhibit histone hyperacetylation. This suggests that the disease-dependent increase in histone acetylation observed in human PD cases is likely a combination of the contributions of both degenerating dopaminergic neurons and infiltrating activated microglia. The HDAC SIRT 2 has become increasingly implicated as a novel target for mediation of neuroprotection in PD: the neuronal and microglial specific effects of its inhibition however remain unclear. We demonstrate that SIRT 2 expression in the SNpc of PD brains remains relatively unchanged from controls and that SIRT 2 inhibition, via AGK2 treatment of neuronal and microglial cultures, results in neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons and reduced activation of microglial cells. Taken together, here we demonstrate that histone acetylation is disease-dependently altered in PD, likely due the effects of dopaminergic neurodegeneration and microglial infiltration; yet SIRT 2 remains relatively unaltered with disease. Given the stable nature of SIRT 2 expression with disease and the effects of SIRT 2 inhibitor treatment on degenerating dopaminergic neurons and activated microglia detected in vitro, SIRT 2 inhibitors warrant further investigation as potential therapeutics for the treatment of the PD.",

    "abstract": "Although previous studies have reported that the prevalence of low back pain in Parkinson's disease was over 50% and low back pain was often classified as chronic, risk factors of chronic low back pain have not been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive risk factors of chronic low back pain in Parkinson's disease.\nOne hundred and sixty-eight patients with Parkinson's disease and 179 controls were consecutively included in the study. Demographic data of the two groups and disease characteristics of Parkinson's disease patient group were recorded. Low back pain lasting for \u22653 months was evaluated as chronic. Firstly, the bivariate correlations were calculated between chronic low back pain and all possible risk factors. Then, a multivariate regression was used to evaluate the impact of the predictors of chronic low back pain.\nThe frequency of chronic low back pain in Parkinson's disease patients and controls were 48.2% and 26.7%, respectively (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). The predictive risk factors of chronic low back pain in Parkinson's disease were general factors including age (odds ratio\u202f=\u202f1.053, p\u202f=\u202f0.032) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Depression subscore (odds ratio\u202f=\u202f1.218, p\u202f=\u202f0.001), and Parkinson's disease-related factors including rigidity (odds ratio\u202f=\u202f5.109, p\u202f=\u202f0.002) and posture item scores (odds ratio\u202f=\u202f5.019, p\u202f=\u202f0.0001).\nThe chronic low back pain affects approximately half of the patients with Parkinson's disease. Prevention of depression or treatment recommendations for managing depression, close monitoring of anti- parkinsonian medication to keep motor symptoms under control, and attempts to prevent, correct or reduce abnormal posture may help reduce the frequency of chronic low back pain in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Exercise has been recommended to improve motor function in Parkinson patients, but its value in altering progression of disease is unknown. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of running wheel exercise in mice. In adult wild-type mice, one week of running wheel activity led to significantly increased DJ-1 protein concentrations in muscle and plasma. In DJ-1 knockout mice, running wheel performance was much slower and Rotarod performance was reduced, suggesting that DJ-1 protein is required for normal motor activity. To see if exercise can prevent abnormal protein deposition and behavioral decline in transgenic animals expressing a mutant human form of \u03b1-synuclein in all neurons, we set up running wheels in the cages of pre-symptomatic animals at 12 months old. Activity was monitored for a 3-month period. After 3 months, motor and cognitive performance on the Rotarod and Morris Water Maze were significantly better in running animals compared to control transgenic animals with locked running wheels. Biochemical analysis revealed that running mice had significantly higher DJ-1, Hsp70 and BDNF concentrations and had significantly less \u03b1-synuclein aggregation in brain compared to control mice. By contrast, plasma concentrations of \u03b1-synuclein were significantly higher in exercising mice compared to control mice. Our results suggest that exercise may slow the progression of Parkinson's disease by preventing abnormal protein aggregation in brain.",

    "abstract": "In previous work, we found that intensive amplitude training successfully improved micrographia in Parkinson's disease (PD). Handwriting abnormalities in PD also express themselves in stroke duration and writing fluency. It is currently unknown whether training changes these dysgraphic features.\nTo determine the differential effects of amplitude training on various hallmarks of handwriting abnormalities in PD.\nWe randomized 38 right-handed subjects in early to mid-stage of PD into an experimental group (n = 18), receiving training focused at improving writing size during 30 minutes/day, five days/week for six weeks, and a placebo group (n = 20), receiving stretch and relaxation exercises at equal intensity. Writing skills were assessed using a touch-sensitive tablet pre- and post-training, and after a six-week retention period. Tests encompassed a transfer task, evaluating trained and untrained sequences, and an automatization task, comparing single- and dual-task handwriting. Outcome parameters were stroke duration (s), writing velocity (cm/s) and normalized jerk (i.e. fluency).\nIn contrast to the reported positive effects of training on writing size, the current results showed increases in stroke duration and normalized jerk after amplitude training, which were absent in the placebo group. These increases remained after the six-week retention period. In contrast, velocity remained unchanged throughout the study.\nWhile intensive amplitude training is beneficial to improve writing size in PD, it comes at a cost as fluency and stroke duration deteriorated after training. The findings imply that PD patients can redistribute movement priorities after training within a compromised motor system.",

PD patients were administered with Non-Motor symptom questionnaire (NMSQuest), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS-III), the Mini-Mental State Examination score (MMSE), the Hoehn-Yahr classification, the MoCA, and GDS-15. The relationship between NMS burden and PD subtypes, age, gender and disease severity were examined using linear regression models. The prevalence of each NMS among different PD motor subtypes was analyzed using x2 test.\nCompared with the healthy controls, PD patients had a higher number of NMS. The prevalence of NMS in postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) group is higher than that in tremor dominant (TD) group. There is no significant correlation between age, gender, MMSE scores, MoCA scores and the number of NMS. PD patients with higher UPDRS-III scores and a longer course of disease had a higher prevalence of NMS.\nNMS is also common in PD patients at an early stage. The PIGD group who have more axial injuries and more severe motor symptoms, have a higher risk of NMS burden than PD patients in TD group.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of action and extent of selective dopaminergic neurodegeneration caused by exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE) leading to the endogenous formation of the neurotoxin 1-trichloromethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-\u03b2-carboline (TaClo) in rodents. Beginning at 3\u00a0months of age, male C57BL/6 mice received oral TCE dissolved in vehicle for 8\u00a0months. Dopaminergic neuronal loss was assessed by nigral tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity. Selective dopaminergic neurodegeneration was determined based on histological analysis of non-dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Behavioral assays were evaluated using open field activity and rotarod tests. Mitochondrial complex I activity, oxidative stress markers, and microglial activation were also examined in the substantia nigra. The level of TaClo was detected using HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Dopaminergic neurotoxicity of TaClo was determined in midbrain organotypic cultures from rat pups. Following 8\u00a0months of TCE treatment, there was a progressive and selective loss of 50% of the dopaminergic neurons in mouse substantia nigra (SN) and about 50% loss of dopamine and 72% loss of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the striatum, respectively. In addition, motor deficits, mitochondrial impairment, oxidative stress, and inflammation were measured. TaClo content was quantified in the brain after TCE treatment. In organotypic cultures, TaClo rather than TCE induced dopaminergic neuronal loss, similar to MPP",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial complex I deficiency occurs in the substantia nigra of individuals with Parkinson's disease. It is generally believed that this phenomenon is caused by accumulating mitochondrial DNA damage in neurons and that it contributes to the process of neurodegeneration. We hypothesized that if these theories are correct, complex I deficiency should extend beyond the substantia nigra to other affected brain regions in Parkinson's disease and correlate tightly with neuronal mitochondrial DNA damage. To test our hypothesis, we employed a combination of semiquantitative immunohistochemical analyses, Western blot and activity measurements, to assess complex I quantity and function in multiple brain regions from an extensively characterized population-based cohort of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n\u00a0=\u00a018) and gender and age matched healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a011). Mitochondrial DNA was assessed in single neurons from the same areas by real-time PCR. Immunohistochemistry showed that neuronal complex I deficiency occurs throughout the Parkinson's disease brain, including areas spared by the neurodegenerative process such as the cerebellum. Activity measurements in brain homogenate confirmed a moderate decrease of complex I function, whereas Western blot was less sensitive, detecting only a mild reduction, which did not reach statistical significance at the group level. With the exception of the substantia nigra, neuronal complex I loss showed no correlation with the load of somatic mitochondrial DNA damage. Interestingly, \u03b1-synuclein aggregation was less common in complex I deficient neurons in the substantia nigra. We show that neuronal complex I deficiency is a widespread phenomenon in the Parkinson's disease brain which, contrary to mainstream theory, does not follow the anatomical distribution of neurodegeneration and is not associated with the neuronal load of mitochondrial DNA mutation. Our findings suggest that complex I deficiency in Parkinson's disease can occur independently of mitochondrial DNA damage and may not have a pathogenic role in the neurodegenerative process.",

We link the Braak's staging hypothesis of PD with the recent evidence from in-vivo and in-vitro studies for the prion-like cell-to-cell propagation of \u03b1-syn (via exocytosis and endocytosis). The classical accumulation of aggregated \u03b1-syn in PD may result from an increased production or a failure in the mechanisms of clearance of \u03b1-syn. We discuss novel agents, currently in clinical trial for PD including the ones that impact the aggregation of \u03b1-syn and others that interfere with \u03b1-syn endocytosis as a means to target the progression of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit deficits in recognizing and expressing vocal emotional prosody. The aim of this study was to explore emotional prosody processing in patients with PD shortly after subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS).\nTwo groups of patients with PD (pre-DBS and post-DBS) and one healthy control (HC) group were recruited as participants. All participants (PD and HC) were assessed using the Montreal Affective Voices database 50 Voices Recognition test. All participants were asked to nonverbally express five basic emotions (happiness, anger, fear, sadness, and neutral) to test emotional prosody expression. Fifteen native Chinese speakers were recruited as raters. We recorded the accuracy rate, reaction time, confidence level, and two acoustic parameters (mean pitch and mean intensity).\nThe PD groups scored lower than the HC group in recognizing and expressing emotional prosody. STN DBS had no significant effect on the recognition of emotional prosody but had a significant effect on fear prosody expression. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between performance on emotional prosody recognition tests and performance on emotional prosody expression tests in both the pre-DBS PD and post-DBS PD groups.\nShortly after STN DBS, the ability to recognize emotional prosody was not altered, but fear expression was impaired. We identified associations between abnormalities in emotional prosody recognition and expression deficits both before and after STN DBS, indicating that the processes involved in recognizing and expressing emotional prosody may share a common system.",

    "abstract": "We herein report a case of pheochromocytoma occurring in the course of Parkinson's disease. The coexistence of these two disease is extremely rare, with only four cases hitherto reported across the public databases. It is also noteworthy that biochemical tests, which are critical for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, are severely confounded by dopaminergic medications for Parkinson's disease, highlighting the importance of image-based modalities in this setting. We further attempted to gain insight into the potential molecular mechanisms, proposing that hypoxia-inducible factor signaling could make these two diseases mutually exclusive, while excessive reactive oxygen species could enable their coexistence.",

    "abstract": "The present behavioral study delineates the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) and of dopaminergic medication on action control over voluntary behavior. Previous studies reported either prolonged responding or stopping latencies in PD compared to healthy controls (HC). Few studies investigated the effects of dopaminergic medication on these processes concurrently. We administered a stop-change task, an extended version of the stop task, that required (i) speeded responding to a go signal (i.e., going), (ii) inhibiting ongoing motor responses (i.e., stopping), and (iii) changing to an alternative response. PD performance (n = 33) was collected once during regular dopaminergic medication conditions (On state) and once after a medication washout period (Off state). A group of age-matched HC (n = 21) performed the stop-change task once. Response latencies to go signals were comparable between HC and PD Off, indicative of unimpaired going. Compared to HC, PD Off showed prolonged stopping latencies. Within the clinical group, stopping latencies significantly improved after taking dopaminergic medication. Interestingly, the shorter stopping latencies observed in the On state were paralleled by longer response latencies to go signals. The degree of the inhibition improvement observed in the medication state was correlated with the degree of response slowing. Change RT did not vary between groups or between medication states. These patterns of results are discussed in terms of a tradeoff between going versus stopping of motor responses in PD patients. Shifts of this tradeoff seem to be driven by dopaminergic medication, which has potential clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria, the powerhouse of the neural cells in the brain, are also the seat of certain essential gene signaling pathways that control neuronal functions. Deterioration of mitochondrial functions has been widely reported in normal aging as well as in a spectrum of age-associated neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Evidences accumulated in the recent past provide not only advanced information on the causes of mitochondrial bioenergetics defects and redox imbalance in PD brains, but also much insight into mitochondrial biogenesis, quality control of mitochondrial proteins, and genes, which regulate intra- and extra-mitochondrial signaling that control the general health of neural cells. The mitochondrial quality control machinery is affected in aging and especially in PD, thus affecting intraneuronal protein transport and degradation, which are primarily responsible for accumulation of misfolded proteins and mitochondrial damage in sporadic as well as familial PD. Essentially we considered in the first half of this review, mitochondria-based targets such as mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial quality control pathways in PD, relevance of mitochondrial DNA mutations, mitophagy, mitochondrial proteases, mitochondrial flux, and finally mitochondria-based therapies possible for PD. Therapeutic aspects are considered in the later half and mitochondria-targeted antioxidant therapy, mitophagy enhancers, mitochondrial biogenesis boasters, mitochondrial dynamics modulators, and gene-based therapeutic approaches are discussed. The present review is a critical assessment of this information to distinguish some exemplary mitochondrial therapeutic targets, and provides a utilitarian perception of some avenues for therapeutic designs on identified mitochondrial targets for PD, a very incapacitating disorder of the geriatric population, world over.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of speech disorders in PD taking into account sociodemographic conditions is not frequent. This paper aims to establish correlations between articulation disorders in PD patients and factors such as the patients' sex, age, education and residence.\nThe study included 92 patients with idiopathic PD diagnosed by means of multiple neurological examinations, biochemical tests, MRI and CT scanning carried out in accordance with the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank (UKPDSBB) criteria. A speech and language test involved the assessment of the mobility of the speech organs as well as the reflexes inside the oral cavity. Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment was applied for an objective evaluation of dysarthria.\nThe study revealed the existence of significant relationship between the functionality of articulators in PD patients and their education and residence. Big city dwellers demonstrated lower incidence of disorders within speech organs, particularly those affecting mobility of the soft palate while eating. Disorders of moderate intensity were more frequently found in subjects living in villages. Subjects with a university education displayed better position of the lips at rest and better performance of both lips and the mandible while speaking.\nAbnormal functioning of the articulatory organs was observed more frequently in PD patients residing in rural areas than in those inhabiting urban areas. As for education, our cohort university graduates displayed a better position of the lips at rest and better performance of the lips and jaw during speaking than those with secondary and vocational education.",

    "abstract": "It has long been accepted that mitochondrial function and morphology is affected in Parkinson's disease, and that mitochondrial function can be directly related to its morphology. So far, mitochondrial morphological alterations studies, in the context of this neurodegenerative disease, have been performed through microscopic methodologies. The goal of the present work is to address if the modifications in the mitochondrial-shaping proteins occurring in this disorder have implications in other cellular pathways, which might constitute important pathways for the disease progression. To do so, we conducted a novel approach through a thorough exploration of the available proteomics-based studies in the context of Parkinson's disease. The analysis provided insight into the altered biological pathways affected by changes in the expression of mitochondrial-shaping proteins via different bioinformatic tools. Unexpectedly, we observed that the mitochondrial-shaping proteins altered in the context of Parkinson's disease are, in the vast majority, related to the organization of the mitochondrial cristae. Conversely, in the studies that have resorted to microscopy-based techniques, the most widely reported alteration in the context of this disorder is mitochondria fragmentation. Cristae membrane organization is pivotal for mitochondrial ATP production, and changes in their morphology have a direct impact on the organization and function of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. To understand which biological processes are affected by the alteration of these proteins we analyzed the binding partners of the mitochondrial-shaping proteins that were found altered in Parkinson's disease. We showed that the binding partners fall into seven different cellular components, which include mitochondria, proteasome, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), amongst others. It is noteworthy that, by evaluating the biological process in which these modified proteins are involved, we showed that they are related to the production and metabolism of ATP, immune response, cytoskeleton alteration, and oxidative stress, amongst others. In summary, with our bioinformatics approach using the data on the modified proteins in Parkinson's disease patients, we were able to relate the alteration of mitochondrial-shaping proteins to modifications of crucial cellular pathways affected in this disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the midbrain substantia nigra (SN). Neuroinflammation, which is marked by microglial activation, plays a very important role in the pathogenesis of PD. Pro-inflammatory mediators produced by activated microglia could damage DA neurons. Hence, the inhibition of microglial activation may provide a new approach for treating PD. Galangin has been shown to inhibit inflammation in a variety of diseases, but not PD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of galangin and the underlying mechanisms in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced PD models. We first examined the protective effect of galangin in the LPS-induced PD rat model. Specifically, we investigated the effects on motor dysfunction, microglial activation, and the loss of DA neurons. Then, galangin was used to detect the impact on the inflammatory responses and inflammatory signaling pathways in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. The in vivo results showed that galangin dose-dependently attenuates the activation of microglia, the loss of DA neurons, and motor dysfunction. In vitro, galangin markedly inhibited LPS-induced expression of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) via associating with the phosphorylation of c-JUN N-terminal Kinase (JNK), p38, protein kinase B (AKT), and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p65. Collectively, the results indicated that galangin has a role in protecting DA neurons by inhibiting microglial activation.",

    "abstract": "The optimal timing of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a topic of ongoing debate. In patients with short disease duration an improvement of quality of life (QoL) has been demonstrated for patients aged younger than 61 years. However, this has not been systematically investigated in older patients yet. We hypothesized that patients aged 61 years or older experience a significant QoL improvement after STN-DBS with no difference in effect sizes for groups of patients with short and longer disease duration.\nFrom four centers (Cologne, London, Manchester, Venice) we identified \"older patients\" aged 61 years or older with short (\u22648 years) or longer disease duration and compared QoL, motor impairment, complications, medication requirements, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) on baseline and five months after surgery.\nMean age/disease duration in 21 subjects with shorter disease duration were 65.5/6.3 years compared to 66.8/14.6 in 33 subjects with longer disease duration. The short disease duration group was affected by less baseline motor complications (p\u2009=\u20090.002). QoL in the short/longer disease duration group improved by 35/20% (p\u2009=\u20090.010/p\u2009=\u20090.006), motor complications by 40/44% (p\u2009=\u20090.018/p\u2009<\u20090.001), and medication requirements by 51/49% (both p\u2009<\u20090.001). MMSE remained unchanged in both groups.\nPatients aged 61 years or older benefited from STN-DBS regardless of short (\u22648 years) or longer (>8 years) disease duration. Our results contribute to the debate about DBS selection criteria and timing and call for prospective confirmation in a larger cohort.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the acute effect of short pulse widths on the therapeutic window in subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease.\nWe assessed 10 PD patients with STN-DBS at a 60-\u00b5s pulse width. We randomly and double-blindedly applied 10- to 50-\u00b5s pulse widths. The principal outcome was the therapeutic window (difference between the amplitude thresholds for visible muscle contraction and for best rigidity control). The secondary outcome was the charge per pulse (which reflects the efficiency of the stimulation) needed to control rigidity. Two-way analysis of variance and pairwise t tests were applied.\nThe therapeutic window widened when the pulse width shortened (r\u2009=\u2009-0.45; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and charge per pulse was reduced (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nThis randomized, double-blind study showed that shorter pulse widths widen the therapeutic window of STN-DBS in PD without increasing the electrical charge required to obtain the same acute clinical benefit. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "To explore perceptions of balance and falls among people with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease 3\u2009-\u200912\u2009months following participation in supervised balance training.\nThis qualitative study used in-depth individual interviews for data collection among 13 people with Parkinson's disease. Interviews were systematically analyzed using qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach.\nThree main themes arose: Falls - avoided and intended highlights the wide spectrum of fall perceptions, ranging from worse-case scenario to undramatized events; Balance identity incorporates how gradual deterioration in balance served as a reminder of disease progression and how identifying themselves as \"aware not afraid\" helped certain participants to maintain balance confidence despite everyday activity restriction; Training as treatment recounts how participants used exercise as disease self-management with the aim to maintain independence in daily life. Interpretation of the underlying patterns of these main themes resulted in the overarching theme Training as treatment when battling problems with balance and falls.\nWhereas certain participants expressed a fear of falling which they managed by activity restriction, others described being confident in their balance despite avoidance of balance-challenging activities. Training was used as treatment to self-manage disease-related balance impairments in order to maintain independence in daily life. Implication for Rehabilitation People with Parkinson's disease require early advice about the positive effects of physical activity as well as strategies for self-management in order to ease the psychological and physical burden of progressive balance impairment. Fear of falling should be investigated alongside activity avoidance in this group in order to provide a more accurate insight into the scope of psychological concerns regarding balance and falls in everyday life. Certain people with Parkinson's disease define their balance according to activities they continue to participate in, while others who express fear-related activity avoidance require help to adapt balance-challenging activities in order to maintain balance confidence and avoid physical inactivity.",

    "abstract": "When students in interprofessional education and practice programmes partner with clients living with a long-term condition, the potential for a better client and educational experience is enhanced when the focus is on client self-management and empowerment. This paper reports the findings from a phenomenological study into the experiences of five clients, six speech language therapy students, eight physiotherapy students, and two clinical educators participating in a university clinic-based interprofessional programme for clients living in the community with Parkinson's Disease. Collaborative hermeneutic analysis was conducted to interpret the texts from client interviews and student and clinical educator focus groups held immediately after the programme. The overarching narratives emerging from the texts were: \"client-centredness\"; \"who am I/why am I here?\"; \"understanding interprofessional collaboration and development\"; \"personal and professional development, awareness of self and others\"; \"the environment - safety and support\". These narratives and the meanings within them were drawn together to develop a tentative metaphor-based framework of \"navigating interprofessional spaces\" showing how the narratives and meanings are connected. The framework identifies a temporal journey toward interprofessional collaboration impacted by diverse identities and understandings of self and others, varying expectations and interpretations of the programme, intra- and interpersonal, cultural and contextual spaces, and uncertainty. Shifts in being and doing and uncertainty appear to characterise client-driven, self-management focused interprofessional teamwork for all participants. These findings indicate that students need ongoing opportunities to share explicit understandings of interprofessional teamwork and dispel assumptions, since isolated interprofessional experiences may only begin to address these temporal processes.",

    "abstract": "An Essay on the Shaking Palsy, by James Parkinson, was published in 1817. Later, Jean-Martin Charcot better described some of the motor features of the disease and named the condition as \"La Maladie de Parkinson.\" As understanding about the disease progressed, aided by both clinical expertise and technological developments, the definition of what is Parkinson's disease has evolved. Motor phenotype, non-motor symptoms, monogenic mutations, genetic risk factors, disease subtyping, and data-driven clusters, among other concepts, have given rise to the hypothesis that Parkinson's disease may be not one well-defined entity but several different diseases encompassed as a levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism. This review present and discusses several of these factors and how they may support or not the notion of Parkinson's being one or more diseases. In summary, current evidence appears to be insufficient at this moment to clarify this issue. Parkinson's disease will continue to be an evolving concept over the years to come.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons through apoptotic, inflammatory and oxidative stress mechanisms. The octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) is a diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI)-derived peptide, expressed by astrocytes, which protects neurons against oxidative cell damages and apoptosis in an in vitro model of PD. The present study reveals that a single intracerebroventricular injection of 10\u00a0ng ODN 1\u00a0h after the last administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) prevented the degeneration of DA neurons induced by the toxin in the substantia nigra pars compacta of mice, 7\u00a0days after treatment. ODN-mediated neuroprotection was associated with a reduction of the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive reactive astrocytes and a strong inhibition of the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as interleukins 1\u03b2 and 6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. Moreover, ODN blocked the inhibition of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, and the stimulation of the pro-apoptotic genes Bax and caspase-3, induced by MPTP in the substantia nigra pars compacta. ODN also decreased or even in some cases abolished MPTP-induced oxidative damages, overproduction of reactive oxygen species and accumulation of lipid oxidation products in DA neurons. Furthermore, DBI knockout mice appeared to be more vulnerable than wild-type animals to MPTP neurotoxicity. Taken together, these results show that the gliopeptide ODN exerts a potent neuroprotective effect against MPTP-induced degeneration of nigrostriatal DA neurons in mice, through mechanisms involving downregulation of neuroinflammatory, oxidative and apoptotic processes. ODN may, thus, reduce neuronal damages in PD and other cerebral injuries involving oxidative neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of review is to review the current status of positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging of serotonergic system in Parkinson's patients who experience levodopa-induced (LIDs) and graft-induced dyskinesias (GIDs). PET imaging studies have shown that Parkinson's disease is characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons. Parkinson's patients who experienced LIDs and GIDs have an aberrant spreading of serotonergic terminals, which lead to an increased serotonergic/dopaminergic terminals ratio within the putamen. Serotonergic terminals convert exogenous levodopa into dopamine in a non-physiological manner and release an abnormal amount of dopamine without an auto-regulatory feedback. This results in higher swings in synaptic levels of dopamine, which leads to the development of LIDs and GIDs. The modulation of serotonergic terminals with 5-HT",

    "abstract": "To assess, in a cross-sectional study, the feasibility and immediate efficacy of laser shoes, a new ambulatory visual cueing device with practical applicability for use in daily life, on freezing of gait (FOG) and gait measures in Parkinson disease (PD).\nWe tested 21 patients with PD and FOG, both \"off\" and \"on\" medication. In a controlled gait laboratory, we measured the number of FOG episodes and the percent time frozen occurring during a standardized walking protocol that included FOG provoking circumstances. Participants performed 10 trials with and 10 trials without cueing. FOG was assessed using offline video analysis by an independent rater. Gait measures were recorded in between FOG episodes with the use of accelerometry.\nCueing using laser shoes was associated with a significant reduction in the number of FOG episodes, both \"off\" (45.9%) and \"on\" (37.7%) medication. Moreover, laser shoes significantly reduced the percent time frozen by 56.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 32.5-85.8; \nThese findings demonstrate the immediate efficacy of laser shoes in a controlled gait laboratory, and offer a promising intervention with potential to deliver in-home cueing for patients with FOG.\nThis study provides Class III evidence that for patients with PD, laser shoes significantly reduce FOG severity (both number and duration of FOG episodes).",

    "abstract": "It may be possible to use attention-based exercise to decrease demands associated with walking in Parkinson's disease (PD), and thus improve dual task walking ability. For example, an external focus of attention (focusing on the effect of an action on the environment) may recruit automatic control processes degenerated in PD, whereas an internal focus (limb movement) may recruit conscious (nonautomatic) control processes. Thus, we aimed to investigate how externally and internally focused exercise influences dual task walking and symptom severity in PD.\nForty-seven participants with PD were randomized to either an Externally (n = 24) or Internally (n = 23) focused group and completed 33 one-hour attention-based exercise sessions over 11 weeks. In addition, 16 participants were part of a control group. Before, after, and 8 weeks following the program (pre/post/washout), gait patterns were measured during single and dual task walking (digit-monitoring task, ie, walking while counting numbers announced by an audio-track), and symptom severity (UPDRS-III) was assessed ON and OFF dopamine replacement. Pairwise comparisons (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) and repeated-measures analyses of variance were conducted.\nPre to post: Dual task step time decreased in the external group (\u0394 = 0.02 seconds, CI 0.01-0.04). Dual task step length (\u0394 = 2.3 cm, CI 0.86-3.75) and velocity (\u0394 = 4.5 cm/s, CI 0.59-8.48) decreased (became worse) in the internal group. UPDRS-III scores (ON and OFF) decreased (improved) in only the External group. Pre to washout: Dual task step time ( P = .005) and percentage in double support ( P = .014) significantly decreased (improved) in both exercise groups, although only the internal group increased error on the secondary counting task (ie, more errors monitoring numbers). UPDRS-III scores in both exercise groups significantly decreased ( P = .001).\nSince dual task walking improvements were found immediately, and 8 weeks after the cessation of an externally focused exercise program, we conclude that externally focused exercise may improve on functioning of automatic control networks in PD. Internally focused exercise hindered dual tasking ability. Overall, externally focused exercise led to greater rehabilitation benefits in dual tasking and motor symptoms compared with internally focused exercise.",

    "abstract": "Wearable devices can capture objective day-to-day data about Parkinson's Disease (PD). This study aims to assess the feasibility of implementing wearable technology to collect data from multiple sensors during the daily lives of PD patients. The Parkinson@home study is an observational, two-cohort (North America, NAM; The Netherlands, NL) study. To recruit participants, different strategies were used between sites. Main enrolment criteria were self-reported diagnosis of PD, possession of a smartphone and age\u226518 years. Participants used the Fox Wearable Companion app on a smartwatch and smartphone for a minimum of 6 weeks (NAM) or 13 weeks (NL). Sensor-derived measures estimated information about movement. Additionally, medication intake and symptoms were collected via self-reports in the app. A total of 953 participants were included (NL: 304, NAM: 649). Enrolment rate was 88% in the NL (n = 304) and 51% (n = 649) in NAM. Overall, 84% (n = 805) of participants contributed sensor data. Participants were compliant for 68% (16.3 hours/participant/day) of the study period in NL and for 62% (14.8 hours/participant/day) in NAM. Daily accelerometer data collection decreased 23% in the NL after 13 weeks, and 27% in NAM after 6 weeks. Data contribution was not affected by demographics, clinical characteristics or attitude towards technology, but was by the platform usability score in the NL (\u03c72 (2) = 32.014, p<0.001), and self-reported depression in NAM (\u03c72(2) = 6.397, p = .04). The Parkinson@home study shows that it is feasible to collect objective data using multiple wearable sensors in PD during daily life in a large cohort.",

To date, little is known about what defines patient-centered outcomes from cognitive evaluations. The current evaluation sought to explore this issue in persons with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) and their care partners (CP).\nFocus groups of 22 PwPD/CP dyads were conducted to identify potential consumer oriented endpoints from cognitive evaluations. These endpoints were utilized to create a Patient-Centered Cognitive Assessment Outcomes Scale, which was administered to a different group of 50 PwPD/CP dyads who rated the importance of each outcome and identified their top three priority outcomes.\nThree themes emerged from the focus groups: improved knowledge, advice, and planning. Both PwPD and CP rated items in all three domains as being very important outcomes. Priorities for outcomes in both groups favored treatment planning information slightly above knowledge based outcomes.\nThe PwPD and CP identified improved knowledge, advice for daily activities, and knowledge they could use to plan for future eventualities as very important. This information can be used as a framework for future studies aimed at demonstrating patient-centered outcomes from neuropsychological evaluations. Implications for future research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of mitophagy, which is a selective degradation of defective mitochondria for quality control, is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, how treadmill exercise (TE) regulates mitophagy-related molecules in PD remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to investigate how TE regulates \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn)-induced neurotoxicity and mitophagy-related molecules in the nigro-striatal region of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-mice. Our data showed that TE exhibited a significant restoration of tyrosine hydroxylase and motor coordination with suppression of \u03b1-syn expression, hallmarks of PD, possibly via up-regulation of lysosomal degradation molecules, LAMP-2 and cathepsin L, with down-regulation of p62, LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, PINK1 and parkin in the substantia nigra of MPTP mice.

    "abstract": "Synucleinopathies (including \u03b1-synucleinopathies), which include Parkinson's disease (PD), manifest themsevles early on (stage 1) in the olfactory system; preferentially in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON). In particular, the non-motor, early manifestations of PD include hyposmia, which is the partial loss of the sense of smell. The neural basis of hyposmia in PD, however, is poorly understood; but the AON appears to be a key structure in the disease's progression. We analyzed whether \u03b1-synuclein was involved in the differential interneuron vulnerability associated with PD in the retrobulbar, cortical anterior and cortical posterior divisions of the AON. First, we determined the expression of the calcium binding interneuron markers, calretinin, calbindin and parvalbumin, as well as non-calcium binding interneuron marker, somatostatin, in neuronal cell bodies alone (cells/mm",

    "abstract": "Gait and balance disorders are major problems that contribute to falls among subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). Strengthening the compensatory responses through the use of balance perturbations may improve balance in PD. To date, it is unclear how PD affects the ability to react and adapt to perturbations delivered while walking. This study aims to investigate how PD affects the ability to walk, respond to balance perturbations, and produce acute short-term effects to improve compensatory reactions and gait stability. A cable-driven robot was used to train nine patients with PD and nine age-matched controls with multidirectional waist-pull perturbations while walking on a treadmill. Margin of stability and base of support were evaluated while walking without cables and reacting to the perturbations. PD was associated with a reduced stability in the forward direction and the inability to produce proactive anticipatory adjustments. Both groups were able to improve the response to the disturbances and produce short-term aftereffects of increased gait stability once the cables were removed. A single session of perturbation-based balance training produced acute effects that ameliorated gait instability in PD. This result is encouraging for designing new therapeutic interventions that remediate falls risk.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions accumulate with age in postmitotic cells and are associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Although the exact mechanisms by which deletions form remain elusive, the dominant theory is that they arise spontaneously at microhomologous sites and undergo clonal expansion. We characterize mtDNA deletions at unprecedented resolution in individual substantia nigra neurons from individuals with Parkinson's disease, using ultradeep sequencing. We show that the number of deleted mtDNA species per neuron is substantially higher than previously reported. Moreover, each deleted mtDNA species shows significant differences in sequence composition compared with the remaining mtDNA population, which is highly consistent with independent segregation and clonal expansion. Deletion breakpoints occur consistently in regions of sequence homology, which may be direct or interrupted stretches of tandem repeats. While our results support a crucial role for misannealing in deletion generation, we find no overrepresentation of the 3'-repeat sequence, an observation that is difficult to reconcile with the current view of replication errors as the source of mtDNA deletions.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to examine potential crucial genes associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) in addition to the interactions and regulators of these genes. The chip data (GSE7621) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus and standardized using the robust multi\u2011array average in the Affy package of R software. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then screened using the Samr package with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 and |log2 fold change (FC)|>1. Crucial PD\u2011associated genes were predicted using the Genetic Association Database in the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and sequence alignment. Furthermore, transcription factors (TFs) of the crucial PD\u2011associated genes were predicted, and protein\u2011protein interactions (PPIs) between the crucial PD\u2011associated genes were analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins. Additionally, another dataset of PD was used to validate the expression of crucial PD\u2011associated genes. A total of 670 DEGs (398 upregulated and 272 downregulated genes) were identified in the PD samples. Of these, 10 DEGs enriched in pathways associated with the nervous system were predicted to be crucial in PD, including C\u2011X\u2011C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and NCL adaptor protein 2 (NCK2). All 10 genes were associated with neuron development and differentiation. They were simultaneously modulated by multiple TFs, including GATA, E2F and E4 promoter\u2011binding protein 4. The PPI networks showed that DCC and CXCR4 were hub proteins. The DCC\u2011netrin 1\u2011roundabout guidance receptor 2\u2011slit guidance ligand 1 interaction pathway, and several genes, including TOX high mobility group box family member 4, kinase insert domain receptor and zymogen granule protein 16B, which interacted with CXCR4, were novel findings. Additionally, CXCR4 and NCK2 were upregulated in another dataset (GSE8397) of PD. These genes, interactions of proteins and TFs may be important in the progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. For decades, the unilateral 6\u2011hydroxydopamine (6\u2011OHDA) rat model has been employed to investigate the pathogenesis and therapy of PD. However, the behavior and associated pathological features of the model long term have not previously been described dynamically. In the present study, the unilateral model was established by 6\u2011OHDA injection in the striatum. The PD rat model was determined 2\u00a0weeks following surgery, according to the apomorphine (APO)\u2011induced rotations, cylinder, rotarod and open field tests. TH\u2011positive neurons and fibers in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum, respectively, and glial activation in the SNpc, determined by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression for astrocytes and CD11b (Mac1) expression for microglia, were detected by immunohistological staining. Correlation analysis was performed to understand the association between PD\u2011associated behavior and pathology. The behavioral impairment progressively deteriorated during the process of experiment. In addition, the decrease in TH\u2011positive neurons was associated with an increase in GFAP\u2011 and Mac1\u2011positive cells in the SNpc. Linear regression analysis indicated the association between behavioral and pathological changes. The results of the present study indicate that the APO\u2011induced rotation, cylinder and rotarod tests are all sensitive and reliable strategies to predict the loss of TH+ neurons. These results provide a potential intervention time\u2011point and a comprehensive evaluation index system for assessment of PD therapeutic strategies using the hemiparkinsonian rat.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement-associated disorder that specifically affects dopamine-producing neurons. The disease causes demyelation that adversely impacts upon the motor activity of the brain. Currently there are no promising biomarkers for PD; improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the different pathological stages of PD are required to enable identification of a novel biomarker. The present study successfully established a PD mouse model via nasal injection of 1\u2011methyl-4\u2011phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. The expression of c\u2011Jun N\u2011termal kinase 3 (JNK3) and caspase\u20113 in two different pathological stages of PD were analysed using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. The results inidcated that the initial PD pathogenesis recovers on response to rasagiline. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis revealed that treatment with rasagiline positively regulated early\u2011stage PD pathogenesis by downregulating the expression of JNK3 and upregulating caspase\u20113; however, there was no positive effect on the advanced stages of PD. Overall, these results concluded that rasagiline has the ability to inhibit the expression of JNK3 and upregulate caspase\u20113 in early stages of PD; however, rasagline appears to have no impact on JNK3 and caspase\u20113 levels in the advanced stages of PD.",

    "abstract": "A wide spectrum of comorbidities has been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects more than seven million people worldwide. Emerging evidence indicates that chronic diseases including diabetes, depression, anemia and cancer may be implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that some of these comorbidities may increase the risk of PD and precede the onset of motor symptoms. Further, drugs to treat diabetes and cancer have elicited neuroprotective effects in PD models. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of these comorbidities remain elusive. Herein, we discuss the biological and clinical implications of comorbidities in the pathogenesis, progression, and clinical management, with an emphasis on personalized medicine applications for PD.",

    "abstract": "This article asks whether distinct caregiver experiences of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) spouses are accounted for by disease diagnosis or by a unique combination of symptoms, demands, support, and quality of life (QOL) cross disease groups.\nOne hundred five live-in spouse caregivers (71.4 \u00b1 7 years) were surveyed for persons with AD (39%), PD (41%), and PDD (20%). A hierarchical cluster analysis organized caregivers across disease diagnosis into clusters with similar symptom presentation, care demands, support, and QoL.\nFour clusters cut across disease diagnosis. \"Succeeding\" cared for mild symptoms and had emotional support. \"Coping\" managed moderate stressors and utilized formal supports. \"Getting by with support\" and \"Struggling\" had the greatest stressors; available emotional support influenced whether burden/depression was moderate or severe. The results remain the same when diagnostic category is added to the cluster analysis.\nThis study supports going beyond disease diagnosis when examining caregiver experiences.",

    "abstract": "We have shown elevated levels of p53 and active caspase-3 in gastrocnemius skeletal muscle with Parkinson's disease (PD). The main aim of this study is to examine the impact of endurance exercise training on the expression of p53 and active caspase-3 in the skeletal muscle of mouse with induced Parkinsonism.\nSedentary control (SC), sedentary Parkinson diseased (SPD), and exercised Parkinson diseased (EPD) groups were formed; each consisting of 10 randomly selected normal albino mice. Chronic Parkinson disease was induced in the SPD and EPD animals using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and probenecid (MPTP/p). The expression of p53 and active caspase-3 was investigated, using immunohistochemistry, in the gastrocnemius muscle in each animal group.\nBoth p53 and active caspase-3 expression was significantly (p value\u200a<\u200a0.05) reduced in the PD gastrocnemius skeletal muscle following endurance exercise training.\nOur present data suggest that chronic exercise training reduced Parkinson disease-induced upregulation of p53 and active caspase-3 in gastrocnemius skeletal muscle. Thus, our study suggests that inhibiting p53 and/or active caspase-3 may be considered as a therapeutic approach to ameliorate PD skeletal muscle abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Sleep-wake disturbances (SWD) are frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD). The effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on SWD is poorly known. In this study we examined the subjective and objective sleep-wake profile and the quality of life (QoL) of PD patients in the context of subthalamic DBS.\nWe retrospectively analyzed data from PD patients and candidates for DBS in the nucleus suthalamicus (STN). Pre-DBS, sleep-wake assessments included subjective and objective (polysomnography, vigilance tests and actigraphy) measures. Post-DBS, subjective measures were collected. QoL was assessed using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and the RAND SF-36-item Health Survey (RAND SF-36).\nData from 74 PD patients (62% male, mean age 62.2 years, SD = 8.9) with a mean UPDRS-III (OFF) of 34.2 (SD = 14.8) and 11.8 (SD = 4.5) years under PD treatment were analyzed. Pre-DBS, daytime sleepiness, apathy, fatigue and depressive symptoms were present in 49%, 34%, 38% and 25% of patients respectively but not always as co-occurring symptoms. Sleep-wake disturbances were significantly correlated with QoL scores. One year after STN DBS, motor signs, QoL and sleepiness improved but apathy worsened. Changes in QoL were associated with changes in sleepiness and apathy but baseline sleep-wake functions were not predictive of STN DBS outcome.\nIn PD patients presenting for STN DBS, subjective and objective sleep-wake disturbances are common and have a negative impact on QoL before and after neurosurgery. Given the current preliminary evidence, prospective observational studies assessing subjective and objective sleep-wake variables prior to and after DBS are needed.",

In the early stages of the disease, especially in younger patients with milder symptoms, the introduction of levodopa substitution could be efficacious in delaying; in advanced stages they are mainly used to treat motor complications, as an adjunct to levodopa.\nThe evaluation of therapeutical strategies used in the neurology clinics of Tirgu Mures County Emergency Clinical Hospital in order to define the role of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.\nThis retrospective study includes all records of patients with Parkinson's disease hospitalized between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2016. From the 2194 reports we used data focusing on the therapeutic recommendations. Regarding disease duration, we divided the patients in two groups: less than or equal to 5 years and more than 5 years.\nFrom the 1183 patients in first group, 243 received monoamine oxidase inhibitors: 12 as monotherapy, 52 together with dopamine agonists, in 61 cases combined with levodopa. In 118 cases monoamine oxidase inhibitors were combined with levodopa and dopamine agonists. From 582 cases whith Parkinson's disease for more than 5 years, 195 received monoamine oxidase B inhibitors (selegiline: 10 cases, rasagiline: 185 cases). In 429 cases we did not find accurate data regarding disease duration (selegiline: 5 cases, rasagiline: 93 cases).\nThe use of monoamine oxidase B inhibitors was similar to those found in literature.

    "abstract": "The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Program 468 study (CSP 468) produced significant findings regarding deep brain stimulation (DBS) target selection for Parkinson's Disease (PD) treatment, yet its impact on clinical practices has not been described. Here we assess how CSP 468 influenced target selection at a high-volume movement disorders treatment center.\nWe compared DBS target site selection between 4-year periods that immediately preceded and followed CSP 468 publication. Additionally, we examined how baseline clinical features influenced target selection following CSP 468.\nThe STN was the predominant site of DBS implantation before and after CSP 468 publication (93.2% of cases, and 60.4%, respectively), but GPi targeting increased significantly following CSP 468 publication (from 5.3% to 37.4%; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Patients who underwent GPi stimulation following CSP 468 exhibited worse indices of depression (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), less responsiveness to medications (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), and a trend towards worse pre-operative cognitive performance (p\u00a0=\u00a0.06). In multi-variate analysis, advanced patient age and depression were independent predictors of GPi targeting (p\u00a0<\u00a0.01).\nKey findings of CSP 468 were reflected in our target selection of DBS for Parkinson's Disease. Following CSP 468, GPi targeting increased, and it was selected for patients with poorer cognitive and mood indices.",

    "abstract": "Gait dysfunction is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease that can cause significant disability and put patients at risk for falls. These symptoms show variable responsiveness to dopaminergic therapy.\nTo determine whether dopaminergic (rs1076560 DRD2 G\u00a0>\u00a0T and rs4680 catechole-o-methyltranspherase (COMT) Val158Met) or brain derived neurotrophic factor (rs6265 BDNF Val66Met) genetic polymorphisms are associated with gait function and medication responsiveness in Parkinson's disease.\nGait function was evaluated on two days for patients (ON and OFF medication in a counterbalanced fashion) and a single session for controls. Investigators were blinded to genotype during data collection. Associations between genotype and medication responsiveness were analyzed using mixed model ANOVAs. A priori hypotheses were tested using GAITRite\nWe found that the DRD2 polymorphism, but neither COMT nor BDNF, was consistently associated with gait function and medication responsiveness in the patients. Specifically, Parkinson's disease patients with reduced striatal D2 expression (DRD2 T allele carriers) had worse gait dysfunction and showed greater dopamine responsiveness of gait function compared to patients who were homozygous for the G allele. There was no effect of any of the genetic polymorphisms on gait for controls.\nThe findings suggest that genetic subgrouping, in particular for DRD2, may be used to identify Parkinson's disease patient subgroups that are more dopamine responsive for gait function.",

    "abstract": "LRRK2 gene mutations underlie the most common mendelian form of Parkinson's Disease (PD), designated PARK8, that shows clinical features similar to those in idiopathic PD (IPD). We assessed the cognitive functions and the cerebral metabolism measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET in PARK8 patients compared with IPD.\nWe enrolled eight PARK8 patients and eight IPD patients, comparable for onset age, stage, severity and duration of disease. Mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD was 61.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.9 years and disease duration 8.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8 in PARK8, and 61.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.7 and 7.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.8 in IPD. All subjects underwent a wide neuropsychological assessment and a FDG-PET. Cerebral regional relative metabolic maps were evaluated using voxel-based analysis with statistical parametric mapping.\nMotor and non-motor phenotype and neuropsychological evaluation did not differ between PARK8 and IPD. We detected one case of dementia and four of Mild Cognitive Impairment in each group. At FDG-PET, compared to controls, IPD patients revealed a significant relative posterior cortical hypometabolism in the left temporal and inferior parietal and in the right inferior and superior parietal regions, whereas patients with LRRK2 mutation, at a less conservative threshold, showed only a relative left inferior parietal hypometabolism. No differences were found between patients with PARK8 and IPD.\nThe results confirm a comparable cognitive profile between LRRK2 and IPD patients. FDG-PET study showed a pattern of posterior cortical hypometabolism in both groups, although less severe in LRRK2-related PD. The milder decrease of cortical metabolism in PARK8 might be due to a less marked pathological involvement compared to IPD.",

    "abstract": "It can be difficult to differentiate multiple system atrophy (MSA) with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), a very disabling but rare disease, from Parkinson's disease (PD). Autonomic dysfunction, particularly cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), is classically more pronounced in MSA. We investigated whether testing for CAN combined with sweat function assessment was helpful to differentiate patients with MSA from those with PD.\nIn this retrospective study, 62 patients with MSA-P and 96 with PD, comparable in age, BMI and sex ratio with disease duration of 4.3\u00b12.5 years for MSA vs. 11.5\u00b16 years for PD (P<0.0001) were tested for CAN using heart rate changes with deep breathing (HR-DB), stand test (HR-ST) and Valsalva maneuver (HR-VM) and blood pressure changes during stand test (BPs-ST and BPd-ST), Valsalva maneuver (BPs-VM-II and IV), hand grip (BPd-HG) and the total \"Ewing\" score tests (EwS), and for sweating function using electrochemical skin conductance for hands and feet (HESC and FESC).\nIn MSA-P abnormal EwS, HR-DB, BP-ST and ESC were more frequent compared to PD, despite longer disease duration for PD. Using a model adjusted for sex, BMI, age, disease duration and treatment, the Odds Ratio for having MSA-P vs. PD based on EwS was 2.71, on HR-DB 2.36, on BP-ST 2.87 and on ESC 4.94 while it was 11.68 (2.17-62.79) for the combination of the three last tests.\nAssessment of HR-DB, BP-ST and ESC, that is, rapid and non-invasive could be helpful in combination as a first simple screening to differentiate MSA-P from PD.",

    "abstract": "The management of movement disorders is shifting from a centralized-clinical assessment towards remote monitoring and individualized therapy. While a variety of treatment options are available, ranging from pharmaceutical drugs to invasive neuromodulation, the clinical effects are inconsistent and often poorly measured. For instance, the lack of remote monitoring has been a major limitation to optimize therapeutic interventions for patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). In this work, we focus on the assessment of full-body tremor as the most recognized PD symptom. Forty PD and twenty two healthy participants were recruited. The main assessment tool was an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based motion capture system to quantify full-body tremor and to separate tremor-dominant from non-tremor-dominant PD patients as well as from healthy controls. We developed a new measure and evaluated its clinical utility by correlating the results with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores as the gold standard. Significant correlation was observed between the UPDRS and the tremor severity scores for the selected tasks. The results suggest that it is feasible and clinically meaningful to utilize the suggested objective tremor score for the assessment of PD patients. Furthermore, this portable assessment tool could potentially be used in the home environment to monitor PD tremor and facilitate optimizing therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "A new expert system is proposed to discriminate healthy people from people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) in early stages by using Diadochokinesis tests.\nThe system is based on temporal and spectral features extracted from the Voice Onset Time (VOT) segments of /ka/ syllables, whose boundaries are delimited by a novel algorithm. For comparison purposes, the approach is applied also to /pa/ and /ta/ syllables. In order to develop and validate the system, a voice recording database composed of 27 individuals diagnosed with PD and 27 healthy controls has been collected. This database reflects an average disease stage of 1.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.55 according to Hoehn and Yahr scale. System design is based on feature extraction, feature selection and Support Vector Machine learning.\nThe novel VOT algorithm, based on a simple and computationally efficient approach, demonstrates accurate estimation of VOT boundaries on /ka/ syllables for both healthy and PD-affected speakers. The PD detection approach based on /k/ plosive consonant achieves the highest discrimination capability (92.2% using 10-fold cross-validation and 94.4% in the case of leave-one-out method) in comparison to the corresponding versions based on the other two plosives (/p/ and /t/).\nA high accuracy has been obtained on a database with a lower average disease stage than previous articulatory databases presented in the literature.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of \u22656 months of transdermal rotigotine on non-motor and motor symptoms of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.\nThe study was conducted in Spain between September 2011 and December 2012 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01504529). The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in non-motor symptoms, as assessed by changes in Parkinson's Disease Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire total scores at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included the assessment of motor symptoms by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III scores.\nData from 378 patients (mean age: 70.2 years; 56.9% male) with Parkinson's disease receiving rotigotine from were collected. Mean disease duration was 6.1\u00a0years, and mean rotigotine treatment duration was 45.6 months. Rotigotine reduced non-motor symptoms by 14.6% (mean change from baseline in Parkinson's Disease Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire: -1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4; p < 0.0001). The majority of patients (58.2%) had improved non-motor symptoms at 6 months. Comparing the baseline versus study end, fewer patients experienced events in the urinary (78.6% vs. 73.3%; p = 0.0066), sleep (82.8% vs. 72.8%; p < 0.0001) and mood/cognition (77.3% vs. 66.4%; p < 0.0001) domains of the Parkinson's Disease Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire. Mean motor symptoms were reduced from baseline by 8.0% (mean change from baseline in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III: -2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.0; p < 0.0001).\nIn clinical practice in Spain, rotigotine may be an effective treatment to reduce the non-motor and motor symptoms in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the LRRK2 and alpha-synuclein (SNCA) genes are well-established causes of autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). However, their frequency differs widely between ethnic groups. Only three studies have screened all coding regions of LRRK2 and SNCA in European samples so far. In Turkey, the role of LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease has been studied fragmentarily, and the incidence of SNCA copy number variations is unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency of LRRK2 and SNCA mutations in autosomal dominant PD in Turkey.\nWe performed Sanger sequencing of all coding LRRK2 and SNCA exons in a sample of 91 patients with Parkinsonism. Copy number variations in SNCA, PRKN, PINK1, DJ1 and ATP13A2 were assessed using the MLPA method. All patients had a positive family history compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance.\nKnown mutations in LRRK2 and SNCA were found in 3.3% of cases: one patient harbored the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, and two patients carried a SNCA gene duplication. Furthermore, we found a heterozygous deletion of PRKN exon 2 in one patient, and four rare coding variants of unknown significance (LRRK2: A211V, R1067Q, T2494I; SNCA: T72T). Genetic testing in one affected family identified the LRRK2 R1067Q variant as a possibly pathogenic substitution.\nPoint mutations in LRRK2 and SNCA are a rare cause of autosomal dominant PD in Turkey. However, copy number variations should be considered. The unclassified variants, especially LRRK2 R1067Q, demand further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Neural entrainment plays a crucial role in perception and action, especially when stimuli possess a certain temporal regularity, and is also suggested to serve as a neural process to select and attend the relevant stream in situations where there are competing stimulus streams. Beneficial effects of entrainment have led to the suggestion that rhythmic stimuli can improve motor function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Behavioural studies support this suggestion, but neurophysiological studies have shown reduced entrainment of motor areas in PD. However, oscillatory entrainment in PD has only been tested in paradigms with a single isochronous stimulus stream, whereas entrainment has an enhanced benefit in situations where one rhythmic stimulus stream has to be segregated from distractor stimuli. Therefore, we here used an intermodal selective attention task with concurrent auditory and visual stimulus streams while recording oscillatory brain activity with Magnetoencephalography (MEG). We aimed to (i) replicate earlier findings of deficient motor entrainment in PD patients in conditions where there is a single stimulus stream, and (ii) to evaluate whether increasing the benefit of entrainment by introducing a distractor stream would lead to entrainment in PD patients not seen otherwise. Contrary to this hypothesis, PD patients showed reduced motor entrainment compared to controls during both conditions, as indexed by beta oscillatory activity. These results suggest that entrainment in PD patients is deficient, even under conditions that encourage entrainment.",

    "abstract": "In the current study, Pramipexole dihydrochloride loaded chitosan nanoparticles (P-CNs) were prepared for Parkinson's disease via nose to brain pathway by ionic gelation method. Optimized P-CNs with chitosan and sodium tripolyphosphate (6:1\u202fv/v) exhibited particle size and entrapment efficiency of 292.5 nm\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.80 and 91.25%\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.95 respectively and its diffusion across the artificial membrane and goat nasal mucosa was found to be 93.32%\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.56 and 83.03%\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.48 correspondingly after 24\u202fh. Transmission electron microscopy displayed the spherical nature of the P-CNs particles and rough surface morphology was observed in scanning electron microphotographs. In pharmacodynamic studies, the comparative results of behavioral testing revealed improved score of photoactometer and reduced motor deficit in the form of catalepsy in P-CN treatment group as compare to its nasal solution or oral marketed tablets. Similarly, P-CNs enhanced antioxidant status in the form of increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, along with increased dopamine level in the brain significantly. Therefore, it can be concluded that intranasal delivery of Pramipexole loaded chitosan nanoparticles exhibited essential in vitro characteristics and superior in vivo activity than other formulations for brain targeted delivery in Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Trazodone is a clinically available anti-depressant that exhibits affinity for serotonin 1A and 2A receptors, as well as for alpha-adrenoceptors, suggesting that it may be useful to treat L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia and psychosis that are encountered in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated the anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of trazodone in the parkinsonian non-human primate. 6 common marmosets were rendered parkinsonian by administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Following repeated administration of L-DOPA to induce stable dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs), trazodone (0.1, 1 and 10\u00a0mg/kg) or vehicle was administered in combination with L-DOPA and its effects on dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonism were determined. The addition of trazodone 10\u00a0mg/kg to L-DOPA reduced peak dose dyskinesia by\u00a0\u2248\u00a039% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and peak dose PLBs by\u00a0\u2248\u00a017% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). However, parkinsonian disability was significantly worsened by trazodone 10\u00a0mg/kg (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and duration of anti-parkinsonian action was diminished by\u00a0\u2248\u00a021% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Our results suggest that trazodone may be effective in alleviating L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and psychosis in PD, but its deleterious effect on motor function is a concern and may limit its tolerability and usefulness in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Deregulated neurotrophin is an etiological factor in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases (ND) that are clinically different entities but characterised by similar limb dysfunction. Earlier validation of peripheral biomarkers can provide significant translational benefit to ND patients. We analysed brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tropomyosin possessing tyrosine-related kinase (Trk B) and its key downstream proteins which are implicated in ND such as Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ataxia. Blood from ND patients with PD, ALS and Ataxia with movement dysfunctions were obtained to analyse mRNA and protein expressions of the above\u00a0mentioned factors in lymphocytes. The mRNA and protein expression of BDNF-Trk\u00a0B and its key downstream molecules showed a significant variation when compared to control and among NDs. The study intends to show that on identifying the variation of these key molecules in the blood samples of patients with ND can serve as early diagnostic candidates. Thus by intervening, the neurotrophins and their pathways can help in early diagnosis and optimising levels of diagnostic certainty.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder in the elderly and is characterised clinically by bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. Diagnosing Parkinson's can be difficult especially in the early stages. High-resolution nigrosome MRI offers promising diagnostic accuracy of patients with established clinical symptoms; however, it is unclear whether this may help to establish the diagnosis in the early stages of PD, when there is diagnostic uncertainty. In this scenario, a single photon emission CT scan using a radioactive dopamine transporter ligand can help to establish the diagnosis, or clinical follow-up may eventually clarify the diagnosis. A non-invasive, cost-effective diagnostic test that could replace this would be desirable. We therefore aim to prospectively test whether nigrosome MRI is as useful as DaTSCAN to establish the correct diagnosis in people with minor or unclear symptoms suspicious for PD.\nIn a prospective study we will recruit 145 patients with unclear symptoms possibly caused by Parkinson's from three movement disorder centres in the UK to take part in the study. We will record the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and participants will undergo DaTSCAN and high-resolution susceptibility weighted MRI at a field strength of 3T. DaTSCANs will be assessed visually and semiquantitatively; MRI scans will be visually assessed for signal loss in nigrosome-1 by blinded investigators. We will compare how the diagnosis suggested by MRI compares with the diagnosis based on DaTSCAN and will also validate the diagnosis based on the two tests with a clinical examination performed at least 1\u2009year after the initial presentation as a surrogate gold standard diagnostic test.\nThe local ethics commission (Health Research Authority East Midlands - Derby Research Ethics Committee) has approved this study (REC ref.: 16/EM/0229). The study is being carried out under the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (64th, 2013) and Good Clinical Practice standards. We have included a number of 15 research-funded DaTSCAN in the research protocol. This is to compensate for study site-specific National Health Service funding for this investigation in affected patients. We therefore have also obtained approval from the Administration of Radioactive Substances Administration Committee (ARSAC Ref 253/3629/35864). All findings will be presented at relevant scientific meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals, on the study website, and disseminated in lay and social media where appropriate.\nNCT03022357; Pre-results.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have repeatedly reported that increased serum urate level is associated with a slower progress of Parkinson's disease (PD). The urate precursor, inosine, raises the serum urate level and is therefore a candidate for a disease modifying treatment. However, an elevated serum urate level is a risk factor for gout, urolithiasis, and cardiovascular diseases. Although there have been previous clinical studies, the use of inosine in a clinical setting is still limited, and its safety is unclear, especially in an Asian population.\nWe conducted a single-arm, single-center clinical trial to assess the safety of inosine for PD patients with relatively low urate levels. After informed consent, 10 subjects were orally administered inosine to maintain a target urate level between 6.0mg/dl and 8.0mg/dl for one year. All adverse effects were recorded and categorized by severity. Also, the efficacy of using inosine to raise the serum urate level was reported.\nWe did not observe any adverse events requiring termination or reduction of the study drug, although uric acid crystalluria was transiently observed in a single subject. An inosine dosage of 1070 (SD=501) mg/day significantly raises the urate level from 3.5 (0.84)mg/dl at baseline to 6.68 (1.11)mg/dl at the 52nd week.\nInosine was safely used for one year and effectively raised urate levels in a small group of subjects. Our study is the first report to use inosine for patients with PD in an Asian population.",

    "abstract": "We review our experience with Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who underwent subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) and then developed noninfectious, non-hemorrhagic, delayed, symptomatic brain edema associated with a DBS lead.\nAll PD patients who underwent STN DBS lead implantation from 2007 to 2015 were included. The same neurosurgeon performed all surgeries, typically in staged fashion, utilizing single pass microelectrode recordings (MER) within a stereotactic frame. A brain CT was obtained in recovery and subsequently if indicated.\nThere were 189 patients who underwent 363 STN lead implantations among which 35 (9.6%) represent re-implantations of removed leads in 28 (14.8%) patients. Among the 363 STN leads implanted, there were 12 (3.3%) cases of delayed symptomatic edema associated with a DBS lead involving 10 (5.3%) of the patients studied. Of the 328 leads representing first-time operations, there were 9 (2.1%) cases of delayed symptomatic edema in 7 (3.7%) patients, one of whom (14.3%) presented with seizures. For lead re-implantations, there were 3 (8.6%) cases of the brain edema in 3 (10.7%) patients; all presenting with seizures. For the 35 re-implantations, the trajectory to target was the same or very similar via the same burr hole as prior surgery in 17 (48.6%); 3 (17.6%) of whom developed edema. There was no case of brain edema in the 18 re-operated cases using a different burr opening. Edema patients were treated with a course of anticonvulsant medication and dexamethasone. Lead-associated edema resolved over generally a 4 to 6-week course.\nNoninfectious, non-hemorrhagic, delayed, symptomatic brain edema occurs in approximately 3% of implanted leads and is more common in re-implantations (9%) compared to new implantations (2%). In re-implantations, the edema is more common when the same trajectory is used (18%) compared to a new trajectory (0%). The edema generally occurs 3 to 8 days after implantation, although immediate post-op CT is normal and seizures are a common presenting feature.",

    "abstract": "Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD\u00ae) is an effective therapy for phonation in Parkinson's Disease (PD) but little is known about any additional spread of effects to swallowing and cough function. This pilot study examined the effect of LSVT LOUD on pharyngeal swallowing parameters and reflexive cough strength.\nTwenty participants (14 men, 6 women; mean 68years, SD3.5) with PD referred for LSVT LOUD with complaints of voice deterioration were recruited. Mean duration of PD was 6yrs., SD 3. Self-reported Eating Assessment Tool-10 scores ranging from 0 to 25 (normal<3). Prior to LSVT LOUD, 1-week post- and 6-months post-treatment, participants undertook a videofluoroscopic study of swallowing and aerodynamic measures of involuntary cough.\nAll participants completed the LSVT LOUD programme; 3 participants were lost to follow-up at 6-months. All participants made significant gains in average sound pressure level (dB SPL). Aspiration was not observed. Pharyngeal residue (p<0.05) and pharyngeal area at rest reduced (p<0.01) while maximal opening of pharyngoesophageal segment (PES) (p<0.05) and PES opening duration (p<0.05) significantly increased. There was a significant improvement in involuntary cough peak expiratory flow rate and peak expiratory flow rise time. All changes were maintained at 6-months.\nLSVT LOUD demonstrates additional spread effects on pharyngoesophageal deglutitive function and involuntary cough effectiveness in people with mild PD referred with voice complaints. Consequently, LSVT LOUD has potential to provide additional benefits for swallowing safety and efficiency in this patient group.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigates whether proprioceptive training, based on kinesthetic illusions, can help in re-educating the processing of muscle proprioceptive input, which is impaired in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The processing of proprioceptive input before and after training was evaluated by determining the error in the amplitude of voluntary dorsiflexion ankle movement (20\u00b0), induced by applying a vibration on the tendon of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle (a vibration-induced movement error). The training consisted of the subjects focusing their attention upon a series of illusory movements of the ankle. Eleven PD patients and eleven age-matched control subjects were tested. Before training, vibration reduced dorsiflexion amplitude in controls by 4.3\u00b0 (P<0.001); conversely, vibration was inefficient in PD's movement amplitude (reduction of 2.1\u00b0, P=0.20). After training, vibration significantly reduced the estimated movement amplitude in PD patients by 5.3\u00b0 (P=0.01). This re-emergence of a vibration-induced error leads us to conclude that proprioceptive training, based on kinesthetic illusions, is a simple means for re-educating the processing of muscle proprioceptive input in PD patients. Such complementary training should be included in rehabilitation programs that presently focus on improving balance and motor performance.",

    "abstract": "Risk factors of infection after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) have been controversial. We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors of infection after DBS surgery in PD patients.\nWe retrospectively investigated 246 consecutive DBS surgeries in 169 advanced PD patients. Clinical data were collected and analyzed to clarify the clinical characteristics associated with infection after DBS surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for infection after DBS surgery.\nInfection occurred in 5% of all DBS surgeries and in 7% of all PD patients who received DBS surgery. Most infections (75%) occurred within 3months after DBS surgery but it also occurred 21months after DBS surgery. Gram-positive bacteria were the most common pathogens (75%). Infection after DBS surgery was associated with short period of prophylactic antibiotic therapy (OR=0.62, 95% CI=0.45-0.85, P=0.002) and intensive care unit (ICU) management immediate after DBS surgery (OR=5.43, 95% CI=1.12-26.45, P=0.036).\nOur study suggests that short period of prophylactic antibiotic therapy and ICU management after surgery may increase the risk of infection in PD patients who received DBS surgery.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi)-based strategies that mediate the specific knockdown of target genes by administration of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) could be applied for treatment of presently incurable neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. However, inefficient delivery of siRNA into neurons hampers in\u00a0vivo application of RNAi. We have previously established the 4-12\u00a0kDa branched polyethylenimine (PEI) F25-LMW with superior transfection efficacy for delivery of siRNA in\u00a0vivo. Here, we present that siRNA complexed with this PEI extensively distributes across the CNS down to the lumbar spinal cord after a single intracerebroventricular infusion. siRNA against \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA), a pre-synaptic protein that aggregates in Parkinson's disease, was complexed with PEI F25-LMW and injected into the lateral ventricle of mice overexpressing human wild-type SNCA (Thy1-aSyn mice). Five days after the single injection of 0.75\u00a0\u03bcg PEI/siRNA, SNCA mRNA expression in the striatum was reduced by 65%, accompanied by reduction of SNCA protein by \u223c50%. Mice did not show signs of toxicity or adverse effects. Moreover, ependymocytes and brain parenchyma were completely preserved and\u00a0free of immune cell invasion, astrogliosis, or microglial activation. Our results support the efficacy and safety of PEI nanoparticle-mediated delivery of siRNA to the brain for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Both motor and non-motor symptoms could contribute to significant deterioration of psychological well-being in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its assessment has been only indirectly evaluated using tools based on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), such as the PDQ-39 scale.\nTo evaluate psychological well-being in PD using a specific tool of assessment, the Psychological Well-being Scale (PWS), and its clinical correlates.\nThis article reports data of patients' perception of health state, as measured by means of the PWS, from an epidemiological, cross-sectional study conducted in Italian PD patients (FORTE Study). We tested possible relationship between well-being and clinical characteristics including fatigue, depression, sleep disruption and HRQoL.\n272 patients completed the PWS questionnaire. Significant and clinically-relevant correlations were found between PWS total score and Parkinson's Fatigue Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, UPDRS Section I, PD Sleep Scale and PDQ-39 for HRQoL scores. Only clinically negligible correlations were found between PWS and motor scores.\nNon-motor symptoms have a significant impact on psychological well-being in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Recently, it was shown that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and freezing of gait (FOG) can also experience freezing episodes during handwriting and present writing problems outside these episodes. So far, the neural networks underlying increased handwriting problems in subjects with FOG are unclear. This study used dynamic causal modeling of fMRI data to investigate neural network dynamics underlying freezing-related handwriting problems and how these networks changed in response to visual cues. Twenty-seven non-freezers and ten freezers performed a pre-writing task with and without visual cues in the scanner with their right hand. The results showed that freezers and non-freezers were able to recruit networks involved in cued and uncued writing in a similar fashion. Whole group analysis also revealed a trend towards altered visuomotor integration in patients with FOG. Next, we controlled for differences in disease severity between both patient groups using a sensitivity analysis. For this, a subgroup of ten non-freezers matched for disease severity was selected by an independent researcher. This analysis further exposed significantly weaker coupling in mostly left hemispheric visuo-parietal, parietal - supplementary motor area, parietal - premotor, and premotor-M1 pathways in freezers compared to non-freezers, irrespective of cues. Correlation analyses revealed that these impairments in connectivity were related to writing amplitude and quality. Taken together, these findings show that freezers have reduced involvement of the supplementary motor area in the motor network, which explains the impaired writing amplitude regulation in this group. In addition, weaker supportive premotor connectivity may have contributed to micrographia in freezers, a pattern that was independent of cueing.",

However, long-term prospective data on the efficacy of LCIG on non-motor symptoms and the safety of outpatient titration are limited.\nIn this 60-week, open-label phase 3b study, LCIG titration was initiated in an outpatient setting following PEG-J placement in PD patients. The efficacy of LCIG on motor and non-motor symptoms, quality of life, and safety was assessed.\nThirty-nine patients were enrolled in the study and 28 patients completed the treatment. A majority of patients (54%) completed outpatient titration within the first week of LCIG infusion. LCIG led to significant reductions from baseline in Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS) total score (least squares mean \u00b1 SE = -17.6 \u00b1 3.6, \nLCIG treatment led to reductions in non-motor symptom burden and motor fluctuations in advanced PD patients.

    "abstract": "Effective treatment for advanced Parkinson disease (PD) uncontrolled with oral medication includes device-aided therapies such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and continuous levodopa-carbidopa infusion to the duodenum via a portable pump.\nOur objective was to quantify patient preferences for attributes of these device-aided treatments.\nWe administered a Web-enabled survey to 401 patients in the United States. A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) was used to evaluate patients' willingness to accept tradeoffs among efficacy, tolerability, and convenience of alternative treatments. DCE data were analyzed using random-parameters logit. Best-worst scaling (BWS) was used to elicit the relative importance of device-specific attributes. Conditional logit was used to analyze the BWS data. We tested for differences in preferences among subgroups of patients.\nImproving ability to think clearly was twice as important as a 6-hour-per-day improvement in control of movement symptoms. After controlling for efficacy, treatment delivered via portable infusion pump was preferred over DBS, and both devices were preferred to oral therapy with poor symptom control. Patients were most concerned about device attributes relating to risk of stroke, difficulty thinking, and neurosurgery. Avoiding surgery to insert a wire in the brain was more important than avoiding surgery to insert a tube into the small intestine. Some differences in preferences among subgroups were statistically, but not qualitatively, significant.\nThis study clarifies the patient perspective in therapeutic choices for advanced PD. These findings may help improve communication between patients and providers and also provide evidence on patient preferences to inform regulatory and access decisions.",

    "abstract": "DJ-1 is one of the important genes found in Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have shown that the DJ-1 protein levels are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of sporadic PD patients, and the DJ-1 protein levels in the CSF and plasma may serve as biomarkers of PD. However, Japanese scholars previously reported that there was no difference in the levels of the DJ-1 protein in serum between sporadic PD patients and controls. Therefore, whether the serum DJ-1 protein levels are different between PD patients and controls in Chinese patients as well as whether serum DJ-1 protein can serve as a biomarker of PD are unknown. The present study aimed to determine whether there was a difference in serum DJ-1 protein levels between Chinese PD patients and controls. The subjects included 18 primary PD patients and 7 controls. Blood was collected by venipuncture, and serum was collected by centrifugation after the blood was coagulated. The serum DJ-1 protein levels were detected by both Western blot and ELISA. There were differences in the serum DJ-1 protein levels among different individuals. The serum DJ-1 concentration in PD patients was 11.3\u00b110.1ng/ml, and that in controls was 18.1\u00b112.8ng/ml (P>0.05). In conclusion, similar to the study conducted by Japanese scholars, we found no significant difference in the serum DJ-1 protein levels between PD patients and controls in Chinese subjects. The levels of the DJ-1 protein in serum may not be a biomarker of PD. In addition, there may be differences in the serum DJ-1 protein levels between Chinese and Japanese patients.",

    "abstract": "Ginsenoside Rb1 has been demonstrated to protect dopaminergic (DA) neurons from death in\u00a0vitro. However, the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanism of Rb1 in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) remain uncharacterized. In this study, we explored the effects of Rb1 on the movement disorder and the underlying mechanisms based on the glutamatergic transmission and excitotoxicity in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. Here, for the first time, we report that Rb1 treatment ameliorates motor deficits, prevents DA neuron death, and suppresses \u03b1-synuclein expression and astrogliosis in the MPTP mouse model of PD. Rb1 attenuates glutamate excitotoxicity by upregulating glutamate transporter expression and function, and modulating the nigrostriatal and cortico-nigral glutamatergic transmission pathways. Our results demonstrate that Rb1 increases glutamate transporter expression via nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B, regulates glutamate receptor expression and promotes synaptic protein expression. These results indicate that Rb1 suppresses glutamate excitotoxicity and modulates synaptic transmission to improve the impairments in motor functions of the MPTP model of PD, suggesting that Rb1 may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for PD.",

However, its effects on PD remain unclear.\nPD was introduced in rats via injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into cerebral corpus striatum, and GLB was given intracerebroventricularly to these rats. Their walking, climbing and sensory states were detected by Stepping, Whisker and Cylinder Tests. The expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), CD11b and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule (IBA)-1 were detected by immunohischemical staining. The levels of a series of inflammatory factors, oxidative stress-related factors and apoptosis-related factors were measured by real-time PCR, immunoblotting and ELISA. In addition, Toll-like receptor (TLR)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase (HO)-1 pathways were investigated to illustrate the underlying mechanism. In vitro, microglial cells exposed to LPS were treated with GLB.\nThe injection of LPS caused walking, climbing and sensory disturbances in rats, induced inflammation, oxidative stress response and apoptosis, and activated TLR/NF-\u03baB and Nrf2/ HO-1 pathways in the cerebral tissue. GLB administration attenuated LPS-induced alterations. The TLR/NF-\u03baB pathway was deactivated and Nrf2/HO-1 was activated after application of GLB. In vitro, cytotoxic effects induced by the conditioned medium derived from microglial cells exposed to LPS in PC12 cells were attenuated by GLB.\nGLB suppresses LPS-induced PD symptoms by modification of TLR/NF-\u03baB and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways in vivo and in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Although a large amount of acoustic indicators have already been proposed in the literature to evaluate the hypokinetic dysarthria of people with Parkinson's Disease, the goal of this work is to identify and interpret new reliable and complementary articulatory biomarkers that could be applied to predict/evaluate Parkinson's Disease from a diadochokinetic test, contributing to the possibility of a further multidimensional analysis of the speech of parkinsonian patients. The new biomarkers proposed are based on the kinetic behaviour of the envelope trace, which is directly linked with the articulatory dysfunctions introduced by the disease since the early stages. The interest of these new articulatory indicators stands on their easiness of identification and interpretation, and their potential to be translated into computer based automatic methods to screen the disease from the speech. Throughout this paper, the accuracy provided by these acoustic kinetic biomarkers is compared with the one obtained with a baseline system based on speaker identification techniques. Results show accuracies around 85% that are in line with those obtained with the complex state of the art speaker recognition techniques, but with an easier physical interpretation, which open the possibility to be transferred to a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Decline in the ability to take effective steps and to adapt gait, particularly under challenging conditions, may be important reasons why people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have an increased risk of falling. This study aimed to determine the extent of stepping and gait adaptability impairments in PD individuals as well as their associations with PD symptoms, cognitive function and previous falls.\nThirty-three older people with PD and 33 controls were assessed in choice stepping reaction time, Stroop stepping and gait adaptability tests; measurements identified as fall risk factors in older adults.\nPeople with PD had similar mean choice stepping reaction times to healthy controls, but had significantly greater intra-individual variability. In the Stroop stepping test, the PD participants were more likely to make an error (48 vs 18%), took 715\u00a0ms longer to react (2312 vs 1517\u00a0ms) and had significantly greater response variability (536 vs 329\u00a0ms) than the healthy controls. People with PD also had more difficulties adapting their gait in response to targets (poorer stepping accuracy) and obstacles (increased number of steps) appearing at short notice on a walkway. Within the PD group, higher disease severity, reduced cognition and previous falls were associated with poorer stepping and gait adaptability performances.\nPeople with PD have reduced ability to adapt gait to unexpected targets and obstacles and exhibit poorer stepping responses, particularly in a test condition involving conflict resolution. Such impaired stepping responses in Parkinson's disease are associated with disease severity, cognitive impairment and falls.",

    "abstract": "Animal models of neurological deficits are essential to assess new therapeutic options and reduce treatment complications. Over the last decades, several rodent models of Parkinson's disease have been developed, and have now become the first-line experimental tool for therapeutic screening purposes. Which model is the most predictive for identifying the efficacy of symptomatic or disease-modifying interventions is still a matter of debate. None of the models so far available is able to recapitulate all the features of the human disease, but several well-characterized models with complementary features currently provide a valuable repertoire of tools to address specific scientific hypotheses. This article reviews the rodent models of Parkinson's disease currently available, with a particular focus on symptomatic models used to mimic parkinsonian motor deficits and treatment-related complications. Advantages and disadvantages of each model are presented and discussed to assist the decision of investigators who wonder which model may be the most suitable for their particular research project.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent central nervous system (CNS) movement disorder and the second most common neurodegenerative disease overall. PD is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) within the midbrain, accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-SYN) in Lewy bodies and neurites and excessive neuroinflammation. The neurodegenerative processes typically begin decades before the appearance of clinical symptoms. Therefore, the diagnosis is achievable only when the majority of the relevant DAergic neurons have already died and for that reason available treatments are only palliative at best. The causes and mechanism(s) of this devastating disease are ill-defined but complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are considered major contributors to the etiology of PD. In addition to the role of classical gene mutations in PD, the importance of regulatory elements modulating gene expression has been increasingly recognized. One example is the critical role played by microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development and homeostasis of distinct populations of neurons within the CNS and, in particular, in the context of PD. Recent reports demonstrate how distinct miRNAs are involved in the regulation of PD genes, whereas profiling approaches are unveiling variations in the abundance of certain miRNAs possibly relevant either to the onset or to the progression of the disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the miRNAs recently found to be implicated in PD etiology, with particular focus on their potential relevance as PD biomarkers, as well as their possible use in PD targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "To systematically review and analyze the efficacy and tolerability of different antidepressant pharmacologic treatments for depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane database (CENTRAL), clinicaltrials.gov, and bibliographies for randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of antidepressant medications versus a non-treatment, placebo, or active treatment groups for depressive symptoms in PD. Twenty of 3191 retrieved studies (1893 patients) were included, but not all could be meta-analyzed. We used a random-effects model meta-analysis to compare depression scores between an active drug and placebo or control group then used a network meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of different antidepressant classes. The primary outcome was the efficacy of different classes of antidepressant medications in PD patients with depressive symptoms, measured by standardized mean difference (SMD) in depression score from baseline compared with control.\nPairwise meta-analysis suggested that type B-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.28, CI\u00a0=\u00a0-1.68, -0.88), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.49, CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.93, -0.05), and tricyclics (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.83, CI\u00a0=\u00a0-1.53, -0.13) are effective antidepressants in PD. Network meta-analysis showed that monoamine oxidase inhibitors had the largest effect on depression in PD (SMD (vs selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)\u00a0=\u00a0-0.78, CI\u00a0=\u00a0-1.55, -0.01), but these might not be considered traditional antidepressants given their type B selectivity.\nAlthough limited by few data, this review suggests that multiple antidepressant classes are potentially efficacious in the treatment of depression in PD, but that further comparative efficacy and tolerability research is needed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating movement disorder typically associated with the accumulation of intracytoplasmic aggregate prone protein deposits. Over recent years, increasing evidence has led to the suggestion that the mutations underlying certain forms of PD impair autophagy. Autophagy is a degradative pathway that delivers cytoplasmic content to lysosomes for degradation and represents a major route for degradation of aggregated cellular proteins and dysfunctional organelles. Autophagy up-regulation is a promising therapeutic strategy that is being explored for its potential to protect cells against the toxicity of aggregate-prone proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we describe how the mutations in different subtypes of PD can affect different stages of autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of olfactory function is valuable for the detection of pre-motor state of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients have an increased risk of associated dementia and one-third of PD patients have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at the time of diagnosis. However, the characteristics of olfactory dysfunction in PD-MCI patients are unclear. This study examined the relationship between olfactory dysfunction and cognitive function in drug-na\u00efve PD at the time of diagnosis with the patterns of olfactory function in PD-MCI patients using the Korean version of the Sniffin' stick test II (KVSS II).\nA total of 66 drug-na\u00efve PD patients were enrolled. A neuropsychiatric assessment battery and KVSS II were performed. For the statistical analyses, univariate, multivariable linear regression and Student's t-test were used to determine the relationship between the variables and olfactory function.\nOlfactory dysfunction was more prevalent in the PD-MCI group than in the PD-normal cognition (PD-CN) group. Each domains of odor threshold, discrimination, identification and total olfactory score were more impaired in the PD-MCI group than the PD-CN group. Whether cognitive impairment was single or multiple domain was not affected.\nPD-MCI is more likely to be associated with severe olfactory impairment than PD-CN. There may be more extensive neurodegenerative processes affecting olfaction in PD-MCI patients. With further investigation and validation using neuropathological data, an objective olfactory function test could be used as a tool to evaluate disease progression. Further studies with prospective design investigating the prognostic value of olfactory dysfunction in PD-MCI patients are essential.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid formation of the synaptic brain protein \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) is related to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease patients. \u03b1S is thought to function in vesicle transport and fusion and it binds strongly to negatively charged vesicles in vitro. Here we combined circular dichroism, fluorescence and imaging methods in vitro to characterize the interaction of \u03b1S with negatively charged vesicles of DOPS (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine, sodium salt) and DOPG (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol), sodium salt) and the consequences of such interactions on \u03b1S amyloid formation. We found that lipid head-group chemistry modulates \u03b1S interactions and also affects amyloid fiber formation. During the course of the experiments, we made the unexpected discovery that pre-formed \u03b1S oligomers, typically present in a small amount in the \u03b1S starting material, acted as templates for linear growth of anomalous amyloid fibers in the presence of vesicles. At the same time, the remaining \u03b1S monomers were restricted from vesicle-mediated nucleation of amyloid fibers. Although not a dominant process in bulk experiments, this hidden \u03b1S aggregation pathway may be of importance in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa (L-DOPA) is the most commonly used drug for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its long-term use is associated with various complications, including L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). Many studies have suggested that L-DOPA neurotoxicity and LID are associated with glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activation. Areas covered: LID is caused by striatal dopamine (DA) denervation in PD and pulsatile L-DOPA treatment. These factors lead to dysregulated DA transmission, abnormal intracellular signaling and transcription factors in striatal neurons, and altered gene expression and plasticity at corticostriatal synapses. The mechanisms of L-DOPA toxicity involve oxidative stress, L-DOPA oxidation to quinone, mitochondrial dysfunction, and \u03b1-synuclein. GSK-3 has been suggested to play key roles in all the mechanisms associated of L-DOPA toxicity and LID in PD. Expert opinion: GSK-3 plays critical roles in L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity, and the development of specific methods to inhibit GSK-3 function may help prevent L-DOPA neurotoxicity and LID in PD. However, balanced GSK-3 inhibition and less \u03b2-catenin degradation is essential for preventing LID, because too much GSK-3 inhibition increases \u03b2-catenin levels, which is related to cancers.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson disease (PD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects nearly 10 million people worldwide, motor skills are significantly impaired. However, onset and progression of motor deficits and the neural correlates of these deficits are poorly understood. We used a genetic mouse model of PD (Pink1-/-), with phenotypic similarities to human PD, to investigate the manifestation of early-onset sensorimotor deficits. We hypothesized this mouse model would show early vocalization and gross motor dysfunction that would be progressive in nature. Pink1-/- mice, compared to wild type (WT) controls, were evaluated at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6\u202fmonths of age. To quantify deficit progression, ultrasonic vocalizations and spontaneous locomotor activity (cylinder test and pole test) were analyzed. Although somewhat variable, in general, Pink1-/- mice produced significantly more simple calls with reduced intensity as well as a larger percentage of cycle calls compared to WT counterparts. However, there were no significant differences in duration, bandwidth, or peak frequency for any of the ultrasonic call types between genotypes. Pink1-/- mice showed a significant impairment in limb motor skills with fewer hindlimb steps, forelimb steps, and rears and lands in the cylinder test compared to WT. Additionally, Pink1-/- mice took significantly longer to turn and traverse during the pole test. Immunohistochemical staining showed no significant difference in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells in the substantia nigra or density of TH staining in the striatum between genotypes. These data suggest the Pink1-/- mouse model may be instrumental in defining early motor biomarkers of PD in the absence of nigrostriatal dopamine loss.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain, is commonly thought of as a motion disorder, but it can have significant effect on the respiratory system. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in these patients, but it can also affect laryngeal function causing dysphonia, dysphagia, and dysarthric speech. Acute upper airway obstruction is a rare finding in PD, especially in the perioperative settings. In this article we report a PD patient who developed upper respiratory obstruction postoperatively. We also review the literature and highlight the importance of preoperative evaluation to identify patients who may be at risk of this complication.\nWe describe a PD patient presenting for brain stimulation electrode implantation under general anesthesia, who postoperatively developed stridor and near complete upper airway obstruction despite maintenance of oral anti-Parkinson medication regimen intraoperatively. The patient was reintubated in post-anesthesia-care unit, and tracheostomy was performed after 1 week due to persistent vocal cord dysfunction.\nBaseline vocal cord impairment in PD patients can be acutely aggravated perioperatively. Symptoms such as dysphagia and dysarthria, which can indicate susceptibility to postoperative upper airway obstruction, may not be well recognized by the patient and family. Surgical candidates should be carefully interviewed preoperatively, and watchful monitoring of respiratory function intraoperatively and postoperatively is of paramount importance. Neurosurgical and neuroanesthesia team should be aware of, and prepared to manage, this potentially life-threatening airway obstruction in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Living with and caring for someone with chronic illness can lead to limitations in activity and social participation for the care partner. Past research emphasizes the importance of care partners taking care of themselves physically and emotionally so they can stay healthy to support the care recipient. There is little information regarding how the care partner takes care of their own social lives. The purpose of this study was to explore the concept of social self-management from the perspective of spousal care partners of people with Parkinson's disease.\nTwenty spousal care partners of people with Parkinson's disease were interviewed three times. A grounded theory approach informed data analysis.\nFindings that emerged from the data focused on balance in activities, support, and emotions and were summarized into three main themes: (1) Activities: Caregiving and beyond; (2) Strategies to support self and spouse; and (3) Emotional impact: Burden and compassion.\nThis research shows that care partners want to retain social participation and provides support for the importance of addressing the socio-emotional needs of care partners of people with a chronic disease. Interventions that guide care partners to take care of their spectrum of needs may lead to healthier, positive relationships. Implications for rehabilitation The focus of rehabilitation is often on the person diagnosed with the chronic condition. Living with and caring for someone with a chronic illness, such as Parkinson's disease, can lead to limitations in activity and social participation for the care partner. Including care partners in the rehabilitation process is key to helping maintain their health and well-being. Learning caregiving and self-management strategies may help care partners support their loved ones while staying socially engaged.",

    "conclusions": "This research shows that care partners want to retain social participation and provides support for the importance of addressing the socio-emotional needs of care partners of people with a chronic disease. Interventions that guide care partners to take care of their spectrum of needs may lead to healthier, positive relationships. Implications for rehabilitation The focus of rehabilitation is often on the person diagnosed with the chronic condition. Living with and caring for someone with a chronic illness, such as Parkinson's disease, can lead to limitations in activity and social participation for the care partner. Including care partners in the rehabilitation process is key to helping maintain their health and well-being. Learning caregiving and self-management strategies may help care partners support their loved ones while staying socially engaged.",

    "abstract": "Transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is a potential therapy for treating neurodegenerative disorders, but this approach has faced many challenges and limited success, primarily because of inhospitable host brain environments that interfere with enriched neuron engraftment and function. Astrocytes play neurotrophic roles in the developing and adult brain, making them potential candidates for helping with modification of hostile brain environments. In this study, we examined whether astrocytic function could be utilized to overcome the current limitations of cell-based therapies in a murine model of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is characterized by dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration in the midbrain. We show here that cografting astrocytes, especially those derived from the midbrain, remarkably enhanced NPC-based cell therapeutic outcomes along with robust DA neuron engraftment in PD rats for at least 6 months after transplantation. We further show that engineering of donor astrocytes with Nurr1 and Foxa2, transcription factors that were recently reported to polarize harmful immunogenic glia into the neuroprotective form, further promoted the neurotrophic actions of grafted astrocytes in the cell therapeutic approach. Collectively, these findings suggest that cografting astrocytes could be a potential strategy for successful cell therapeutic outcomes in neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Aim - to evaluate the efficacy of combined bilateral stereotactic destruction of subcortical nucleus - thalamotomy and contralateral subthalamotomy in patients with Parkinson disease. The study included 10 patients with PD, aged 54-73 (mean age 61.1\u00b15.2 years). The time between two surgeries ranged from 1 to 5 years (mean 2.5\u00b10.5 years). The surgeries were conducted on CRW Radionics stereotactic system using StereoPlan, Atlas (Radionics) andFraimLink (Medtronic) software for target calculating. The neuropsychological status was assessed by UPDRS II, Hoehn and Yahr scale, Schwab and England scale, MMSE. The postoperative follow-up was from 6 months to 5.5 years (mean 3.2\u00b10.9 years). After surgeries tremor stopped or significantly regressed in 9 (90.0%) patients, muscle tone returned to normal in 8 (80.0%) cases and in 7 (70.0%) bradykinesia partially regressed. The increase of motor activity was observed in 8 (80.0%) patients. Levodopa-induced dyskinesia stopped in 5 (50.0%) patients and motor fluctuations regressed in 4 of 5 (80.0%) patients. After the surgery the dose of levodopa decreased on average by 36% - from 885\u00b1245 mg/day to 570\u00b1165 mg/day. The indices of Schwab and England Activities of daily living improved from 56.1% to 80.7%. The postoperative complications were observed in2 (20.0%) cases. Our results demonstrate that bilateral ablative surgery is an effective and safe method of treatment of PD. Stereotactic radiofrequency thalamotomy and contralateral subthalamotomyimprove overall motor function, increase patient's mobility, allow patients to reduce levodopa dose and improve the quality of life.",

    "abstract": "There is an association among postural instability, gait dysfunction, and cognitive impairment in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). Difficulty in dividing attention, response inhibition, and visuospatial attention deficiencies may contribute to the impairment of motor performance during daily activities. There are strong evidences that physical therapy can prevent physical and cognitive decline in individuals with PD. Recently, the European Physiotherapy Guideline (EPG) was developed based on randomized clinical trials about the effectiveness of the physical therapy to improve the functional deficiencies of individuals with PD. The EPG did not include the use of promising new intervention as virtual reality in PD due the lack of studies about its safety, feasibility and effectiveness. Therefore, this study protocol had as objective to evaluate the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of a physical therapy program-based on the European Physiotherapy Guideline (EPG) compared to Kinect-based training on postural control, gait, cognition, and quality of life (QoL) of Individuals with PD.\nA single-blind, parallel, randomized, controlled feasibility trial will be conducted with a sample of 32 individuals diagnosed with idiopathic PD. Participants will be allocated into control group (CG) and experimental group (EG). The intervention of the CG will be conventional physical therapy, and the intervention of the EG will be a supervised practice of five Kinect games. Both groups will perform 14 sessions of 1\u00a0h each one, twice a week over 7\u00a0weeks. Process outcomes will be safety, feasibility, adherence, and acceptability. Safety will be assessed by the proportion of participants who experienced intervention-related adverse events or any serious adverse event during the study period. Feasibility will be assessed through the scores of the games recorded in all training sessions. Adherence will be assessed through the participant's attendance. Acceptability will be the motivation of the participants regarding the interventions. Clinical outcomes will be (1) postural control, (2) cognitive function, (3) balance, (4) gait, and (5) QoL. Individuals will be assessed pre- and post-interventions and after 30\u00a0days by a blinded evaluator.\nThis protocol will clarify if an intervention based on Kinect games will be feasible, safe, and acceptable for individuals with PD compared to conventional physical therapy. We will verify whether the proposed interventions can improve clinical outcomes as postural control, gait, cognition, and QoL of individuals with PD. Our hypothesis is that both Kinect games and conventional physical therapy will be feasible, safe, and acceptable for individuals with PD and will promote positive clinical effects. The results of this feasibility study will be used to design a future definitive clinical trial.\nUnique identification number in WHO Trial Registration: U1111-1171-0371.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients exhibit deficits in emotional recognition and expression abilities, including emotional faces and voices. The aim of this study was to explore emotional processing in pre-deep brain stimulation (pre-DBS) PD patients using two sensory modalities (visual and auditory).\nFifteen PD patients who needed DBS surgery and 15 healthy, age- and gender-matched controls were recruited as participants. All participants were assessed by the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces database 50 Faces Recognition test. Vocal recognition was evaluated by the Montreal Affective Voices database 50 Voices Recognition test. For emotional facial expression, the participants were asked to imitate five basic emotions (neutral, happiness, anger, fear, and sadness). The subjects were required to express nonverbal vocalizations of the five basic emotions. Fifteen Chinese native speakers were recruited as decoders. We recorded the accuracy of the responses, reaction time, and confidence level.\nFor emotional recognition and expression, the PD group scored lower on both facial and vocal emotional processing than did the healthy control group. There were significant differences between the two groups in both reaction time and confidence level. A significant relationship was also found between emotional recognition and emotional expression when considering all participants between the two groups together.\nThe PD group exhibited poorer performance on both the recognition and expression tasks. Facial emotion deficits and vocal emotion abnormalities were associated with each other. In addition, our data allow us to speculate that emotional recognition and expression may share a common system.",

    "abstract": "In autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs), the levels of inflammatory mediators are increased and microglia may be activated, resulting in an inflammatory state and the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. We investigated the association between ARDs and Parkinson disease (PD).\nWe identified ARD patients through the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2001 to 2012. From the general population, we randomly selected a comparison cohort that was frequency-matched by age (in 5-year increments), sex and index year. We analysed the risk of PD, stratified by sex, age and comorbidities, by using a Cox regression model.\nThe risk of PD was 1.37 times greater in ARD patients than in controls after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities. ARD subgroups, such as the rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren syndrome (SS) cohorts, were associated with a significantly higher risk of PD (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.2 and adjusted HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.35-1.79, respectively). Furthermore, primary and secondary SS patients had significantly higher risks of PD (adjusted HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.32-1.88 and adjusted HR, 1.53, 95% CI, 1.23-1.90, respectively).\nThe risk of PD was significantly higher in the ARD patients.

    "abstract": "Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the major genetic cause of autosomal-dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 is implicated in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, neurite outgrowth and PD risk in connection with Rab7L1, a putative interactor of LRRK2. Recently, a subset of Rab GTPases have been reported as substrates of LRRK2. Here we examine the kinase activity of LRRK2 on Rab7L1 in situ in cells. Phos-tag analyses and metabolic labeling assays revealed that LRRK2 readily phosphorylates Golgi-localized wild-type Rab7L1 but not mutant forms that are distributed in the cytoplasm. In\u00a0vitro assays demonstrated direct phosphorylation of Rab7L1 by LRRK2. Subsequent screening using Rab7L1 mutants harboring alanine-substitution for every single Ser/Thr residue revealed that Ser72 is a major phosphorylation site, which was confirmed by using a phospho-Ser72-specific antibody. Moreover, LRRK2 pathogenic Parkinson mutants altogether markedly enhanced the phosphorylation at Ser72. The modulation of Ser72 phosphorylation in Rab7L1 resulted in an alteration of the morphology and distribution of the trans-Golgi network. These data collectively support the involvement of Rab7L1 phosphorylation in the LRRK2-mediated cellular and pathogenetic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTBackground:Psychological resources, such as psychological well-being (PWB) and life satisfaction (LS) can aid individuals suffering from chronic illnesses to cope with their illness. The aim of this study was to investigate PWB, LS, quality of life (QoL), and distress in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to compare them with healthy controls.\nOne hundred and thirteen individuals were recruited. Fifty of the participants suffered from PD, while 53 individuals reported other non-neurological diseases. PD patients were assessed through medical routine examinations. All participants had to be devoid of severe cognitive impairment. They were administered self-report questionnaires to measure PWB, LS, QoL, and distress. A cross-sectional comparative design was applied.\nPD patients reported higher general PWB than controls with the exception of the autonomy subscale where the PD patients scored lower. However, they also reported higher distress (anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and hostility-irritability), lower LS, and poorer QoL compared to controls. In regressive models, general PWB and LS were significantly correlated to the presence of PD, to its functional impairments, and not to other socio-demographic variables.\nFindings confirmed previous literature on other neurological conditions, showing that PD may be associated with greater psychological distress, lower levels of LS and QoL. At the same time, PD patients may preserve their PWB, which is a protective factor for mental and physical health. The presence of these psychological resources is inversely related to functional impairments. Future studies should better investigate the pattern of PWB in PD.",

    "abstract": "Previous postmortem studies demonstrated dysregulation of autophagy in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To clarify whether this alteration reflects a fundamental aspect of PD or represents the final stage of autophagy dysregulation resulting from a long neurodegenerative process, we focused on basal autophagy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PD patients (n\u00a0= 35) and controls (n\u00a0= 23). The whole-transcriptome assay revealed downregulation of mRNAs for 6 core regulators of autophagy (UNC-51-like kinase [ULK] 3, autophagy-related [Atg] 2A, Atg4B, Atg5, Atg16L1, and histone deacetylase 6). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis confirmed significantly increased protein levels of upstream autophagy (ULK1, Beclin1, and autophagy/beclin1 regulator 1) with negative feedback of mRNA expression for these proteins in PD. These protein levels were correlated with increased levels of \u03b1-synuclein in PBMCs. The expression level of the oligomeric form of \u03b1-synuclein in PBMCs paralleled the clinical severity of PD and the degeneration of cardiac sympathetic nerves. Basal activity of autophagy can be lower in patients with PD. Alteration of basal autophagy may be a fundamental aspect of PD.",

However, the biological mechanism underlying DBS treatment remains poorly understood.\nIn this study, we investigated how STN-DBS modulated the brain network using a bimodal positron emission tomography (PET)/functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset. We first performed an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 13 PET/SPECT studies concerning STN-DBS effects on resting-state brain activity in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, using a functional connectivity analysis in resting-state fMRI, we investigated whether these STN-DBS-affected regions were functionally connected to constitute an effective network.\nThe results revealed that STN-DBS reduced brain activity in the right thalamus, bilateral caudal supplementary area, and the left primary motor cortex, and it increased brain activity in the left thalamus during rest. Second, these STN-DBS-affected areas were functionally connected within an STN-DBS effective network.\nDeep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) may deactivate the motor cortex as a remote and network effect, affecting the target and the neighboring subcortical areas.

    "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease-dementia (PDD), although sharing many clinical, neurochemical and morphological features, according to DSM-5, are two entities of major neurocognitive disorders with Lewy bodies of unknown etiology. Despite considerable clinical overlap, their diagnosis is based on an arbitrary distinction between the time of onset of motor and cognitive symptoms: dementia often preceding parkinsonism in DLB and onset of cognitive impairment after onset of motor symptoms in PDD. Both are characterized morphologically by widespread cortical and subcortical \u03b1-synuclein/Lewy body plus \u03b2-amyloid and tau pathologies. Based on recent publications, including the fourth consensus report of the DLB Consortium, a critical overview is given. The clinical features of DLB and PDD include cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, and fluctuating attention. Intravitam PET and post-mortem studies revealed more pronounced cortical atrophy, elevated cortical and limbic Lewy pathologies (with APOE \u03b54), apart from higher prevalence of Alzheimer pathology in DLB than PDD. These changes may account for earlier onset and greater severity of cognitive defects in DLB, while multitracer PET studies showed no differences in cholinergic and dopaminergic deficits. DLB and PDD sharing genetic, neurochemical, and morphologic factors are likely to represent two subtypes of an \u03b1-synuclein-associated disease spectrum (Lewy body diseases), beginning with incidental Lewy body disease-PD-nondemented-PDD-DLB (no parkinsonism)-DLB with Alzheimer's disease (DLB-AD) at the most severe end, although DLB does not begin with PD/PDD and does not always progress to DLB-AD, while others consider them as the same disease. Both DLB and PDD show heterogeneous pathology and neurochemistry, suggesting that they share important common underlying molecular pathogenesis with AD and other proteinopathies. Cognitive impairment is not only induced by \u03b1-synuclein-caused neurodegeneration but by multiple regional pathological scores. Recent animal models and human post-mortem studies have provided important insights into the pathophysiology of DLB/PDD showing some differences, e.g., different spreading patterns of \u03b1-synuclein pathology, but the basic pathogenic mechanisms leading to the heterogeneity between both disorders deserve further elucidation. In view of the controversies about the nosology and pathogenesis of both syndromes, there remains a pressing need to differentiate them more clearly and to understand the processes leading these synucleinopathies to cause one disorder or the other. Clinical management of both disorders includes cholinesterase inhibitors, other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies, but these have only a mild symptomatic effect. Currently, no disease-modifying therapies are available.",

We assessed the correlation between the topography of radiofrequency-based lesions of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with motor improvement and the emergence of haemichorea-ballism.\nSixty-four patients with PD treated with subthalamotomy were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score (UPDRSm), MRI and tractography. Patients were classified according to the degree of clinical motor improvement and dyskinesia scale. Lesions were segmented on MRI and averaged in a standard space. We examined the relationship between the extent of lesion-induced disruption of fibres surrounding the STN and the development of haemichorea-ballism.\nMaximum antiparkinsonian effect was obtained with lesions located within the dorsolateral motor region of the STN as compared with those centre-placed in the dorsal border of the STN and the zona incerta (71.3%, 53.5% and 20.8% UPDRSm reduction, respectively). However, lesions that extended dorsally beyond the STN showed lower probability of causing haemichorea-ballism than those placed entirely within the nucleus. Tractography findings indicate that interruption of pallidothalamic fibres probably determines a low probability of haemichorea-ballism postoperatively.\nThe topography of the lesion is a major factor in the antiparkinsonian effect of subthalamotomy in patients with PD. Lesions involving the motor STN and pallidothalamic fibres induced significant motor improvement and were associated with a low incidence of haemichorea-ballism.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of implicit versus explicit local contextual processing in Parkinson's disease (PD) using electrophysiological measures. EEG recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by either randomized sequences of standards or by sequences including a predictive sequence signaling the occurrence of a target event. PD patients (\"on\" medication) and healthy controls performed two sessions: in the first the regularity of the predictive sequence was implicit, while in the second this regularity was made explicit. PD and control subjects showed shorter reaction times for predicted versus random targets across both the implicit and explicit sessions. Healthy controls showed a facilitation of the P3b latency for predicted targets (compared with random targets) in both the implicit and explicit sessions, while PD patients showed no significant P3b latency differences between the two target conditions across both sessions. In healthy controls the P3b amplitude of the last most-informative stimulus of the predictive sequence (n-1) was larger in the explicit compared to the implicit session, while this difference was absent in PD patients. Functional connectivity measures showed that during the explicit and implicit sessions detection of n-1 was associated with higher gamma values and weaker fronto-central-parietal connections, in the theta band, in PD compared to controls. The findings suggest that implicit and explicit processing of predictive contextual information is altered in PD patients and that this may be associated with functional connectivity abnormalities within top-down frontal networks.",

    "abstract": "Long-term levodopa (l-dopa) treatment in patients with Parkinson\u00b4s disease (PD) is associated with the development of motor complications (ie, motor fluctuations and dyskinesias). The principal etiopathogenic factors are the degree of nigro-striatal dopaminergic loss and the duration and dose of l-dopa treatment. In this review article we concentrate on analysis of the mechanisms underlying l-dopa-induced dyskinesias, a phenomenon that causes disability in a proportion of patients and that has not benefited from major therapeutic advances. Thus, we discuss the main neurotransmitters, receptors, and pathways that have been thought to play a role in l-dopa-induced dyskinesias from the perspective of basic neuroscience studies. Some important advances in deciphering the molecular pathways involved in these abnormal movements have occurred in recent years to reveal potential targets that could be used for therapeutic purposes. However, it has not been an easy road because there have been a plethora of components involved in the generation of these undesired movements, even bypassing the traditional and well-accepted dopamine receptor activation, as recently revealed by optogenetics. Here, we attempt to unify the available data with the hope of guiding and fostering future research in the field of striatal activation and abnormal movement generation. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is conventionally seen as resulting from single-system neurodegeneration affecting nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. However, accumulating evidence indicates multi-system degeneration and neurotransmitter deficiencies, including cholinergic neurons which degenerate in a brainstem nucleus, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), resulting in motor and cognitive impairments. The neuropeptide galanin can inhibit cholinergic transmission, while being upregulated in degenerating brain regions associated with cognitive decline. Here we determined the temporal-spatial profile of progressive expression of endogenous galanin within degenerating cholinergic neurons, across the rostro-caudal axis of the PPN, by utilizing the lactacystin-induced rat model of PD. First, we show progressive neuronal death affecting nigral dopaminergic and PPN cholinergic neurons, reflecting that seen in PD patients, to facilitate use of this model for assessing the therapeutic potential of bioactive peptides. Next, stereological analyses of the lesioned brain hemisphere found that the number of PPN cholinergic neurons expressing galanin increased by 11%, compared to sham-lesioned controls, and increasing by a further 5% as the neurodegenerative process evolved. Galanin upregulation within cholinergic PPN neurons was most prevalent closest to the intra-nigral lesion site, suggesting that galanin upregulation in such neurons adapt intrinsically to neurodegeneration, to possibly neuroprotect. This is the first report on the extent and pattern of galanin expression in cholinergic neurons across distinct PPN subregions in both the intact rat CNS and lactacystin-lesioned rats. The findings pave the way for future work to target galanin signaling in the PPN, to determine the extent to which upregulated galanin expression could offer a viable treatment strategy for ameliorating PD symptoms associated with cholinergic degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease, with the majority of cases being sporadic or \"idiopathic\". The aetiology of the sporadic form is still unknown, but there is a broad consensus that Parkinson's disease involves multiple pathways. In previous human post-mortem studies investigating substantia nigra of parkinsonian subjects, gene expression alterations in various metabolic pathways including protein folding, trafficking, aggregation, ubiquitination and oxidative stress were found. These studies revealed transcriptomic dysregulation of various genes, amongst others Skp1A and PSMC4 (part of ubiquitin-proteasome system), HSC70 (belonging to the chaperone family) and ALDH1A1 (an enzyme involved in the catabolism of dopamine). To investigate whether these alterations are manifested at the protein level, we performed immunohistochemical analysis in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease and compared them to Alzheimer's disease and non-neurological post-mortem controls. We were able to confirm cell-specific reductions in the protein content of ALHD1A1 and Skp1A in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra of Parkinsonian patients compared to Alzheimer's and control subjects. Furthermore, we observed particular distribution for HSC70 and PSMC4 in the cytoplasm and accumulation within Lewy body in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra in Parkinson patients. These findings, together with previous evidence, suggest a malfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome and possible autophagy systems as major players in protein misfolding and aggregation in Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, this needs further proof, possibly with trajectory time line.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease displaying negative impacts on both the health and social ability of patients and considerable economical costs. The classical anti-parkinsonian drugs based in dopaminergic replacement are the standard treatment, but several motor side effects emerge during long-term use. This mini-review presents the rationale to several efforts from pre-clinical and clinical studies using adenosine receptor antagonists as a non-dopaminergic therapy. As several studies have indicated that the monotherapy with adenosine receptor antagonists reaches limited efficacy, the usage as a co-adjuvant appeared to be a promising strategy. The formulation of multi-targeted drugs, using adenosine receptor antagonists and other neurotransmitter systems than the dopaminergic one as targets, have been receiving attention since Parkinson's disease presents a complex biological impact. While pharmacological approaches to cure or ameliorate the conditions of PD are the leading strategy in this area, emerging positive aspects have arisen from non-pharmacological approaches and adenosine function inhibition appears to improve both strategies.",

    "abstract": "One of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases worldwide is still referred to as 'Parkinson's disease'. The condition is named after James Parkinson who, in 1817, described the shaking palsy (paralysis agitans). In the bicentennial year of this publication, we trace when and why the shaking palsy became Parkinson's disease. The term was coined by William Rutherford Sanders of Edinburgh in 1865 and later entered general usage through the influence of Jean-Martin Charcot and the school that he nurtured at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital in Paris. Despite a move towards more mechanism-based nosology for many medical conditions in recent years, the Parkinson's disease eponym remains in place, celebrating the life and work of this doctor, palaeontologist and political activist.",

    "abstract": "Real world data have an important role to play in the evaluation of epidemiology and burden of disease; and in assisting health-care decision-makers, especially related to coverage and payment decisions. However, there is currently no overview of the existing longitudinal real world data sources in Parkinson's disease (PD) in the USA. Such an assessment can be very helpful, to support a future effort to harmonize real world data collection and use the available resources in an optimal way.\nThe objective of this comprehensive literature review is to systematically identify and describe the longitudinal, real world data sources in PD in the USA, and to provide a summary of their measurements (categorized into 8 main dimensions: motor and neurological functions, cognition, psychiatry, activities of daily living, sleep, quality of life, autonomic symptoms and other). The literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and internet key word search.\nOf the 53 data sources identified between May and August 2016, 16 were still ongoing. Current medications (81%) and comorbidities (79%) were frequently collected, in comparison to medical imaging (36%), genetic information (30%), caregiver burden (11%) and healthcare costs (2%). Many different measurements (n\u00a0=\u2009108) were performed and an interesting variability among used measurements was revealed.\nMany longitudinal real world data sources on PD exist. Different types of measurements have been performed over time. To allow comparison and pooling of these multiple data sources, it will be essential to harmonize practices in terms of types of measurements.",

    "abstract": "Early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD), as a dangerous neurodegenerative disease, is a key factor in the therapy or prevention of further development of this disease. We developed an electrochemical nanobiosensor for early detection of PD based on the quantification of circulating biomarker, miR-195. Exfoliated graphene oxide (EGO) and gold nanowires (GNWs) were used to modify the surface of screen-printed carbon electrode. A single-strand thiolated probe was designed for specific hybridization with target miRNA (miR-195), and doxorubicin was used as an electrochemical indicator for differential pulse voltammetry measurements. The results of scanning electron microscope imaging and cyclic voltammetry experiments confirmed the accuracy of the working electrode modification steps. The results of analytical performance nanobiosensor showed a high sensitivity of the biosensing with 2.9 femtomolar detection limit and dynamic range of 10.0-900.0 femtomolar. In addition, good selectivity for target miRNA over non-specific oligonucleotides (one and three base replacement in target miRNA, and non-complementary) was achieved. The results of real human serum analysis did not show any interference in the function of the biosensor. Based on the results, the miR-195 electrochemical nanobiosensor could be suggested for clinicians in the medical diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the most frequent depressive symptoms and their association with cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\n48 patients with PD and 44 controls (CG), aged between 50 and 80 years and with at least 4 years of formal education, all with MCI and none diagnosed with depression, were assessed. Patients and controls were matched for age, education, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Participants underwent clinical evaluation with a neurologist followed by neuropsychological assessment employing the instruments: MMSE, Clock Drawing Test, Verbal Fluency Test (semantic and phonemic), Figures Memory Test (FMT), Stroop Test, Trail Making Test, Digit Span (WAIS III), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Hooper Visual Organization Test, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).\nThe most frequent depressive symptoms in the PD group were: difficulty working, fatigue and sleep disorders (the latter also being present in CG). BDI score correlated negatively with learning and recognition memory in both groups. Episodic memory, evaluated by the FMT and RAVLT tests, was the cognitive function showing greatest impairment.\nSome of the depressive symptoms observed in PD patients with MCI seem to be attributable to complications of PD, while others are common to both PD and MCI, making differential diagnoses complex but crucial.\nInvestigar os sintomas depressivos mais frequentes e sua associa\u00e7\u00e3o com a cogni\u00e7\u00e3o de indiv\u00edduos com doen\u00e7a de Parkinson (DP) e decl\u00ednio cognitivo leve (DCL).\nForam avaliados 48 pacientes com DP e 44 Controles (GC), com idade entre 50 e 80 anos e escolaridade superior a 4 anos, todos com DCL e sem diagn\u00f3stico de depress\u00e3o. Pacientes e controles foram pareados quanto \u00e0 idade, escolaridade e pontua\u00e7\u00e3o do Mini Exame do Estado Mental (MEEM).

    "abstract": "A 71-year-old woman with a 9-year history of Parkinson's disease was admitted to our hospital emergently because of consciousness disturbance. Her consciousness level was 200 on the Japan coma scale (JCS), and she presented with tenderness and distension of the lower abdomen. Brain computed tomography showed normal findings. Blood tests showed an increased ammonia level (209 \u03bcg/dl) with normal AST and ALT levels. We catheterized the bladder for urinary retention. Five hours after admission, the blood ammonia level decreased to 38 \u03bcg/dl, and her consciousness level improved dramatically. Corynebacterium urearyticum, a bacterial species that produces urease, was detected by urine culture. Therefore, she was diagnosed with hyperammonemic encephalopathy resulting from urinary tract infection caused by urease-producing bacteria. In this case, urologic active agents had been administered to treat neurogenic bladder. We suspect that these drugs caused urinary obstruction and urinary tract infection. It is important to recognize that obstructive urinary tract infection caused by urease-producing bacteria can cause hyperammonemia. Neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, tend to complicate neurogenic bladder. This disease should be considered in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease who are receiving urologic active drugs.",

    "abstract": "To examine diagnostic accuracy of anxiety detection tools compared with a gold standard in outpatient settings among adults with Parkinson disease (PD).\nA systematic review was conducted. MEDLINE, EMABASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched to April 7, 2017. Prevalence of anxiety and diagnostic accuracy measures including sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were gathered. Pooled prevalence of anxiety was calculated using Mantel-Haenszel-weighted DerSimonian and Laird models.\nA total of 6,300 citations were reviewed with 6 full-text articles included for synthesis. Tools included within this study were the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety, Parkinson's Anxiety Scale (PAS), and Mini-Social Phobia Inventory. Anxiety diagnoses made included generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and any anxiety type. Pooled prevalence of anxiety was 30.1% (95% confidence interval 26.1%-34.0%). The GAI had the best-reported sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.88. The observer-rated PAS had a sensitivity of 0.71 and the highest specificity of 0.91.\nWhile there are 6 tools validated for anxiety screening in PD populations, most tools are only validated in single studies. The GAI is brief and easy to use, with a good balance of sensitivity and specificity. The PAS was specifically developed for PD, is brief, and has self-/observer-rated scales, but with lower sensitivity. Health care practitioners involved in PD care need to be aware of available validated tools and choose one that fits their practice.",

The GAI had the best-reported sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.88. The observer-rated PAS had a sensitivity of 0.71 and the highest specificity of 0.91.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Both diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation in the brain-neuroinflammation. The first signs of PD and AD are most often manifested in old age, in which the immune system is usually characterized by chronic inflammation, so-called \"inflammaging\" In recent years, there is growing evidence that pathogenesis of these diseases is connected with both regional and peripheral immune processes. Currently, the association of clinical signs of PD and AD with different characteristics of patient immune status is actively being researched. In this mini-review we compare the association of PD and AD alterations of a number of immune system parameters connected with the process of inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The endosomal system is critical for the maintenance of intracellular homeostasis, and defects in this system are often linked to neurological disorders. The retromer complex is a critical coordinator of endosomal dynamics and has functional roles in multiple cellular processes through sorting cargoes from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or to the plasma membrane. Mammalian retromer comprises a core Vps26-Vps35-Vps29 trimer and associates with a range of proteins to generate endosomal tubular-vesicular carriers. Alterations in retromer function or its molecular organization have been a rising risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Although genetic evidence has shown several variants within retromer in late-onset PD cases, the exact molecular machineries by which retromer variants induce the development of PD are still not completely elucidated. In this Review, we will focus on the functional roles of retromer in neuronal health, summarize advances in defining the cellular pathological phenotype caused by retromer deficiency or PD-linked retromer variants and discuss the potential clues of how retromer deregulation may contribute to PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders are very common in Parkinson's disease (PD), being associated with several other conditions, mainly psychiatric disorders. The present study was designed to assess sleep quality in Brazilian patients with PD and to evaluate whether sleep changes are associated with clinical variables, especially neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD. Patients diagnosed with PD were subjected to a comprehensive clinical evaluation that included the assessment of motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Our study showed that sleep complaints are frequent in PD and worse sleep quality is associated with depressive and anxious symptoms, poorer cognitive performance and greater severity of PD symptoms. In the multivariate analysis, older age, greater severity of anxiety and PD remained as significant predictors of worse sleep quality. In conclusion, sleep complaints, depressive and anxiety symptoms are frequent in PD patients. Older age, disease severity and anxiety symptoms are significant predictors of poorer sleep quality in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to several specific pesticides has led to an increase of Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. However, it is difficult to quantify the PD population risk related to certain pesticides in regions where environmental exposure data are scarce. Furthermore, the time trend of the prevalence and incidence of PD embedded in the background relationship between PD risk and pesticide exposures has not been well characterized. It has been convincingly identified that a key pesticide associated significantly with an increased risk trend of PD is paraquat (PQ). Here, we present a novel, probabilistic population-based exposure-response approach to quantify the contribution from PQ exposure to prevalence risk of PD. We found that the largest PQ exposure contributions occurred in its positive trend during 2004-2011, with the PQ contributing nearly 21 and 24%, respectively, to the PD prevalence rates among the age groups of 70-79 and \u2265 80\u00a0years in Taiwan. We also employed the present population risk model to predict the PQ-induced PD prevalence based on the projected rates of increase in PQ exposure associated with age-specific population. The predicted outcome can be used as an early warning signal for public health authorities. We suggest that a mechanistic understanding of the contribution of a specific pesticide exposure to PD risk trends is crucial to enhance our insights into the perspective on the impacts of environmental exposure on the neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs regulating gene expression and may participate in pathogenesis of various diseases. Recently, rs897984:T\u2009>\u2009C in miR-4519 and rs11651671:A\u2009>\u2009G in miR-548at-5p have been reported that associate with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, to our knowledge, there is no further evidence regarding this finding. Herein, we performed a case-control study of 546 PD patients and 550 healthy controls to genotype the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assess their associations with PD. The results showed that rs897984 (OR value for C allele =\u20090.851, 95% CI 0.603-1.201, P\u2009=\u20090.358) in miR-4519 and rs11651671 (OR value for G allele =\u20091.405, 95% CI 0.927-2.131, P\u2009=\u20090.107) in miR-548at-5p were not associated to PD, which suggest they may not contribute to the gene susceptibility of PD at least in Chinese Han population. More evidences from larger sample size and other ethnic populations are still needed to illustrate the association between miRNAs and PD.",

    "abstract": "To further understand the effect of Parkinson's disease (PD) on articulatory movements in speech and to expand our knowledge of therapeutic treatment strategies, this study examined movements of the jaw, tongue blade, and tongue dorsum during sentence production with respect to speech intelligibility and compared the effect of varying speaking styles on these articulatory movements.\nTwenty-one speakers with PD and 20 healthy controls produced 3 sentences under normal, loud, clear, and slow speaking conditions. Speech intelligibility was rated for each speaker. A 3-dimensional electromagnetic articulograph tracked movements of the articulators. Measures included articulatory working spaces, ranges along the first principal component, average speeds, and sentence durations.\nSpeakers with PD demonstrated significantly smaller jaw movements as well as shorter than normal sentence durations. Between-speaker variation in movement size of the jaw, tongue blade, and tongue dorsum was associated with speech intelligibility. Analysis of speaking conditions revealed similar patterns of change in movement measures across groups and articulators: larger than normal movement sizes and faster speeds for loud speech, increased movement sizes for clear speech, and larger than normal movement sizes and slower speeds for slow speech.\nSentence-level measures of articulatory movements are sensitive to both disease-related changes in PD and speaking-style manipulations.",

In 2006, Levy and Dubois proposed a model that distinguishes three different apathy aetiologies in PD divided into three subtypes of disrupted processing: \"emotional-affective,\" \"cognitive,\" and \"auto-activation.\" These three dimensions associated with dopamine depletion present in the pathology would lead to the emergence of apathy in PD. The aim of this mini-review was to describe and discuss studies that have explore links between apathy and the three subtypes of disrupted processing proposed by Levy and Dubois (2006) and as well as the links between these dimensions and dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease. The lack of consensus regarding the emotional-affective correlates of apathy and the lack of evidence supporting the hypothesis of the auto-activation deficit, do not clearly confirm the validity of Levy and Dubois's model. Furthermore, the suggested association between dopaminergic depletion and apathy must also be clarified.",

    "abstract": "Expression array data from dozens of laboratories, including our own, show significant changes in expression of many genes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients compared with normal controls. These data typically rely on brain homogenates, and information about transcripts specific to microglia and other central nervous system (CNS) cell types, which far outnumber microglia-specific transcripts, is lost. We therefore used single-cell laser capture methods to assess the full range of microglia-specific expression changes that occur in different brain regions (substantia nigra and hippocampus CA1) and disease states (AD, Parkinson's disease, and normal controls). Two novel pathways, neuronal repair and viral processing were identified. Based on KEGG analysis (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, a collection of biological pathways), one of the most significant viruses was hepatitis B virus (HBV) (false discovery rate < 0.00000001). Immunohistochemical analysis using HBV-core antibody in HBV-positive control, amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and HBV-positive AD cases show increased HBV immunoreactivity as disease pathology increases. These results are the first, to our knowledge, to show regional differences in human microglia. In addition, these data reveal new functions for microglia and suggest a novel risk factor for AD.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are important organelles in virtually all eukaryotic cells, and are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Besides the generation of cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate, mitochondria are also involved in calcium homeostasis, reactive oxygen species production and the activation of the intrinsic cell death pathway, thus determining cell survival and death. Mitochondrial abnormalities have been implicated in a wide range of disorders, including neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease\u00a0(PD), and considered as a primary cause and central event responsible for the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD. Thus, reversion or attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction should alleviate the severity or progression of the disease. The present review systematically summarizes the possible mechanisms associated with mitochondria\u2011mediated dopaminergic neuron damage in PD, in an attempt to elucidate the requirement for further studies for the development of effective PD treatments.",

    "abstract": "Examine relationships among neurodegenerative biomarkers and PD motor and nonmotor symptoms.\nCSF alpha-synuclein is decreased in PD versus healthy controls, but whether plasma and saliva alpha-synuclein differentiate these groups is controversial. Correlations of alpha-synuclein among biofluids (CSF, plasma, saliva) or biomarkers (eg, beta-amyloid, tau [total, phosphorylated]) are not fully understood. The relationships of these biomarkers with PD clinical features remain unclear.\nBioFIND, a cross-sectional, observational study, examines clinical and biomarker characteristics in moderate-advanced PD and matched healthy controls. We compared alpha-synuclein concentrations across diagnosis, biofluids, and CSF biomarkers. Correlations of CSF biomarkers and MDS-UPDRS, motor phenotype, MoCA, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder questionnaire scores in PD were examined.\nCSF alpha-synuclein was lower in PD versus controls (P\u2009=\u2009.01), controlling for age, gender, and education. Plasma and saliva alpha-synuclein did not differ between PD and controls, and alpha-synuclein did not significantly correlate among biofluids. CSF beta-amyloid\nLower CSF alpha-synuclein is associated with diagnosis and motor phenotype in moderate-advanced PD.

    "abstract": "Hyperactivity in the corticostriatal glutamatergic pathway (CGP) induces basal ganglia dysfunction, contributing to parkinsonian syndrome (PS). Physical exercise can improve PS. However, the effect of exercise on the CGP, and whether this pathway is involved in the improvement of PS, remains unclear. Parkinson's disease (PD) was induced in rats by 6-hydroxydopamine injection into the right medial forebrain bundle. Motor function was assessed using the cylinder test. Striatal neuron (SN) spontaneous and evoked firing activity was recorded, and the expression levels of Cav1.3 and CaMKII in the striatum were measured after 4 weeks of treadmill exercise. The motor function in PD rats was improved by treadmill exercise. SN showed significantly enhanced excitability, and treadmill exercise reduced SN excitability in PD rats. In addition, firing activity was evoked in SNs by stimulation of the primary motor cortex, and SNs exhibited significantly decreased stimulus threshold, increased firing rates, and reduced latency. The expression of Cav1.3 and p-CaMKII (Thr286) in the striatum were enhanced in PD rats. However, these effects were reversed by treadmill exercise. These findings suggest that treadmill exercise inhibits CGP hyperactivity in PD rats, which may be related to improvement of PS.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating neurological movement disorder. Since its first discovery 200 years ago, genetic and environmental factors have been identified to play a role in PD development and progression. Although genetic studies have been the predominant driving force in PD research over the last few decades, currently only a small fraction of PD cases can be directly linked to monogenic mutations. The remaining cases have been attributed to other risk associated genes, environmental exposures and gene-environment interactions, making PD a multifactorial disorder with a complex etiology. However, enormous efforts from global research have yielded significant insights into pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for PD. This review will highlight mitochondrial dysfunction as a common pathway involved in both genetic mutations and environmental toxicants linked to PD.",

    "abstract": "There are very less data on the comparison between the cognitive profile in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Parkinson's-plus groups, especially in India.\nThe aim of this study is to compare the cognitive profile across PD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) groups and compare them using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), frontal assessment battery (FAB), and verbal fluency tests.\nThis was a cross-sectional study.\nMMSE, FAB, and verbal fluency tests were administered in a total of 73 patients constituting 22 patients in MSA, 26 patients in PD, and 25 patients in PSP group, respectively. Twenty-six participants both age- and gender-matched were enrolled in control group.\nStatistical analysis was done using SPSS Version 20.0. Descriptive statistics were done to find out the mean and standard deviation of different variables. ANOVA was done for followed by \nANOVA showed that there is a significant difference for MMSE scores (\nOur data suggest that global cognitive impairment and executive dysfunction are worst in PSP among the three groups. Patients with MSA had significant cognitive decline as opposed to previous experience. FAB scores and verbal fluency tests are good tests to assess cognitive impairment in these diseases. Subsets of FAB score have significant differences but cannot help differentiating conclusively between these three diseases.",

    "abstract": "To explore the potential influence of the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) on social support in Parkinson disease (PD).\nThis was a quasi-experimental mixed methods design. Volunteers with PD (n=27) and care partners (n=6) completed the CDSMP, questionnaires of social support and self-management outcomes, and an interview about social support in relation to CDSMP participation. PD participants (n=19) who did not participate in the CDSMP completed the questionnaires for quantitative comparison purposes.\nRegarding the quantitative data, there were no significant effects of CDSMP participation on social support questionnaire scores; however, there were some positive correlations between changes in social support and changes in self-management outcomes from pre- to post-CDSMP participation. Three qualitative themes emerged from the interviews: lack of perceived change in amount and quality of social support, positive impact on existing social networks, and benefit from participating in a supportive PD community.\nAlthough participants did not acknowledge major changes in social support, there were some social support-related benefits of CDSMP participation for PD participants and care partners. These findings provide a starting point for more in-depth studies of social support and self-management in this population.",

    "abstract": "Ablative neurosurgery has been used to treat Parkinson's disease for many decades. MRI-guided focused ultrasound allows focal lesions to be made in deep brain structures without skull incision. We investigated the safety and preliminary efficacy of unilateral subthalamotomy by focused ultrasound in Parkinson's disease.\nThis prospective, open-label pilot study was done at CINAC (Centro Integral de Neurociencias), University Hospital HM Puerta del Sur in Madrid, Spain. Eligible participants had Parkinson's disease with markedly asymmetric parkinsonism. Patients with severe dyskinesia, history of stereotactic surgery or brain haemorrhage, a diagnosis of an unstable cardiac or psychiatric disease, or a skull density ratio of 0\u00b73 or less were excluded. Enrolled patients underwent focused ultrasound unilateral subthalamotomy. The subthalamic nucleus was targeted by means of brain images acquired with a 3-Tesla MRI apparatus. Several sonications above the definitive ablation temperature of 55\u00b0C were delivered and adjusted according to clinical response. The primary outcomes were safety and a change in the motor status of the treated hemibody as assessed with part III of the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS III) in both off-medication and on-medication states at 6 months. Adverse events were monitored up to 48 h after treatment and at scheduled clinic visits at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02912871.\nBetween April 26 and June 14, 2016, ten patients with markedly asymmetric parkinsonism that was poorly controlled pharmacologically were enrolled for focused ultrasound unilateral subthalamotomy. By 6 months follow-up, 38 incidents of adverse events had been recorded, none of which were serious or severe. Seven adverse events were present at 6 months. Three of these adverse events were directly related to subthalamotomy: off-medication dyskinesia in the treated arm (one patient, almost resolved by 6 months); on-medication dyskinesia in the treated arm (one patient, resolved after levodopa dose reduction); and subjective speech disturbance (one patient). Four of the adverse events present at 6 months were related to medical management (anxiety and fatigue [one patient each] and weight gain [two patients]). The most frequent adverse events were transient gait ataxia (related to subthalamotomy, six patients), transient pin-site head pain (related to the head frame, six patients), and transient high blood pressure (during the procedure, five patients). Transient facial asymmetry (one patient) and moderate impulsivity (two patients) were also recorded. The mean MDS-UPDRS III score in the treated hemibody improved by 53% from baseline to 6 months in the off-medication state (16\u00b76 [SD 2\u00b79] vs 7\u00b75 [3\u00b79]) and by 47% in the on-medication state (11\u00b79 [3\u00b71] vs 5\u00b78 [3\u00b75]).\nMRI-guided focused ultrasound unilateral subthalamotomy was well tolerated and seemed to improve motor features of Parkinson's disease in patients with noticeably asymmetric parkinsonism. Large randomised controlled trials are necessary to corroborate these preliminary findings and to assess the potential of such an approach to treat Parkinson's disease.\nFundaci\u00f3n de investigaci\u00f3n HM Hospitales and Insightec.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects extensive regions of the central nervous system. In this work, we evaluated the structural connectome of patients with PD, as mapped by diffusion-weighted MRI tractography and a multi-shell, multi-tissue (MSMT) constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) method to increase the precision of tractography at tissue interfaces. The connectome was mapped with probabilistic MSMT-CSD in 21 patients with PD and in 21 age- and gender-matched controls. Mapping was also performed by deterministic single-shell, single tissue (SSST)-CSD tracking and probabilistic SSST-CSD tracking for comparison. A support vector machine was trained to predict diagnosis based on a linear combination of graph metrics. We showed that probabilistic MSMT-CSD could detect significantly reduced global strength, efficiency, clustering, and small-worldness, and increased global path length in patients with PD relative to healthy controls; by contrast, probabilistic SSST-CSD only detected the difference in global strength and small-worldness. In patients with PD, probabilistic MSMT-CSD also detected a significant reduction in local efficiency and detected clustering in the motor, frontal temporoparietal associative, limbic, basal ganglia, and thalamic areas. The network-based statistic identified a subnetwork of reduced connectivity by MSMT-CSD and probabilistic SSST-CSD in patients with PD, involving key components of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical network. Finally, probabilistic MSMT-CSD had superior diagnostic accuracy compared with conventional probabilistic SSST-CSD and deterministic SSST-CSD tracking. In conclusion, probabilistic MSMT-CSD detected a greater extent of connectome pathology in patients with PD, including those with cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical network disruptions. Connectome analysis based on probabilistic MSMT-CSD may be useful when evaluating the extent of white matter connectivity disruptions in PD.",

    "abstract": "Classical motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and axial symptoms are graded in the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III. It is yet to be ascertained whether parkinsonian motor symptoms are associated with different anatomical patterns of neurodegeneration as reflected by brain grey matter (GM) alteration. This study aimed to investigate associations between motor subscores and brain GM at voxel level. High resolution structural MRI T1 scans from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) repository were employed to estimate brain GM intensity of PD subjects. Correlations between GM intensity and total MDS-UPDRS III and its four subscores were computed. The total MDS-UPDRS III score was significantly negatively correlated bilaterally with putamen and caudate GM density. Lower anterior striatal GM intensity was significantly associated with higher rigidity subscores, whereas left-sided anterior striatal and precentral cortical GM reduction were correlated with severity of axial symptoms. No significant morphometric associations were demonstrated for tremor subscores. In conclusion, we provide evidence for neuroanatomical patterns underpinning motor symptoms in early PD.",

Evidence suggests an important role of the gut-brain axis in PD pathogenesis. These interactions might be essentially influenced by the gut microbiota. Here, we review recent findings supporting that changes in the gut microbiota composition might be a trigger for inflammation contributing to neurodegeneration in PD.\nRecent research revealed that PD patients exhibit a pro-inflammatory microbiota profile in their intestinal tract that might increase gut permeability, allowing leakage of bacterial products and inflammatory mediators from the intestines. Evidence in literature indicates that alpha-synuclein deposition might start in the enteric nervous system by pro-inflammatory immune activity and then propagates to the CNS. Alternatively, the peripheral inflammatory response could impact the brain through systemic mechanisms.\nA better understanding of the gut-brain interactions and the role of the intestinal microbiota in the regulation of immune responses might bring new insights in PD pathological progression and might lead to novel diagnostics and therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Our goal was to assess the association between potentially inappropriate medication use and risk of falls in the Parkinson's disease population.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study conducted at an outpatient Parkinson's Disease Treatment Center. Individuals 65\u2009years of age or older, diagnosed with Parkinson's disease who attended at least three visits in 2015 for physical, occupational therapy, or physician's visits were included in the study. Electronic medical records were utilized to perform chart reviews, and medications were analyzed to identify prescription medications, combination preparations, over-the-counter medications, and dietary supplements. The goal of this study was to test the following hypothesis: elderly individuals with Parkinson's disease who take multiple potentially inappropriate medications are more likely to experience a fall compared to elderly individuals with Parkinson's disease who do not take multiple potentially inappropriate medications.\nA higher mean number of prescription medications were associated with falls in elderly Parkinson's disease patients (6.53 vs 5.21, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Polypharmacy (taking five or more prescription and nonprescription medications) was not significantly associated with falls. Patients taking potentially inappropriate medications specifically contraindicated for those with a history of falls and fractures were more likely to report falls (p\u2009<\u20090.04). Analysis of the specific therapeutic medication categories demonstrated no significant differences between those who did and did not report falls.\nA future prospective study at Parkinson's disease center should include an electronic medical record-based intervention to reduce the total number of medications, as well as to minimize the use of high-risk medications.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the microstructure of brain white matter according to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based on tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in early Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA total of 31 age- and sex-matched early PD patients and 22 healthy volunteers were recruited in the present study. DTI was performed, and the data analyzed with fsl4.0 software. The fractional anisotropy (FA) was compared between both groups with an independent t test, and the differential area was analyzed. White matter fiber tracts with significant difference in FA between the two groups were selected, and their FAs were measured. Pearson's correlation analysis was employed to analyze the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) score and its association with FA of different tracts.\nWhen compared with healthy volunteers, early PD patients had reduced FA in the following areas: bilateral anterior corona radiate, upper corona radiate, fasciculus arcuatus, crus anterius capsulae internae, crus posterius capsulae internae, capsula externa, posterior thalamic radiation, optic radiation, sagittal layer (including fasciculus arcuatus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus), crura fornicis, stria terminalis, fornix, genu, body and pad of corpus callosum, left unciform fasciculus, right cingulate bundle, right medipeduncle, and arcuate fibers in the bilateral frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). When compared with healthy volunteers, early PD patients showed abnormal FA of fasciculus in the white matter mainly in following areas: bilateral crus anterius capsulae internae, bilateral capsula externa, right anterior corona radiate, body and pad of bilateral corpus callosum, and left sagittal layer (including fasciculi longitudinalis inferior and fasciculus occipitofrontalis inferior) (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). In addition, in early PD patients, the UPDRS score and movement score had no relationship with the FA of different fasciculi in the white matter (P\u202f>\u202f0.05).\nThere is wide alteration of white matter microstructure in early PD patients, which is characterized by disruption of projection fibers in the descending pathway, limbic system-related fasciculi, corpus callosum, thalamus after radiation, posterior thalamic radiation, Gratiolet's bundle and other fasciculi in the white matter.",

    "abstract": "Gait instability and muscle rigidity are known characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD), putting PD patients at risk for complications following total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The outcomes of Parkinson's patients undergoing TJA are largely unknown. This study evaluated the outcomes of TJA in this population.\nA single institution retrospective cohort of 123 TJAs (52 hips, 71 knees) from 2000 to 2016 was reviewed. An electronic chart query was performed using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision codes to identify this population. A manual chart review was performed to confirm the diagnosis of PD, survivorship, and reason for failure. A control cohort was matched 2:1 based on age, body mass index, joint, and comorbidities. Outcomes were assessed using revision for any reason as the primary endpoint. Functional outcomes were assessed using Short-Form 12 scores.\nAt an average follow-up of 5.3 years, 23.6% of patients required revision surgery. The most common reasons for revision for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were periprosthetic infection and for total hip arthroplasty (THA) were periprosthetic fracture and dislocation. Overall survivorship of TJA at years 2, 5, and 10 respectively were 94.9%, 87.9%, and 72.3%. The survivorship of TKA was 95.2%, 89.8%, and 66.2%. THA implant survivorship was 94.3%, 85.3%, and 78.7%. Functional score improvement was less in PD cohort than the control.\nPatients with PD are at increased risk for complications, particularly periprosthetic infection following TKA and periprosthetic fracture and dislocation following THA. Despite this increased risk of complications, patients with PD can demonstrate improved functional outcomes but not as high as patients without PD. Patients with PD should be counseled appropriately prior to undergoing TJA.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be associated with both motoric (e.g., dyskinesias) and neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Examples of the latter include Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome (DDS) and impulse control disorder (ICD), which are separate but related behavioral/psychiatric complications of treatment in PD. Dysregulation of volition characterizes both dyskinesias and DDS/ICD; thus, we analyzed potential disease-related correlates in a large PD cohort.\nWe analyzed cross-sectional data from 654 participants collected through the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program. DDS/ICD symptoms and dyskinesias were assessed using the Movement Disorders Society (revised) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Potential associated variables were selected from PD-validated or PD-specific scales of neuropsychiatric or motoric status. Multivariable models with DDS/ICD or dyskinesia presence outcomes were produced with backward stepwise regression to identify factors independently associated with DDS/ICD and/or dyskinesias.\nFifty-three (8.1%) participants endorsed DDS and/or ICD symptoms and 150 (22.9%) were dyskinetic. In multivariable analysis, psychosis was independently associated with both dyskinesias (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and DDS/ICD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Unpredictable motor fluctuations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026) and depression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) were also associated with DDS/ICD; female sex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), low tremor score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and high akinesia-rigidity score (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were associated with dyskinesias.\nOur findings suggest that psychosis may be an important marker of impaired volition across motor and cognitive domains. Unpredictable motor fluctuations, psychosis, and depression may together comprise a phenotypic profile of patients at increased risk for DDS/ICD. Similarly, dyskinetic PD patients should be closely monitored for psychotic symptoms and treated appropriately.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease experience disabling non-motor symptoms, including autonomic dysfunction, cognitive decline, and sleep disorders. Pharmacologic treatments for these symptoms are often ineffective or have intolerable side effects. Therefore, non-pharmacologic interventions are an attractive alternative. Exercise in particular has the potential to alleviate the progressive impairment related to these non-motor symptoms. In this commentary, we explore available research that addresses the impact of exercise and physical activity on autonomic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease and suggest areas in need of further study. Many gaps remain in our understanding of the most effective exercise intervention for these symptoms, the mechanisms underlying exercise-induced changes, and the best way to monitor response to therapy. However, available research suggests that exercise is a promising approach to improve non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The ability to carry out two tasks at once is critical to effective functioning in the real world and deficits are termed Dual-task interference or effect-DTE. DTE substantially compromised the gait of subjects with Parkinson's disease and freezing of gait (PD\u2009+\u2009FOG), leading to exaggerated slowing, increasing gait dysrhythmicity, and inducing FOG episodes. This study aimed to investigate the DTE in gait variability of subjects with PD and freezing of gait (PD\u2009+\u2009FOG). Thirty-three patients with PD\u2009+\u2009FOG and 14 healthy individuals (REFERENCE) took part at this study. Two gait conditions were analyzed: usual walking (single task) and walking while taking the word-color Stroop test (dual task). The computed variables were as follows: gait velocity, step length, step timing, gait asymmetry, variability measures and DTE of each variable. The PD\u2009+\u2009FOG group has presented negative DTE values for all analyzed variables, indicating dual task cost. The REFERENCE group has presented dual-task benefits for step length standard deviation and step time. Differences between both groups and conditions were found for all variables, except for step time. Taking the word-color Stroop test while walking led to a larger dual-task cost in subjects with PD\u2009+\u2009FOG.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-synuclein) aggregation and impairment of the Ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) are implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. While zinc (Zn) induces dopaminergic neurodegeneration resulting in PD phenotype, its effect on protein aggregation and UPS has not yet been deciphered. The current study investigated the role of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and UPS in Zn-induced Parkinsonism. Additionally, levodopa (L-Dopa) response was assessed in Zn-induced Parkinsonian model to establish its closeness with idiopathic PD. Male Wistar rats were treated with zinc sulfate (Zn; 20\u00a0mg/kg; i.p.) twice weekly for 12 weeks along with respective controls. In few subsets, animals were subsequently treated with L-Dopa for 21 consecutive days following Zn exposure. A significant increase in total and free Zn content was observed in the substantia nigra of the brain of exposed groups. Zn treatment caused neurobehavioral anomalies, striatal dopamine decline, and dopaminergic neuronal cell loss accompanied with a marked increase in \u03b1-synuclein expression/aggregation and Ubiquitin-conjugated protein levels in the exposed groups. Zn exposure substantially reduced UPS-associated trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and caspase-like activities along with the expression of SUG1 and \u03b2-5 subunits of UPS in the nigrostriatal tissues of exposed groups. L-Dopa treatment rescued from Zn-induced neurobehavioral deficits and restored dopamine levels towards normalcy; however, Zn-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss, reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase expression, and increase in oxidative stress were unaffected. The results suggest that Zn caused UPS impairment, resulting in \u03b1-synuclein aggregation subsequently leading to dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and that Zn-induced Parkinsonism exhibited positive L-Dopa response similar to sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "Frontal/executive dysfunction commonly occurs in Parkinso's disease - Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI patients). However, to date, the number of studies comparing PD-MCI and MCI patients of other etiologies are too small. The present study aims at clarifying the attention/working memory and executive dysfunction of PD-MCI patients in comparison to amnestic MCI multiple domain patients with first extended then abbreviated structural brain changes suggesting preclinical Alzheimer's Disease.\n40 PD-MCI patients and 40 amnestic MCI multiple domain (aMCI+) patients were diagnosed according to the International guidelines. 22 healthy subjects were also recruited as control group. The groups were assessed by a wide neuropsychological battery, including measures of attention/working memory (Digit Span and Stroop Test), executive functions (Tower of London-Drexel Version -TOLDX- and Brixton Test), language (Boston Naming Test and Category Fluency), memory (Prose Recall and Pairs Associates Learning), and visuospatial function (Street's Completion Test and Constructive Apraxia Test). Performances were compared by non parametric tests. Spearman correlations were performed to explore association between neuropsychological measures of attention/working memory and executive functions in PD-MCI group.\nThe PD-MCI patients performed worse on Digit Span and Stroop Interference/Error than aMCI+ and controls. AMCI+ patients, in turn, showed a greater deficit on TOLDX Initiation Time and on Violation Time than PD-MCI and controls. Both PD-MCI and aMCI+ patients reported lower scores on Stroop Interference/Time than controls. Moreover, aMCI+ patients performed worse then controls on Brixton Test. Positive correlations between Digit Span and Stroop Interference/Error, Stroop Interference/Error and TOLDX Execution Time, Total Time and Violation Time, Stroop Interference Time and TOLDX Move Score and Total Time were found in PD-MCI group.\nPD-MCI patients mainly present a conscious attention defect and an inhibitory control deficit than aMCI+. PD-MCI patients with deficits in attention/working memory domain should undergo specific cognitive trainings in order to improve cognitive abilities and prevent Parkinson's Disease Dementia onset.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and debilitating symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). The current study investigated alterations of resting-state spontaneous brain activity in PD patients with FOG. A total of 29 patients with FOG, 28 patients without FOG and 31 controls were included. All subjects underwent resting-state functional MRI, and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was calculated to measure the spontaneous brain activity. Between-group differences and correlations with FOG severity (both subjective and objective measures) were analyzed. Compared to those without FOG, patients with FOG showed increased ALFF in right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), as well as decreased ALFF in right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), bilateral cerebellum and left thalamus. Correlation analyses demonstrated that ALFF within the right SFG, right ACC and bilateral pallidum were positively correlated with FOG; while ALFF within the thalamus, putamen, cerebellum and sensorimotor regions were negatively correlated. Our results indicate that FOG is associated with dysfunction within frontal-parietal regions, along with increased inhibitory outputs from basal ganglia. Additionally, altered activity of cerebellum implicates its role in the pathophysiology of FOG. These findings provide further insight into the underlying neural mechanisms of FOG in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "We examined whether exposure to mild hyperbaric oxygen inhibits the decrease of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of a neurotoxic animal model with Parkinson's disease. Mice injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride and probenecid twice a week were divided into two groups: mice with mild hyperbaric oxygen and those without. The mice with mild hyperbaric oxygen were exposed to 1317hPa with 45% oxygen for 3h, three times a week. The decrease in dopaminergic neurons of mice with Parkinson's disease was inhibited by 11 weeks of exposure to mild hyperbaric oxygen. We conclude that exposure to mild hyperbaric oxygen is effective in preventing the progression of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The aberrant accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) is believed to contribute to the onset and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) is responsible for the high capacity clearance of \u03b1-syn. ALP dysfunction is documented in PD and pre-clinical evidence suggests that inhibiting the ALP promotes the pathological accumulation of \u03b1-syn. We previously identified the pathological accumulation of \u03b1-syn in the brains of mice deficient for the soluble lysosomal enzyme alpha-Galactosidase A (\u03b1-Gal A), a member of the glycosphingolipid metabolism pathway. In the present study, we quantified \u03b1-Gal A activity and levels of its glycosphingolipid metabolites in postmortem temporal cortex specimens from control individuals and in PD individuals staged with respect to \u03b1-syn containing Lewy body pathology. In late-state PD temporal cortex we observed significant decreases in \u03b1-Gal A activity and the 46kDa \"active\" species of \u03b1-Gal A as determined respectively by fluorometric activity assay and western blot analysis. These decreases in \u03b1-Gal A activity/levels correlated significantly with increased \u03b1-syn phosphorylated at serine 129 (p129S-\u03b1-syn) that was maximal in late-stage PD temporal cortex.

It is characterised by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which results in dopamine depletion, leading to a number of motor and non-motor symptoms.\nIn recent years, the development of new animal models using nuclease-based genome-editing technology (ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) has enabled the introduction of custom-made modifications into the genome to replicate key features of PD, leading to significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease.\nWe review the most recent studies on this new generation of in vitro and in vivo PD models, which replicate the most relevant symptoms of the disease and enable better understanding of the aetiology and mechanisms of PD. This may be helpful in the future development of effective treatments to halt or slow disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Dystonia is occasionally found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonisms. However, systematic comparative analysis of the association between dystonia and parkinsonism have seldom been reported. The goals of this study are to compare the clinical characteristics and distributions of dystonia between PD, multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD).\nWe prospectively enrolled 176 patients who presented with dystonia and parkinsonism out of 1278 patients with parkinsonism. We analyzed the clinical features of dystonia and parkinsonism.\nThe frequencies of dystonia were 11.0% in PD, 20.9% in MSA, 40.7% in PSP and 66.7% in CBD. Dystonia symptoms were most frequent in CBD and relatively more frequent in PSP and MSA (p<0.001). Moreover, multiple types of dystonia occurred most frequently in MSA (p=0.034). According to the distribution of dystonia, cranio-facial dystonia (CFD) and cervical dystonia (CD) were more frequently observed in atypical parkinsonism (p=0.001). In contrast, limb dystonia (LD) was more frequently observed in both PD and CBD, and truncal dystonia (TD) was more frequently detected in PD (p<0.001). Levodopa medication related dystonia was markedly more frequent in PD than in atypical parkinsonism (p=0.030).\nIn this long-term, observational, prospective study, we concluded that levodopa medication related LD and TD were more frequently observed in PD than in atypical parkinsonism. Conversely, levodopa medication non-related CFD and CD were more frequently observed in atypical parkinsonism, and coexisting of some types of multiple dystonia may be unique features of atypical parkinsonism. TD or multiple types of LD, might be representative of PD rather than atypical parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD is widely used to study the progression of this disease. Behavior impairment is closely related to the damage of the dopaminergic system in the basal ganglia. Here, MPTP-induced changes in mouse behavior and glial activation were evaluated at different time points after the treatment and the long-term changes in the nigrostriatal pathway were analyzed. We found that mice exposed to MPTP displayed a full recovery in the rotarod test and the pole test but not in the wire hanging test at 65\u202fdays post-injection. A biphasic activation of microglial cells was revealed in the nigrostriatal pathway of MPTP-treated mice. However, activation of astrocytes displayed an approximately bell-shaped kinetics and an approximately S-shaped kinetics in the striatum and the substantia nigra, respectively. In addition, the numbers of complement component 3 (C3)-positive neurotoxic astrocytes in the substantia nigra of MPTP-treated mice increased with time and reached a maximum at 42\u202fdays, and declined at 74\u202fdays, after the treatment. Three months later, the dopaminergic system was partially recovered from the lesion of MPTP. The time course of pathophysiological events has important implications for the interventions or treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Orthostatic hypotension (OH) represents a frequent yet overlooked source of disability in Parkinson disease (PD). In particular, its impact on health care utilization has been insufficiently examined. We sought to determine the differential health care utilization in PD patients with (PDOH+) and without OH (PDOH-).\nWe quantified the emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, outpatient clinic evaluations, phone calls, and e-mails from PD patients on whom supine and orthostatic blood pressure (BP) measurements were obtained during routine clinical practice between June 2013 and July 2016. Comparative costs between PDOH+ and PDOH- were adjusted for age, disease duration, motor severity, levodopa equivalent daily dose, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment.\nFrom a total of 317 PD patients, 29.3% were classified as PDOH+ (n\u00a0=\u00a093) and 70.6% as PDOH- (n\u00a0=\u00a0224) over 30.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.0 months, in which there were 247 hospitalizations, 170\u00a0ER visits, 2386 outpatient evaluations, and 4747 telephone calls/e-mails. After-adjusting for relevant covariates, PDOH+ was associated with more hospitalization days (+285%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.041), ER visits (+152%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.045), and telephone calls/e-mails than PDOH- (+142%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). The overall health care-related cost in PDOH+ was 2.5-fold higher than for PDOH- ($25,205\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0$6546 vs. $9831\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0$4167/person/year; p\u00a0=\u00a00.037).\nOH increases health care utilization in PD independently from age, disease duration, motor severity, dopaminergic treatment, and cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "Neurosurgical interventions have been used to treat PD for over a century. We examined the changing landscape of surgery for PD to appraise the value of various procedures in the context of advances in our understanding and technology. We assessed the number of articles published on neurosurgical procedures for PD over time as an albeit imprecise surrogate for their usage level. We identified over 8,000 publications associated with PD surgery. Over half the publications were on DBS. The field of DBS for PD showed a rapid rise in articles, but is now in a steady state. Thalamotomy and, to a lesser extent, pallidotomy follow a biphasic publication distribution with peaks approximately 30 years apart. Articles on gene therapy and transplantation experienced initial rapid rises and significant recent declines. Procedures using novel technologies, including gamma knife and focused ultrasound, are emerging, but are yet to have significant impact as measured by publication numbers. Pallidotomy and thalamotomy are prominent examples of procedures that were popular, declined, and re-emerged and redeclined. Transplantation and gene therapy have never broken into clinical practice. DBS overtook all procedures as the dominant surgical intervention and drove widespread use of surgery for PD. Notwithstanding, the number of DBS articles appears to have plateaued. As advances continue, emerging treatments may compete with DBS in the future. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Consensus criteria for classifying tremor disorders were published by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society in 1998. Subsequent advances with regard to essential tremor, tremor associated with dystonia, and other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors make a significant revision necessary.\nConvene an international panel of experienced investigators to review the definition and classification of tremor.\nComputerized MEDLINE searches in January 2013 and 2015 were conducted using a combination of text words and MeSH terms: \"tremor\", \"tremor disorders\", \"essential tremor\", \"dystonic tremor\", and \"classification\" limited to human studies. Agreement was obtained using consensus development methodology during four in-person meetings, two teleconferences, and numerous manuscript reviews.\nTremor is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part and is classified along two axes: Axis 1-clinical characteristics, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution), tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition), associated signs (systemic, neurological), and laboratory tests (electrophysiology, imaging); and Axis 2-etiology (acquired, genetic, or idiopathic). Tremor syndromes, consisting of either isolated tremor or tremor combined with other clinical features, are defined within Axis 1. This classification scheme retains the currently accepted tremor syndromes, including essential tremor, and provides a framework for defining new syndromes.\nThis approach should be particularly useful in elucidating isolated tremor syndromes and syndromes consisting of tremor and other signs of uncertain significance. Consistently defined Axis 1 syndromes are needed to facilitate the elucidation of specific etiologies in Axis 2. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

Tremor syndromes, consisting of either isolated tremor or tremor combined with other clinical features, are defined within Axis 1. This classification scheme retains the currently accepted tremor syndromes, including essential tremor, and provides a framework for defining new syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Whether systemic manganese (Mn) dysfunctions in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is still under ongoing debate. The recent reported studies on the circulating Mn levels in PD showed inconsistent results. A meta-analysis study was conducted to evaluate the association of circulating Mn levels with PD, and to clarify whether Mn should be considered as a potential risk factor for PD. A systematic searching was performed based on PubMed, web of science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Finally, 22 studies were identified, involving 637 PD patients and 802 health controls (HC) individuals for serum Mn, 1258 PD patients and 1304 HC individuals for peripheral blood Mn, and 195 PD patients and 196 HC individuals for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Mn. Forest plots were adopted to represent the comparison of the groups by assessing standardized mean difference with random effects model. This meta-analysis revealed a significantly increased serum Mn levels in PD patients (SMD=0.78; 95% CI [0.32, 1.24]; P=0.001), and it was further confirmed when serum, plasma and whole blood studies were analyzed together (SMD=0.58; 95% CI [0.25, 0.91]; P=0.001). Instead, no significant differences of CSF Mn were observed between PD patients and HC individuals (SMD=-0.09; 95% CI [-0.47, 0.29]; P=0.644). These results supported the notion that elevated Mn level should be a potential risk factor for PD, although the high heterogeneity and methodological limitations recommended caution in the interpretations for the present findings.",

    "abstract": "Numerous published case-control studies have investigated a role of PARK16 gene in susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD), but the results remain conflicting and under-powered. Herein, we performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the possible association between the polymorphism of the PARK16 rs8231128 (A/G) and PD.A comprehensive search of six databases was conducted to identify all case-control studies involving PARK16rs823128variants and PD risk up to August 2017. The strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. A total of 9 studies including 15 case-control studies with 7277 PD cases and 6188 controls were included in the meta-analysis. And STATA 12.0 statistics software was used to calculate available data from each study. The crude odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the genetic association between PARK16 rs823128 polymorphism and the risk of PD. In the combined analysis, results showed a significant association between rs823128 and PD in allelic model(G vs. A: OR=0.886, 95% CI=0.811-0.969, P=0.008), dominant model (GG+ AG vs. AA: OR=0.886, 95% CI=0.804-0.976, P=0.014), and heterozygote model (AG vs. AA: OR=0.897, 95% CI=0.812-0.991, P=0.032). Further, ethnicity based analysis showed a significant association in Asian and Chilean population, but not in Caucasian samples. Within its limitations, this meta-analysis demonstrated that the rs823128 variants(G allele, GA and GG genotype)in PARK16 might be a potential protective factor for PD. However, these associations vary in different ethnicities.",

    "abstract": "Dyskinesia is a known side-effect of the treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD). We examined the influence of haplotypes in three dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD2 and DRD3) and the Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) on dyskinesia.\nPatient data were drawn from a population-based case-control study. We included 418 patients with confirmed diagnoses by movement disorder specialists, using levodopa and a minimum three years disease duration at the time of assessment. Applying Haploview and Phase, we created haploblocks for DRD1-3 and BDNF. Risk scores for DRD2 and DRD3 were generated. We calculated risk ratios using Poisson regression with robust error variance.\nThere was no difference in dyskinesia prevalence among carriers of various haplotypes in DRD1. However, one haplotype in each DRD2 haploblocks was associated with a 29 to 50% increase in dyskinesia risk. For each unit increase in risk score, we observed a 16% increase in dyskinesia risk for DRD2 (95%CI: 1.05-1.29) and a 17% (95%CI: 0.99-1.40) increase for DRD3. The BDNF haploblock was not associated, but the minor allele of the rs6265 SNP was associated with dyskinesia (adjusted RR 1.31 (95%CI: 1.01-1.70)).\nCarriers of DRD2 risk haplotypes and possibly the BDNF variants rs6265 and DRD3 haplotypes, were at increased risk of dyskinesia, suggesting that these genes may be involved in dyskinesia related pathomechanisms. PD patients with these genetic variants might be prime candidates for treatments aiming to prevent or delay the onset of dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "This study has evaluated the action of flavonoid hesperidin on the neurotoxic effects caused by the intake of iron (Fe) in Drosophila melanogaster. Male adult flies, aged 1-3 days, have been divided into four groups of 50 each: (1) control, (2) Hsd 10\u00a0\u03bcM, (3) Fe 20\u00a0mM (4) Hsd 10\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0+\u00a0Fe 20\u00a0mM. During the exposure protocol, the flies have been exposed to a diet containing Hsd and/or Fe for 48\u00a0h. The survival and behavioral analyses have been carried out in vivo, and ex vivo. The analyses involved acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and Fe levels in the flies' heads and bodies and determination of dopaminergic levels, cellular and mitochondrial viability, activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), reactive species levels (RS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and contents of total thiols and non-proteic thiols (NPSH) in the flies' heads. A significant negative correlation between Fe levels in the head of the flies and the survival, dopamine levels and antioxidant enzymes in the head of the flies has been found. Additionally, significant positive correlation between Fe levels in the head of the flies with negative geotaxis RS and AChE activity in the head of the flies has been found. It demonstrates that the flies which had higher levels of Fe in their heads have demonstrated more susceptibility to neurotoxicity. An important result from our study is that Hsd treatment promotes a decrease in Fe concentration in the head, restores dopamine levels and cholinergic activity of the flies and improves motor function caused by Fe. Hsd also ameliorates Fe induced mortality, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results have demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of Hsd and it suggests that flavonoid acts in different ways to protect against the Parkinson disease caused by Fe exposure such as the direct scavenging of RS and activation of antioxidant enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to identify risk factors for mortality in a community-based cohort of nondemented patients with Parkinson disease (PD) during prospective long-term follow-up, while also comparing the effect of motor complications to nonmotor symptoms (NMS) on risk of mortality.\nOne hundred forty seven nondemented patients with PD (57.1% males; 70.9 \u00b1 8.6 years old) were included in this 48 month follow-up, longitudinal, single, evaluation study. Motor and therapy-related complications were assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale/part-IV (UPDRS-IV). Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) total score was used to assess NMS burden. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to identify independent predictors of mortality during follow-up.\nTwenty-two patients of 146 (15.1%) died (1 case without information). Both UPDRS-IV and NMSS total scores were higher at baseline in patients with PD who died (3.5 \u00b1 3.1 vs 2.4 \u00b1 2.4, P = .049 and 96.9 \u00b1 58.6 vs 61.9 \u00b1 51.0, P = .004, respectively). Unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) associated with UPDRS-IV and NMSS total scores among those who died during follow-up were 1.171 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.012-1.357; P = .035) and 1.008 (95% CI: 1.002-1.013; P = .006), respectively. Independent predictors of mortality during follow-up after adjusting for other covariates were UPDRS-IV (HR: 1.224; 95% CI: 1.002-1.494; P = .047), age (HR: 1.231; 95% CI: 1104-1.374; P < .0001), and comorbidity (Charlson Index; HR: 1.429; 95% CI: 1.023-1.994; P = .036), but not NMSS total score (HR: 1.005; 95% CI: 0.996-1.014; P = .263).\nBoth motor complications (UPDRS-IV) and NMS (NMSS) were associated with mortality at 4 years, being motor complications an independent predictor of it.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disease affecting over 6 million people worldwide. Loss of dopamine-producing neurons results in a range of both motor and non-motor symptoms, however there is currently no definitive test for PD by non-specialist clinicians, especially in the early disease stages where the symptoms may be subtle and poorly characterised. This results in a high misdiagnosis rate (up to 25% by non-specialists) and people can have the disease for many years before diagnosis. There is a need for a more accurate, objective means of early detection, ideally one which can be used by individuals in their home setting. In this investigation, keystroke timing information from 103 subjects (comprising 32 with mild PD severity and the remainder non-PD controls) was captured as they typed on a computer keyboard over an extended period and showed that PD affects various characteristics of hand and finger movement and that these can be detected. A novel methodology was used to classify the subjects' disease status, by utilising a combination of many keystroke features which were analysed by an ensemble of machine learning classification models. When applied to two separate participant groups, this approach was able to successfully discriminate between early-PD subjects and controls with 96% sensitivity, 97% specificity and an AUC of 0.98. The technique does not require any specialised equipment or medical supervision, and does not rely on the experience and skill of the practitioner. Regarding more general application, it currently does not incorporate a second cardinal disease symptom, so may not differentiate PD from similar movement-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "l-Dopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, is the treatment of choice for the symptomatic relief of the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. The oral bioavailability of l-dopa, however, is only about 10% to 30%, and less than 1% of the oral dose is estimated to reach the brain unchanged. l-Dopa's physicochemical properties are responsible for its poor bioavailability, short half-life and the wide range of inter- and intrapatient variations of plasma levels. An l-dopa-lazabemide prodrug is proposed to overcome the problems associated with l-dopa absorption. Lazabemide is a monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor, a class of compounds that slows the depletion of dopamine stores in Parkinson's disease and elevates dopamine levels produced by exogenously administered l-dopa. l-Dopa was linked at the carboxylate with the primary aminyl functional group of lazabemide via an amide, a strategy which is anticipated to protect l-dopa against peripheral decarboxylation and possibly also enhance the membrane permeability of the prodrug. Selected physicochemical and biochemical properties of the prodrug were determined and included lipophilicity (logD), solubility, passive diffusion permeability, p",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent chronic neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, following Alzheimer's disease. Along with the characteristic motor symptoms of the disorder, especially bradykinesia, cognitive deficits can often be found prior to the onset of the disorder. These mainly concern executive functioning. To detect cognitive deficits at an early stage, initial screening procedures are recommended. The new cognitive rapid test Paarassoziationslernen-5 (\"PAL-5\") has been developed to detect the most prevalent cognitive symptoms - namely executive impairments - of PD patients. It consists of a direct recall of five incompatible and newly jointed word pairs (capitals vs. countries), an intermediate formal lexical word fluency task (\"FAS-Test\") and a delayed recall. Thereby, the three major executive functioning processes are tested: cognitive flexibility, inhibition and memory. In the department of neurology of the University Clinic of Cologne, the PAL-5 was completed by 154 PD patients, 115 participants with cognitive deficits without a PD diagnosis and 115 controls (N = 384) between 2014 and 2016. For purposes of retest reliability determination, another 42 controls were examined from February to July 2017, with a four-month time interval between the initial and second test. Highly significant group differences have been found. PD patients and cognitive impaired participants scored significantly lower than the control group. A comparison of PD patients and cognitively impaired participants did not reveal significant group differences. Additionally, a moderate to high correlation between PAL-5 and MMST as well as PAL-5 and PANDA was found (respectively p\u2005<\u2005.001). An ROC analysis of the PAL-5 total score of PD patients with a score lower than 11 showed an AUC of .91. Therefore, a cut-off of\u2005\u2264\u200510 seems to be practicable to detect cognitive deficits - especially executive functioning deficits and memory impairments - in PD patients. It has been shown that cognitive flexibility, inhibition and memory is a short useful combination for a screening procedure of PD patients.\nMorbus Parkinson ist nach der Demenz vom Alzheimer-Typ die zweith\u00e4ufigste chronische neurodegenerative Erkrankung weltweit. Neben den charakteristischen motorischen Symptomen der Krankheit, insbesondere der Bradykinese, treten h\u00e4ufig bereits vor Beginn der Erkrankung leichte kognitive Beeintr\u00e4chtigungen (PD-MCI) auf, die vor allem die Exekutivfunktionen betreffen. Um solche kognitiven Beeintr\u00e4chtigungen fr\u00fchzeitig zu erkennen, ist initial die Durchf\u00fchrung eines Screenings w\u00fcnschenswert. Der neu entwickelte kognitive Schnelltest Paarassoziationslernen-5 (\u201ePAL-5\u201c) wurde konzipiert, um die Leitsymptomatik kognitiver St\u00f6rungen \u2013 n\u00e4mlich exekutive Beeintr\u00e4chtigungen \u2013 bei Parkinson-Patienten zu erkennen. Dieser besteht aus einem unmittelbaren Abruf von f\u00fcnf inkompatiblen und neu zusammengef\u00fcgten Wortpaaren (Hauptst\u00e4dte vs. L\u00e4nder), einer intermedi\u00e4ren formallexikalischen Wortfl\u00fcssigkeitsaufgabe (\u201eFAS-Test\u201c) und einem anschlie\u00dfenden verz\u00f6gerten Abruf. Damit werden die drei Kernprozesse exekutiver Funktionen getestet: kognitive Flexibilit\u00e4t, Inhibition und Ged\u00e4chtnis. An der Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Neurologie der Universit\u00e4tsklinik K\u00f6ln wurde der PAL-5 in den Jahren von 2014 bis 2016 insgesamt an 154 Parkinson-Patienten, 115 kognitiv Beeintr\u00e4chtigten ohne Parkinson-Diagnose und 115 Kontrollprobanden durchgef\u00fchrt (N = 384). F\u00fcr eine Retest-Reliabilit\u00e4tsbestimmung wurden au\u00dferdem weitere 42 Kontrollprobanden herangezogen, die im Zeitraum von Februar bis Juli 2017, in einem Abstand von jeweils vier Monaten zwischen der ersten und zweiten Testung, untersucht wurden. Es stellten sich hochsignifikante Gruppenunterschiede in den Subtests des PAL-5 heraus. Parkinson-Patienten sowie kognitiv Beeintr\u00e4chtigte schnitten signifikant schlechter ab als die Kontrollprobanden. Zwischen den Parkinson-Patienten und kognitiv Beeintr\u00e4chtigten gab es keine signifikanten Gruppenunterschiede in den Testscores. Au\u00dferdem zeigten sich mittelhohe bis hohe Korrelationen zwischen PAL-5 und MMST sowie PAL-5 und PANDA (jeweils p\u2005<\u20050,001). In der ROC-Analyse f\u00fcr den PAL-5-Gesamtwert bei Parkinson-Patienten mit einem Score von weniger als 11 Punkten zeigte sich eine AUC von 0,91. Ein Summenscore von\u2005\u2264\u200510 scheint daher praktikabel zu sein, um kognitive Defizite \u2013 vor allem exekutive Funktionsst\u00f6rungen und Ged\u00e4chtnisbeeintr\u00e4chtigungen \u2013 bei Parkinsonerkrankten zu erkennen. Es hat sich gezeigt, dass die Kombination von kognitiver Flexibilit\u00e4t, Inhibition und Ged\u00e4chtnis eine kurze sinnvolle Zusammenstellung f\u00fcr ein Screeningverfahren von Parkinson-Patienten ist.",

Although the most common delusional misidentification is Capgras syndrome, in which the sufferer believes a familiar person has been replaced by an identical imposter, other forms have been also described. The pathogenesis of delusions of misidentification appears to require dysfunction of or connection to a left cerebral cortical area involved in recognition of familiarity, and also right frontal cortex serving belief evaluation. Two cases of Parkinson's disease with an unusual delusional misidentification, intermetamorphosis, are presented, along with their improvement with pimavanserin, a novel atypical antipsychotic medication.",

    "abstract": "In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a first-in-class atypical antipsychotic medication called pimavanserin for the treatment of Parkinson disease psychosis (PDP). We aim to inform readers about its indications, effectiveness, and safety profile.\nPimavanserin acts as an inverse agonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and has negligible effects on other receptors, thereby avoiding the D2 receptor antagonism that can potentially worsen motor symptoms. Its FDA approval was based primarily on the results of a single randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial.\nWhile pimavanserin appears to be a safe, effective, and well-tolerated therapeutic option for PDP, additional clinical trials and open-label extension studies are needed to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of this promising therapy. In the meantime, prescribers need to be aware of the possible adverse effects of pimavanserin including QT interval prolongation and a potential to cause a paradoxical worsening of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Blogs have become a major venue of information sharing and emotional release for people worldwide. Illness blogs are a specific type of blog in which patients describe their experience with illness and coping with disease. Illness blog research has been conducted on several disorders; however, blogs by Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have been neglected.\nTo categorize the characteristics of PD patients from blogs and explore whether we can learn about the medical issues with which they are most concerned, as conveyed through their blog posts.\nUsing located PD patients' blogs, we analyzed the contents of 78 blogs, and employed thematic analysis of eight arbitrarily selected blogs.\nThe majority of blog authors in our sample (N=78) were from the United States (42%). The number of blogs written by male and female authors was fairly similar: 49% and 44%, respectively, while gender was unknown for 7%. Blogs were written by both early- and late-onset PD patients. The thematic analysis revealed five major themes: diagnosis, symptoms, treatment, coping mechanisms, and information.\nThematic analysis of blogs by PD patients provided considerable information and insight regarding the experience of these patients, which is significant to other patients and their families, as well as to medical professionals. Further qualitative studies of larger blog samples utilizing data mining techniques are needed to further explore the subjective experiences of patients.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the autonomic neural function in Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) with head-up tilt test and spectral analysis of cardiovascular parameters. This study included 15 patients with MSA, 15 patients with PD, and 29 healthy control (HC) subjects. High frequency power of the RR interval (RR-HF), the ratio of low frequency power of RR interval to RR-HF (RR-LF/HF) and LF power of systolic BP were used to evaluate parasympathetic, cardiac sympathetic and vasomotor sympathetic functions, respectively. Both patients with PD and MSA showed orthostatic hypotension and lower parasympathetic function (RR-HF) at tilt position as compared to HC subjects. Cardiac sympathetic function (RR-LF/HF) was significantly high in patients with PD than MSA at supine position. RR-LF/HF tended to increase in MSA and HC, but decreased in PD by tilting. Consequently, the change of the ratio due to tilting (\u0394RR-LF/HF) was significantly lower in patients with PD than in HC subjects. Further analysis showed that compared to mild stage of PD, RR-LF/HF at the supine position was significantly higher in advanced stage. By tilting, it was increased in mild stage and decreased in the advanced stage of PD, causing \u0394RR-LF/HF to decrease significantly in the advanced stage. Thus, we demonstrated that spectral analysis of cardiovascular parameters is useful to identify sympathetic and parasympathetic disorders in MSA and PD. High cardiac sympathetic function at the supine position, and its reduction by tilting might be a characteristic feature of PD, especially in the advanced stage.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prime example of a complex and heterogeneous disorder, characterized by multifaceted and varied motor- and non-motor symptoms and different possible interplays of genetic and environmental risk factors. While investigations of individual PD-causing mutations and risk factors in isolation are providing important insights to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind PD, there is a growing consensus that a more complete understanding of these mechanisms will require an integrative modeling of multifactorial disease-associated perturbations in molecular networks. Identifying and interpreting the combinatorial effects of multiple PD-associated molecular changes may pave the way towards an earlier and reliable diagnosis and more effective therapeutic interventions. This review provides an overview of computational systems biology approaches developed in recent years to study multifactorial molecular alterations in complex disorders, with a focus on PD research applications. Strengths and weaknesses of different cellular pathway and network analyses, and multivariate machine learning techniques for investigating PD-related omics data are discussed, and strategies proposed to exploit the synergies of multiple biological knowledge and data sources. A final outlook provides an overview of specific challenges and possible next steps for translating systems biology findings in PD to new omics-based diagnostic tools and targeted, drug-based therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Whereas hemispheric dominance is well-established for appendicular motor control in humans, the evidence for dominance in axial motor control is still scarce. In Parkinson's disease (PD), unilateral (UL) onset of appendicular motor symptoms corresponds with asymmetric neurodegeneration predominantly affecting contralateral nigrostriatal circuits. Disease progression yields bilateral and axial motor symptoms but the initial appendicular asymmetry usually persists. Furthermore, there is evidence for hemispheric dominance for axial motor dysfunction in some of these patients. Dopaminergic medications improve appendicular symptoms but can also produce motor complications over time. Once these complications develop, bilateral (BL) deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nuclei (STN) can significantly improve appendicular symptoms while reducing medication doses and motor complications. Conversely, axial motor symptoms remain a significant source of disability, morbidity, and mortality for patients with PD. These axial symptoms do not necessarily improve with dopaminergic therapy, might not respond, and could even worsen after BL-DBS. In contrast to medications, DBS provides the opportunity to modify stimulation parameters for each cerebral hemisphere. Identical, BL-DBS of motor circuits with hemispheric dominance in PD might produce overstimulation on one side and/or understimulation on the other side, which could contribute to motor dysfunction. Several studies based on asymmetry of appendicular motor symptoms already support an initial UL rather than BL approach to DBS in some patients. The response of axial motor symptoms to UL versus BL-DBS remains unclear. Nonetheless, UL-DBS, staged BL-DBS, or asymmetric programming of BL-DBS could also be considered in patients with PD.",

We aimed to extract global motor performance measures covering different everyday motor tasks, as a function of a clinical intervention, i.e., deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus.\nWe followed a data-driven, machine-learning approach and propose performance measures that employ Random Forests with probability distributions. We applied this method to 14 PD patients with DBS switched-off or -on, and 26 healthy control subjects performing the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), the Functional Reach Test (FRT), a hand coordination task, walking 10-m straight, and a 90\u00b0 curve.\nFor each motor task, a Random Forest identified a specific set of metrics that optimally separated PD off DBS from healthy subjects. We noted the highest accuracy (94.6%) for standing up. This corresponded to a sensitivity of 91.5% to detect a PD patient off DBS, and a specificity of 97.2% representing the rate of correctly identified healthy subjects. We then calculated performance measures based on these sets of metrics and applied those results to characterize symptom severity in different motor tasks. Task-specific symptom severity measures correlated significantly with each other and with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, part III, correlation of \nThe close correlation of PD patients' various motor abnormalities quantified by different, task-specific severity measures suggests that these abnormalities are only facets of the underlying one-dimensional severity of motor deficits. The identification and characterization of this underlying motor deficit may help to optimize therapeutic interventions, e.g., to \"automatically\" adapt DBS settings in PD patients.",

HCs were age-matched adults without any history of neurodegenerative disease or movement disorders. Retrospective data from the past 10 years (from January 2006 to December 2015) were obtained from the Hospital Information Management System, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. The measurements of pons area-midbrain area ratio (P/M) and MCP width-superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) width ratio (MCP/SCP) were used, and MRPI was calculated by the formula ([P/M]\u00d7[MCP/SCP]).\nMidbrain area and SCP width in patients with PSP (19 males, 15 females; mean age =66.7 years) were significantly (\nMRPI should be made an essential part of all MRI brain reporting whenever differentiation between PD and PSP is sought for.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. The reason for the death of these neurons is unclear; however, studies have demonstrated the potential involvement of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, \u03b1-synuclein or dopamine levels in contributing to cellular oxidative stress as well as PD symptoms. Even though those papers had separately described the individual roles of each element leading to neurodegeneration, recent publications suggest that neurodegeneration is the product of various cellular interactions. This review discusses the role of oxidative stress in mediating separate pathological events that together, ultimately result in cell death in PD. Understanding the multi-faceted relationships between these events, with oxidative stress as a common denominator underlying these processes, is needed for developing better therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Objective There is growing interest in investigating prospective memory (PM) functioning in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia because evidence suggests that PM may be impaired in this clinical population. This paper reviews current literature on PM functioning in PD patients with the aim of discussing (i) the potential contribution of executive and episodic memory disorders to PM impairments, (ii) whether PM impairment is an independent disorder in PD or whether it is a sign of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and (iii) the efficacy of cognitive interventions in treating PM disorders in these patients. Method A search of the relevant literature revealed 21 original research papers and five review/meta-analyses that directly investigated PM abilities in PD samples. Results Analysis of the reported data revealed that both executive functions and episodic memory are involved in the PM performance of patients with PD. Moreover, sparse evidence suggests that PM is not impaired in all PD patients but, rather, that PM deficits may be specifically associated with MCI. Finally, preliminary findings suggest that cognitive interventions may be effective in improving PM functioning in PD patients with MCI who present a well-established neuropsychological profile. Conclusions Although some shortcomings of the PM literature on PD patients prevent drawing firm conclusions, this review of current evidence highlights the importance of including PM assessment in the standard neuropsychological evaluation of patients with PD. Moreover, there are indications that ad hoc cognitive programs applied according to the qualitative cognitive profile of patients could improve their PM abilities.",

    "abstract": "Since anatomic MRI is presently not able to directly discern neuronal loss in Parkinson's Disease (PD), studying the associated functional connectivity (FC) changes seems a promising approach toward developing non-invasive and non-radioactive neuroimaging markers for this disease. While several groups have reported such FC changes in PD, there are also significant discrepancies between studies. Investigating the reproducibility of PD-related FC changes on independent datasets is therefore of crucial importance. We acquired resting-state fMRI scans for 43 subjects (27 patients and 16 normal controls, with 2 replicate scans per subject) and compared the observed FC changes with those obtained in two independent datasets, one made available by the PPMI consortium (91 patients, 18 controls) and a second one by the group of Tao Wu (20 patients, 20 controls). Unfortunately, PD-related functional connectivity changes turned out to be non-reproducible across datasets. This could be due to disease heterogeneity, but also to technical differences. To distinguish between the two, we devised a method to directly check for disease heterogeneity using random splits of a single dataset. Since we still observe non-reproducibility in a large fraction of random splits of the same dataset, we conclude that functional heterogeneity may be a dominating factor behind the lack of reproducibility of FC alterations in different rs-fMRI studies of PD. While global PD-related functional connectivity changes were non-reproducible across datasets, we identified a few individual brain region pairs with marginally consistent FC changes across all three datasets. However, training classifiers on each one of the three datasets to discriminate PD scans from controls produced only low accuracies on the remaining two test datasets. Moreover, classifiers trained and tested on random splits of the same dataset (which are technically homogeneous) also had low test accuracies, directly substantiating disease heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "While the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is incompletely understood, mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to play a crucial role in disease pathogenesis. Here, we examined the relationship between mitochondrial function and dopamine neuron dysfunction and death using C. elegans mutants for three mitochondria-related genes implicated in monogenic PD (pdr-1/PRKN, pink-1/PINK1 and djr-1.1/DJ-1). We found that pdr-1 and pink-1 mutants exhibit deficits in dopamine-dependent behaviors, but no loss of dopamine neurons, while djr-1.1 mutants showed an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. In examining mitochondrial morphology and function, we found that djr-1.1 mutants exhibit increased mitochondrial fragmentation leading to decreased rate of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP levels. pdr-1 and pink-1 mutants show an accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria with age, which leads to activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mitoUPR). Preventing the upregulation of the mitoUPR with a deletion in atfs-1 results in decreased lifespan and dopamine neuronal loss in pdr-1 and pink-1 mutants but not in wild-type worms. Overall, our results suggest that mutations in pdr-1 and pink-1 cause the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, which activates the mitoUPR to mitigate the detrimental effect of these mutations on dopamine neuron survival.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture combined with Madopar for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), compared to the use of Madopar alone.\nA systematic search was carried out for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture and Madopar for the treatment of PD published between April 1995 and April 2015. The primary outcome was total effectiveness rate and secondary outcomes included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores. Data were pooled and analysed with RevMan 5.3. Results were expressed as relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CIs).\nFinally, 11 RCTs with 831 subjects were included. Meta-analyses showed that acupuncture combined with Madopar for the treatment of PD can significantly improve the clinical effectiveness compared with Madopar alone (RR=1.28, 95%\u2009CI 1.18 to 1.38, P<0.001). It was also found that acupuncture combined with Madopar significantly improved the UPDRS II (SMD=-1.00, 95%\u2009CI -1.71 to -0.29, P=0.006) and UPDRS I-IV total summed scores (SMD=-1.15, 95%\u2009CI -1.63 to -0.67, P<0.001) but not UPDRS I (SMD=-0.37, 95%\u2009CI -0.77 to 0.02, P=0.06), UPDRS III (SMD=-0.93, 95%\u2009CI -2.28 to 0.41, P=0.17) or UPDRS IV (SMD=-0.78, 95%\u2009CI -2.24 to 0.68, P=0.30) scores. Accordingly, acupuncture combined with Madopar appeared to have a positive effect on activities of daily life and the general condition of patients with PD, but was not better than Madopar alone for the treatment of mental activity, behaviour, mood and motor disability. In the safety evaluation, it was found that acupuncture combined with Madopar was associated with significantly fewer adverse effects including gastrointestinal reactions (RR=0.38, 95%\u2009CI 0.23 to 0.65, P<0.001), on-off phenomena (RR=0.27, 95%\u2009CI 0.11 to 0.66, P=0.004) and mental disorders (RR=0.24, 95%\u2009CI 0.06 to 0.92, P=0.04) but did not significantly reduce dyskinesia (RR=0.64, 95%\u2009CI 0.35 to 1.16, P=0.14).\nAcupuncture combined with Madopar appears, to some extent, to improve clinical effectiveness and safety in the treatment of PD, compared with Madopar alone. This conclusion must be considered cautiously, given the quality of most of the studies included was low. Therefore, more high-quality, multicentre, prospective, RCTs with large sample sizes are needed to further clarify the effect of acupuncture combined with Madopar for PD.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms that contribute to gait asymmetry in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) are unclear, mainly during gait with greater environmental demand, such as when an obstacle is circumvented while walking.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the effects of obstacle circumvention of the least and most affected side on motor and gaze behavior in people with PD under/without the effects of dopaminergic medication.\nFifteen people with PD and 15 matched-control individuals were instructed to walk along a pathway, at a self-selected velocity, and to circumvent an obstacle, avoiding contact with it. Each participant performed five trials for each side. Kinematic parameters, mediolateral and horizontal body clearance to the obstacle, strategy to circumvent the obstacle, and gaze behavior were calculated. Parameters were grouped according to the side that the obstacle was circumvented and compared by three-way ANOVAs.\nBoth people with PD and the control group presented asymmetry to circumvent an obstacle during walking, however this was exacerbated in people with PD. Individuals with PD presented safe strategies (largest mediolateral and horizontal body clearance to the obstacle, \"lead-out\" strategy, and higher number and time of fixations on the obstacle) during obstacle circumvention for the least affected side compared to the most affected side. In addition, positive effects of dopaminergic medication on body clearance, spatial-temporal parameters, and gaze behavior were evidenced only when the obstacle was circumvented to the least affected side.\nThe obstacle circumvention to the most affected side is risky for people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) accumulation is considered a major risk factor for the development of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies. We have generated mice overexpressing full-length human \u03b1-Syn fused to a membrane-targeting signal sequence under the control of the mouse Thy1-promotor. Three separate lines (L56, L58 and L62) with similar gene expression levels, but considerably heightened protein accumulation in L58 and L62, were established. In L62, there was widespread labelling of \u03b1-Syn immunoreactivity in brain including spinal cord, basal forebrain, cortex and striatum. Interestingly, there was no detectable \u03b1-Syn expression in dopaminergic neurones of the substantia nigra, but strong human \u03b1-Syn reactivity in glutamatergic synapses. The human \u03b1-Syn accumulated during aging and formed PK-resistant, thioflavin-binding aggregates. Mice displayed early onset bradykinesia and age progressive motor deficits. Functional alterations within the striatum were confirmed: L62 showed normal basal dopamine levels, but impaired dopamine release (upon amphetamine challenge) in the dorsal striatum measured by in vivo brain dialysis at 9 months of age. This impairment was coincident with a reduced response to amphetamine in the activity test. L62 further displayed greater sensitivity to low doses of the dopamine receptor 1 (D1) agonist SKF81297 but reacted normally to the D2 agonist quinpirole in the open field. Since accumulation of \u03b1-Syn aggregates in neurones and synapses and alterations in the dopaminergic tone are characteristics of PD, phenotypes reported for L62 present a good opportunity to further our understanding of motor dysfunction in PD and Lewy body dementia.",

Effects of non-invasive cortical stimulation are short lived; transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may be useful to assess the suitability for invasive cortical stimulation. Direct cortical stimulation (DCS) is the method able to provide long-lasting effects in treatment of neuropathic pain and some symptoms of Parkinson's disease through the use of totally implantable systems that ensure a chronic stimulation.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to measure the effects of a dance training program on subjective and objective balance and gait measures in a person with Parkinson's disease.\nThe participant was measured via clinical scales and biomechanical balance and gait analyses pre- and post-16 weeks of dance participation at the University Center for Arts in Medicine. The dance program consisted of 75 minute sessions three days a week.\nImproved clinical scales included the Schwab and England scale (+10%), falls efficacy scale (-11 points), six-minute walk (+15.54m), and timed up and go (1.38s). Balance measures during three conditions (eyes open, eyes closed, and narrow stance) all demonstrated an increase (24-112%) in center of pressure path length, velocity (anteroposterior and mediolateral), sway area, and approximate entropy (anteroposterior and mediolateral). Spatiotemporal gait parameters improved during forward walking: velocity (+0.12m/s), cadence (+3.89steps/min), double support time (-2.02%), stride length (+0.07m), stride time (-0.03s), and backward walking: single support (+3.47%), double support (-7.0%), swing time (+3.4%), and stance time (-3.4%).\nClassic interpretation of the above measures may indicate a detriment in biomechanical balance effects concomitant with an improvement in gait. Alternative explanations explored suggest this paradox to be illusory.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurological disorder with many intractable consequences for patients and their family caregivers. Little is known about the possibilities that palliative care could offer to patients and their proxies. Guidelines strongly recommend palliative care to improve the quality of life and - if needed - the quality of dying. However, providing palliative care to persons with PD involves specific challenges. For example, a timely initiation of palliative interventions is difficult because due to the gradually progressive nature of PD, there is often no clear marker for the transition from curative towards palliative care. Furthermore, there is little evidence to indicate which palliative care interventions are effective. Here, we describe the contours of a study that aims to examine the experiences of patients, (bereaved) family caregivers and professionals, with the aim of improving our knowledge about palliative care needs in PD.\nWe will perform a mixed methods study to evaluate the experiences of patients, (bereaved) family caregivers and palliative care professionals. In this study, we focus on Quality of Life, Quality of Care, perceived symptoms, caregiver burden and collaboration between professionals. In phase 1, we will retrospectively explore the views of bereaved family caregivers and professionals by conducting individual interviews and focus group interviews. In phase 2, 5-15 patients with PD and their family caregiver will be followed prospectively for 8-12\u00a0months. Data collection will involve semi-structured interviews and questionnaires at three consecutive contact moments. Qualitative data will be audio recorded, transcribed and analyzed using CAQDAS. If patients pass away during the study period, a bereavement interview will be done with the closest family caregiver.\nThis study will offer a broad perspective on palliative care, and the results can be used to inform a palliative care protocol for patients with PD. By describing the experiences of patients, (bereaved) family caregivers and professionals with palliative care, this investigation will also establish an important ground for future intervention research.",

    "abstract": "Dysphagia is frequent and clinically highly relevant in Parkinson's disease (PD). For a rational dysphagia screening predictors are required. Previous investigations suggested that drooling correlates with dysphagia and may serve as its early sign. The aim of this study was to clarify the interrelationship of drooling and dysphagia.\nIn a controlled, cross-sectional, observational study, a total of 119 Parkinson outpatients and 32 controls were examined clinically and by flexible-endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Drooling, dysphagia including retained pharyngeal secretions, and cognitive function were assessed by established evaluation scales.\nFifty percent of all PD patients but only 9% of controls had drooling (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Drooling and dysphagia were related in PD (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027) but the data do not support to view drooling as a hallmark symptom for critical dysphagia. Thirty-nine percent of the patients with critical aspiration had no drooling. In contrast, 41% of the patients with severe drooling had no clinically relevant dysphagia in FEES. The oral, but not the pharyngeal secretion management was impaired in PD patients and there was no clear association between drooling and pharyngeal secretion accumulation. Cognitive impaired patients had significantly more drooling (P\u00a0=\u00a0.005).\nAlthough frequent in PD, drooling and dysphagia are only weakly related and drooling cannot be viewed as an early sign of dysphagia. Our data further suggest that the underlying cause of drooling is located in the voluntary oral phase, which is negatively influenced by cognitive deficits.",

    "abstract": "There is strong evidence of a key role for mitochondrial dysfunction in both sporadic and all forms of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). However, none of the clinical trials carried out with putative mitochondrial rescue agents have been successful. Firm establishment of a wet biomarker or a reliable readout from imaging studies detecting mitochondrial dysfunction and reflecting disease progression is also awaited. We will provide an overview of our current knowledge about mitochondrial dysfunction in PD and related drug screens. We will also summarise previously undertaken mitochondrial wet biomarker studies and relevant imaging studies with particular focus on 31P-MRI spectroscopy. We will conclude with an overview of clinical trials which tested putative mitochondrial rescue agents in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. Mutations in the DJ-1, including L166P, are responsible for recessive early-onset PD. Many lines of evidence have shown that L166P is not only a loss-of-function mutant, but also a pro-apoptotic-like protein that results in mitochondrial dysfunction. L166P has been reported to be unstable and to mislocalize to mitochondria. However, the mechanisms underlying the instability of L166P compared to wild-type DJ-1 remain largely unknown. Here, we showed that Omi/HtrA2, a mitochondrial serine protease that has also been linked to the pathogenesis of PD, contributed to L166P instability. Omi directly interacted with and cleaved L166P in mitochondria to decrease the L166P level. However, Omi did not bind and cleave wild-type DJ-1. Moreover, Omi cleaved L166P at both serine residues 3 and 121, while L166P-induced cell death under H",

Research in this field has gained recent interest among clinicians and scientists and is rapidly evolving. This review is dedicated to sleep and circadian dysfunction associated with PD.\nMost primary sleep disorders may co-exist with PD; majority of these disorders have unique features when expressed in the PD population.\nWe discuss the specific considerations related to the common sleep problems in Parkinson's disease including insomnia, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, sleep disordered breathing, excessive daytime sleepiness and circadian rhythm disorders. Within each of these sleep disorders, we present updated definitions, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, clinical implications and management.

    "abstract": "The excitability of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that supply the striatum with dopamine (DA) determines the function of the nigrostriatal system for motor coordination. We previously showed that 4-pyridinylmethyl-9(10H)-anthracenone (XE991), a specific blocker of Kv7/KCNQ channels, enhanced the excitability of nigral DA neurons and resulted in attenuation of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in a Parkinson's disease (PD) rat model. However, whether XE991 exhibits neuroprotective effects towards DA neuron degeneration remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Kv7/KCNQ channel blocker, XE991, on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced nigral DA neuron degeneration and motor dysfunction. Using immunofluorescence staining and western blotting, we showed that intracerebroventricular administration of XE991 prevented the 6-OHDA-induced decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons and TH protein expression in the SNc. High-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) also revealed that XE991 partly restored the levels of DA and its metabolites in the striatum. Moreover, XE991 decreased apomorphine (APO)-induced contralateral rotations, enhanced balance and coordination, and attenuated muscle rigidity in 6-OHDA-treated rats. Importantly, all neuroprotective effects by XE991 were abolished by co-application of Kv7/KCNQ channel opener retigabine and XE991. Thus, Kv7/KCNQ channel inhibition by XE991 can exert neuroprotective effects against 6-OHDA-induced degeneration of the nigrostriatal DA system and motor dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have evaluated the association of Parkinson's disease with Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, although no cohort studies have evaluated this association among the general population.\nThis study aimed to investigate the risk of Parkinson's disease after HP infection in the general Taiwanese population.\nThis study of Taiwanese health insurance data (2000-2012) evaluated 9105 cases of HP infection and 9105 controls matched with propensity scoring. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the risk of subsequent Parkinson's disease.\nWe observed 64 cases of Parkinson's disease in the HP infection group (1.7/1000 person-years), and 25 cases in the control group (0.7/1000 person-years). Overall, there was a significantly higher risk of Parkinson's disease in the HP infection group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44-3.66). HP infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease among individuals who were \u226560 years old (aHR: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.47-4.35), but not among those <60 years old (aHR: 1.86, 95% CI: 0.69-4.98). Furthermore, HP infection was associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease among both men (aHR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.15-3.96) and women (aHR: 2.84, 95% CI: 1.37-5.89). Nonetheless, eradication therapy was not significantly associated with the risk of Parkinson's disease (aHR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.63-1.82).\nAlthough HP infection was associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, eradication therapy did not ameliorate this association. Further research is needed to explore the underlying biological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue and balance impairment leads to a loss of independence and are important to adequately manage. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a resistance training program on dynamic balance and fatigue in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nRandomized controlled trial. Forty-six patients with PD were randomly allocated to an intervention group receiving a 8-week resistance training program focused on lower limbs or to a control group. Balance was assessed using the Mini-BESTest and fatigue was assessed by the Piper Fatigue Scale.\nPatients in the intervention group improved significantly (p<0.05) on dynamic balance (reactive postural control and total values) and perceived fatigue.\nAn 8-week resistance training program was found to be effective at improving dynamic balance and fatigue in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has been increasingly used to investigate local brain structures in Parkinson's disease (PD). Compared to healthy participants, PD patients tend to show reduced brain volume in limbic and paralimbic areas in early disease stages, while the neocortical areas, such as the temporal and frontal cortices, are affected in advanced patients. Moreover, there are many studies showing correlation between cognitive performance and local brain volume. In the last decade, emotional and social cognitive function, such as facial emotion recognition, emotional decision-making, and theory of mind, have been the target of VBM analysis in PD. These studies facilitate understanding of the nature of communication and behavioral disorders that some PD patients display. However, there are discrepancies in VBM results between studies. Future studies need to employ larger sample sizes and combined analysis of brain perfusion or network connectivity in order to confirm brain structural changes and their effects on social cognitive function in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) increase the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) by 6-10 times in all populations and are associated with the early-onset of PD, development of cognitive impairment and presence of psychotic disorders. At the same time, polymorphic variants associated with the twofold increase in the risk of PD were also described in the GBA gene.\nTo estimate the clinical features of PD in patients with mutations and polymorphic variants of the GBA gene.\nEvaluation of motor, cognitive, emotional, psychotic and autonomic dysfunctions in patients with mutations (N370S, L444P) and polymorphic variants (E326K, T369M) in the GBA gene was performed using clinical scales.\nPatients with mutations (mGBA-PD), and with polymorphic variants (pGBA-PD) in the GBA gene were compared with the group of patients with sporadic PD (sPD). Compared to sPD, affective disorders (depression and anxiety) were more expressed in the mGBA-PD group (p=0.001) and the general GBA-PD group (p=0.001) assessed with Sheehan anxiety rating scale, in the pGBA-PD group (p=0.012) and the general GBA-PD group (p=0.05) assessed with the NPI, in the mGBA-PD (p=0.003), pGBA-PD (p=0.022), and general GBA-PD groups (p=0.001) assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS 'A'), and in the pGBA-PD group (p=0.005) assessed with the HADS 'D'. Non-motor symptoms assessed with the PD-NMS were more expressed in the pGBA-PD patients (p=0.007) and in the total group with GBA-PD (p=0,014) compared to sPD. Cognitive impairment measured with MMSE was more marked in mGBA-PD patients (p=0.022). Differences in motor and non-motor clinical symptoms between pGBA-PD and mGBA-PD groups were not found.\nThus, clinical features of non-motor symptoms were described both in carriers of GBA mutations and polymorphisms. Identification of the specific clinical phenotype of PD in carriers of GBA polymorphic variants is important due to their relatively high prevalence in PD patients.\n\u041c\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u044e\u043a\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0437\u044b (GBA)

    "abstract": "Despite extensive research, the functions of the basal ganglia (BG) in movement control have not been fully understood. Eye movements, particularly saccades, are convenient indicators of BG function. Here, we review the main oculomotor findings reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) and genetic parkinsonian syndromes. PD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder caused by dopaminergic cell loss within the substantia nigra pars compacta, resulting in depletion of striatal dopamine and subsequent increased inhibitory BG output from the internal globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Eye movement abnormalities are common in PD: anomalies are more evident in voluntary than reflexive saccades in the initial stages, but visually guided saccades may also be involved at later stages. Saccadic hypometria (including abnormally fragmented saccades), reduced accuracy, and increased latency are among the most prominent deficits. PD patients show also unusually frequent and large square wave jerks and impaired inhibition of reflexive saccades when voluntary mirror saccades are required. Poor convergence ability and altered pursuit are common. Inherited parkinsonisms are a heterogeneous group of rare syndromes due to gene mutations causing symptoms resembling those of PD. Eye movement characteristics of some parkinsonisms have been studied. While sharing some PD features, each syndrome has a distinctive profile that could contribute to better define the clinical phenotype of parkinsonian disorders. Moreover, because the pathogenesis and the underlying neural circuit failure of inherited parkinsonisms are often well defined, they might offer a better prospect than idiopathic PD to understand the BG function.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder related to \u03b1-synuclein misfolding and aggregation. For this reason, it belongs to the family of 'synucleinopathies', which also includes some other neurological diseases. Although imaging and ancillary investigations may be helpful in the diagnostic workup, the diagnosis of PD mostly relies on the clinician's expertise. Furthermore, there is a need today for markers that can track the disease progression in PD that might improve the evaluation of novel disease-modifying therapies. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been widely investigated with the purpose of finding useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for PD.\nThis systematic review protocol has been developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol 2015 statement and was registered on the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews. An international collaboration will be established. We will search the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Medline and Embase from inception, using appropriate search strategies. Individual participant data from all included studies will be merged into a single database. We will include any study assessing the diagnostic and prognostic role of CSF biomarkers in PD. To evaluate the risk of bias and applicability of primary diagnostic accuracy studies, we will use Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 and Quality in Prognostic Studies. We will use standard meta-analytic procedures. We will first explore the utility of each CSF biomarker in turn. For each biomarker, we will assess its diagnostic and prognostic utility by means of receiver operating characteristic analysis and regression models. We will then move towards a multivariate approach considering different panels of biomarkers.\nOur study will not include confidential data, and no intervention will be involved, so ethical approval is not required. The results of the study will be reported in international peer-reviewed journals.",

    "abstract": "In order to find out the possible earliest biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD) cholinopathy, we followed the impact of bilateral pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) lesion in rat on: the cortical and hippocampal sleep/wake states architectures, all sleep states related EEG microstructures, sleep spindles, the basal and stimulated locomotor activity. Sleep and basal locomotor activity in adult Wistar rats were followed during their inactive circadian phase, and throughout the same aging period. The bilateral PPT lesions were done by 0.1M ibotenic acid (IBO) during the surgical procedure for implantation of the electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) electrodes for chronic sleep recording. The cholinergic neuronal loss was identified by NADPH - diaphorase histochemistry. After all sleep and behavioral recording sessions, the locomotor activity was stimulated by d-amphetamine (d-AMPH) and the neuronal activity of striatum was followed by c-Fos immunolabeling. Impaired cholinergic innervation from the PPT was expressed earlier as sleep disorder then as movement disorder, and it was the earliest and long-lasting at hippocampal and thalamo-cortical level, and followed by a delayed \"hypokinesia\". This severe impact of a tonically impaired PPT cholinergic innervation was evidenced as the cholinergic interneuronal loss of the caudate putamen and as a suppressed c-Fos expression after stimulation by d-AMPH. In order how they occurred, the hippocampal non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep disorder, altered high voltage sleep spindle (HVS) dynamics during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in the hippocampus and motor cortex, and \"hypokinesia\" may serve as the biomarkers of PD cholinopathy onset and progression.",

    "abstract": "People with PD are at high risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia. Cross-sectional studies have identified candidate biomarkers associated with cognitive decline. However, longitudinal studies on this topic are rarer, and few have investigated the use of biomarker panels encompassing multiple modalities. The objective of this study was to find baseline predictors of cognitive decline in longitudinally followed, nondemented Parkinson's disease patients.\nWe performed a prospective cohort study of 100 PD patients with a median disease duration of 6.4 years. All participants were nondemented at baseline. We examined 16 baseline biomarkers from clinical, genetic, biochemical, and MRI-based imaging modalities for their association with longitudinal cognitive decline for up to 8 years. We investigated biomarkers individually, as well as in a multivariate linear mixed-effects model encompassing multimodal biomarkers, with change in the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 over time as the primary outcome. Annual consensus process-derived cognitive diagnosis was used for Cox proportional hazards modeling of risk for cognitive decline.\nIn multivariate analysis, the presence of the APOE E4 allele, thought disorder, and an Alzheimer's disease pattern of brain atrophy (spatial pattern of abnormality for recognition of early Alzheimer's disease index) best predicted cognitive decline, with APOE E4 genotype exerting the greatest effect. The presence of the APOE E4 allele was associated with a 3.5 times higher risk of worsening cognitive diagnosis over time (HR, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.52-8.24; P\u2009<\u20090.05). The APOE genotype effect was not specific to any Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 domain.\nOur results confirm the importance of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers as risk factors for cognitive decline in established Parkinson's disease. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common nonmotor manifestation of Parkinson's disease, with deficits ranging from mild cognitive difficulties in 1 or more of the cognitive domains to severe dementia. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society commissioned the assessment of the clinimetric properties of cognitive rating scales measuring global cognitive performance in PD to make recommendations regarding their use.\nA systematic literature search was conducted to identify the scales used to assess global cognitive performance in PD, and the identified scales were reviewed and rated as \"recommended,\" \"recommended with caveats,\" \"suggested,\" or \"listed\" by the panel using previously established criteria.\nA total of 12 cognitive scales were included in this review. Three scales, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale Second Edition, and the Parkinson's Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale, were classified as \"recommended.\" Two scales were classified as \"recommended with caveats\": the Mini-Mental Parkinson, because of limited coverage of executive abilities, and the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Cognition, which has limited data on sensitivity to change. Six other scales were classified as \"suggested\" and 1 scale as \"listed.\"\nBecause of the existence of \"recommended\" scales for assessment of global cognitive performance in PD, this task force suggests that the development of a new scale for this purpose is not needed at this time. However, global cognitive scales are not a substitute for comprehensive neuropsychological testing. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Evidence continues to accumulate that pesticides are the leading candidates of environmental toxins that may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The mechanisms, however, remain largely unclear. According to epidemiological studies, we selected nine representative pesticides (paraquat, rotenone, chlorpyrifos, pendimethalin, endosulfan, fenpyroximate, tebufenpyrad, trichlorphon and carbaryl) which are commonly used in China and detected the effects of the pesticides on mitochondria and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) function. Our results reveal that all the nine studied pesticides induce morphological changes of mitochondria at low concentrations. Paraquat, rotenone, chlorpyrifos, pendimethalin, endosulfan, fenpyroximate and tebufenpyrad induced mitochondria fragmentation. Furthermore, some of them (paraquat, rotenone, chlorpyrifos, fenpyroximate and tebufenpyrad) caused a significant dose-dependent decrease of intracellular ATP. Interestingly, these pesticides which induce mitochondria dysfunction also inhibit 26S and 20S proteasome activity. However, two out of the nine pesticides, namely trichlorphon and carbaryl, were found not to cause mitochondrial fragmentation or functional damage, nor inhibit the activity of the proteasome, which provides significant guidance for selection of pesticides in China. Moreover, our results demonstrate a potential link between inhibition of mitochondria and the UPS, and pesticide-induced Parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, fluctuations in symptoms commonly occur after many years of dopamine replacement therapy. The so-called wearing-off phenomenon exists of both motor and non-motor symptoms, such as rigidity and anxiety. Current treatment options are limited and an integrated approach is needed to address the complex interactions between motor and non-motor symptoms. Since wearing-off is eventually inevitable, treatment needs to focus on coping, acceptance and self-efficacy. We developed the body awareness training, named BEWARE, combining physical therapy with acceptance and commitment therapy to help PD patients deal better with wearing-off related anxiety (WRA).\nThis was an investigator-blinded randomized controlled trial. Forty PD patients with WRA were randomly assigned to the BEWARE or to the treatment as usual (TAU) condition. Assessments were performed prior to and immediately after the treatment period, and at 3-months follow up. The primary outcome was self-efficacy, secondary outcomes focused on mobility, daily functioning, anxiety, depression and quality of life.\nThere was no significant improvement in self-efficacy in the BEWARE treatment condition when compared to TAU. However, standing balance and emotional wellbeing showed a significant improvement, and feelings of stigmatization showed a trend-significant decrease in the BEWARE condition.\nWe consider the BEWARE training to be a promising therapeutic approach to address WRA. Improvement points from the participants included 1) less frequent but longer therapy sessions; 2) active involvement of caregivers; and 3) the development of a supportive workbook. The optimized treatment protocol needs further evaluation in a phase III RCT.\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02054845.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety and depression are common in Parkinson disease and both are important determinants of quality of life in patients. Several risk factors are identified but few research have investigated general and Parkinson's disease (PD)-specific factors comprehensively. The aim of this work was to explore PD-specific and -non-specific risk factors for PD with depression or anxiety.\nA cross-sectional survey was performed in 403 patients with PD. Multivariate logistic analysis was used to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for the depression and anxiety in PD. The data of patients included demographic information, medicine history, disease duration, age at onset (AAO), family history, anti-parkinsonism drug, modified Hoehn and Yahr staging (H-Y) stage, scales of motor and non-motor symptoms and substantia nigra (SN) echogenic areas.\n403 PD patients were recruited in the study. Depression and anxiety were present in 11.17% and 25.81% respectively. Marital status, tumor, higher Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) II score, dyskinesia, higher Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) score and lower the Parkinson's disease sleep scale (PDSS) score were associated with depression in PD. female gender, higher rapid eye movement behavior disorder Questionnaire-Hong Kong (RBD-HK) score, higher Hamilton Deprssion Rating Scale (HAMD) score, higher the scale for outcomes in PD for autonomic symptoms (SCOPA-AUT)score and larger SN echogenic areas were associated with anxiety. Neither depression nor anxiety was related to any anti-parkinsonism drugs.\nThe prevalence of depression and anxiety in the current PD patients was 11.17% and 25.81% respectively. Disease of tumor, currently having no partner, severer motor function, dyskinesia, poorer sleep quality and anxiety were risk factors for PD with depression. Female, depression, rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD), autonomic dysfunction and larger SN area were risk factors for PD with anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in PARK6 (PINK1) and PARK2 (Parkin) are linked to rare familial cases of Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations in these genes result in pathological dysregulation of mitophagy, contributing to neurodegeneration. Here, we report that environmental factors\u00a0causing a specific posttranslational modification on PINK1 can mimic these genetic mutations. We describe a molecular mechanism for impairment of mitophagy via formation of S-nitrosylated PINK1 (SNO-PINK1). Mitochondrial insults simulating age- or environmental-related stress lead to increased SNO-PINK1, inhibiting its kinase activity. SNO-PINK1 decreases Parkin translocation to mitochondrial membranes, disrupting mitophagy in cell lines and human-iPSC-derived neurons. We find levels of SNO-PINK1 in brains of \u03b1-synuclein transgenic PD mice similar to those in cell-based models, indicating the pathophysiological relevance of our findings. Importantly, SNO-PINK1-mediated deficits in mitophagy contribute to\u00a0neuronal cell death. These results reveal a direct molecular link between nitrosative stress, SNO-PINK1 formation, and mitophagic dysfunction that contributes to the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Stimulation parameters in deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus for Parkinson's disease (PD) are rarely tested in double-blind conditions. Evidence-based recommendations on optimal stimulator settings are needed. Results from the CUSTOM-DBS study are reported, comparing 2 pulse durations.\nA total of 15 patients were programmed using a pulse width of 30\u2009\u00b5s (test) or 60\u2009\u00b5s (control). Efficacy and side-effect thresholds and unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) III were measured in meds-off (primary outcome). The therapeutic window was the difference between patients' efficacy and side effect thresholds.\nThe therapeutic window was significantly larger at 30\u2009\u00b5s than 60\u2009\u00b5s (P\u2009=\u2009\u00b70009) and the efficacy (UPDRS III score) was noninferior (P\u2009=\u2009.00008).\nSubthalamic neurostimulation at 30\u2009\u00b5s versus 60\u2009\u00b5s pulse width is equally effective on PD motor signs, is more energy efficient, and has less likelihood of stimulation-related side effects. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

    "abstract": "A Parkinson's disease is attended by high strain for the patients and an obvious loss of relationship functioning. Partners of patients (N=110) were evaluated via self-assessment in terms of own depression (PHQ-9), own fear of progression (PA-F-P-KF), relationship quality (PFB) as well as perceived deficits in everyday life and nonverbal communication. 26% of women and 11% of men showed depression scores, 51% of women and 41% of men dysfunctional fear of progression and about 60% were unsatisfied with their relationship. Gender-specific differences regarding the severity of the symptoms and their distress occurred. The severity of symptoms was estimated highest by spouses of male patients with Parkinson's disease, whereas female spouses showed higher psychological distress than male spouses. Moreover, restrictions of everyday life were associated with depression (r=0.40, p<0.05), fear of progression (r=0.40, p<0.05) und relationship quality (r=-0.52, p<0.05) as well as deficits in nonverbal communication with depression (r=0.37, p<0.05), fear of progression (r=0.27, p<0.05) und relationship quality (r=-0.49, p<0.05). Regression analysis to predict relationship quality explained 46% of the variance. As significant predictors emerged cognitive deficits in everyday life, lacking eye contact, physical mobility and pain. Due to the high association of relationship quality and restrictions through the Parkinson's disease, interventions with couples were discussed.\nDie neurodegenerative Erkrankung des Idiopathischen Parkinson-Syndroms geht mit einer hohen Belastung f\u00fcr die Betroffenen und einem deutlichen Verlust des partnerschaftlichen Funktionsniveaus einher. Angeh\u00f6rige von Patienten (N=110) wurden in der vorliegenden Studie mittels Fragebogen zur eigenen Depressivit\u00e4t (PHQ-9), zur eigenen Progredienzangst (PA-F-P-KF), zur Partnerschaftsqualit\u00e4t (PFB) sowie zu den wahrgenommenen Alltags- und nonverbalen Defiziten der Patienten befragt. 26% der Frauen und 11% der M\u00e4nner zeigten Depressivit\u00e4tswerte \u00fcber dem Cut-off, 51% der Frauen und 41% der M\u00e4nner dysfunktionale Progredienzangst und ca. 60% klassifizierten ihre Partnerschaft als ungl\u00fccklich. Die Schwere der Symptomatik und ihre Belastung weisen eine deutliche Geschlechtsspezifit\u00e4t auf: M\u00e4nnliche Parkinson-Patienten werden von ihren Partnerinnen als von einer st\u00e4rkeren Symptomatik betroffen eingesch\u00e4tzt, Frauen weisen als Angeh\u00f6rige von Parkinson-Patienten mehr psychische Belastung auf. Hier zeigt sich ein starker korrelativer Zusammenhang zwischen Alltagsdefiziten und Depressivit\u00e4t (r=0,40, p<0,05), Progredienzangst (r=0,40, p<0,05) und Partnerschaftsqualit\u00e4t (r=\u22120,52, p<0,05) sowie nonverbalen Defiziten und Depressivit\u00e4t (r=0,37, p<0,05), Progredienzangst (r=0,27, p<0,05) und Partnerschaftsqualit\u00e4t (r=\u22120,49, p<0,05). Mittels Regressionsanalysen zur Vorhersage von Partnerschaftsqualit\u00e4t konnte ein Regressionsmodell mit 46% Aufkl\u00e4rung entwickelt werden. Kognitive Einschr\u00e4nkungen im Alltag, mangelnder Blickkontakt, k\u00f6rperliche Beweglichkeit und Schmerzen stellten sich als st\u00e4rkste Pr\u00e4diktorvariablen heraus. Der starke Zusammenhang zwischen Partnerschaftsqualit\u00e4t und Einschr\u00e4nkungen des Morbus Parkinson-Betroffenen wird auf die Frage hin diskutiert, ob nicht gezielte paartherapeutische Interventionen hilfreich f\u00fcr den m\u00f6glichst langen Erhalt der Partnerschaftsqualit\u00e4t sein k\u00f6nnen.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are established treatment option in Parkinson's disease (PD). If DBS does not provide the desired effect, re-operation to the alternative target is a treatment option, but data on the effect of re-operation are scarce.\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical effect of re-operation the alternative target after failure of initial STN or GPi DBS for Parkinson's disease.\nWe descriptively analyzed the baseline characteristics, the effect of initial surgery and re-operation of eight NSTAPS (Netherlands SubThalamic and Pallidal Stimulation) patients and six previously published cases that underwent re-operation to a different target.\nIn the NSTAPS cohort, two of the eight patients showed more than 30% improvement of off-drug motor symptoms after re-operation. The initial DBS leads of these patients were off target. In the cases from the literature, 30% off-drug motor improvement was seen in all three patients re-operated from GPi to STN and none of the three patients re-operated from STN to GPi. Only one of the three cases from the literature where any improvement was seen with the operation had a confirmed on target lead location after the first surgery, while the other two patients did not undergo post-operative imaging after the first surgery.\nRe-operation to a different target due to lack of effect appears to have a limited chance of leading to objective improvement if the leads were correctly placed during initial surgery.",

    "abstract": "Rotigotine-a non-ergot dopamine agonist-has two advantages; it can stimulate all dopamine receptors (D1-D5) like innate dopamine, and its transdermal administration provides continuous dopaminergic stimulation. The age of the patient impacts the effect and adverse events of anti-parkinsonian treatment. We conducted a post hoc analysis on three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials performed in Japan to clarify the difference of anti-parkinsonian treatment in elderly and non-elderly patients. Data from two combination therapy trials (with levodopa) in advanced stage Parkinson's disease patients and one monotherapy trial in early stage patients were pooled and grouped by age (non-elderly aged\u00a0<\u00a070, elderly aged 70\u00a0+). In each age group, efficacy of rotigotine was compared to placebo. In the combination therapy, total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III scores and some subtotal scores, including those for tremor, akinesia and gait disturbance, significantly improved in both elderly and non-elderly patients. Regarding safety, the incidence of total adverse event tended to be lower in elderly patients than non-elderly patients, although it was not significant. No difference was observed in maintenance dosage of rotigotine between the two groups. In conclusion, the improvement in motor symptoms and frequency of adverse events were shown to be similar in elderly and non-elderly patients with rotigotine-levodopa combination therapy. Further, there was no major difference in maintenance dosage of rotigotine between the age groups. These results suggest good tolerability of rotigotine among elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that parkinsonian [Parkinson's disease (PD)] patients might have a \"dominant\" (DOM) subthalamic nucleus (STN), whose unilateral electrical stimulation [deep brain stimulation (DBS)] could lead to an improvement in PD symptoms similar to bilateral STN-DBS.\nSince disability in PD patients is often related to gait problems, in this study, we wanted to investigate in a group of patients bilaterally implanted for STN-DBS: (1) if it was possible to identify a subgroup of subjects with a dominant STN; (2) in the case, if the unilateral stimulation of the dominant STN was capable to improve gait abnormalities, as assessed by instrumented multifactorial gait analysis, similarly to what observed with bilateral stimulation.\nWe studied 10 PD patients with bilateral STN-DBS. A clinical evaluation and a kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic (EMG) analysis of overground walking were performed-off medication-in four conditions: without stimulation, with bilateral stimulation, with unilateral right or left STN-DBS. Through a hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis based on motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores, it was possible to separate patients into two groups, based on the presence (six patients, DOM group) or absence (four patients, NDOM group) of a dominant STN.\nIn the DOM group, both bilateral and unilateral stimulation of the dominant STN significantly increased gait speed, stride length, range of motion of lower limb joints, and peaks of moment and power at the ankle joint; moreover, the EMG activation pattern of distal leg muscles was improved. The unilateral stimulation of the non-dominant STN did not produce any significant effect. In the NDOM group, only bilateral stimulation determined a significant improvement of gait parameters.\nIn the DOM group, the effect of unilateral stimulation of the dominant STN determined an improvement of gait parameters similar to bilateral stimulation. The pre-surgical identification of these patients, if possible, could allow to reduce the surgical risks and side effects of DBS adopting a unilateral approach.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to present a predictive model of Parkinson's disease (PD) global severity, measured with the Clinical Impression of Severity Index for Parkinson's Disease (CISI-PD).\nThis is an observational, longitudinal study with annual follow-up assessments over 3\u2009years (four time points). A multilevel analysis and multiple imputation techniques were performed to generate a predictive model that estimates changes in the CISI-PD at 1, 2, and 3\u2009years.\nThe clinical state of patients (CISI-PD) significantly worsened in the 3-year follow-up. However, this change was of small magnitude (effect size: 0.44). The following baseline variables were significant predictors of the global severity change: baseline global severity of disease, levodopa equivalent dose, depression and anxiety symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive state. The goodness-of-fit of the model was adequate, and the sensitive analysis showed that the data imputation method applied was suitable.\nDisease progression depends more on the individual's baseline characteristics than on the 3-year time period. Results may contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of PD including the non-motor manifestations of the disease.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that disruption of basal ganglia function generates the motor symptoms in PD, however, these are presented in a heterogeneous manner; patients can be divided into tremor-dominant and akinesia/rigidity-dominant subtypes. To date, it is unknown if these differences in the motor symptoms could be explained by differences on the functional connectivity of basal ganglia with specific brain regions. In this study, we aimed to explore the alterations of the network-based and global functional connectivity linking to basal ganglia between the PD-TD and PD-AR patients. One hundred and six PD patients and 52 normal controls were recruited. According to the subscales of UPDRS motor scale, PD patients were divided into the PD-TD (",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies indicate that physical activity and exercise may reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD), and clinical observations suggest that physical exercise can reduce the motor symptoms in PD patients. In experimental animals, a profound observation is that exercise of appropriate timing, duration, and intensity can reduce toxin-induced lesion of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system in animal PD models, although negative results have also been reported, potentially due to inappropriate timing and intensity of the exercise regimen. Exercise may also minimize DA denervation-induced medium spiny neuron (MSN) dendritic atrophy and other abnormalities such as enlarged corticostriatal synapse and abnormal MSN excitability and spiking activity. Taken together, epidemiological studies, clinical observations, and animal research indicate that appropriately dosed physical activity and exercise may not only reduce the risk of developing PD in vulnerable populations but also benefit PD patients by potentially protecting the residual DA neurons or directly restoring the dysfunctional cortico-basal ganglia motor control circuit, and these benefits may be mediated by exercise-triggered production of endogenous neuroprotective molecules such as neurotrophic factors. Thus, exercise is a universally available, side effect-free medicine that should be prescribed to vulnerable populations as a preventive measure and to PD patients as a component of treatment. Future research needs to establish standardized exercise protocols that can reliably induce DA neuron protection, enabling the delineation of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that in turn can maximize exercise-induced neuroprotection and neurorestoration in animal PD models and eventually in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Familial Parkinson's disease (PD) is often caused by mutation of a certain gene, while sporadic PD is associated with variants of genes which can influence the susceptibility to PD. The goal of this study was to investigate the difference between the two forms of PD in terms of brain abnormalities using resting-state functional MRI and graph theory. Thirty-one familial PD patients and 36 sporadic PD patients underwent resting-state functional MRI scanning. Frequency-dependent functional connectivity was calculated for each subject using wavelet-based correlations of BOLD signal over 246 brain regions from Brainnetome Atlas. Graph theoretical analysis was then performed to analyze the topology of the functional network, and functional connectome differences were identified with a network-based statistical approach. Our results revealed a frequency-specific (0.016 and 0.031 Hz) connectome difference between familial and sporadic forms of PD, as indicated by an increase in assortativity and decrease in the nodal strength in the left medial amygdala of the familial PD group. In addition, the familial PD patients also showed a distinctive functional network between the left medial amygdala and regions related to retrieval of motion information. The present study indicates that the medial amygdala might be most vulnerable to both sporadic and familial PD. Our findings provide some new insights into disrupted resting-state functional connectomes between sporadic PD and familial PD.",

    "abstract": "Among the neurodegenerative disorders, Parkinson's disease (PD) ranks as the second most common disorder with a higher prevalence in individuals aged over 60 years old. Younger individuals may also be affected with PD which is known as early onset PD (EOPD). Despite similarities between the characteristics of EOPD and late onset PD (LODP), EOPD patients experience much longer disease manifestations and poorer quality of life. Although some individuals are more prone to have EOPD due to certain genetic alterations, the molecular mechanisms that differentiate between EOPD and LOPD remains unclear. Recent findings in PD patients revealed that there were differences in the genetic profiles of PD patients compared to healthy controls, as well as between EOPD and LOPD patients. There were variants identified that correlated with the decline of cognitive and motor symptoms as well as non-motor symptoms in PD. There were also specific microRNAs that correlated with PD progression, and since microRNAs have been shown to be involved in the maintenance of neuronal development, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, there is a strong possibility that these microRNAs can be potentially used to differentiate between subsets of PD patients. PD is mainly diagnosed at the late stage, when almost majority of the dopaminergic neurons are lost. Therefore, identification of molecular biomarkers for early detection of PD is important. Given that miRNAs are crucial in controlling the gene expression, these regulatory microRNAs and their target genes could be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis of PD. In this article, we discussed the genes involved and their regulatory miRNAs, regarding their roles in PD progression, based on the findings of significantly altered microRNAs in EOPD studies. We also discussed the potential of these miRNAs as molecular biomarkers for early diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Deficiencies in adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been suggested to be a possible pathophysiological mechanism that underlies depressive symptoms that are often observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Pioglitazone, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) agonist, has been shown to exert antiinflammatory and antidepressant effects and modulate neural plasticity in several neurodegenerative disorders. The present study investigated the effects of pioglitazone on depressive phenotypes and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a rat model of PD that was induced by bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) infusions in the substantia nigra pars compact (SNpc). Rats with SNpc and ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurodegeneration exhibited despair-like behavior, concomitant with persistent microglial activation in the hippocampus. Pioglitazone reduced the rate of mortality and attenuated microglial activation in the early phase of 6-OHDA-induced nigral lesions. Pioglitazone exerted antidepressant-like effects and increased the survival of neurons in the hippocampus in rats with nigral lesions. These results indicate that pioglitazone exerts neuroprotective effects by facilitating hippocampal neurogenesis in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, which might contribute to its antidepressant-like effect.",

    "abstract": "The key mechanisms that connect Parkinson's disease pathology with dementia are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that the quantitative spectral electroencephalographic measure, delta bandpower, correlates with Lewy type synucleinopathy on pathological examination in Parkinson's disease. As a corollary hypothesis, we analyzed whether there would be delta bandpower electroencephalographic differences between Parkinson's disease dementia cases with and without pathological criteria for Alzheimer's disease.\nWe used pathological examination results from 44 Parkinson's disease subjects from our brain bank with various degrees of cognitive decline, who had undergone electroencephalography. Pathological grading for Lewy type synucleinopathy, plaques, tangles, and indications of vascular pathology in subcortical and cortical areas were correlated with the most associated electroencephalographic biomarker with Parkinson's disease dementia in our laboratory, delta bandpower. Group differences for all spectral electroencephalographic measures were also analyzed between cases with and without pathological criteria for Alzheimer's disease.\nFindings revealed significant correlations between delta bandpower with Lewy type synucleinopathy, whereas indications of Alzheimer's disease or vascular pathology had nonsignificant correlation. The strongest association was with delta bandpower and Lewy type synucleinopathy in the anterior cingulate region. Mean delta bandpower was higher in the group for Parkinson's disease dementia with Alzheimer's disease pathology criteria than without.\nLewy type synucleinopathy severity appears to be more associated with increased delta bandpower than with Alzheimer's disease pathology or indications of vascular pathology over all cases. However, the presence of Alzheimer's pathology may associate with more cortex physiological disruption in a subset of cases.",

    "abstract": "CVT-301, an inhaled levodopa (LD) formulation, is under development for relief of OFF periods in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previously, we reported that CVT-301 improved OFF symptoms relative to placebo. In this study, we evaluate pulmonary function in patients treated with a single dose of CVT-301 or placebo for 3 hours, or received multiple doses/day for 4 weeks.\nAs part of two phase 2 studies, pulmonary safety and tolerability of CVT-301 were evaluated in PD patients experiencing motor fluctuations (\u22652 hours OFF/day), Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-3, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio \u226575% of predicted (in ON state). In study A, patients received single doses of oral carbidopa/LD and each of the following via the inhaled route: placebo and 25 and 50\u2009mg LD fine particle dose (FPD) CVT-301. In study B, patients received up to 3 inhaled doses/day of 35\u2009mg (weeks 1-2) and 50\u2009mg LD FPD CVT-301 (weeks 3-4) versus placebo. Assessments included spirometry and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).\nIn study A, (n\u2009=\u200924) mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation was 61.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4 years, mean time since diagnosis was 10.5\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6 years, and mean duration of LD treatment 8.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7 years. Assessment of pulmonary function (predose to 3 hours postdose) showed that spirometry findings were within normal ranges, regardless of treatment groups, or motor status at screening. In study B, (n\u2009=\u200986) mean age was 62.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7 years, time since PD diagnosis was 9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9 years, and duration of LD treatment 7.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9 years. Longitudinal assessment of pulmonary function over 4 weeks showed no significant difference in spirometry between CVT-301 versus placebo groups. In both studies, the most common CVT-301 TEAE was mild-to-moderate cough (study A: 21%; study B: 7% vs. 2% in placebo). Other common TEAEs in study B were dizziness and nausea.\nAcute and longitudinal assessment of pulmonary function showed that CVT-301 treatment was not associated with acute airflow obstruction in this population. CVT-301 was generally safe and well tolerated.",

Biofilm on prostheses was measured at baseline, and verbal instructions on prosthesis hygiene were given. After 7, 14, and 30 days, biofilm presence was re-evaluated and the results were shown to participants, with repeated cleaning instruction. At baseline, participants with PD had more biofilm on maxillary prostheses than did controls (p = 0.009). At 30 days, biofilm presence on maxillary and mandibular prostheses did not differ between groups. Both groups showed reductions in biofilm accumulation on prostheses over time, but this effect took longer to appear on mandibular prostheses in the PD group (p < 0.05).\nVerbal instruction and positive reinforcement can improve prosthesis hygiene in elders with and without PD.",

Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) encompasses minor phenomena (illusions, passage hallucinations and presence hallucinations), visual and nonvisual hallucinations and delusions. PDP is associated with reduced function and quality of life. The initial management approach should focus on identification and treatment of any contributory medical factors, reduction or discontinuation of medications with potential to induce or worsen psychosis, nonpharmacological strategies and consideration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment in the setting of dementia. Pimavanserin, quetiapine and clozapine may all be considered for use in PDP. In this review, we discuss the presentation, diagnosis and management of PDP.",

    "abstract": "L-Dopa represents the mainstay of therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its effectiveness is reduced with continued treatment and disease progression. Accordingly, there remains a need to explore novel treatment strategies to manage the signs and symptoms of the later disease stages. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjunctive perampanel (PER) in patients with PD through a meta-analysis of existing trials.\nRandomized, placebo-controlled, double- or single-blind, add-on studies of PER in patients with PD were identified through a systematic literature search. The following outcomes were assessed: changes from baseline to final efficacy visit in total daily OFF time, activities of daily living during OFF time and motor function during ON time, incidence of adverse events (AEs), and treatment withdrawal.\nFour trials were included involving 2266 participants, 1449 and 817 for PER and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Four PER daily doses were tested, namely 0.5, 1, 2 and 4\u00a0mg. There were no significant differences in any efficacy outcome between PER and placebo treated patients. The risk ratios (RRs) for AEs, severe AEs and treatment withdrawal were similar between placebo and PER at 0.5, 1 and 2\u00a0mg; the 4\u00a0mg daily dose was associated with an increased risk of AEs [RR 1.118 (1.047-1.193)], and withdrawal for AEs [RR 1.345 (1.034-1.749)] and for any reason [RR 1.197 (1.020-1.406)].\nIn PD patients experiencing motor fluctuations, adjunctive PER did not improve the motor state and was well-tolerated at the lower doses.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has suggested a possible link between Parkinson's disease (PD) and Fabry disease. To test this relationship, we administered a self-report and family history questionnaire to determine the prevalence of PD in Fabry disease patients and family members with likely pathogenic alpha-galactosidase A (GLA) mutations. A total of 90 Fabry patients (77 from the online survey and 13 from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS)) were included in the analysis. Two of the Fabry disease patients who completed the online survey were diagnosed with PD (2/90, 2.2%). Among probands older than 60, 8.3% (2/24) were diagnosed with PD. Using Kaplan Meier survival analysis, the age-specific risk of PD by age 70 was 11.1%. Family history was available on 72 Fabry families from the online study and 9 Fabry families from ISMMS. Among these 81 families, 6 (7.4%) had one first degree relative who fit the criteria for a conservative diagnosis of PD. The results of this study suggest that there may be an increased risk of developing PD in individuals with GLA mutations, but these findings should be interpreted with caution given the limitations of the study design.",

    "abstract": "Besides being better known for causing motor impairments, Parkinson's disease (PD) can also cause many nonmotor symptoms, like depression and anxiety, which can cause significant loss of life quality and may not respond to regular drugs treatment. In this review, we discuss the depression in PD, based on data from studies in humans and rodents. Depression frequency seems higher in PD patients than in general population, despite high variation in data due to diagnosis disparities. Development of depression in PD seems more likely to be caused by the nigrostriatal pathway degeneration than as a consequence of the awareness of disease prognostic, and it seems to be related to dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotoninergic synapses deficits. The dopaminergic role could be more significant, since it can modulate the release of the others, and its depletion is progressive, due to the degenerative feature of PD. Highly regarded in major depression, serotonin can be depleted in rats after nigrostriatal damage, but data from human patients are more conflicting. Animal studies can help in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of depression in PD and the pursuit for more effective drugs for its treatment, but they lack the complexity of the disease progression, especially the nondopaminergic degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Imbalance and tripping over obstacles as a result of altered gait in older adults, especially in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), are one of the most common causes of falls. During obstacle crossing, patients with PD modify their behavior in order to decrease the mechanical demands and enhance dynamic stability. Various descriptions of dynamic traits of gait that have been collected over longer periods, probably better synthesize the underlying structure and pattern of fluctuations in gait and can be more sensitive markers of aging or early neurological dysfunction and increased risk of falls. This confirmation challenges the clinimetric of different protocols and paradigms used for gait analysis up till now, in particular when analyzing obstacle crossing. The authors here present a critical review of current knowledge concerning the interplay between the cognition and gait in aging and PD, emphasizing the differences in gait behavior and adaptability while walking over different and challenging obstacle paradigms, and the implications of obstacle negotiation as a predictor of falls. Some evidence concerning the effectiveness of future rehabilitation protocols on reviving obstacle crossing behavior by trial and error relearning, taking advantage of dual-task paradigms, physical exercise, and virtual reality have been put forward in this article.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in the central nervous system (CNS) is a core feature of Parkinson disease (PD) that leads to activation of the innate immune system, production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and subsequent neurodegeneration. Here, we used heterozygous reporter knock-in mice in which the first exons of the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) and of the C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) are replaced with fluorescent reporters to study the role of resident microglia (CX3CR1+) and infiltrating peripheral monocytes (CCR2+), respectively, in the CNS. We used an \u03b1-syn mouse model induced by viral over-expression of \u03b1-syn. We find that in vivo, expression of full-length human \u03b1-syn induces robust infiltration of pro-inflammatory CCR2+ peripheral monocytes into the substantia nigra. Genetic deletion of CCR2 prevents \u03b1-syn induced monocyte entry, attenuates MHCII expression and blocks the subsequent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. These results demonstrate that extravasation of pro-inflammatory peripheral monocytes into the CNS plays a key role in neurodegeneration in this model of PD synucleinopathy, and suggest that peripheral monocytes may be a target of neuroprotective therapies for human PD.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability is one of the most disabling and risky symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether and how this is mediated by a centrally impaired spatial orientation. Therefore, we performed a spatial orientation study in 21 PD patients (mean age 68years, SD 8.5 years, 9 women) in a medically on condition and 21 healthy controls (mean age 68.9years, SD 5.5years, 14 women). We compared their spatial responses to the horizontal axis (Sakashita's visual target cancellation task), the vertical axis (bucket-test), the sagittal axis (tilt table test) and postural stability using the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (FAB). We found larger deviations on the vertical axis in PD patients, although the direct comparisons of performance in PD patients and healthy controls did not reveal significant differences. While the total scores of the FAB Scale were significantly worse in PD (25.9 points, SD 7.2 points) compared to controls (35.1 points, SD 2.3 points, p<0.01), the results from the spatialorientation task did not correlate with the FAB Scale. In summary, our results argue against a relation between perceptional deficits of spatial information and postural control in PD. These results are in favor of a deficit in higher order integration of spatial stimuli in PD that might influence balance control.",

    "abstract": "In this era of modern medicine, there is an increase in life expectancy and thereby an ageing population. Among this group one of the most common neurological disorder is Parkinson disease and one of the most common operation done in elderly population is a total joint arthroplasty. But total joint arthroplasty in Parkinson disease is a relatively uncommon entity. There is sparse literature available with regards to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in Parkinson disease. This review focusses on the necessity, complications and previous experiences on TKA in PD based on the literature available.\nThe review was conducted after a series of advanced search in the following medical databases; Pub med, Biomed central, Cochrane and Google scholar for articles related to total knee replacement in patients with Parkinson's disease. The following keywords were used; Total knee arthroplasty, Parkinson's disease, Hoehn and Yahr, Flexion Contracture.\nThe review indicates that the functional outcome is comparable to that of controls in immediate post-operative phase, one year and three-year phase, but the long term functional outcome seems to deteriorate significantly.\nTotal knee arthroplasty can serve as an effective tool in alleviating pain in short term as well as long term periods, whereas the functional outcome seems to deteriorate post operatively on a long-term basis. Nevertheless, TKA in PD is a challenging situation, thereby necessitating a holistic approach with the efforts from various specialists needed at each stage to ensure a successful operation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive movement disorder of adults and the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Neuropathologic diagnosis of PD requires moderate-to-marked neuronal loss in the ventrolateral substantia nigra pars compacta and \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) Lewy body pathology. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration correlates with the Parkinsonian motor features, but involvement of other peripheral and central nervous system regions leads to a wide range of non-motor features. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration is shared with other parkinsonian disorders, including some genetic forms of parkinsonism, but many of these disorders do not have Lewy bodies. An ideal animal model for PD, therefore, should exhibit age-dependent and progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration, motor dysfunction, and abnormal \u03b1S pathology. Rodent models of PD using genetic or toxin based strategies have been widely used in the past several decades to investigate the pathogenesis and therapeutics of PD, but few recapitulate all the major clinical and pathologic features of PD. It is likely that new strategies or better understanding of fundamental disease processes may facilitate development of better animal models. In this review, we highlight progress in generating rodent models of PD based on impairments of four major cellular functions: mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, autophagy-lysosomal metabolism, ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response. We attempt to evaluate how impairment of these major cellular systems contribute to PD and how they can be exploited in rodent models. In addition, we review recent cell biological studies suggesting a link between \u03b1S aggregation and impairment of nuclear membrane integrity, as observed during cellular models of apoptosis. We also briefly discuss the role of incompetent phagocytic clearance and how this may be a factor to consider in developing new rodent models of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurological condition characterised mainly by bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity and postural instability, symptoms that together comprise the parkinsonian syndrome. Non-motor symptoms preceding and following clinical onset are also helpful diagnostic markers revealing a widespread and progressive pathology. Many other neurological conditions also include parkinsonism as primary or secondary symptom, confounding their diagnosis and treatment. Although overall disease course and end-stage pathological examination single out these conditions, the significant overlaps suggest that they are part of a continuous disease spectrum. Recent genetic discoveries support this idea because mutations in a few genes (\u03b1-synuclein, ",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation has been shown to have a significant long-term beneficial effect on motor function. However, whether it affects survival is not clear. In this study, we compared survival rates for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) with those who were medically managed.\nA retrospective analysis of Veterans Affairs and Medicare administrative data of veterans with PD who received DBS and were propensity score matched to a cohort of veterans with PD who did not receive DBS between 2007-2013.\nVeterans with PD who received DBS had a longer survival measured in days than a matched group of veterans who did not undergo DBS (mean\u2009=\u20092291.1 [standard error\u2009=\u200946.4] days [6.3 years] vs 2063.8 [standard error\u2009=\u200947.7] days [5.7 years]; P\u2009=\u2009.006; hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.69 [95% confidence interval 0.56-0.85]). Mean age at death was similar for both groups (76.5 [standard deviation\u2009=\u20097.2] vs 75.9 [standard deviation\u2009=\u20098.4] years, P\u2009=\u2009.67), respectively, and the most common cause of death was PD.\nDBS is associated with a modest survival advantage when compared with a matched group of patients who did not undergo DBS. Whether the survival advantage reflects a moderating influence of DBS on PD or on comorbidities that might shorten life or whether differences may be a result of unmeasured differences between groups is not known. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate how quality of life outcome after bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) depends on age.\nIn this prospective, open-label, multicenter study including 120 PD patients undergoing bilateral STN-DBS, we investigated the PDQuestionnaire-8 (PDQ-8), Unified PD Rating Scale-III, Scales for Outcomes in PD-motor examination, complications, activities of daily living, and levodopa equivalent daily dose preoperatively and at 5 months follow-up. Significant changes at follow-up were analyzed with Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. To explore the influence of age post hoc, the patients were classified into 3 age groups (\u226459, 60-69, \u226570 years). Intragroup changes were analyzed with Wilcoxon signed-rank and intergroup differences with Kruskal-Wallis tests. The strength of clinical responses was evaluated using effect size.\nThe PDQuestionnaire-8, Scales for Outcomes in PD-motor complications, activities of daily living, and levodopa equivalent daily dose significantly improved in the overall cohort and all age groups with no significant intergroup differences. However, PDQuestionnaire-8 effect sizes for age groups \u226459, 60 to 69, and \u226570 years, respectively, were strong, moderate, and small. Furthermore, PDQuestionnaire-8 domain analyses revealed that all domains except cognition and emotional well-being significantly improved in patients aged \u226459 years, whereas only communication, activities of daily living, and stigma improved in patients aged 60-69 years, and activities of daily living and stigma in patients aged \u226570 years.\nAlthough quality of life, motor complications, and activities of daily living significantly improved in all age groups after bilateral STN-DBS, the beneficial effect on overall quality of life was more pronounced and affected a wider range of quality of life domains in younger patients. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a well-established surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is currently no consensus on the best timing for this surgery. The aim of our study is to compare the therapeutic efficacy of bilateral STN DBS in patients with PD with early and late motor complications.\n200 patients with PD will be enrolled in this multicentre, prospective, observational study, and will be followed up for 4\u2009years. Patients with PD who meet the criteria for STN DBS surgery will be allocated to either the early stimulation group or the late stimulation group based on the duration of their motor complications. The primary outcome will be changes in quality of life from baseline to 4\u2009years, measured using the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire Summary Index. The secondary outcomes include changes in motor function measured using Movement Disorder Society-revised Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III, self-reported experiences of daily living measured using MDS-UPDRS Part I B and Part II, good 'on' time recorded by the patients using a diary and safety profile of both groups.\nThe study received ethical approval from the Medical Ethical Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University.

Cholinergic neuronal loss co-occurs, particularly within a brainstem structure, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). We isolated single cholinergic neurons from postmortem PPNs of aged controls and PD patients. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mtDNA deletions were increased significantly in PD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, compared to controls the PD patients had significantly more PPN cholinergic neurons containing mtDNA deletion levels exceeding 60%, a level associated with deleterious effects on oxidative phosphorylation. The current results differ from studies reporting mtDNA depletion in nigral dopaminergic neurons of PD patients. Ann Neurol 2017;82:1016-1021.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers of oxidative stress are relevant in the evaluation of the disease status and prooxidant-antioxidant balance, advanced oxidation protein products and lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal) are being extensively evaluated regarding their relationship with clinical presentation and disease severity.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of the above-mentioned parameters in plasma of 39 men and 17 women with Parkinson's disease, originated from the Republic of Serbia and their relation to clinicopathological characteristics (gender, age at examination, duration of the disease, and Hoehn and Yahr score) and oxidative status.\nThe incidence of disease was 2:1 towards males. The investigated oxidative parameters were gender and Hoehn and Yahr related. Significant association of higher Hoehn and Yahr scores was observed for malondialdehyde (p = 0.01) and prooxidant-antioxidant balance (p = 0.02). Relation between oxidant-antioxidant status was further supported by observed positive correlation between 4-hydroxynonenal (p = 0.04) and prooxidant-antioxidant balance (p = 0.03). Finally, the multivariate analysis indicated that prooxidant-antioxidant balance and malondialdehyde were partially determined by gender (10.6% and 7.6%) and Hoehn and Yahr scores (13.6% and 18.8%), while Hoehn and Yahr scores contributed to the variance of advanced oxidation protein products with 13.2%.\nOur results indicate the higher level of oxidative stress (oxidant-antioxidant imbalance) and possible relation of several markers with gender and disease stage in patients with Parkinson's disease. The analyzed markers could be used to specify the severity of oxidative stress; however, their potential value should be analyzed in further studies.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the effect of a somatosensory cueing on gait disorders in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). After having performed stepping in place and timed up and go assessing tasks, 13 participants with PD were equipped with an electrical stimulator and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) located under the lateral malleolus on the sagittal plane. Electrodes were positioned under the arch of the foot and electrical stimulation (ES) parameters (five 500 \u00b5s/phase charge-balanced biphasic pulses delivered at 200 Hz, repeated four times at 10 Hz) adjusted to deliver a sensitive signal. Online IMU signal was processed in order to trigger ES at heel off detection. Starting from a quiet standing posture, subjects were asked to walk at their preferred speed on a path including 5 m straight line, u-turn, and walk around tasks. Three situations were considered: no stimulation baseline precondition (C0), ES condition (C1), and no stimulation baseline post-condition (C0bis), for eliminating a learning effect possibility. In ES condition (C1) the time to execute the different tasks was globally decreased in all the subjects (n\u2009=\u200913). Participants' results were then grouped regarding whether they experienced freezing of gait (FOG) or not during C0 no stimulation baseline precondition. In \"freezer\" subjects (n\u2009=\u20099), the time to complete the entire path was reduced by 19%. FOG episodes occurrence was decreased by 12% compared to baseline conditions.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive, age-related, neurodegenerative disorder, and oxidative stress is an important mediator in its pathogenesis. DJ-1 has been identified as a causative gene of a familial form of Parkinson's disease, PARK7, and plays a significant role in antioxidative defense, protecting cells from oxidative stress. A cysteine residue of DJ-1 at position 106 (Cys-106) is preferentially oxidized under oxidative stress. This reactive Cys-106 plays a critical role in the biological function of DJ-1, which could act as a sensor of oxidative stress by regulating antioxidative defense depending on Cys-106 oxidation. Thus, the levels of Cys-106-oxidized DJ-1 (oxDJ-1) could be a possible biomarker of oxidative stress. This chapter focuses on the properties of DJ-1 and oxDJ-1 levels as a biomarker of Parkinson's disease. In particular, the usability of these biomarkers to prevent and treat this neurodegenerative disease is discussed. Further, this section deals with the importance of identifying a biomarker of early-phase Parkinson's disease. Finally, this chapter summarizes the features of oxDJ-1 levels in the brain and blood as a biomarker candidate for early-phase Parkinson's disease based on our results using oxDJ-1-specific antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is a well-established therapy for control of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Despite an appropriate targeting and an accurate placement of DBS lead, a thorough and efficient programming is critical for a successful clinical outcome. DBS programming is a time consuming and laborious manual process. The current approach involves use of general guidelines involving determination of the lead type, electrode configuration, impedance check, and battery check. However there are no validated and well-established programming protocols. In this review, we will discuss the current practice and the recent advances in DBS programming including the use of interleaving, fractionated current, directional steering of current, and the use of novel DBS pulses. These technological improvements are focused on achieving a more efficient control of clinical symptoms with the least possible side effects. Other promising advances include the introduction of computer guided programming which will likely impact the efficiency of programming for the clinicians and the possibility of remote Internet based programming which will improve access to DBS care for the patients.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTBackground:Fear of falling in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been suggested as predictor of future falling. The purpose of this study was to compare fear of falling score after two years of follow-up with those observed at baseline and to assess factors associated with change in fear of falling over time.\nA total of 120 consecutive persons with PD were recruited and followed for two years. Fear of falling was assessed by using the 10-item Falls Efficacy Scale (FES). Occurrence of falling was registered during the first year of follow-up.\nAfter two years, the average FES score statistically significantly changed (p = 0.003) from 30.5 to 37.5 out of 100 (increase of 22.9%). We observed that median scores of all FES items, except for \"Preparing a meal, not requiring carrying of heavy or hot objects\" and \"Personal grooming,\" significantly increased after two-year follow-up. After accounting for age, gender, PD duration, levodopa dosage, Hoehn and Yayhr stage, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score three, depression, anxiety, and falling, we observed that sustaining greater number of falls in the first year of follow-up was associated with higher increase in FES score after two years (odds ratio 3.08, 95% confidence interval 1.30-4.87).\nAfter two years of follow-up, we observed a decrease in confidence at performing nearly all basic daily activities. Fall prevention programs should be prioritized in management of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system. The prevalence of PD varies considerably by age group; it has a higher prevalence in patients aged 60 years and more. Several studies have shown that statin, a cholesterol-lowering medication, reduces the risk of developing PD, but evidence for this is so far inconclusive. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between statin use and the risk of developing PD.\nPubMed, EMBASE, and the bibliographies of articles were searched for studies published between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 2017, which reported on the association between statin use and PD. Articles were included if they (1) were published in English, (2) reported patients treated with statin, and the outcome of interest was PD, (3) provided OR/HR with 95% CI or sufficient information to calculate the 95% CI. All abstracts, full-text articles, and sources were reviewed, with duplicate data excluded. Summary relative risk (RRs) with 95% CI was pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also conducted.\nWe selected 16 out of 529 unique abstracts for full-text review using our selection criteria, and 13 out of these 16 studies, comprising 4,877,059 persons, met all of our inclusion criteria. The overall pooled RR of PD was 0.70 (95% CI 0.58-0.84) with significant heterogeneity between estimates (I2\u00a0= 93.41%, p\u00a0= 0.000) for the random-effects model. In subgroup analysis, the greater decreased risk was found in studies from Asia (RR 0.62 95% CI 0.51-0.76), whereas a moderate reduction was observed in studies from North America (RR 0.69 95% CI 0.47-1.00), but less reduction was observed in studies from Europe (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.80-0.92). Also, long-term statin use, simvastatin, and atorvastatin showed a higher rate of reduction with significance heterogeneity.\nOur results showed that statin use is significantly associated with a lower risk of developing PD. Physicians should consider statin drug therapy, monitor its outcomes, and empower their patients to improve their knowledge, therapeutic outcomes, and quality of life. However, preventive measures and their associated mechanisms must be further assessed and explored.",

Several studies have shown the influence of CR on cognitive impairment and its relationship with cognitive function in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe aim of the present study was to show if CR influences the effectiveness of balance rehabilitation in PD patients who performed a conventional rehabilitative treatment.\nObservational longitudinal study.\nNeurology Outpatient Unit, University Hospital.\nFifty-three patients affected by idiopathic PD, stage 2-3 at the Hoehn and Yahr Scale.\nEach patient underwent 32 group sessions of conventional rehabilitative treatment. At baseline, patients' CR was assessed by the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq). The primary outcome was the evaluation of static and dynamic balance modifications, induced by the treatment, through the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), assessed at T0 and T1. Mini Mental State Examination, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation) and Brief Intelligence Test were assessed only at T0 and used as descriptive variables.\nConsidering the clinically meaningful change, BBS improved in 26% of patients, worsened in 2% and was unchanged in 72%. BBS score significantly improved in older patients, and in those with lower CRI total score. A significant inverse correlation was observed between changes in BBS and work and education related CR. Patients with lower baseline BBS score showed better improvement in balance.\nWe found an inverse correlation between CR level and balance improvement in PD patients who underwent conventional rehabilitation: higher improvement in BBS was observed in those with a lower CRI score. This may suggest that patients with higher CRI could benefit from more stimulating types of non-conventional rehabilitation (e.g. robotic, virtual reality).\nRehabilitation should be individually tailored considering CR as a significant variable.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) can cause severe dysphagia, especially later in disease progression. Early identification of swallowing dysfunction may lead to earlier intervention. Pharyngeal high-resolution manometry (HRM) provides complementary information to videofluoroscopy, with advantages of being quantitative and objective. Artificial neural network (ANN) classification can examine non-linear relationships among multiple variables with relatively low bias. We evaluated if ANN techniques could differentiate between patients with PD and healthy controls.\nSimultaneous videofluoroscopy and pharyngeal HRM were performed on 31 patients with early to mid-stage PD and 31 age- and sex-matched controls during thin-liquid swallows of 2\u00a0cc, 10\u00a0cc and comfortable sip volume. We performed multilayer-perceptron analyses on only videofluoroscopic data, only HRM data or a combination of the two. We also evaluated variability-based parameters, representing variability in manometric parameters across multiple swallows. We hypothesized that patients with PD and controls would be classified with at least 80% accuracy, and that combined videofluoroscopic and HRM data would classify participants better than either alone.\nClassification rates were highest with all parameters considered. Maximum classification rate was 82.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2%, recorded for 2\u00a0cc swallows. Inclusion of variability-based parameters improved classification rates. Classification rates using only manometric parameters were similar to those using all parameters, and rates were substantially lower for the comfortable sip volumes.\nResults from these classifications highlight the differences between swallowing function in patients with early and mid-stage PD and healthy controls. Early identification of swallowing dysfunction is key to developing preventative swallowing treatments for those with PD.",

    "abstract": "Despite its clinical relevance, the pathophysiology of pain in Parkinson's disease (PD) is still largely unknown, and both central and peripheral mechanisms have been invoked.\nTo investigate whether central pain processing is altered in \"drug-naive\" pain-free PD (dnPD) patients.\nUsing event-related functional MRI (fMRI), functional response to forearm heat stimulation (FHS) at two different intensities (41\u00b0C and 53\u00b0C) was investigated in 20 pain-free dnPD patients, compared with 18 healthy controls (HCs). Secondary analyses were performed to evaluate associations between BOLD signal changes and PD clinical features and behavioral responses.\nDuring low-innocuous FHS (41\u00b0C), no activation differences were found between dnPD patients and HCs. During high-noxious FHS (53\u00b0C) a significantly increased activation in the left somatosensory cortex, left cerebellum, and right low pons was observed in dnPD patients compared to HCs. In the latter experimental condition, fMRI BOLD signal changes in the right low pons (p\u2009<\u2009.0001; R\u00a0=\u00a0-0.8) and in the cerebellum (p\u2009=\u2009.004; R\u2009=\u2009-0.7) were negatively correlated with pain intensity ratings only in dnPD patients. No statistically significant difference in experimental pain perception was detected between dnPD patients and HCs.\nOur findings suggest that a functional remodulation of pain processing pathways occurs even in the absence of clinically overt pain symptoms in dnPD patients. These mechanisms may eventually become dysfunctional over time, contributing to the emergence of pain symptoms in more advanced PD stages. The comprehension of pain-related mechanisms may improve the clinical approach and therapeutic management of this disabling nonmotor symptom.",

    "abstract": "Visual dysfunction is common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to investigate the perceived impact of visual dysfunction and especially color vision loss on PD patients, and to identify retinal and disease factors associated with color vision. Thirty PD patients and thirty-four healthy controls were included. Participants performed the Farnsworth-Munsell Hue-100 test (FMT). Patients answered the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assessment, and underwent optical coherence tomography with measurement of retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer\u00a0+\u00a0inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), and outer nuclear and photoreceptor layer. Dopaminergic treatment was assessed as levodopa equivalent dose (LED). Vision domains significantly worse in PD patients compared to normative data were General Vision, Near Activities, Distance Activities, Vision-Specific Dependency, Driving, and Peripheral Vision. Worse NEI-VFQ total scores were associated with worse UPDRS, higher LED, and higher age, but not with FMT, visual acuity, or OCT measures. Only two patients (7%) reported problems with color vision. In contrast, patients performed significantly worse in the FMT than healthy controls and 17 (56.7%) patients were outside the 95th percentile of normative data. In multiple regression analyses, lower LED and higher age were associated with worse color vision in the FMT. PD patients are not aware of color vision deficits. Given the impact of color vision loss on everyday tasks in other conditions, future research should investigate the impact of vision deficits on disease burden in PD.",

    "abstract": "Background Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common comorbidity that significantly affects the quality of life and disease outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. No studies have been conducted to our knowledge to address the health care utilization and its outcomes in these patients. The aim of this study is to analyze and discern the differences in the hospitalization outcomes, comorbid conditions, and utilization of procedures in PD patients versus patients with comorbid MDD. Methods We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project from year's 2010-2014. We identified PD and MDD as a primary and secondary diagnosis respectively using validated International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, and Clinical Modification codes. Pearson's chi-square test and independent sample T-test were used for categorical data and continuous data, respectively. All statistical analysis was done by SPSS 22.0 in this study. Results Extensive analysis was performed on 63,912 patients with PD and 1445 patients with PD having MDD. Patients with comorbid depression had three times greater chances of disposition to acute care hospital (3.1% vs. 1.1%, p < 0.001). Median length of hospitalization was higher in Parkinson's patients with depression (5.85 vs. 4.08 days; p < 0.001) though the median cost of hospitalization was low ($ 31,039 vs. $ 39,464; p < 0.001). This could be because therapeutic procedures performed during the hospitalization were lower in Parkinson's patients with depression (0.53 vs. 0.89, p < 0.001). Utilization of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) was lower in Parkinson's patients with depression (9.4% vs. 25.6%, p < 0.001). In--hospital mortality was significantly higher in Parkinson's patients with depression (1.4% vs. 1.1%; p < 0.001). Conclusion Our study establishes the negative impact of depression in PD with regards to hospitalization-related outcomes including the illness severity, comorbid conditions, risk of mortality, utilization of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, the length of stay and disposition as compared to PD without depression.",

    "abstract": "Loss of dopamine neurons in the brain is a characteristic feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). TRODAT-1 is a tropane derivative that binds to dopamine transporter (DAT) receptors. It can be used for noninvasive \nRadiolabeling was performed through transchelation method. For optimization studies, varied amount of glucoheptonate (GHA) and stannous chloride was incubated with Tc-99 m for 10 min at room temperature. TRODAT-1 was added to the reaction mixture followed by incubation at 95\u00b0C for various time intervals. Phosphate buffer saline was added to maintain the pH of the final product. After performing the quality checks, whole-body imaging was performed to check the biodistribution in 4 patients at 1 h postinjection of 20-25 mCi (740-925 MBq) of Tc-99 m-TRODAT-1. Regional brain imaging was performed at 3-4 h. Clinical evaluation was done in control (\nRadiolabeling yield of 100% was achieved by incubating TRODAT-1 with Tc-99 m GHA. All the quality control indicated the suitability of radiopharmaceutical for the intravenous administration. Good uptake of Tc-99 m TRODAT-1 was observed in the striatum of normal patients. However, decreased uptake was seen in patients with PD.\nTc-99 m TRODAT-1 is a potential radiopharmaceutical for the diagnosis and staging PD which can be radiolabeled in-house with good yield leading to its easy availability.",

    "abstract": "The genetic architecture of Parkinson's Disease (PD) is complex and not completely understood. Multiple genetic studies to date have identified multiple causal genes and risk loci. Nevertheless, most of the expected genetic heritability remains unexplained. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) may provide greater statistical power and inform about the genetic architecture of multiple phenotypes. The aim of this study was to test the association between PRS and PD risk, age at onset and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (\u03b1-synuclein, A\u03b2\nThe weighted PRS was created using the genome-wide loci from Nalls et al., 2014 PD GWAs meta-analysis. The PRS was tested for association with PD status, age at onset and CSF biomarker levels in 829 cases and 432 controls of European ancestry.\nThe PRS was associated with PD status (p\u2009=\u20095.83\u00d710\nOur study suggests that there is an overlap in the genetic architecture of PD risk and onset, although the different loci present different weights for those phenotypes. In our dataset we found a marginal association of the PRS with CSF t-tau but not with \u03b1-synuclein CSF levels, suggesting that the genetic architecture for the CSF biomarker levels is different from that of PD risk.",

    "abstract": "Subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) are very common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the relationship between SCCs and objective cognitive impairment is still unclear. This study aimed to determine whether SCCs are correlated with objective cognitive performance in patients with PD.\nTotals of 148 cognitively normal patients, 71 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 31 demented patients were recruited consecutively from a movement-disorders clinic. Their SCCs and cognitive performances were evaluated using the Cognitive Complaints Interview (CCI) and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery.\nThe CCI score increased with age, duration of PD, and depression score, and was inversely correlated with cognitive performance. The association between CCI score and performance remained significant after adjustment for the depression score, age, and duration of PD. The CCI score could be used to discriminate patients with dementia from cognitively normal and MCI patients [area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.80], but not patients with MCI or dementia from cognitively normal patients (AUC of 0.67).\nSCCs as measured by the CCI are strongly correlated with objective cognitive performance in patients with PD. The CCI can also be used to screen for dementia in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), which cause Gaucher disease, are also potent risk factors for Parkinson's disease. We examined whether a genetic burden of variants in other lysosomal storage disorder genes is more broadly associated with Parkinson's disease susceptibility. The sequence kernel association test was used to interrogate variant burden among 54 lysosomal storage disorder genes, leveraging whole exome sequencing data from 1156 Parkinson's disease cases and 1679 control subjects. We discovered a significant burden of rare, likely damaging lysosomal storage disorder gene variants in association with Parkinson's disease risk. The association signal was robust to the exclusion of GBA, and consistent results were obtained in two independent replication cohorts, including 436 cases and 169 controls with whole exome sequencing and an additional 6713 cases and 5964 controls with exome-wide genotyping. In secondary analyses designed to highlight the specific genes driving the aggregate signal, we confirmed associations at the GBA and SMPD1 loci and newly implicate CTSD, SLC17A5, and ASAH1 as candidate Parkinson's disease susceptibility genes. In our discovery cohort, the majority of Parkinson's disease cases (56%) have at least one putative damaging variant in a lysosomal storage disorder gene, and 21% carry multiple alleles. Our results highlight several promising new susceptibility loci and reinforce the importance of lysosomal mechanisms in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. We suggest that multiple genetic hits may act in combination to degrade lysosomal function, enhancing Parkinson's disease susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "The neurophysiology of gait is complex and involves numerous structures in the central nervous system. Gait disorders occur frequently in Parkinson's disease (PD), and their management may become cumbersome, especially in the more advanced stages. Neuromodulatory treatments, including deep brain stimulation, cortical stimulation and spinal cord stimulation, are reviewed with respect to their effectiveness to improve gait in PD patients. Although positive effects have been reported for all of these procedures, many issues remain in view of methodological heterogeneity, variability in outcome measures and sample size. Gait in PD remains a difficult issue with a tremendous impact on quality of life, for which future research is badly needed.",

    "abstract": "Polypharmacy is common in geriatric Parkinson's disease (PD) patients in advanced disease stages with multiple comorbidities, bearing multiple risks for drug safety in theory.\nThe aim of this study was to empirically identify the most frequent and relevant contraindications and drug interactions actually occurring and compromising drug safety in PD in real life.\nWe conducted a prospective observational study in a multimorbid cohort of PD patients with polypharmacy admitted to a specialized hospital. Inclusion criteria were the presence of at least one comorbidity requiring pharmacotherapy and at least five different drugs in the discharge prescription. Hoehn and Yahr stage during the 'on' state, therapeutic problems related to motor and non-motor PD symptoms, comorbidities, and drug regimens on admission and discharge were analyzed for contraindications and interactions.\nOverall, 127 patients were included (medium Hoehn and Yahr stage\u00a0=\u00a0IV, range II-V). Interactions with the anti-PD medication were mainly caused by other central nervous system (CNS)-active substances, cytochrome P450-metabolized substances, and QT-time prolonging substances. Contraindications against the anti-PD medication mainly occurred from internal, haematopoietic, neurologic and psychiatric diseases, and QT-time prolonging drugs. The highest frequency of interactions and contraindications were identified with levodopa (n\u00a0=\u00a0119 at admission/n\u00a0=\u00a0126 at discharge), entacapone (n\u00a0=\u00a046/42), pramipexole (n\u00a0=\u00a044/24), and amantadine (n\u00a0=\u00a032/30).\nSeveral medically relevant risk factors (interactions and contraindications) frequently occurred in advanced PD patients. These findings provide a basis for developing programmes for awareness, education, monitoring, and preventive interventions to avoid adverse incidents. Future studies will need to evaluate preventive efficacy of structured drug safety programmes.",

    "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinemia and homocysteine (Hcy) mediated dopaminergic neurotoxicity is a matter of concern in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Our previous study established the involvement of oxidative stress in the substantia nigra (SN) of Hcy rat model of PD; however, the role of antioxidants, such as melatonin, was not tested in this model.\nMelatonin (10, 20 and 30mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to rats injected with Hcy in right SN (1.0\u03bcmol in 2\u03bcl saline) to investigate its potency in attenuating the behavioral abnormalities, dopamine depletion and oxidative stress prompted by Hcy.\nTreatment of melatonin protected against nigral dopamine loss and replenished the striatal dopamine loss that resulted in amelioration of rotational behavioral bias in Hcy denervated animals. Melatonin administration significantly improved mitochondrial complex-I activity and protected the SN neurons from the toxic insults of oxidative stress induced by Hcy. Amelioration of oxidative stress by melatonin in Hcy-infused SN was bought by dose-dependently scavenging of hydroxyl radicals, restoration of glutathione level and elevation in the activity of antioxidant enzymes.\nThe observations bring into light the significant neuroprotective potentials of melatonin in Hcy model of PD which is attributed to the attenuation of oxidative stress in SN.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a new research focus that are reported to influence the pathogenetic process of neurodegenerative disorders. To uncover new disease-associated genes and their relevant mechanisms, we carried out a gene microarray analysis based on a Parkinson's disease (PD) in vitro model induced by \u03b1-synuclein oligomers. This cellular model induced by 25\u202f\u03bcmol/L \u03b1-synuclein oligomers has been confirmed to show the stable, transmissible neurotoxicity of \u03b1-synuclein, a typical PD pathological marker. And several differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified in this model, such as G046036, G030771, AC009365.4, RPS14P3, CTB-11I22.1, and G007549. Subsequent ceRNA analysis determined the potential relationships between these lncRNAs and their associated mRNAs and microRNAs. The results of the present study widen our horizon of PD susceptibility genes and provide new pathways towards efficient diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by chronic and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in substansia nigra pars compacta. Oxidative stress is proposed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PD. Uric acid (UA), as an important physiological antioxidant, is identified a molecular predictor associated with a decreased risk and a slower disease progression for PD and potential neuroprotectant of PD by increasing epidemiological and clinical evidences. Within this review, we will present a comprehensive overview of the data linking UA to PD in recent years.\nWe searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science databases for relevant studies. Any observational or experimental studies that evaluated UA and PD were our goal of searching the electric databases.\nTwelve studies that evaluated UA and PD were identified in this review. We reviewed the roles of UA in the pathogenesis of PD, the association of UA with morbidity, severity/progression, nonmotor symptoms, motor complications of PD, with an attempt to provide new ideas for diagnosis and treatment in PD.\nOur findings supported that lots of clinical and epidemiological data observed lower UA levels in PD patients. Manipulation of UA or its precursors' concentration could be effective to treat or prevent PD. However, it is still suspectable that higher UA levels are better enough to PD patients. Furthermore, for the complex nature of PD and its heterogeneous genetic and environmental influences, it is inadequate for just manipulating UA in treating the disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neuro-degenerative disorder, and novel therapeutic targets are required for the treatment of PD. Juglanin is a natural compound extracted from the crude Polygonum aviculare, exhibiting anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activities. In our study, PD in mice was induced by systemic LPS treatment as evidenced by enhanced \u03b1-synuclein and reduced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which were reversed by juglanin treatment. Moreover, juglanin administration attenuated LPS-caused behavioral and memory impairments and reduced LPS-induced enhancement of neuro-degenerative markers, including amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) and p-Tau. Additionally, juglanin ameliorated synaptic functionality through promoting the expression of synaptic markers, such as SYP, PSD-95 and SNAP-25. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in brain regulates neuroinflammation, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, LPS induced neuroinflammation through the acceleration of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-18 (IL-18) and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), via activating TLR4/nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB pathway in hippocampus of mice and microglia cells. Juglanin significantly reduced LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and blocked TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway. We also found that LPS-induced astrocytes (AST) activity was prevented by juglanin through down-regulating glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Iba1 in vivo and in vitro. Together, our results indicated that juglanin ameliorated neuroinflammation-related memory impairment, and neurodegeneration through impeding TLR4/NF-\u03baB, indicating its potential for PD prevention.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), one kind of post-transcriptional modification, mediate transcriptional silencing of various metabolic enzymes that are involved in various life processes, including Parkinson's disease. At present, the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is not clear, although many studies suggest that miRNAs play a very important role in the progress of Parkinsonism. This paper reviews the biological characteristics of miRNAs and summarizes the progress of miRNAs in reference to the diagnosis and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. It even considers miRNAs as a potential target for Parkinson's disease therapy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is, without doubt, a burden on modern society as the prevalence increases significantly with age. Owing to this growing number of PD cases, it is more critical than ever to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying PD to identify therapeutic targets. The discovery of genetic mutations associated with PD and parkinsonism paves the way toward this goal. Even though, familial forms of the disease represent the minority of PD cases and some forms are so rare that there are only a few affected families, the research on the associated genes is invaluable. Recent additions to PARK mutations are those in PARK15 that encodes the F-box protein O-type 7 (FBXO7). In this review, we highlight the recent research on FBXO7, which advances our knowledge of the etiopathological pathways and fills unexpected gaps therein, justifying the dedicated study of rare variants of PD.",

    "abstract": "Damage of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) results in similar characteristics to the cognitive deficiency seen with the progress of Parkinson's disease (PD). Since the course of mPFC damage is still unclear, our study aimed to investigate the effects of melatonin (MT) on neurotoxicity in the mPFC of a rat model of PD.\nOne hundred and fifty-four normal, male Wistar rats were randomly divided into the following five groups: normal + normal saline (NS), normal + 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), sham pinealectomy (PX) + 6-OHDA, PX + 6-OHDA, and MT + 6-OHDA. 6-OHDA was injected into the right substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) of each group, except normal + NS, 60 days after the PX. In the MT treatment group, MT was administered immediately after the intraperitoneal injection at 4 p.m. every day, for 14 days. Neuronal apoptosis in the mPFC was examined using the TUNEL method, while the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), Bax,and Bcl-2 in this region was measured using immunohistochemistry. The concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the mPFC was examined using the thiobarbituric acid method.\nRats in the normal + 6-OHDA and sham PX + 6-OHDA groups were combined into one group (Group N + 6-OHDA) since there was no significant discrepancy between the groups for all the detected parameters. Apoptosis of cells in the NS, MT + 6-OHDA, N + 6-OHDA, and PX + 6-OHDA groups was successively significantly increased (Hc = 256.25, P < 0.001). The gray value of TH (+) fibers in the NS, MT + 6-OHDA, N + 6-OHDA, and PX + 6-OHDA groups was also successively significantly increased (F = 99.33, P < 0.001). The staining intensities of Bax and Bcl-2 were as follows: Group NS +/+, Group MT + 6-OHDA ++/+, Group N + 6-OHDA ++/+, and PX + 6-OHDA +++/+. The concentrations of MDA in the NS, MT + 6-OHDA, N + 6-OHDA, and PX + 6-OHDA groups were significantly increased in sequence (Hc = 296.309, P < 0.001).\nNeuronal damage of the VTA by 6-OHDA might induce VTA-mPFC nerve fibers to undergo anterograde nerve damage, in turn inducing transneuronal damage of the mPFC. PX significantly exacerbated the neurotoxicity in the mPFC, which was induced by the neuronal injury of the VTA. However, MT replacement therapy significantly alleviated the neurotoxicity in the mPFC.",

    "abstract": "'Wearing off' refers to the phenomenology of movement disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) that appears early and is much commoner than generally believed. It may be present in the form of either motor symptoms or non-motor symptoms.\nTo investigate the utility of wearing-off questionnaire (WOQ-19, Italian version) in the outpatient clinical practice to assess the suitability of different combinations of treatment, in various stages of PD.\n73 consecutive patients (58% male and 42% female) suffering from PD were recruited through the Santorso Hospital and San Martino Hospital from September 2012 to March 2014. The patients were asked to indicate whether or not they experienced any of the 19 symptoms listed in the questionnaire during the day; if one or more of these referred symptoms relating to PD improved after taking an additional dose of levodopa; and, if these variations were present routinely. Furthermore, we also evaluated the possible correlation between the presence of motor and non-motor symptoms that were listed in the WOQ 19 with the motor impairment assessed by the Hoehn and Yahr stage (HY) and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III motor section, in the whole patient cohort as well as in different subgroups undergoing therapy.\nAmong the 73 patients, 22% were receiving levodopa (a mean daily dose of 300 \u00b1 121.3 mg), 38.3% levodopa and dopamine agonists, 12.3% levodopa/rasagiline, 8.2% levodopa/selegiline, and 19.2% a combination of levodopa/dopamine agonists (DA)/monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI). The most prevalent symptoms were the non-motor symptoms included in the WOQ-19. A significant correlation between the scores obtained on the different motor and non-motor items recorded by the WOQ-19 and the UPDRS motor section and HY scores was found. The therapeutic benefit was especially related to the motor symptoms.\nIn clinical practice, this simple and easily administered questionnaire may be useful for the early detection of fluctuations in symptomatology in patients with PD. It will, therefore, help to improve the quality of the global care of patients with PD detected in various stages of the disease.",
