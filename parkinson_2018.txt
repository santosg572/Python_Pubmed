    "abstract": "This study evaluated the adherence of physicians to the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines on Parkinson's Disease (CPTG-PD) within the scope of the Unified Health System (SUS). A descriptive analysis of 375 drug application documents sent to the Pharmaceutical Services of the Rio Grande do Sul State Public Health Department (AF/SES/RS) between March and September 2016, and a structured survey to evaluate the physician's perception about the protocol and barriers to its use was conducted. Only 5.33% of the requests analyzed presented all the necessary data, considering the criteria of the protocol. The requests from specialists had a higher percentage of adherence to the diagnostic and dose criteria (p<0.05). The main barriers to protocol use were the lack of awareness or familiarity with the protocol (48%) and the lack of time to complete the mandatory documents (52%). More recently qualified physicians tended to perceive fewer barriers to protocol use (p<0.05). The results indicate that actions are still necessary to implement the PCDT-DP in medical practice, focusing on care and management teams. Greater integration between pharmaceutical assistance and the healthcare network is needed.\nEste estudo avaliou a ades\u00e3o de m\u00e9dicos ao Protocolo Cl\u00ednico e Diretrizes Terap\u00eauticas para a Doen\u00e7a de Parkinson (PCDT-DP), no \u00e2mbito do SUS. Dois m\u00e9todos complementares foram utilizados: avalia\u00e7\u00e3o descritiva de 375 solicita\u00e7\u00f5es de medicamentos encaminhadas \u00e0 Assist\u00eancia Farmac\u00eautica da Secretaria de Estado da Sa\u00fade do Rio Grande do Sul, de mar\u00e7o a setembro de 2016, e levantamento por meio de question\u00e1rio estruturado aos prescritores para investigar a percep\u00e7\u00e3o de barreiras \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Apenas 5,33% das solicita\u00e7\u00f5es analisadas apresentaram ades\u00e3o completa \u00e0s recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es do protocolo. As solicita\u00e7\u00f5es oriundas de especialistas em DP tiveram maior ades\u00e3o aos crit\u00e9rios para o diagn\u00f3stico (p<0,05) e dose do medicamento (p<0,05). Dentre as respostas ao question\u00e1rio destacaram-se como principais barreiras a falta de tempo para preenchimento dos documentos obrigat\u00f3rios (52%) e nenhum ou pouco conhecimento sobre o protocolo (48%). M\u00e9dicos com menor tempo de exerc\u00edcio de profiss\u00e3o tendem a perceber menos barreiras para a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do protocolo (p<0,05). Os resultados indicam a necessidade de a\u00e7\u00f5es de implementa\u00e7\u00e3o do PCDT-DP \u00e0 pr\u00e1tica m\u00e9dica, direcionadas \u00e0s equipes assistenciais e de gest\u00e3o, e maior integra\u00e7\u00e3o da assist\u00eancia farmac\u00eautica com a rede de aten\u00e7\u00e3o.",

    "abstract": "The closed-loop cortico-subcortical pathways of basal ganglia have been extensively used to describe the physiology of these centres and to justify the functional disorders of basal ganglia diseases. This approach justifies some experimental and clinical data but not others, and furthermore, it does not include a number of subcortical circuits that may produce a more complex basal ganglia dynamic than that expected for closed-loop linear networks. This work studied the functional connectivity of the main regions of the basal ganglia motor circuit with magnetic resonance imaging and a new method (functional profile method), which can analyse the multiple covariant activity of human basal ganglia. The functional profile method identified the most frequent covariant functional status (profiles) of the basal ganglia motor circuit, ordering them according to their relative frequency and identifying the most frequent successions between profiles (profile transitions). The functional profile method classified profiles as input profiles that accept the information coming from other networks, output profiles involved in the output of processed information to other networks and highly interconnected internal profiles that accept transitions from input profiles and send transitions to output profiles. Profile transitions showed a previously unobserved functional dynamic of human basal ganglia, suggesting that the basal ganglia motor circuit may work as a dynamic multiple covariance network. The number of internal profiles and internal transitions showed a striking decrease in patients with Parkinson's disease, a fact not observed for input and output profiles. This suggests that basal ganglia of patients with Parkinson's disease respond to requirements coming from other neuronal networks, but because the internal processing of information is drastically weakened, its response will be insufficient and perhaps also self-defeating. These marked effects were found in patients with few motor disorders, suggesting that the functional profile method may be an early procedure to detect the first stages of the Parkinson's disease when the motor disorders are not very evident. The multiple covariance activity found presents a complementary point of view to the cortico-subcortical closed-loop model of basal ganglia. The functional profile method may be easily applied to other brain networks, and it may provide additional explanations for the clinical manifestations of other basal ganglia disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by intracellular \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) deposition. Alternation of the \u03b1-Syn expression level in plasma or erythrocytes may be used as a potential PD biomarker. However, no studies have compared their prognostic value directly with the same cohort.\nThe levels of \u03b1-Syn in plasma and erythrocytes, obtained from 45 PD patients and 45 control subjects, were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Then, correlation and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were performed to characterize the predictive power of erythrocytic and plasma \u03b1-Syn.\nOur results showed that \u03b1-Syn expression levels in both plasma and erythrocytes were significantly higher in PD patients than in control subjects (823.14 \u00b1 257.79 vs. 297.10 \u00b1 192.82 pg/mL, p < 0.0001 in plasma; 3,104.14 \u00b1 143.03 vs. 2,944.82 \u00b1 200.41 pg/mL, p < 0.001 in erythrocytes, respectively). The results of the ROC analysis suggested that plasma \u03b1-Syn exhibited better predictive power than erythrocytic \u03b1-Syn with a sensitivity of 80.0%, specificity of 97.7%, and a positive predictive value of 77.8%. The expression level of plasma \u03b1-Syn correlated well with the age of patients, H-Y stage, MoCA scale, and UPDRS motor scale. On the contrary, there was no correlation between erythrocytic \u03b1-Syn level and clinical parameters in this study.\nOur results suggest that plasma \u03b1-Syn could be a specific and sensitive potential diagnostic biomarker for PD.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorder (ICD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a critical nonmotor symptom with personality or neuropsychiatric traits contributing to ICD.\nThis study aimed to identify predictive traits for persistent or paradoxical aggravation of ICD after dopamine agonist substitution therapy for ICD in PD.\nWe conducted a case-control study using a database of a multicenter intervention trial for ICD in PD. The poor-outcome group was defined by showing paradoxical increases in ICD behaviors after the substitution of dopamine agonists with levodopa. We analyzed the pre-intervention personality traits associated with the poor outcome and also evaluated the risk traits for refractory ICD using a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.\nThe poor-outcome group showed higher levels of anger expression (p =0.007) and obsessive-compulsive traits (p =0.009) compared with the good-outcome group at the pre-intervention state. In the ROC curve analysis, the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory showed the highest area under the curve with 80.0% sensitivity and 74.3% specificity in discriminating against the poor-outcome group.\nOur results suggest that assessment of obsessive compulsiveness may be useful for predicting the refractoriness of ICD behaviors in planning an interventional treatment for ICD in PD.",

    "abstract": "Chronic deep brain stimulation (CDBS) is a surgical treatment that reduces the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although CDBS has been in use for a long time, very little has been reported on its supposed effects on cognition, particularly in relation to implants in the subthalamic nucleus. The results of the rare studies that do exist are controversial, and in many cases the studies have several design flaws. The present study compared cortical activation during three tasks (action execution, action observation and motor imagery) in PD patients with and without subthalamic implants. The study sample consisted of 36 volunteers, divided into three groups: healthy controls, PD patients with CDBS of the subthalamic nucleus, and PD patients without CDBS. Through a quantitative electroencephalogram assessment, absolute beta power was examined to observe the interaction between group and cognitive motor tasks. The electrodes at sites Fp1, Fp2, F7, F8, F3, Fz and F4, located in the prefrontal and frontal regions, were analyzed and a Group x Task interaction (p < 0.05) was observed for all of them. These findings suggest that CDBS of the subthalamic nucleus is efficient in reducing some of the effects of PD in these study tasks. At the same time, the dysfunctions found in several cortical areas, characteristic of PD, limited the effects of the CDBS. The results of this study suggest that CDBS of the subthalamic nucleus can modulate cognitive-motor aspects of PD.",

    "abstract": "The Barthel Index (BI) is used in Italy to measure the severity of disability and to identify patients suitable for admission to rehabilitation units. The objective of this psychometric study was to validate the Italian version of the BI in a population of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The study was conducted at three neurological and rehabilitation centres in Rome, Italy. The BI was administered to outpatients with PD. The reliability of the scale was assessed using Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency; the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to measure its intra- and inter-rater reliability. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to evaluate its validity, comparing it with the Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), the Italian version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Short Form 36-Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). The BI was administered to 94 patients with PD. The psychometric properties measured were significant: Cronbach's alpha was 0.866 and the ICC for intra- and inter-rater reliability was 0.998 and 0.993, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient showed good correlation with the PDQ-39, GDS, HADS and SF-36 (p < 0.01). The BI is a valid and reliable tool for measuring disability in a PD population.",

    "abstract": "Exercise ameliorates the quality of life and reduces the risk of neurological derangements such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Irisin is a product of the physical activity and is a circulating hormone that regulates the energy metabolism in the body. In the nervous system, Irisin influences neurogenesis and neural differentiation in mice. We previously demonstrated that co-treatment of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) with a neurotrophic factor reduce Parkinson's symptoms. Our goal in this project was to evaluate whether Irisin with BMSCs can protect the dopaminergic (DA) neurons in PD.\n35 adult male Wistar rat weighing (200-250 g) were chosen. They were separated into five experimental groups (n=7). To create a Parkinson's model, intranasal (IN) administration of the MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) was used. The BMSCs (2\u00d7106) and Irisin (50 nm/ml) was used for 7 days for treatment after creation of the PD model. After completion of the tests (4 weeks), their brains were used for the TUNEL and immunohistochemical (IHC) assays.\nOne of the important results of this study was that the Irisin induce BMSCs transport into the injured area of the brain. Co-treatment of the Irisin with BMSCs increased tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons (TH+) in substantia nigra (SN) and striatum of the PD mice brain. In this group, the number of TUNEL-positive cells significantly decreased. Behavioral symptoms were better in the combination group and Irisin simultaneously.\nCo- treatment of Irisin with BMSCs protects the DA neurons from degeneration and apoptotic process after MPTP injection.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a selective loss of the neurons in the midbrain area called the substantia nigra pars compacta and the loss of projecting nerve fibers in the striatum. Predominant pathological hallmarks of PD are the degeneration of discrete neuronal populations and progressive accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein-containing intracytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies and dystrophic Lewy neuritis. There is currently no therapy to terminate or delay the neurodegenerative process as the exact mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PD require further investigation. The identification and validation of novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD is a great challenge using contemporary approaches and optimizing sampling handling as well as interpretation using bioinformatics analysis. In this review, recent evidences associated with multi-omic data-sets and molecular mechanisms underlying PD are examined. A combined mapping of several transcriptional evidences could establish a patient-specific signature for early diagnose of PD though eligible systems biology tools, which can also help develop effective drug-based therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease with manifestations related to oxidative stress and damage to the skeletal striated musculature. This study evaluated the electromyographic fatigue of the masseter and temporal muscles in individuals with Parkinson's disease. The median frequency of the normotensive electromyographic signal was analyzed in 16 individuals, aged between 50 and 70 years, with Parkinson's disease in stages I and III of the Hoehn and Yahr disability scale (n=8) or without the disease (n=8). The data were tabulated and analyzed statistically (t-test, p .05). Compared with the group without Parkinson's disease, the group with the disease showed an increase in the median frequency, with significant differences for the right masseter (p=.05) and the right temporal (p=.03) muscles. The results suggest that there is a link between Parkinson's disease and functional alterations of the masticatory system, especially when electromyographic fatigue is assessed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting a large number of elderly people worldwide. The current therapies for PD are symptom-based; they do not provide a cure but improve the quality of life. Muscular dysfunction is the hallmark clinical feature of PD and oxidative stress and inflammation play a critical role in its pathogenesis. Epalrestat is used for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and is known to improve antioxidative defense mechanisms in the CNS. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the role of Epalrestat in the reserpine induced mouse model of PD.\nWe used Swiss Albino mice for the PD model and tested for akinesia/bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, palpebral ptosis, and tremor, as well as conducting swim and open field tests. Brain samples were used to determine oxidative stress parameters and infiltration of immune cells.\nEpalrestat treatment significantly improved akinesia and bradykinesia, muscular dysfunctions, tremor level, and gait functions compared to the reserpine group. It also improved the latency in the swim test. Eplarestat significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and NO concentration in different brain tissues and increased the activity of antioxidative enzymes, glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. Furthermore, Epalrestat reduced neuroinflammation by reducing the number of infiltrating immune cells.\nEplarestat improves muscular dysfunction in PD by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.",

The common symptoms of PD are rest tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity.\nThe present study was devised to find out the clinical features and risk factors associated with PD in a population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nA total of 600 PD patients and 1,200 control individuals took part in this study. The participants filled out a standard questionnaire.\nThis study found a significant association between PD and exposure to pesticides (p < 0.0001) and doing work on farms (p < 0.0001). The use of aldrin was significantly associated with PD (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, we also found that PD status was associated with individuals who have a history of depression, hypertension, head injury, and Alzheimer's disease. This study also showed that the PD rate was lower in those who were using tobacco products.\nIn this case-control study, we revealed some environmental and medical conditions that are linked with PD. To control the disease, we must minimize exposure to pesticides, and the government and scientific community should play their role.",

    "abstract": "The most pressing need in Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical practice is to identify agents that might slow down, stop or reverse the neurodegenerative process of Parkinson's disease and therefore avoid the onset of the most disabling, dopa-refractory symptoms of the disease. These include dementia, speech and swallowing problems, poor balance and falling. To date, there have been no agents which have yet had robust trial data to confirm positive effects at slowing down the neurodegenerative disease process of PD. In this chapter we will review the reasons why there is growing interest in drugs currently licensed for the treatment of diabetes as agents which may slow down disease progression in PD, including a review of the published trials regarding exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist licensed to treat type 2 diabetes, and recently shown to be associated with reduced severity of PD in a randomized, placebo controlled washout design trial of 60 patients treated for 48 weeks. This subject is now a major area of interest for multiple pharmaceutical companies hoping to bring GLP-1 receptor agonists forward as treatment options in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure. In order to better understand the pathological mechanisms which lead to neuronal cell death and to accelerate the process of drug discovery, a reliable in vitro model is required. Unfortunately, research into PD and neurodegeneration in general has long suffered from a lack of adequate in vitro models, mainly due to the inaccessibility of live neurons from vulnerable areas of the human brain. Recent reprogramming technologies have recently made it possible to reliably derive human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients and healthy subjects to generate specific, difficult to obtain, cellular sub-types. These iPSC-derived cells can be employed to model disease to better understand pathological mechanisms and underlying cellular vulnerability. Therefore, in this chapter, we will discuss the techniques involved in the reprogramming of somatic cells into iPSCs, the evolution of iPSC differentiation methods and their application in neurodegenerative disease modeling.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has classically been defined as a movement disorder, in which motor symptoms are explained by the aggregation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) and subsequent death of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). More recently, the multisystem effects of the disease have been investigated, with the immune system being implicated in a number of these processes in the brain, the blood, and the gut. In this review, we highlight the dysfunctional immune system found in both human PD and animal models of the disease, and discuss how genetic risk factors and risk modifiers are associated with pro-inflammatory immune responses. Finally, we emphasize evidence that the immune response drives the pathogenesis and progression of PD, and discuss key questions that remain to be investigated in order to identify immunomodulatory therapies in PD.",

    "abstract": "In the elderly, functional balance, fear of falling, and independence in daily living activities are interrelated; however, this relationship may change under the influence of drug phase and the severity of disease in individuals with idiopathic Parkinson disease. This study aimed to investigate the association of functional balance, fear of falling, and independence in the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) with the drug on- and drug off-phases.\nA total of 140 patients with Parkinson disease (age: Mean\u00b1SD; 60.51\u00b112.32 y) were evaluated in terms of their functional balance, fear of falling, and independence in their daily activities by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fall Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-ADL (UPDRS-ADL), respectively, in drug on- and drug off-phases. The Hoehn and Yahr scale recorded global disease rating. The Spearman coefficient, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney tests were used to find out whether the distribution of scale scores differs with regard to functional balance or disease severity.\nA strong correlation was found between the functional balance, fear of falling, and independence in ADL with both drug phases. The results also showed the significant difference in the distribution of the FES-I and UPDRS-ADL scores with regard to functional balance (except independence in ADL in drug off-phase). Also, the distribution of the scores of BBS, FES-I, and UPDRS-ADL showed significant differences with regard to disease severity.\nThe study showed a strong correlation between functional balance, fear of falling, and independence in ADL that can be affected by the drug phase and severity of the disease. However, more studies are needed to understand this relationship precisely.",

    "abstract": "To explore disease burden in Parkinson disease (PD) by evaluating the prevalence of symptoms and key disease milestones (critical events, e.g., hospitalization or frequent falls) and their association with quality of life (QOL) in those with PD.\nWe created and pretested an online needs assessment survey to evaluate the clinical characteristics, QOL, symptom prevalence, and critical event frequency among those with PD. We recruited individuals with self-reported Hoehn and Yahr stage II-V PD through online postings and email through the Davis Phinney Foundation. We used logistic regression to evaluate the association between a large number of uncontrolled symptoms and events on QOL.\nA total of 612 individuals (mean age 70.1 years, 49.8% women) completed the survey. Among respondents, 13.6% reported poor QOL. Nearly 20% of respondents reported >3 falls, and 15% of respondents had been hospitalized over the previous 6 months. Participants had an average of 5.1 uncontrolled symptoms, with 86.1% of respondents reporting at least 1 uncontrolled symptom; more than 10% of respondents reported >10 uncontrolled symptoms. Depression, confusion, pain, and bothersome hallucinations were associated with poor QOL among the cohort.\nIn this national survey of individuals with PD, we identified poor QOL, frequent critical events, and numerous uncontrolled symptoms among a substantial proportion of respondents. Although motor symptoms were common, only nonmotor symptoms were associated with poor QOL. Many of these symptoms and events are treatable or preventable, highlighting the need for better identification and management to improve QOL among those with PD.",

    "abstract": "To examine the role of KSOP1009 (a modified formulation of Suhexiang Wan essential oil) in an animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD) induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) injection.\nCell toxicity, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were analyzed in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. After that, changes in animal behavior and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein levels in the substantia nigra (SN) of MPTP-injected mice were examined. Three different doses of KSOP1009 (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg, n = 8 for each group) were administered daily for 7 d before MPTP injection and 14 d after MPTP injection, totaling 21 d.\nMPP+, the active metabolite of MPTP, decreased the viability of SH-SY5Y cells, whereas KSOP1009 alleviated MPP+-induced cytotoxicity. KSOP1009 (10 and 50 mg/mL) reduced MPP+-induced ROS generation compared with the control group. Treatment with 1 mM MPP+ increased the percentage of depolarized/live cells, whereas KSOP1009 intake at a dose of 10 mg/mL decreased the percentage of these cells. The mean latency to fall in the rotarod test was reduced in mice treated with MPTP compared with the control group. However, mice receiving three different doses of KSOP1009 performed better than MPTP-treated animals. MPTP-treated mice were more hesitant and took longer to traverse the balance beam than the control animals. In contrast, KSOP1009-treated mice performed significantly better than MPTP- treated mice. Furthermore, the KSOP1009-treated groups had a significantly higher number of TH-positive neurons in the lesioned SN and significantly higher expression of TH in the striatum than the MPTP-treated group. MPTP treatment strongly induced Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, whereas KSOP1009 suppressed MPTP-induced JNK activation. In addition, KSOP1009 intake reversed the decrease in the phosphorylation levels of cAMP-response element-binding protein in the brain of MPTP-treated mice. KSOP1009 also restored the decrease in dopaminergic neurons and dopamine levels in the brain of MPTP-treated mice.\nKSOP1009 protected mice against MPTP-induced toxicity by decreasing ROS formation and restoring mitochondrial function.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder. It is reported that most of PD patients have voice impairments. But these voice impairments are not perceptible to common listeners. Therefore, different machine learning methods have been developed for automated PD detection. However, these methods either lack generalization and clinically significant classification performance or face the problem of subject overlap.\nTo overcome the problems discussed above, we attempt to develop a hybrid intelligent system that can automatically perform acoustic analysis of voice signals in order to detect PD. The proposed intelligent system uses linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction and genetic algorithm (GA) for hyperparameters optimization of neural network (NN) which is used as a predictive model. Moreover, to avoid subject overlap, we use leave one subject out (LOSO) validation.\nThe proposed method namely LDA-NN-GA is evaluated in numerical experiments on multiple types of sustained phonations data in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthew correlation coefficient. It achieves classification accuracy of 95% on training database and 100% on testing database using all the extracted features. However, as the dataset is imbalanced in terms of gender, thus, to obtain unbiased results, we eliminated the gender dependent features and obtained accuracy of 80% for training database and 82.14% for testing database, which seems to be more unbiased results.\nCompared with the previous machine learning methods, the proposed LDA-NN-GA method shows better performance and lower complexity. Clinical Impact: The experimental results suggest that the proposed automated diagnostic system has the potential to classify PD patients from healthy subjects. Additionally, in future the proposed method can also be exploited for prodromal and differential diagnosis, which are considered challenging tasks.",

    "abstract": "Although non-motor symptoms (NMS) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often worsen as the severity of motor symptoms (MS) increases, few studies have assessed the associated factors of non-motor symptoms.\nThis study aims to determine whether the presence of NMS in PD patients is associated with or independent from the severity of MS considering confounders.\nThe registry of PD patients from seven facilities in Japan was used. Multiple logistic regression was performed with each domain and item of the Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) as objective variables. Severity of motor symptoms was assessed by Hoehn & Yahr stage (HY stage) as an explanatory variable. The analysis was adjusted for sex, age, disease duration, presence/absence of wearing off and dyskinesia, clinical phenotypes and Levodopa equivalent daily dose.\nA total of 1037 patients were analyzed. Analysis by NMSS domain showed higher odds ratios (ORs) in patients with higher HY stages compared with patients with lower HY stages for domains D1 (cardiovascular), D2 (sleep/fatigue), D3 (mood/apathy), D4 (perceptual problems/hallucinations), D5 (attention/memory), and D6 (gastrointestinal) (ORs: 1.54-2.72, P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). However, only domains D7 (urinary) and D8 (sexual dysfunction) were not associated with HY stage. Item 2 (fainting) and Item 14 (delusions) showed higher ORs in the HY stage 4-5 (ORs: 9.95 and 5.92, P\u00a0<\u00a0.05).\nMost NMS worsened with exacerbation of MS in PD patients, however some NMS domains were also affected with other factors. These findings contribute to the understanding of the clinical picture of PD and may improve personalized medicine and research in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, presumably due to increased apoptosis. In previous studies, we showed altered expression of proteins involved in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) antiapoptotic and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) apoptotic pathways of translational control in experimental cellular and animal models of PD.\nIn this work, our results showed clear modifications in the expression of kinases involved in mTOR and PKR apoptosis pathways, in lymphocytes of PD patients treated or not with anti-PD treatment (levodopa), which confirmed the role played by apoptosis in the pathogenesis of this disease and the positive effect of treatment with medication on this parameter. Others proteins involved in apo-ptosis were also evaluated in lymphocytes of patients as the expression of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and caspase-3.\nTranslational control is altered in PD and hence its evaluation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells may serve as an early marker of apoptosis and indicate the efficacy of the dopaminergic treatment.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between pain, freezing of gait (FOG) and falls in Parkinson's Disease (PD).\nThe study included 110 PD patients. The Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr Scale were used to evaluate disease severity. The patients self-reported occurrence of FOG and falls, and the FOG Questionnaire was administered to evaluate the severity of FOG. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure the severity of pain and pain localization was self-reported by the patients.\nFifty-eight of the patients had FOG and 43 experienced falls. Among the patients, 42 had no pain, whereas 35 had lower extremity pain. Higher UPDRS motor and FOG scores, and advanced-stage disease were noted in significantly more of the patients with FOG and falls. VAS scores were not affected by the presence of FOG or falls. There was a positive correlation between the severity of FOG and VAS score in the male patients (r=0.308; p=0.010). More patients with falls had lower extremity pain than those without falls (r=0.308; p=0.010).\nPatients with FOG and falls had more severe motor findings. Pain is correlated with both FOG and falls. Further investigations should be done to understand the mechanism of this relationship to prevent the motor complications in advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) are at increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Reliable biomarkers are required for objective identification of cognitive decline in PD. In this pilot study, serum levels of well-known mediators of neuroinflammation were measured in PD patients with or without MCI to find out the involvement of neuroinflammation and microglial activation in PD-MCI.\n36 PD-MCI, 25 PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and 19 healthy controls were recruited. Serum levels of NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1), NLRP3, caspase-1, NF-kB, IL-1b and IL-18 were measured by ELISA and a panel of neuropsychological tests was administered.\nPD-MCI patients showed significantly reduced levels of NF-kB, IL-1b and IL-18, whereas NLRP1, NLRP3 and caspase-1 levels were comparable among PD-NC and PD-MCI patients. IL-18 levels were positively correlated with Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised and Symbol Digit Modalities Test scores.\nLevels of several microglial activation mediators are reduced in PD-MCI patients inferring a protective role to certain inflammation factors against cognitive decline in PD.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) present with complex and variable symptoms, with recent findings suggesting that the etiology of PD extends beyond the involvement of just the basal ganglia. These symptoms include significant impairments in the speech and swallowing domains, which can greatly affect quality of life and therefore require therapeutic attention. This research-based update reviews the neurophysiological basis for swallowing and speech changes in PD, the effectiveness of various types of treatments, and implications for symptom evaluation and management.\nThe mechanisms responsible for swallowing and speech symptoms in PD remain largely unknown. Dopaminergic medication and deep-brain-stimulation do not provide consistent benefits for these symptoms suggesting a non-dopaminergic network is involved. Importantly, evidence suggests that symptoms of dysphagia and hypokinetic dysarthria may be early indications of PD, so it is critical to investigate the cause of these changes.",

    "abstract": "This research was aimed to investigate the effects of baicalin on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the main mechanism of baicalin based on metabolomics.\nThe rat model of PD was induced by 6-OHDA. The protective effects of baicalin on rat model of PD were evaluated by open field test and rotarod test. The anti-PD efficacy of baicalin was evaluated by examining the morphologic changes of neurons and the level of monoamine neurotransmitters in the striatum, the number and morphology of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons, and oxidative stress. Combined with metabolomics methods, the pharmacodynamic mechanism of baicalin on PD pathogenesis was also explored.\nBaicalin treatment improved the rod time and voluntary movement in rat model of PD (\nBaicalin has significant protective effect on 6-OHDA-induced PD rats, which may play a protective role through an antioxidant, promoting the release of neurotransmitters and regulating the metabolism of N-acetyl aspartate and glutamate.",

We enrolled 7 ambulatory individuals to have the device installed in the bedroom of their homes over 8 weeks and performed standard PD assessments at baseline. We evaluated the ability of the device to objectively measure gait and time in bed and to generate novel visualizations of home activity. We captured 353 days of monitoring. Mean gait speed (0.39-0.78 m/s), time in bed per day (4.4-12.1 h), and number (1.4-5.9) and duration (15.0-49.8 min) of nightly awakenings varied substantially across and within individuals.

    "abstract": "There is an increasing recognition of the significant non-motor symptoms that burden people with Parkinson's disease. As such, there is a pressing need to better understand and investigate the mechanisms underpinning these non-motor deficits. The electrical activity within the brains of people with Parkinson's disease is known to exhibit excessive power within the beta range (12-30 Hz), compared with healthy controls. The weight of evidence suggests that this abnormally high level of beta power is the cause of bradykinesia and rigidity in Parkinson's disease. However, less is known about how the abnormal beta rhythms seen in Parkinson's disease impact on non-motor symptoms. In healthy adults, beta power decreases are necessary for successful episodic memory formation, with greater power decreases during the encoding phase predicting which words will subsequently be remembered. Given the raised levels of beta activity in people with Parkinson's disease, we hypothesized that the necessary decrease in power during memory encoding would be diminished and that this would interfere with episodic memory formation. Accordingly, we conducted a cross-sectional, laboratory-based experimental study to investigate whether there was a direct relationship between decreased beta modulation and memory formation in Parkinson's disease. Electroencephalography recordings were made during an established memory-encoding paradigm to examine brain activity in a cohort of adults with Parkinson's disease (",

    "abstract": "Twenty PD subjects trained NW for 12 weeks, with a frequency of twice per week. Each session lasted about 60 minutes. Twenty patients in the control group did not use any form of physiotherapy (no-intervention group). Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ), the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and the Provocative Test for Freezing and Motor Blocks (PTFMB) were performed at baseline, immediately after the end of NW program, and three months later.\nThe results of FOGQ, TUG, and total PTFMB revealed significant improvement after completing the exercise program, and this effect persisted at follow-up. The results of the PTFMB subtests showed a different effect of NW on particular subtypes of FoG. Start hesitation, sudden transient blocks that interrupt gait, and blocks on turning improved considerably, while motor blocks, when walking through narrow space and on reaching the target, did not respond to NW training. \nThe present study showed that NW training had a beneficial effect on FOG in PD and that the achieved improvement is long-lasting. Future research should clarify whether the observed improvement limited to FoG triggered by only some circumstances reflects different pathomechanisms of FoG subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Functional mobility (FM) is a person's ability to move to accomplish activities of daily living; it bridges the concepts of mobility and functional ability. There is frequently a loss of FM in Parkinson's disease (PD). Several instruments have been used to assess this concept in PD; however, there is no consensus on which are the most appropriate.\nWe aimed to identify and critically appraise which measurement instruments have been used to assess FM.\nA systematic review was conducted using the databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PEDro from their inception to January 2019 to identify all observational and experimental studies conducted in PD or atypical parkinsonism that included an FM assessment. Two reviewers independently screened citations, extracted data, and assessed clinimetric properties.\nWe included 95 studies that assessed FM in PD. Fifty-five (57.9%) studies mentioned FM in the article, and 39 (41.1%) specified the measurement tools used to evaluate FM. FM was the primary outcome in 12 (12.6%) studies. The Timed Up and Go test was the most frequently used measurement tool. Only one study presented a definition of FM. Several overlapping terms were used, the most common being mobility.\nSeveral studies reported the use of FM measurement tools in PD, though with frequent misconceptions, an inadequate context of use, or suboptimal assessment. We propose the establishment of the concept of FM applied to PD, followed by the adequate clinimetric validation of existing measurement tools to provide a comprehensive and reliable evaluation of FM in PD.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the change of serum indirect bilirubin (IBIL) concentrations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and whether IBIL concentrations were associated with the motor subtypes of PD.\nA case-control study was performed to evaluate differences in bilirubin concentrations between 78 PD subjects and 78 controls. Venous blood samples were collected, and total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), and IBIL concentrations were analyzed between PD subjects and controls. PD patients were classified into three motor subtypes: tremor-dominant (TD), intermediate (I), and postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD). It was evaluated whether there were differences in IBIL concentrations between the different motor subtypes and between motor subtypes and controls.\nPD patients had lower IBIL concentrations compared to controls (6.51 \u00b1 4.03 vs. 10.82 \u00b1 4.61, p< 0.001). There was no significant difference in IBIL concentrations between PD males and PD females (6.66 \u00b1 3.64 vs. 6.22 \u00b1 4.79, p =0.655). IBIL concentrations had negative relationships with levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD) (R = -0.452, p < 0.001) and positive relationships with tremor score (R = 0.360, p = 0.001). IBIL concentrations were significantly lower for PIGD than for TD subtype (4.88 \u00b1 4.03 vs. 9.00 \u00b1 4.15, p< 0.001). The lower IBIL concentrations in PD compared to controls were mainly driven by the PIGD patients.\nPD subjects showed lower levels of IBIL compared to controls. Higher IBIL levels were associated with TD motor subtype in PD, which could be related to the antioxidative properties of IBIL.",

IBIL concentrations were significantly lower for PIGD than for TD subtype (4.88 \u00b1 4.03 vs. 9.00 \u00b1 4.15, p< 0.001). The lower IBIL concentrations in PD compared to controls were mainly driven by the PIGD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with movement and balance impairments. Although studies have reported improvement of motor symptoms with physical exercise, the mechanisms by which exercise is beneficial remains poorly understood. Our study addresses the exercise-induced changes to peripheral immune cells by interrogating the transcriptome of blood-derived leukocytes in PD patients before and after exercise. Patients attended 1 h exercise classes twice a week for 12 weeks. Leukocytes were collected at the beginning and end of the study for gene expression analysis by RNA-seq or quantitative real-time PCR. We correlated differentially expressed genes after exercise with clinical measures and analyzed the potential functions of gene changes with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and Gene Ontology analysis. Exercise improved measures of movement and balance when compared with scores before the exercise program. Among the gene changes, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology analysis suggests that T-cell receptor signaling, T-cell activation, and T-cell migration pathways were downregulated, while the T-cell receptor signaling pathway was the most significantly correlated with clinical measures. To further investigate T-cell-related changes in PD leukocytes, we reanalyzed the differentially expressed genes from publicly available microarray data and found that genes in the T-cell activation, differentiation, and migration pathways were upregulated in PD samples compared to controls in a time-dependent manner. Together, our findings suggest that exercise rehabilitation may improve movement and balance in PD patients by reversing the upregulated T-cell activation pathways associated with PD. This study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under ChiCTR-TRC-14004707. Registered on May 27, 2014.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease. The diagnosis of PD based on neuroimaging is usually with low-level or deep learning features, which results in difficulties in achieving precision classification or interpreting the clinical significance. Herein, we aimed to extract high-order features by using radiomics approach and achieve acceptable diagnosis accuracy in PD.\nIn this retrospective multicohort study, we collected \nTwenty-six brain ROIs were identified. Six thousand one hundred and ten radiomic features were extracted in total. Among them 30 features were remained after feature selection. The accuracies of the proposed method achieved 90.97%\u00b14.66% and 88.08%\u00b15.27% in Huashan and Wuxi test sets, respectively.\nThis study showed that radiomic features and SVM could be used to distinguish between PD and NC based on 18F-FDG PET images.",

    "abstract": "Sequence variants in glucocerebrosidase (GBA) are a major genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), and display ethnic-dependent frequencies, for example, variants such as p.N370S and 84insGG are common in Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Notably, there are limited studies on black patients from the African continent; hence, we conducted a study on 30 South African black PD patients. All 11 exons of GBA were screened using a nested PCR approach to avoid pseudogene contamination. We identified previously described Gaucher's disease-associated variants, p.R120W in one patient [age at onset (AAO) of 35\u00a0years], and p.R131L in another patient (AAO 30 years) and in her affected sibling (AAO 45\u00a0years). In addition, we found 3 previously identified [p.K(-27)R, p.T36del, and p.Q497*] and 2 novel (p.F216L and p.G478R) variants. Screening of ethnic-matched controls for the novel variants revealed that the allele frequency of p.F216L was 9.9%, whereas p.G478R was not found in the controls. Studies such as these are important and necessary to reveal the genetic architecture underlying PD in the understudied patients of African ancestry.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies comparing objective sleep measures between patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and control participants were limited by their small sample size. The purpose of this study was to compare objective sleep measures between large-scale cohorts of PD outpatients and community-based older adults.\nIn this cross-sectional study, we measured sleep parameters for 157 PD patients using an actigraph on the non-dominant wrist for six consecutive nights (95 Hoehn-Yahr stage I/II; 62 Hoehn-Yahr stage III-V). Moreover, two consecutive nights of actigraphy were performed on 1101 community-based control participants aged \u226560 years.\nIn multivariable analysis, sleep efficiency (SE) was significantly lower in patients with late-stage PD by 17.5% [95% confidence interval: 15.3%-19.7%] and early-stage PD by 9.4% [7.6%-11.1%] compared to the controls (67.1% and 75.3% vs. 84.6%, respectively). Similar results were observed for wake after sleep onset (WASO) and fragmentation index (FI). Total sleep time and sleep onset latency (SOL) were significantly shorter in patients with late- and early-stage PD stage compared to the controls. Among PD patients, significant association trends between advancement of individual Hoehn-Yahr stages and worsened sleep measures of SE, WASO, and FI were observed independently of age, gender, levodopa equivalent dose, and motor function parameter.\nThis study demonstrated significant and quantitative differences in objective sleep quality and quantity between PD patients and control participants. Furthermore, with advancement of disease stages, objectively measured sleep quality worsened in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "To compare a 6-week virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation programme with a conventional rehabilitation programme in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nProspective, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial.\nOutpatients.\nFifty-one patients with Parkinson's disease were assigned at random to a VR rehabilitation programme or a conventional rehabilitation programme.\nBoth programmes ran for 6 consecutive weeks, with a 40-minute session three times per week.\nThe Balance Berg Scale (BBS) was used to measure balance. Secondary outcome measures were: Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) to evaluate ability to adapt gait to complex walking tasks; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scale to measure performance of the upper limb; and Short Form 36 (SF-36) to evaluate quality of life.\nThe VR rehabilitation programme led to an increase in BBS score {45.6 [standard deviation (SD) 7.9] vs 49.2 (SD 8.1), mean difference 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 5.9; P=0.003}, DGI score [18.7 (SD 4.7) vs 20.2 (SD 4.2), mean difference 1.6, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.5; P=0.003] and SF-36 mental composite score [37.7 (SD 11.4) vs 43.5 (SD 9.2), mean difference 5.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 11.3; P=0.037], and a decrease in DASH scale score [29.6 (SD 17.5) vs 21.6 (SD 15.1), mean difference -7.9, 95% CI -13.7 to -2.2; P=0.009]. In contrast, the conventional rehabilitation programme only led to a decrease in DASH scale score [30.3 (SD 18.1) vs 25.1 (SD 15.8), mean difference -5.2, 95% CI -8.8 to -1.5; P=0.007].\nThese findings suggest that rehabilitation is useful in Parkinson's disease, and the VR rehabilitation programme was more effective in determining overall improvement than the conventional rehabilitation programme.\nNCT02807740.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's is a common progressive neurological condition characterised by impairments of movement and balance; and non-motor deficits. It is now accepted that physical activity is a fundamental for people with Parkinson's (PwP), despite this PwP remain inactive. There is a social and financial drive to increase physical activity for PwP through physical self-management, however little is known about this concept.\nThis scoping review provides an overview of the literature concerning physical self-management for PwP and its provision, participation and uptake by PwP.\nSystematic search of the databases; Medline, EMBASE, HMIC, CDSR, Cochrane Methods Studies, DARE, CINAHL, PEDro, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library using the search terms 'Parkinson*' and 'self-manag*' was undertaken alongside citation and grey literature searching and a consultation exercise.\nA narrative summary was undertaken to describe the current state of the literature.\n1959 studies were identified with nineteen papers from seventeen studies meeting the inclusion criteria - Three reviews, four experimental studies, three pre-post-test designs, six cross-sectional designs, one qualitative interview design and two mixed method designs.\nThe findings of this scoping review suggest a need for clarity on what 'physical self-management' means and involves, with a gap between what the evidence promotes and what is being achieved by PwP. Further research should focus on the amount, type, intensity and duration of physical self-management models including behavioural change approaches and how, where and by whom this should be implemented.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the construct validity of two dexterity measures, the 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) and Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT) in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nCross-sectional observational study.\nTesting was conducted at the university or in participants' homes.\nThirty community dwelling people with mild to moderately severe PD and no major upper limb comorbidities or cognitive impairments.\nPegboard tests were administered in the 'on' and 'end-of-dose' phases of participants' PD medication cycles. Participants rated hand function with two self-report questionnaires - the Manual Ability Measure-36 (MAM-36) and a subset of upper limb items from the MDS-UPDRS. To explore construct validity, we compared 'on' phase pegboard scores with normative values for unimpaired men and women and investigated relationships between pegboard scores and hand function questionnaires.\nIn the 'on' phase, pegboard scores were poorer than normative values. Differences in individual subtest scores ranged between 10 and 41%. Correlations between self-reported hand function and pegboard scores were weak to moderately strong in the 'on' phase (r=0.21-0.51), and weak at 'end-of-dose' (r=0.13-0.22). Higher correlation coefficients were observed between hand function and PPT subtest scores than with hand function and 9HPT scores. Most participants reported difficulty with daily hand tasks.\nWe found evidence for construct validity supporting the use of the 9HPT and PPT to evaluate people with mild to moderately severe PD when 'on', but not at the 'end-of-dose'. Results also suggest that the PPT may be more sensitive to PD-related changes in dexterity than the 9HPT.",

Without appropriate treatment, coronary vasospasm is also a potentially fatal condition due to ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation. A rare case of cardiac arrest due to coronary vasospasm during general anesthesia in a patient with pre-existing WPW syndrome is presented.\nA 55-year-old man was scheduled for brain surgery under general anesthesia. During surgery, the ECG monitor showed ST segment elevation followed by sustained ventricular tachycardia and the patient's blood pressure was unmeasurable. Since pseudo-VT with WPW syndrome was suspected, pilsicainide was administered. A few weeks later, a spasm provocation test with acetylcholine was performed, which showed complete spastic occlusion of the right coronary artery.\nA rare case of cardiac arrest during surgery in a patient with WPW syndrome, possibly caused by coronary vasospasm, was described.",

    "abstract": "Mechanism by which \u03b1-synuclein affects the progression of Parkinson's disease through Pyrin Domain Containing Protein 3 (NLRP3) was explored. Peripheral blood plasma of 40 Parkinson's disease patients and 40 normal healthy people attending the department of neurology of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical University were collected from March 2018 to January 2019. The expression levels of oligomers, phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein, interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1) in plasma were detected by ELISA. Astrocytes in mouse brain tissues were extracted by primary culture method, the cells were divided into drug group and the drug + inhibitor group. After adding 0, 5, 10 and 20 \u00b5g oligomerized \u03b1-synuclein or 5 mM autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), the expression level of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2 and Atg5 proteins in the cells was detected. The expression level of IL-1\u03b2 in peripheral blood of PD patients was significantly increased (0.604\u00b10.136 \u00b5mol/l vs. 1.876\u00b10.327 \u00b5mol/l, P=0.002), while there was no significant difference between IL-6 and TGF-\u03b1. Both oligomers (0.171\u00b10.045 \u00b5mol/l vs. 0.676\u00b10.084 \u00b5mol/l, P<0.0001) and phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein (0.128\u00b10.041 \u00b5mol/l vs. 0.849\u00b10.108 \u00b5mol/l, P<0.0001) in peripheral blood of PD patients were significantly elevated. The expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 in mouse astrocytes all increased with the increase of the concentration of oligomerized \u03b1-synuclein, and Atg5 protein expression also increased gradually with the concentration, and reached the highest level when the concentration was 10 \u00b5g/ml. The expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 were inhibited after the addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. \u03b1-synuclein mediates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in PD patients by upregulating Atg5 protein expression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by hypokinetic motor features; however, patients also display non-motor symptoms like sleep disorders. The standard treatment for PD is dopamine replacement with L-DOPA; however, symptoms including gait deficits and sleep disorders are unresponsive to L-DOPA. Notably, these symptoms have been linked to aberrant activity in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). Of late, clinical trials involving PPN deep brain stimulation (DBS) have been employed to alleviate gait deficits. Although preclinical evidence implicating PPN cholinergic neurons in gait dysfunction was initially promising, DBS trials fell short of expected outcomes. One reason for the failure of DBS may be that the PPN is a heterogenous nucleus that consists of GABAergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic neurons that project to a diverse array of brain structures. Second, DBS trials may have been unsuccessful because PPN neurons are susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction, Lewy body pathology, and degeneration in PD. Therefore, pharmaceutical or gene-therapy strategies targeting specific PPN neuronal populations or projections could better alleviate intractable PD symptoms. Unfortunately, how PPN neuronal populations and their respective projections influence PD motor and non-motor symptoms remains enigmatic. Herein, we discuss normal cellular and neuroanatomical features of the PPN, the differential susceptibility of PPN neurons to PD-related insults, and we give an overview of literature suggesting a role for PPN neurons in motor and sleep deficits in PD. Finally, we identify future approaches directed towards the PPN for the treatment of PD motor and sleep symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most frequently occurring movement disorder, with an increasing incidence due to an aging population. For many years, the post-mortem brain was regarded as the gold standard for the analysis of the human pathology of this disease. However, modern stem cell technologies, including the analysis of patient-specific neurons and glial cells, have opened up new avenues for dissecting the pathologic mechanisms of PD. Most data on morphological changes, such as cell death or changes in neurite complexity, or functional deficits were acquired in 2D and few in 3D models. This review will examine the prerequisites for human disease modeling in PD, covering the generation of midbrain neurons, 3D organoid midbrain models, the selection of controls including genetically engineered lines, and the study of cell-cell interactions. We will present major disease phenotypes in human ",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation is a surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease. Its impacts on motor symptoms are widely reported; however, little is known about the broader impact of deep brain stimulation on the community lives of people with Parkinson's disease. Lifespace is a measure of lived community mobility, providing an indication of community access and participation.\nThis pilot study explored the feasibility of remotely monitoring the qualitative and quantitative community outcomes related to deep brain stimulation.\nA longitudinal mixed methods study with a convergent design was undertaken exploring the lifespace, quality of life, life satisfaction and lived experiences of people with Parkinson's disease before and after deep brain stimulation. Data were collected through questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and a smartphone-based application which collected geolocation data.\nQuantitative and qualitative data from eight participants living with Parkinson's disease were analysed and integrated. At baseline, participants had a median age of 68 years and a median Hoehn and Yahr score of 2. Measuring a range of community-based outcomes indicated different change trajectories for individuals across outcomes. Key content areas were developed from the qualitative data: participation in occupations and travel and home. This study indicates the potential value of including geolocation data-based lifespace collection in metropolitan and regional areas.\nMonitoring lifespace in conjunction with subjective measures provides insights into the complex and individually varied experiences. Further research could explore the impacts of deep brain stimulation on occupations and community participation to gain a deeper understanding of the related needs and support clinical approaches.",

    "abstract": "There is insufficient data in the literature regarding the real-life, daily clinical practice evaluation of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (APD). We are not sure what is the upper limit of dopaminergic medication, especially the levodopa (LD) dosage, and how it is influenced by access and suitability to the various add-on and device-aided therapies (DAT).\nThis retrospective study explored the profile of APD patients that were considered and systematically evaluated regarding the suitability for DAT.\nWe analyzed the data from 311 consecutive patients with APD hospitalized between 2011 and 2017 that 1) described at least 2 hrs/day off periods divided into at least two instances/day (except early morning akinesia), 2) were in stage 3 or above on the Hoehn and Yahr scale, 3) were with or without dyskinesia, and 4) received at least four levodopa doses/day combined with adjuvant therapy.\nOf the 311 patients enrolled initially, 286 patients showed up for the second visit, of which in 125 cases we assessed that DAT would be necessary. Finally, 107 patients were tested in our clinic to confirm the efficacy of LCIG. Patients selected for DAT had significantly longer off periods, more frequent dyskinesia, early morning akinesia, and freezing despite having significantly higher LD doses than those with an improved conservative therapy.\nPatients with APD can have a variety of symptoms, and because symptoms and therapeutical efficacy can be manifested in many different combinations, it is not possible to decide using a single, rigid set of criteria which APD patient is eligible for DAT. Nevertheless, treating physicians should refer APD patients to a specialized movement disorder center when patients with an average daily dose of LD of at least 750-1000 mg and maximal complementary therapies present daily motor complications that significantly reduce the quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is caused by the deficiency of dopamine, the neurotransmitter that has an effect on specific uptake region of the substantia nigra. Identification of PD is quite tough at an early stage.\nThe present work proposes an expert system for three dimensional Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) image to diagnose the early PD.\nThe transaxial image slices are selected on the basis of their high specific uptake region. The processing techniques like preprocessing, segmentation and feature extraction are implemented to extract the quantification parameters like Intensity, correlation, entropy, skewness and kurtosis of the images. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifiers using Radial Basis Function kernel (RBF) are implemented and their results are compared in order to achieve better performance of the system. The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity analysis, accuracy, Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) and Area Under the Curve (AUC).\nIt is found that RBF-ELM provides high accuracy of 98.2% in diagnosing early PD. In addition, the similarity among the features is found out using K-means clustering algorithm to compute the threshold level for early PD. The computed threshold level is validated using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).\nThe proposed system has a great potential to assist the clinicians in the early diagnosis process of PD.",

    "abstract": "Various numbers of factors such as oxidative stress, neurotoxins, and pesticides have been implicated in its pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Paraoxonas1 (PON1) metabolizes xenobiotics, including pesticides. Therefore, we surveyed the relationship between PON1 polymorphisms with its activities in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease..\nWe investigated polymorphisms of the PON1 (L55M and Q192R) by PCR-RFLP assays; we also measure the levels of PON1, TAC (total antioxidant capacity) and TOS (total oxidant status) with ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and spectrophotometric method for their activities.\nParaoxonase and arylesterase activity of PON1 as well as their concentrations were lower in patients with PD compared with control group, but from the view of the specific activity, it was not significant between two groups. In the compare of TAC, TOS, and OSI, the TOS and OSI were higher in the patients than controls, while patients had lower levels of TAC compared with controls. Serum PON1 concentrations and activities were higher in LL (comparison with LM and MM) and RR (comparison with QR and QQ) genotypes while we did not observe any significant differences in arylesterase levels among mentioned polymorphisms.\nIn the current study, we reported associations between PON1 polymorphisms (55, 192) and enzyme activities in Parkinson's disease as there was a significant reduction in PON1 levels in patients with Parkinson compared with healthy. Taken together, paraoxonase enzyme in subjects with different genotypes could be a potential biomarker for determining the severity and prognosis of Parkinson. However, more studies are needed to clarify its clinical values. Key words: Parkinson's disease; paraoxonase1; Polymorphism.",

    "abstract": "6-Hydroxy-BDE-47 (6-OH-BDE-47) is an important in vivo metabolite derived from 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), a ubiquitous environmental pollutant. The chemical has been widely detected in environmental and biological samples. However, as a potential neurotoxin, whether 6-OH-BDE-47 could promote the development of typical neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) is still unknown. Here, we tested the potential PD-related neurotoxic effect of 6-OH-BDE-47 in rat. The chemical with levels of 0.1, 1 and 10\u00a0\u00b5g was stereotaxically injected into the right midbrain regions of rat where contain abundant dopaminergic neurons. The resulting deteriorated motor function and decreased levels of striatal dopamine and nigrostriatal tyrosine hydroxylase indicate the dopaminergic neuron loss after the injection. Proteomics study revealed that protein degradation pathways were affected. Western blot analysis confirmed that 6-OH-BDE-47 could inhibit ubiquitination and autophagy, resulting in the increased formation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregate, an important pathological hallmark of PD. Overall, our study demonstrated that the 6-OH-BDE-47 administration could induce motor defect by impairing dopaminergic system and promote \u03b1-syn aggregation by inhibiting ubiquitination and autophagy, suggesting that the occurrence of 6-OH-BDE-47 in brain could be a risk for developing PD.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases involve the progressive deterioration of structures within the central nervous system responsible for motor control, cognition, and autonomic function. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are among the most common neurodegenerative disease and have an increasing prevalence over the age of 50. Central in the pathophysiology of these neurodegenerative diseases is the loss of protein homeostasis, resulting in misfolding and aggregation of damaged proteins. An element of the protein homeostasis network that prevents the dysregulation associated with neurodegeneration is the role of molecular chaperones. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are chaperones that regulate the aggregation and disaggregation of proteins in intracellular and extracellular spaces, and evidence supports their protective effect against protein aggregation common to neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, upregulation of HSPs, such as HSP70, may be a target for therapeutic intervention for protection against neurodegeneration. A novel therapeutic intervention to increase the expression of HSP may be found in heat therapy and/or heat acclimation. In healthy populations, these interventions have been shown to increase HSP expression. Elevated HSP may have central therapeutic effects, preventing or reducing the toxicity of protein aggregation, and/or peripherally by enhancing neuromuscular function. Broader physiological responses to heat therapy have also been identified and include improvements in muscle function, cerebral blood flow, and markers of metabolic health. These outcomes may also have a significant benefit for people with neurodegenerative disease. While there is limited research into body warming in patient populations, regular passive heating (sauna bathing) has been associated with a reduced risk of developing neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, the emerging evidence is compelling and warrants further investigation of the potential benefits of heat acclimation and passive heat therapy for sufferers of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the main risk factor of which is age, is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, thus presenting a substantial burden on the health of affected individuals as well as an economic burden. Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a subtype in the family of sirtuins, belongs to class III histone deacetylases (HDACs). It is known that SIRT2 levels increase with aging, and a growing body of evidence has been accumulating, showing that the activity of SIRT2 mediates various processes involved in PD pathogenesis, including aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), microtubule function, oxidative stress, inflammation, and autophagy. There have been conflicting reports about the role of SIRT2 in PD, in that some studies indicate its potential to induce the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, and that inhibition of SIRT2 may, therefore, have protective effects in PD. Other studies suggest a protective role of SIRT2 in the context of neuronal damage. As current treatments for PD are directed at alleviating symptoms and are very limited, a comprehensive understanding of the enzymology of SIRT2 in PD may be essential for developing novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease. This review article will provide an update on our knowledge of the structure, distribution, and biological characteristics of SIRT2, and highlight its role in the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "To study the relationship between the physical condition, degree of motor disturbances and power loading in former athletes with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe study included 20 men with PD, including 10 power athletes with training loads in the youth for more than 5 years and 10 non-athletic patients. A medical history of PD and accompanied hypertension were analyzed, body mass index and power hand index were measured and the orthostatic test from supine to sitting position was made. Motor function was assessed with the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale of the Movement Disorder Society (MDS UPDRS) - part III.\nFormer athletes with PD were younger compared to non-athletic patients (57.44\u00b18,14 vs. 66.78\u00b14.29 years; p<005) and had longer duration of the disease (6.56\u00b15,36 vs. 3.60\u00b13.50 years; p<0.05). The orthostatic reaction of the former athletes was accompanied by increasing of diastolic blood pressure (DBP), while there was a decrease in DBD in the non-athletic men. Hypokinetic syndrome was more pronounced in the former athletes. The slowing of movements (bradykinesia) were accessed as 3 points on MDS UPDRS in 6 people and 4 points in 4. The results show the impact of power training on the course and presentations of PD in former athletes.\n\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0418\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0438 \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0437\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0435 \u0443 \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c\u044e \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f). \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u044b. \u041e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 20 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d \u0441 \u0411\u041f, \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u0438\u0445 10 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0437 - \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 5 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 10 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u0423 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0442\u0449\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0437 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438, \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u0438, \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0441\u044b \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0430, \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0438, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443. \u041c\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044e \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0411\u041f (MDS UPDRS - \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c III). \u0420\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0437, \u0432 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u043b\u0438\u0446, \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043c, \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430 (57,44\u00b18,14 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 66,78\u00b14,29 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430;

    "abstract": "An important approach to an early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is screening for peripheral biomarkers in patients at the early clinical stage. In this study, we evaluated catecholamine concentration changes in the tear fluid of untreated PD patients as biomarkers. Norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations in the tear fluid of patients were found to increase compared to those in age controls, which was especially pronounced on the side where motor symptoms appeared. On the contrary, the epinephrine concentration in the tear fluid of patients was reduced bilaterally. Since there was no reason to consider the markers found in the clinical stage of PD as markers of the preclinical stage, we additionally studied the tear fluid composition in mouse neurotoxic models of PD preclinical and clinical stages. The norepinephrine concentration in the tear fluid of mice from the clinical stage model was found to be higher than that in controls; in the preclinical stage model, the norepinephrine concentration had a tendency to increase. Therefore, both PD patients and mice from PD preclinical and clinical stage models manifest unidirectional changes in their tear fluid compositions, which may be considered as promising biomarkers for the development of early diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is one of the common and burdensome non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying neuropathology mechanism in PD patients with EDS (PD-EDS) remains unclear. The present study aims to delineate potential locations of structural alteration of subcortical regions in early stage and drug-na\u00efve PD-EDS.\nThe study had 252 patients with PD and 92 matched healthy controls (HC). EDS was estimated with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, with a cutoff of 10. Ultimately, 59 patients were considered as PD-EDS. The remaining 193 were PD patients without EDS (PD-nEDS). FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) was employed to assess the volumetric and surface alterations of subcortical nuclei in PD and PD-EDS.\nVolumetric analyses found no difference in the subcortical nucleus volume between PD and HC, or PD-EDS and PD-nEDS groups. The shape analyses revealed the local atrophic changes in bilateral caudate and right putamen in patients with PD. In addition, the hypertrophic changes were located in the right putamen and left pallidum in PD-EDS than in PD-nEDS.\nOur findings revealed the regional hypertrophy of the striatum in PD-EDS. Our results indicate that local hypertrophic striatum would be a valuable early biomarker for detecting the alteration in PD-EDS. The shape analysis contributes valuable information when investigating PD-EDS.",

    "abstract": "Persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience somatic and psycho-emotional limitations. As a neurodegenerative disease with increasing motor symptoms, PD changes the body experience. Embodied activities like dancing are beneficial to individuals with PD regarding mobility, balance and body feeling. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of Tango Argentino (TA) on body experience in individuals with PD.\nThis qualitative study was conducted among 12 individuals with PD and their dance partners participating in TA courses for persons with PD and uses semi-standardized interviews. The heterogeneity of the sample was mainly based on the number of TA classes, so that participants were distinguished in participants with 10\u202fh (beginners) and participants with more than 10\u202fh (advanced). Further variance was due to different age groups and duration of disease.\nParticipants reported change on five categories of body experiences: body awareness, motor symptoms and movement, general feelings, body sensations and disease-related feelings. Participants cited a shift in body awareness and improved stability, walking safety, enhanced mobility and amelioration in gestures and facial expressions. In general, participants described reduced body fatigue, anxiety, shame and frustration and increase in joy, pride, curiosity as well as reinforcement of partnership. With regard to perception, positive and negative feelings, ease, relaxation and increase of inner congruence were reported. The experience of normality and health helped to generate greater acceptance of disease burdens and to develop self-confidence and self-assurance. Dance partners confirmed the perceptions of the dancers with PD.\nThe perceived effects of TA courses may be linked to a positive body awareness and body control which may be related improved motor symptoms, social and everyday life. These perceived effects should be controlled in relation to the long time change in embodied activity and body experience in persons with PD.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to explore the clinical characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) comorbidity with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), explore the correlation between OSA and PD features and identify factors that are independent predictors of OSA in PD patients.\nIn sum, 239 PD patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of OSA (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) score \u22655) (PD-OSA vs PD-non-OSA). Blinded to sleep apnea status, participants underwent an extensive assessment to determine demographic features, concomitant disease, disease severity, polysomnography (PSG) characteristics and non-motor symptoms (NMSs).\nOf the 239 patients, 66 (27.62%) had an AHI score \u22655, including 14.2% (34/239) with mild, 6.7% (16/239) with moderate, and 6.7% (16/239) with severe sleep apnea. The binary logistic regression analyses indicated that age and male gender were risk factors for OSA, while rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorder (RBD) and higher Levodopa equivalent dose (LED) were protective factors for OSA. PD-OSA patients had higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores than those of PD-non-OSA patients. No differences were found for other NMSs between groups.\nOur data suggest that OSA in PD was lower in patients with RBD and higher LED. RBD and higher LDEs were significant protective factors for OSA in PD. OSA in PD was increased with age and male gender. Age and male gender were risk factors for OSA in PD. OSA can aggravate excessive daytime somnolence in PD patients but is not associated with other NMSs.",

    "abstract": "Hyposmia is common in Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). We evaluated the pattern of olfactory functional connectivity (FC) in AD and PDD to uncover neural correlates that are related to olfactory dysfunction. This study enrolled 57 patients with AD and PDD and 25 control subjects. Using a seed-based approach, we compared the resting-state network from the seed-region-of-interest in the olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, piriform cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) between groups. The PDD group showed lower FC with striatal-thalamic-frontal regions from the olfactory bulb than the AD group. The PDD group showed lower FC from left OFC with striatal-frontal regions and lower FC from right OFC with left fronto-temporal areas than the AD group. In a correlation analysis, the FC from left OFC with right insula that differed between the PDD and control groups was positively correlated with olfactory function. The present study demonstrated that this distinct olfactory functional network pattern may represent different neural mechanisms for olfactory dysfunction in AD and PDD.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and associated with reduced functional abilities and increased dependence. To date, however, little is known about the relationship between performance of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and cognitive stages in PD, and there are conflicting reports as to whether declines in specific cognitive domains predict IADL impairment.\nParticipants with PD were drawn from the Pacific Udall Center and included in the study if both participant and study partner IADL ratings and cognitive tests were completed (n = 192). Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether participant and/or study partner rating predicted mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Correlations are reported for the relationship between participant/study partner IADL reports as well as for specific cognitive tests.\nAlthough both participant and study partner ratings of IADL performance were associated with a diagnosis of PD with dementia, only participant self-rating of functional ability was significantly associated with a diagnosis of PD with mild cognitive impairment. Functional ability correlated most strongly with measures of processing speed, auditory working memory, and immediate verbal recall for both the participant and study partner ratings.\nFor participants with PD in the early stages of cognitive decline, self-rating may be more sensitive to the impact of cognitive changes on IADL function than ratings made by a knowledgeable study partner. Changes in executive function, processing speed, and learning may indicate a higher likelihood of IADL impairment. Careful assessment of cognition and IADL performance is recommended to permit individualized interventions prior to significant disability.",

Careful assessment of cognition and IADL performance is recommended to permit individualized interventions prior to significant disability.",

    "abstract": "Treatment response in PD is important clinically and for research diagnostic criteria, but few objective data show treatment-responsiveness of PD motor features.\nTo evaluate the treatment response of motor features to moderate treatment doses in a \"real-world\" PD cohort.\nWe analyzed data from a community-based incident cohort of PD in North-East Scotland (PINE study). We assessed change in the UPDRS motor scale and its individual items over a period of up to 13 months comparing (1) patients with an increase of at least 300 mg of levodopa-equivalent dose (LED) and (2) patients without treatment change, matched for age, sex, and disease duration.\nWe identified 101 matched pairs of patients with and without a treatment increase. LED increases were mostly 300 to 375 mg/day. Forty-two percent with treatment increase had \u226530% improvement in overall UPDRS motor score, a further 35% had substantial subjective improvement, but only 1 had an objective excellent (>70%) treatment response. Women responded better than men by 5.4 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7-8.1). All motor features improved with treatment, but after adjustment for age, sex, and initial score, only rest tremor (\nMotor items sometimes previously considered dopa unresponsive have small improvements with moderate LED increases. Women respond better than men. Excellent treatment responses are uncommon. These data can inform clinical decisions about treatment.",

    "abstract": "Exercise is gaining extreme relevancy as a new therapeutic intervention for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the frequent misuse of the concepts exercise, physiotherapy, and physical activity limits the possibility of summarizing research findings. This review aims to clarify these concepts and summarize the evidence on exercise in PD.\nWe critically appraised physical activity-related concepts and conducted a systematic review of clinical trials evaluating exercise interventions in PD. Additionally, we discussed the implications for PD clinical practice and research.\nExercise is a subset of physical activity, and a major component of physiotherapy for PD management, having as the main goal to improve physical fitness. The appraisal of the 83 identified clinical trials found high variability in exercise interventions. Multimodal exercise was the most studied, and 60 minutes, two times/week for 12\u2009weeks, the most reported prescription parameters.\nThe best available evidence recommends increasing physical activity levels in PD. Exercise and physiotherapy programs seem the most efficacious strategies to achieve this goal. As a result of the heterogeneity in the type and manner exercise is prescribed, it is not possible to propose strong recommendations for exercise in PD.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder with disabling motor symptoms and no available disease modifying treatment. The majority of the PD cases are of unknown etiology, with both genetics and environment playing important roles. Over the past 25 years, however, genetic analysis of patients with familial history of Parkinson's and, latterly, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have provided significant advances in our understanding of the causes of the disease. These genetic insights have uncovered pathways that are affected in both genetic and sporadic forms of PD. These pathways involve oxidative stress, abnormal protein homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lysosomal defects. In addition, newly identified PD genes and GWAS nominated genes point toward synaptic changes involving vesicles. This review will highlight the genes that contribute PD risk relating to intracellular vesicle trafficking and their functional consequences. There is still much to investigate on this newly identified and converging pathway of vesicular dynamics and PD, which will aid in better understanding and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "We have performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the current evidence of the pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and safety profile of oral melevodopa/carbidopa fixed combination in the management of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nSearch has been started from common libraries and was then restricted to articles of studies in humans with melevodopa/carbidopa as fixed combination. Abstracts of international congresses have been also explored. The search has led to the identification of one PK study and five efficacy/safety studies that included more 743 PD patients overall, 488 of which treated with melevodopa/carbidopa effervescent tablets (Sirio\u00ae, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., Parma, Italy).\nMelevodopa/carbidopa has a more rapid absorption, less apparent drug accumulation, less inter-patient variability and more effective LD delivery after the early morning and early afternoon dose compared to standard LD. Although they differed in used dose regimens, duration of treatment and endpoints, the results of the efficacy/safety studies suggest that treatment with melevodopa/carbidopa may determine improvements in motor fluctuations compared to treatment with standard LD/CD formulations, with no increased risk of adverse effects or LD-induced dyskinesias.\nData from literature have shown that melevodopa/carbidopa in a highly soluble formulation as effervescent oral tablets is effective in improving control of motor complications in PD patients compared to conventional levodopa. Further research is needed to confirm this evidence in large controlled trials and to explore if melevodopa/carbidopa may have a potential role in the earlier phases of the disease or in special PD populations.",

    "abstract": "Long-term population-representative data on motor fluctuations and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease is lacking.\nThe Cambridgeshire Parkinson's Incidence from GP to Neurologist (CamPaIGN) cohort comprises incident PD cases followed for up to 13\u2009years (n = 141). Cumulative incidence of motor fluctuations and levodopa-induced dyskinesias and risk factors were assessed using Kaplan-Meyer and Cox regression analyses.\nCumulative incidence of motor fluctuations and levodopa-induced dyskinesias was 54.3% and 14.5%, respectively, at 5\u2009years and 100% and 55.7%, respectively, at 10\u2009years. Higher baseline UPDRS-total and SNCA rs356219(A) predicted motor fluctuations, whereas higher baseline Mini-mental State Examination and GBA mutations predicted levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Early levodopa use did not predict motor complications. Both early motor fluctuations and levodopa-induced dyskinesias predicted reduced mortality in older patients (age at diagnosis >70\u2009years).\nOur data support the hypothesis that motor complications are related to the severity of nigrostriatal pathology rather than early levodopa use and indicate that early motor complications do not necessarily confer a negative prognosis. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) implantation under general anesthesia (GA) is of great importance for patients with disabling off-medication symptoms or medical comorbidities. However, the relative advantages/disadvantages of routine local anesthesia (LA) surgery versus GA regarding clinical outcomes are controversial, and the safety of DBS implantation under GA is debatable.\nWe systematically reviewed the literature to compare the efficacy and safety of awake and asleep DBS surgery. We identified cohort studies from the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE (January 1970 to August 2019) by using Review Manager 5.3 software to conduct a meta-analysis following the PRISMA guidelines. Fourteen cohort studies involving 1,523 patients were included. The meta-analysis results showed that there were no significant differences between the GA and LA groups in UPDRSIII score improvement (standard mean difference [SMD] 0.06; 95% CI -0.16 to 0.28; p = 0.60), postoperative LEDD requirement (SMD -0.17; 95% CI -0.44 to 0.12; p = 0.23), or operation time (SMD 0.18; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.67; p = 0.47). Additionally, there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.53-1.80; p = 0.94), including postoperative speech disturbance and intracranial hemorrhage. However, the volume of intracranial air was significantly lower in the GA group than that in the LA group. In a subgroup analysis, there was no significant difference in clinical efficacy between the microelectrode recording (MER) and non-MER groups. We demonstrated equivalent clinical outcomes of DBS surgery between GA and LA in terms of improvement of symptoms and the incidence of adverse events. Key Messages: MER might not be necessary for DBS implantation. For patients who cannot tolerate DBS surgery while being awake, GA should be an appropriate alternative.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the mostly seen neurological disease. It affects to nervous system and hinders people's vital activities. The majority of Parkinson's patients lose their ability to speak, write and balance. Many machine learning methods have been proposed to automatically diagnose Parkinson's disease using acoustic, hand writing and gaits. In this study, a statistical pooling method is proposed to recognize Parkinson's disease using the vowels. The used Parkinson's disease dataset contains the features of vowels. In the proposed method, the features of dataset are increased by applying statistical pooling method. Then, the most weighted features are selected from increased feature vector by using ReliefF. The classification is applied using the most weighted feature vector obtained. In the proposed method, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms are used. The success rate was calculated as 91.25% and 91.23% with by using SVM and KNN respectively. The proposed method has two main contributions. The first is to obtain new features from the Parkinson's acoustic dataset using the statistical pooling method. The second one is the selection of the most significant features from the many feature vectors obtained. Thus, successful results were obtained for both KNN and SVM algorithms. The comparatively results clearly show that the proposed method achieved the best success rate among the selected state-of-art methods. Considering the proposed method and the results obtained, it proposed method is successful for Parkinson's disease recognition.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsonian tremor manifests in different types: rest, postural, and action tremors. The postural tremor occurs while a body part is held straight out from the body in a stable position against gravity. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which is a subjective assessment performed by the qualitative judgment of neurologists, is the clinical standard for parkinsonian tremor assessment. Despite the common use of subjective methods, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors are largely used in many studies as a motion capture system to objective assessment of tremors. However, this kind of sensor must be attached to the patient's body, it limits the patient's movements and requires specific techniques for correct positioning in the limb. In this sense, non-contact capacitive (NCC) sensors are an alternative proposed in this research to record the motor activity of the hand and wrist during a pose against gravity. In order to assess the postural tremor and evaluate this novel sensing technology, data from ten subjects, five with Parkinson's disease (PD) and five neurologically healthy (H) matched in age and sex, were collected. We analyzed the instantaneous mean frequency (IMNF) of the signals from NCC and gyroscope sensors for both groups. The selected descriptive statistical variables allowed discrimination (p <; 0.05) among subjects from H and PD groups while using the gyroscope or the NCC sensor. The obtained results indicate that the NCC sensor can measure the postural hand tremor, and also that frequency features extracted from the collected signals can be used to discriminate subjects from both groups.",

    "abstract": "Arrhythmia localization prior to catheter ablation is critical for clinical decision making and treatment planning. The current standard lies in 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation, but this method is non-specific and anatomically limited. Accurate localization requires intracardiac catheter mapping prior to ablation. Electromechanical Wave Imaging (EWI) is a high frame-rate ultrasound modality capable of non-invasively mapping the electromechanical activation in all cardiac chambers in vivo. In this study, we evaluate 3D-rendered EWI as a technique for consistently localizing the accessory pathway (AP) in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pediatric patients. A 2000 Hz EWI diverging sequence was used to transthoracically image 13 patients with evidence of ECG pre-excitation, immediately prior to catheter ablation and after successful ablation whenever possible. 3D-rendered activation maps were generated by co-registering and interpolating the 4 resulting multi-2D isochrones. A blinded electrophysiologist predicted the AP location on 12-lead ECG prior to ablation. Double-blinded EWI isochrones and clinician assessments were compared to the successful ablation site as confirmed by intracardiac mapping using a segmented template of the heart with 19 ventricular regions. 3D-rendered EWI was shown capable of consistently localizing AP in all the WPW cases. Clinical ECG interpretation correctly predicted the origin with an accuracy of 53.8%, respectively 84.6% when considering predictions in immediately adjacent segments correct. Our method was also capable of assessing the difference in activation pattern from before to after successful ablation on the same patient. These findings indicate that EWI could inform current diagnosis and expedite treatment planning of WPW ablation procedures.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) can lead to impaired/slowed movement, gait impairments and increased risk of falling. Wearable technology-based gait analysis is emerging as a powerful tool to detect early disease and monitor progression. Here we present a novel approach to producing an objective, compact and personalised overview of a patient's gait pattern. Phase plots were constructed in 41 people with PD and 38 controls (CL) from accelerometry data collected during straight intermittent walks with a single triaxial accelerometer placed on the lower back. Phase plots were analysed using bivariate Gaussian mixture models and classified based on several apparent features derived from the parameters of said model. Significant differences in phase plot form were found between and PD and CL subjects; with a very high within-subject consistency (reproducibility) (p <; 0.0001). PD and CL subjects differ in the types of phase plots produced (p <; 0.001). Strong connections between spatio-temporal (ST) gait characteristics and phase plot types were found. The presented novel methodology not only showed to be sensitive to pathology (PD vs CL), but can quickly produce a unique fingerprint of a person's gait. This work presents encouraging results for clinical application of an objective, personalised gait feature for disease monitoring and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel metric to serve as a bio-marker for understanding and detecting progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Proposed metric, termed as `Mediolateral Stability (MLS) index' has been derived from processing insole gait data using graph connectivity analysis. The proposed metric focuses on variability of mediolateral pressure in foot during gait progression. Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) and stride time information derived from a wearable insole for PD subjects as well as healthy controls are processed to create a connectivity graph. The insole contains eight pressure sensitive sensors for each foot and these sensors serve as the nodes of the connectivity graph. The proposed MLS index shows significant difference (p <; 0.05) in between control and PD groups and also in between progressive stages of PD, such as mild and moderate PD groups with p <; 0.05. Proposed graph connectivity based feature can act as a bio marker to correctly classify PD, identify early onset of PD and trace changes due to disease progression and can also provide information about dynamic pressure distribution during gait.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by disabling motor and non-motor symptoms. Idiopathic hyposmia (IH), a reduced olfactory sensitivity, is a preclinical marker for the pathology and affects >95% of PD patients. In this paper, SensHand V1 and SensFoot V2, two inertial wearable sensors for upper and lower limbs, were developed to acquire motion data in ten tasks of the MDS-UPDRS III. Fifteen healthy subjects of control, 15 IH people, and 15 PD patients were enrolled. Seventy-one parameters per side were computed by spatiotemporal and frequency data analysis, and the most significant were selected to distinguish among the different classes. Performances of supervised learning algorithms (i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)) were compared on two-group and three-group classification and considering upper and lower limbs separately or together as a full system. Excellent results were obtained for healthy vs. patients classification (accuracy 1.00 for RF, and 0.97 for SVM), and good results were achieved by including IH subjects (0.92 F-measure with RF) within a three-group classification. Overall, the best performances were obtained using the full system with an RF classifier. The system is, thus, suitable to support an objective PD diagnosis. Furthermore, combining motion analysis with a validated olfactory screening test, people at risk for PD can be appropriately analyzed, and subtle changes in motor performance that characterize the prodromal phase and the early PD onset can be identified.",

Since most symptoms are exposed in the later stages of the disease, early diagnosis of PD is essential for more effective treatment. The motivation of this research is early automatic assessment of PD using clinical information, not only for disease diagnosis but also for monitoring progression. After preprocessing the data, feature selection is done by the Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI) method. In the classification step, Random Forest (RF) is used as a classifier model for two tasks, including (1) classifying the subjects to PD and Healthy Control (HC), and (2) determining the disease severity level by Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) scale. The clinical data used is taken from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, which is the most prominent source of data for PD. Experimental results show promising performance of the proposed model for assessment of PD by incorporating clinical properties.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, causing both motor and non-motor symptoms. In the early stages, symptoms are mild and patients may ignore their existence. As a result, they do not undergo any related clinical examination; hence delaying their PD diagnosis. In an effort to remedy such delay, analysis of data passively captured from user's interaction with consumer technologies has been recently explored towards remote screening of early PD motor signs. In the current study, a smartphone-based method analyzing subjects' finger interaction with the smartphone screen is developed for the quantification of fine-motor skills decline in early PD using Convolutional Neural Networks. Experimental results from the analysis of keystroke typing in-the-clinic data from 18 early PD patients and 15 healthy controls have shown a classification performance of 0.89 Area Under the Curve (AUC) with 0.79/0.79 sensitivity/specificity, respectively. Evaluation of the generalization ability of the proposed approach was made by its application on typing data arising from a separate self-reported cohort of 27 PD patients' and 84 healthy controls' daily usage with their personal smartphones (data in-the-wild), achieving 0.79 AUC with 0.74/0.78 sensitivity/specificity, respectively. The results show the potentiality of the proposed approach to process keystroke dynamics arising from users' natural typing activity to detect PD, which contributes to the development of digital tools for remote pathological symptom screening.",

    "abstract": "This study has investigated the use of inter-personnel mutual information computed from the phonetic sound recordings to differentiate between Parkinson's disease (PD) and control subjects. The normalized mutual information (NMI) denotes the amount of information shared between the voice recordings of people within the same group: PD and Control. The hypothesis of this study was that within group NMI will be significantly different when compared with inter- group NMI. For each phonetic sound, the NMI was computed for every pairing of recordings for both the PD and control groups. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to determine the association of NMI with clinical parameters including Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and disease duration. ANOVA test for the three phonetic sounds of control and PD subjects showed that there is significant difference between the intra-group mean NMI for the two groups (p <; 0.003) and also showed significant association with the UPDRS motor examination score, MoCA and disease duration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) has the second-highest prevalence rate of all neurodegenerative disorders. It effects approximately 1% of the population over the age of 60, with this proportion rising further, in more elderly cohorts. PD manifests as several motor and non-motor disfunctions, which develop progressively over time. Gait and mobility problems are amongst the most debilitating symptoms for people with PD. They severely affect a person's ability to carry out daily activities of living and can lead to a decreased quality of life. However, recent research has shown exercise intervention to be effective in improving gait, and overall functional mobility, in persons with PD. In this paper, we study the effect of an exercise intervention, comprised of three separate methods of exercise - all which have been shown previously to be effective individually - on a cohort with early-to-moderate stage PD. We also examine the ability of the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test - instrumented with inertial sensors (QTUG) - and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III in measuring the response to the exercise intervention. We found that TUG time and the QTUG-derived frailty index - along with many additional parameters derived from QTUG - showed a significant change between baseline and post-intervention, while the UPDRS Part III score did not. The direction of the changes in the QTUG parameters also align with the expected exercise effect from the literature. Our results suggest QTUG may be a more sensitive measure than UPDRS Part III for assessing the effect of exercise intervention on functional mobility in people with early-to-moderate stage PD.",

    "abstract": "Clinical research studies in Parkinson's Disease (PD) focusing on symptom assessment often rely on thorough time-consuming physical examinations quantified on clinical scales such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Although widely used in clinical research, realistic time constraints preclude its use in daily clinical practice. The Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) staging is an alternative scale which is easier to administer and provides a succinct descriptor of overall PD severity. There is no universal agreement amongst neurologists on the specific PD symptoms they need to be assessing in order to prescribe treatments and optimize symptom management for their patients, and practically there are no clinical scales which are recorded in daily clinical practice. In this study, we systematically evaluate diverse symptoms (as expressed in 44 UPDRS items) and aim to provide a statistical association with UPDRS and H&Y using rank correlation and mutual information metrics. Moreover, we investigate the projection of a UPDRS item subset on a 2D plot to map onto H&Y. We report some statistically strong correlations of PD symptoms against UPDRS and H&Y (|R| \u2265 0.3), and provide an intuitively appealing visualization mapping onto H&Y. These findings may be useful to neurologists as practical guidance in their daily clinical routine.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most severe and common disease globally. PD induces motor system impairment causing symptoms such as shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement, body tremor and difficulty with walking. Clinically, accurately and objectively assessing the severity of PD symptoms is critical in controlling appropriate dosage of Levodopa to prevent unwanted side effect of switching between Dyskinesia and PD. The unified Parkinson's disease rating scale published by the Movement Disorder Society (MDS-UPDRS) is an validated instrument regularly administrated by trained physician to assess the severity of a PD patient's motor disorder. In this work, we aim at advancing vision-based automatic motor disorder assessment, specifically hand tremor and movement, for PD patients during UPDRS. Our proposed method leverages information across the two behavior tasks simultaneously via deep joint training to improve each single task's, i.e., tremor and movement, severity classification rate. We evaluate our framework on a large cohort of 106 PD patients, and with our proposed deep joint training framework, we achieve accuracy of 78.01% and 80.60% in right and left hand movement binary classification; in terms of tremor severity classification, our approach obtains an enhanced recognition rates of 72.20% and 71.10% for right and left hand respectively.",

We calculated spectrum of the audio recordings and used them as an image input to the ResNet architecture pre-trained using the ImageNet and SVD databases. To prevent overfitting the dataset was strongly augmented in the time domain. The Parkinson's dataset (from PC-GITA database) consists of 100 patients (50 were healthy / 50 were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease). Each patient was recorded 3 times. The obtained accuracy on the validation set is above 90% which is comparable to the current state-of-the-art methods. The results are promising because it turned out that features learned on natural images are able to transfer the knowledge to artificial images representing the spectrogram of the voice signal. What is more, we showed that it is possible to perform a successful detection of Parkinson's disease using only frequency-based features. A spectrogram enables visual representation of frequencies spectrum of a signal. It allows to follow the frequencies changes of a signal in time.",

    "abstract": "The continuous monitoring of Parkinsons's disease (PD) symptoms would allow to automatically adjust medication or deep brain stimulation parameters to a patient's momentary condition. Wearable sensors have been proposed to monitor PD symptoms and have been validated in a number of lab and hospital settings. However, taking these sensors into the daily life of patients introduces a number of difficulties, most notably the absence of an observable ground truth of what the user is currently doing. In this pilot study, we investigate PD symptoms by combining wearable sensors on both wrist and the chest with a questionnaire based evaluation of PD symptoms, in the form of experience sampling method. For a tremor dominant patient, we show that experienced tremor severity can be predicted from the sensor data with correlations of up to r = 0.43. We evaluated different window lengths to calculate the features in and see better results for longer window lengths. Our results show that continuous monitoring of PD symptoms in daily life is feasible using wearable sensors.",

    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules comprising more than 200 nucleotides, which are not translated into proteins. Many studies have shown that lncRNAs are involved in regulating a variety of biological processes, including immune, cancer, stress, development and differentiation at the transcriptional, epigenetic or post-transcriptional levels. Here, we review the role of lncRNAs in the process of neurodevelopment, neural differentiation, synaptic function, and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). These pathomechanisms include protein misfolding and aggregation, disordered protein degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, autophagy, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. This information will provide the basis of lncRNA-based disease diagnosis and drug treatment for PD.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of Parkinson's with higher accuracy is always desirable to slow down the progression of the disease and improved quality of life. There are evidences of inherent neurological differences between male and females as well as between elderly and adults. However, the potential of such gender and age infomration have not been exploited yet for Parkinson's identification.\nIn this paper, we develop a sex-specific and age-dependent classification method to diagnose the Parkinson's disease using the online handwriting recorded from individuals with Parkinson's (n\u00a0=\u00a037; m/f-19/18;age-69.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.9yrs) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a038; m/f-20/18;age-62.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.3yrs). A support vector machine ranking method is used to present the features specific to their dominance in sex and age group for Parkinson's diagnosis.\nThe sex-specific and age-dependent classifier was observed significantly outperforming the generalized classifier. An improved accuracy of 83.75% (SD\u00a0=\u00a01.63) with the female-specific classifier, and 79.55% (SD\u00a0=\u00a01.58) with the old-age dependent classifier was observed in comparison to 75.76% (SD\u00a0=\u00a01.17) accuracy with the generalized classifier.\nCombining the age and sex information proved to be encouraging in classification. A distinct set of features were observed to be dominating for higher classification accuracy in a different category of classification.",

    "abstract": "Although many publications have evaluated the correlation between dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) TaqIA polymorphism and Parkinson disease (PD), the results remain inconclusive. In order to further address the association between DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism and PD risk, we performed a meta-analysis of all eligible studies from more databases. Related studies were identified from six databases involving PubMed, Springer Link, Ovid, Chinese Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Biology Medicine (CBM) through Octorber 2018. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the associations. A total of 13 studies including 3558 PD patients and 10186 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, no significant association was found between DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism and PD risk in the total population. A further subgroup study by ethnicity showed a significant association between DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism and PD in Caucasians (for A1 vs. A2: P=0.02, OR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.02-1.27; for (A1A1 + A1A2) vs. A2A2: P=0.03, OR=1.16, 95% CI: 1.02-1.33). No significant results were observed in Asians. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism may contribute to the PD development in Caucasians, and large-scale well-designed studies are required in future to confirm this conclusion.",

    "abstract": "The number of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients increases with aging, which brings heavy burden to families and society. The emergence of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has brought hope to the current situation of lacking new breakthroughs in diagnosis and treatment of PD. In this article, we reviewed and analyzed the current researches related to PD patient-derived iPSCs, in order to provide solid theoretical basis for future study of PD. In 2008, successful iPSCs derived from PD patients were reported. The current iPSCs research in PD mostly focused on the establishment of specific iPSCs models of PD patients carrying susceptible genes. The main source of PD patient-derived iPSCs is skin fibroblasts and the mainstream reprogramming methodology is the mature \"four-factor\" method, which introduces four totipotent correlation factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc into somatic cells. The main sources of iPSCs are patients with non-pedigrees and there have been no studies involving both PD patients and unaffected carriers within the same family. Most of the existing studies of PD patient-derived iPSCs started with the induction method for obtaining dopaminergic neurons in the first instance, but therapeutic applications are being increased. Although it is not the ultimate panacea, and there are still some unsolved problems (e.g., whether the mutated genes should be corrected or not), a better understanding of iPSCs may be a good gift for both PD patients and doctors due to their advantages in diagnosis and treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN)-striatum circuit, which is associated with glial activation and consequent chronic neuroinflammation. Optimized Yinxieling Formula (OYF) is a Chinese medicine that exerts therapeutical effect and antiinflammation property on psoriasis. Our previous study has proven that pretreatment with OYF could regulate glia-mediated inflammation in an acute mouse model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Given that PD is a chronic degeneration disorder, this study applied another PD animal model induced by striatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to mimic the progressive damage of the SN-striatum dopamine system in rats. The OYF was administrated in the manner of pretreatment plus treatment. The effects of the OYF on motor behaviors were assessed with the apomorphine-induced rotation test and adjusting steps test. To confirm the effect of OYF on dopaminergic neurons and glia activation in this model, we analyzed the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and glia markers, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the SN region of the rat PD model. Inflammation-associated factors, including tumor necrosis factor-",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder that affects extensive regions of the nervous system. Its current clinical diagnosis is based on motor symptoms that appear late during disease progression when substantial proportions of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron population are lost already. Although disturbances in sleep and other biofunctions often surface years prior to motor impairments and point to a long prodromal phase, these phenotypic signs in a person's midlife lack predictive power. They do, however, signal the unfolding of the disease and suggest molecular correlates that begin deviating early on. Revealing such trajectories, hence, promises not only a better understanding of prodromal PD but may also enable a much-needed earlier diagnosis. A nexus that may harbor such molecular trajectories is the epigenome as key etiological factors of PD-genetics, age, and environment-influence this substrate. An earlier diagnosis would also allow earlier interventions and lifestyle adjustments to improve brain function and reduce symptoms. In this review, we describe the challenges of diagnosing PD early on and highlight the opportunities that may arise from steering research efforts towards comprehensive interrogations of molecular layers during the long-time neglected midlife phase. In particular, we emphasize how existing cohorts of at-risk individuals, available animal models, and suitable markers may come together and aid in revealing molecular trajectories that offer diagnostic utility for PD in its prodromal stage.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for motor features in Parkinson's disease (PD). We present the case of a 56-year-old man with a 17-year history of PD. He underwent bilateral STN-DBS at the age of 51 years because of troublesome dyskinesia and wearing off. His motor features dramatically improved after the operation; however, he developed dysarthria and a refractory wheeze associated with dyspnea due to abnormal hyperadduction of the false vocal fold. By adjusting the stimulation site of STN, his severe wheeze, which was considered to be the result of the unfavorable spread of current to the corticobulbar tract, was significantly improved. This report provides concrete evidence that wheezing is caused by hyperadduction of the false vocal fold as an adverse effect of STN-DBS and can be reversed by adjusting the stimulation site for STN-DBS.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous and \"event-related\" motor cortex oscillations in the beta (15-30 Hz) frequency range are well-established phenomena. However, the precise functional significance of these features is uncertain. An understanding of the specific function is of importance for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), where attenuation of augmented beta throughout the motor network coincides with functional improvement. Previous research using a discrete movement task identified normalization of elevated spontaneous beta and postmovement beta rebound following GABAergic modulation. Here, we explore the effects of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A modulator, zolpidem, on beta power during the performance of serial movement in 17 (15M, 2F; mean age, 66 \u00b1 6.3 years) PD patients, using a repeated-measures, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-control design. Motor symptoms were monitored before and after treatment, using time-based Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale measurements and beta oscillations in primary motor cortex (M1) were measured during a serial-movement task, using magnetoencephalography. We demonstrate that a cumulative increase in M1 beta power during a 10-s tapping trial is reduced following zolpidem, but not placebo, which is accompanied by an improvement in movement speed and efficacy. This work provides a clear mechanism for the generation of abnormally elevated beta power in PD and demonstrates that perimovement beta accumulation drives the slowing, and impaired initiation, of movement. These findings further indicate a role for GABAergic modulation in bradykinesia in PD, which merits further exploration as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate microscale changes in the bilateral red nucleus and substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). Twenty-six patients with PD [mean age, 62.5 \u00b1 8.7 years; Hoehn-Yahr stage, 0-4.0; Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores, 8-43] and 15 healthy controls (mean age, 59.5 \u00b1 9.4 years) underwent DKI of the substantia nigra and red nucleus. Imaging was performed using a General Electric (GE) Signa 3.0-T MRI system. Patients with PD were divided into two groups consisting of 12 patients with UPDRS scores \u2265 30 and 14 patients with UPDRS scores < 30. All DKI data processing operations were performed with commercial workstations (GE, ADW 4.6) using Functool software to generate color-coded and parametric maps of mean kurtosis (MK), fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD). MK values in the bilateral substantia nigra were significantly lower in patients with early- and advanced-stage PD than in controls. Moreover, MK values in the left substantia nigra were significantly lower in patients with advanced-stage PD than in those with early-stage PD. Patients with advanced-stage PD also exhibited significant decreases in MK values in the bilateral red nucleus relative to controls. No significant differences in FA or MD values were observed between the PD and control groups. There were no significant correlations between MK, FA, or MD values and UPDRS scores. Our findings suggest that decreased MK values in the substantia nigra may aid in determining the severity of PD and help provide early diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "Several symptomatic treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) are currently available. Still, the challenge today is to find a therapy that might reduce degeneration and slow down disease progression. The identification of pathogenic mutations in familial Parkinsonism (fPD) associated to the monogenic forms of PD provided pathophysiological insights and highlighted novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Mutations in the VPS35 gene have been associated with autosomal dominant fPD and a clinical phenotype indistinguishable from idiopathic PD. Although VPS35 mutations are relatively rare causes of PD, their study may help understanding specific cellular and molecular alterations that lead to accumulation \u03b1-synuclein in neurons of PD patients. Interacting with such mechanisms may provide innovative therapeutic approaches. We review here the evidence on the physiological role of VPS35 as a key intracellular trafficking protein controlling relevant neuronal functions. We further analyze VPS35 activity on \u03b1-synuclein degradation pathways that control the equilibrium between \u03b1-synuclein clearance and accumulation. Finally, we highlight the strategies for increasing VPS35 levels as a potential tool to treat PD.",

    "abstract": "The underlying neuropathology of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) remains elusive in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aim to investigate neural network changes that underlie EDS in PD.\nEarly PD patients comprising eighty-one patients without EDS (EDS-) and seventeen patients with EDS (EDS+) received a resting state functional MRI scan and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Connectivities within the default mode network (DMN), motor and basal ganglia networks were compared between the EDS+ and EDS- groups. Correlations between network connectivity and the severity of EDS were investigated through linear regression.\nEDS+ patients displayed a trend of increased network connectivity of the posterior DMN (pDMN). A significant positive correlation was found between connectivity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the pDMN and ESS.\nEDS+ patients are likely to display increased activation in the DMN, suggesting neural compensation in early PD or impaired attentiveness due to mechanisms such as mind-wandering.",

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays essential roles in gene expression and human diseases. We hypothesize that lncRNAs are involved in neuronal degeneration of PD. Using microarray, we identified 122 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and 48 DE mRNAs between the circulating leukocytes from PD patients and healthy controls.

    "abstract": "This study presents an alternative therapy to conventional anti-Parkinson's treatment strategies; where motor and non-motor symptomatic complications are considered. Thus; providing sustainability, patient compliance, therapeutic safety and efficiency, based on triggering secretion of endogenous dopamine (DA). Exogenous DA has long been considered the best therapy, however, its poor blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, fluctuated plasma levels, and non-motor complications negligence, decreased response to therapy with time. Consequently; brain targeting Tween\u00ae80-coated pegylated lipomers were tailored for intravenous administration (IV) of L-Dopa, and two drugs of reported neuroprotective effect: lamotrigine (LTG) and tenoxicam (TX). Single-step nanoprecipitation method was used; for its reproducibility and ease of scaling-up. Formulation targeting and anti-PD efficiency was evaluated against marketed standards and L-Dopa. ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology may damage emotion circuit and cause depression. We investigated whether the neural basis of depressive symptoms varies at different PD stages. Seventy-six healthy controls (HC) and 98 PD patients (divided into early and middle stage groups) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and general neuropsychological tests. Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based analysis were used to study the association between brain structural alterations and the Hamilton Depression Scale 17 Item (HAMD-17) scores in different groups. Comparing with HC group, PD patients showed widespread brain alterations in both gray and white matter. The HAMD-17 scores were positively correlated with GM volume in the right pre-central gyrus of early PD patients. In the middle stage group, HAMD-17 scores were positively correlated with GM volume in midbrain and right superior temporal gyrus, and negatively associated with GM volume in left anterior cingulate and superior frontal gyrus. In white matter analysis, The HAMD-17 scores were positively correlated with fractional anisotropy value of the bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in the early stage group, but not the middle stage group. We concluded that the neural basis of depressive symptoms might be distinct in different stages of PD, implying the need for differential treatments.",

    "abstract": "Excessive neuronal activity in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is believed to promote parkinsonian akinesia/bradykinesia, but not tremor. Parkinsonian tremor is thought to result from dysfunction in the basal ganglia and cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits. Whether the GPi is involved in tremorgenesis has not been fully elucidated. This study was designed to quantify the characteristics of oscillatory GPi neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nNine patients undergoing surgery were studied. Microelectrode recordings in the GPi and electromyographic (EMG) activity in the limbs were recorded and the mean spontaneous firing rates (MSFRs) were calculated. Spectral analysis was used to assess neuronal oscillatory patterns. Coherence analysis was applied to explore the relationship between oscillatory neurons and EMG.\nOf 79 GPi neurons, 50.6% oscillated at the tremor frequency; 25.3% oscillated at \u03b2 frequency, and 24.1% did not oscillate. The MSFR of all neurons was 81.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4 spikes/s. Among neurons oscillating at tremor frequency, 40% were coherent with the tremor. In four neurons, the pattern changed from tremor frequency to \u03b2 frequency or vice versa. It appeared that the tremor began before the GPi fired bursts.\nSome neuronal activity in the GPi correlates with tremor and this correlation might be due to either feedback, maintenance, or initiation. Since there were examples of EMG tremor prior to GPi activity, initiation seems least likely. The data further support the prediction of the classic pathophysiology model of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed when patients meet motor symptom criteria (bradykinesia plus tremor or rigidity). However, patients may demonstrate prodromal nonmotor symptoms 5-20 years prior to diagnosis. While motor symptoms are of concern, patients often consider nonmotor symptoms to be just as bothersome. In this brief CME activity, diagnostic criteria and assessment tools are described.",

    "abstract": "Fear of falling (FOF) is more common in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) than in healthy controls. It can lead to several negative consequences such as restrictions in everyday life. Moreover, FOF is a risk factor for future falls.\nThis study aimed to identify predictive factors of FOF (conceptualized as concerns about falling) after three years, with and without adjusting for concerns about falling at baseline, in people with PD.\nThis study included 151 participants (35% women) with PD. At baseline, their mean (SD) age and PD duration were 68 (\u00b19.0) and 9 (\u00b16.1) years, respectively. The Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) was used as the dependent variable in multivariable linear regression analyses.\nThe mean (SD) FES-I score increased from 28.1 (11.9) to 33.1 (14.0) three years later (\nThis study pinpoints several predictive factors of concerns about falling that are modifiable and which could be addressed in rehabilitation: perceived walking difficulties, having problems maintaining balance while dual tasking, and dependence on others in daily activities. The importance of dual tasking is a novel finding, which future studies need to confirm or refute. One should be aware of the fact that an increased age predicts concerns about falling with and without adjusting for baseline FES-I scores, whereas female sex predicts concerns about falling only when adjusting for baseline FES-I scores.",

    "abstract": "This focus of our research is to investigate the protective effect of Baicalin on apoptosis and mTOR/AKT/GSK-3\u03b2 pathway in substantia nigra neurons in a rat model for Parkinson's disease, induced by 6-Hydroxydopamine. Thirty healthy female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control group, model group, and Baicalin group. The Parkinson model was established by injecting 6-Hydroxydopamine into the right substantia nigra of rats in model and Baicalin group. The rats in Baicalin group were intragastrically administered with Baicalin (25 mg/kg/day) for four weeks. At the same time, the rats in control and model groups were intragastrically administered with equivalent solvents. We observed the rat turns, rotation speed and left forelimb usage. The protein expression levels of \u03b1-SYN, mTOR, AKT, and GSK-3\u03b2 in substantia nigra were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Compared with model group, Baicalin significantly reduced the number of rotation speeds and neuron apoptosis (P < 0.001, respectively). However, the left forelimb use rate was notably increased after treatment with Baicalin (P < 0.001, respectively). Also, Baicalin decreased the expression levels of \u03b1-SYN, mTOR, AKT, and GSK-3\u03b2 in rats when compared with those in model group (P < 0.001, respectively).",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the feasibility of applying intracranial lead reconstruction in deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy for Parkinsonism.\nWe retrospectively collected the clinical data from 27 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), who received bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS therapy between January, 2016 and December, 2017. According to the position of the selected optimal stimulating contact of the implanted leads, the patients were divided into group A with the stimulating contacts of the bilateral leads in the STN, group B with unilateral stimulating contacts in the STN, and group C with bilateral stimulating contacts outside the STN. All the patients were assessed for improvement using Hoehn-Yahr stage, the third part of United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS \u2162), Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (SE-ADL), and L-dopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD). The consistency between the optimal stimulating contact selected by lead reconstruction and that by standard postoperative programming procedure was also evaluated.\nThe patients in all the 3 groups showed postoperative improvements in Hoehn-Yahr stage, UPDRS \u2162 score, SE-ADL score, and LEDD in the medication-off state. But at 12 months of the follow-up, such improvements were maintained only in the patients of group A. The optimal stimulating contacts selected by lead reconstruction and standard postoperative programming procedure had a matching rate of up to 77.78% (42/54), and the coordinates of the optimal contacts selected by the two methods showed no significant difference.\nIntracranial lead reconstruction facilitates the study of the association between the implant site of the leads and the clinical outcome of DBS therapy for PD and allows the precise selection of the optimal contact of the implanted leads in postoperative programming of DBS.\n\u8bc4\u4f30\u9885\u5185\u7535\u6781\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u8111\u6df1\u90e8\u523a\u6fc0\u672f\uff08DBS\uff09\u4e34\u5e8a\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\n\u56de\u987e\u6027\u7eb3\u51652016\u5e741\u6708~2017\u5e7412\u6708\u63a5\u53d7\u53cc\u4fa7\u4e18\u8111\u5e95\u6838\uff08STN\uff09DBS\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u800527\u4f8b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9885\u5185\u7535\u6781\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u690d\u5165\u7535\u6781\u4e0eSTN\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06\u75c5\u4f8b\u5206\u4e3a3\u7ec4\uff08A\u7ec4\uff1a\u53cc\u4fa7\u7535\u6781\u6700\u4f73DBS\u523a\u6fc0\u89e6\u70b9\u5747\u4f4d\u4e8eSTN\u5185\uff1bB\u7ec4\uff1a\u4ec5\u4e00\u4fa7\u7535\u6781\u6700\u4f73\u523a\u6fc0\u89e6\u70b9\u4f4d\u4e8eSTN\u5185\uff1bC\u7ec4\uff1a\u53cc\u4fa7\u7535\u6781\u6700\u4f73\u523a\u6fc0\u89e6\u70b9\u5747\u4e0d\u4f4d\u4e8eSTN\u5185\uff09\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u67903\u7ec4\u75c5\u4f8b\u5728\u57fa\u7ebf\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u672f\u540e6\u6708\u3001\u672f\u540e12\u6708\u7684Hoehn-Yahr\u5206\u671f\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8bc4\u5b9a\u91cf\u8868\u7b2c3\u90e8\u5206\uff08UPDRS \u2162\uff09\u5206\u503c\u3001Schwab & England\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\uff08SE-ADL\uff09\u3001\u5de6\u65cb\u591a\u5df4\u7b49\u6548\u5242\u91cf\uff08LEDD\uff09\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7535\u6781\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5f00\u673a\u7a0b\u63a7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u523a\u6fc0\u89e6\u70b9\u7684\u543b\u5408\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u89e6\u70b9\u5750\u6807\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5224\u65ad\u8be5\u9879\u6280\u672f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\nSTN-DBS\u672f\u540e3\u7ec4\u75c5\u4f8b\u5728\u836f\u7269-\u5173\u671f\u7684H-Y\u5206\u671f\u3001UPDRS \u2162\u5206\u503c\u3001SE-ADL\u5206\u503c\u53caLEDD\u5747\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u672f\u540e12\u6708\uff0c\u4ec5\u6709\u7ec4A\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5206\u503c\u6539\u5584\u4ecd\u662f\u663e\u8457\u7684\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7535\u6781\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5f00\u673a\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u89e6\u70b9\u7684\u543b\u5408\u5ea6\u8fbe77.78%\uff0842/54\uff09\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u7684\u89e6\u70b9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08\n\u9885\u5185\u7535\u6781\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u9885\u5185\u7535\u6781\u690d\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0eDBS\u4e34\u5e8a\u7597\u6548\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u672f\u540e\u7a0b\u63a7\u6700\u4f73DBS\u89e6\u70b9\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9700\u6c42\u3002",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, which is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal protein accumulation. No treatment can stop or slow PD. Autophagy inhibits neuronal death by removing damaged mitochondria and abnormal protein aggregations. Celastrol is a triterpene with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Up until now, no reports have shown that celastrol improves PD motor symptoms. In this study, we used PD cell and mouse models to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of celastrol. In the substantia nigra, we found lower levels of autophagic activity in patients with sporadic PD as compared to healthy controls. In neurons, celastrol enhances autophagy, autophagosome biogenesis (Beclin 1\u2191, Ambra1\u2191, Vps34\u2191, Atg7\u2191, Atg12\u2191, and LC3-II\u2191), and mitophagy (PINK1\u2191, DJ-1\u2191, and LRRK2\u2193), and these might be associated with MPAK signaling pathways. In the PD cell model, celastrol reduces MPP",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease results in motor impairment that deteriorates patients' quality of life. One of the symptoms negatively interfering with daily activities is kinetic tremor which should be measured to monitor the outcome of therapy. A new instrumented method of quantification of the kinetic tremor is proposed, based on the analysis of circles drawn on a digitizing tablet by a patient. The aim of this approach is to obtain a tremor scoring equivalent to that performed by trained clinicians. Models are trained with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method to predict the tremor scores on the basis of the parameters computed from the patients' drawings. Signal parametrization is derived from both expert knowledge and the response of an artificial neural network to the raw data, thus the approach was named multimodal. The fitted models are eventually combined into model ensembles that provide aggregated scores of the kinetic tremor captured in the drawings. The method was verified with a set of clinical data acquired from 64 Parkinson's disease patients. Automated and objective quantification of the kinetic tremor with the presented approach yielded promising results, as the Pearson's correlations between the visual ratings of tremor and the model predictions ranged from 0.839 to 0.890 in the best-performing models.",

    "abstract": "Movement disorders including Parkinson\u2019s disease and dystonia are caused by neurological dysfunction, typically resulting from the loss of a neuronal input within a circuit. Neuromodulation, specifically deep brain stimulation (DBS), has proven to be a critical development in the treatment of movement disorders. Continuing efforts aim to improve DBS techniques, both in how they exert their effects and in the efficacy of the mechanism involved in eliciting those effects. While optogenetic stimulation is currently infeasible in human patients, opto-DBS research provides an indispensible avenue to understand the mechanisms of DBS therapeutic and adverse effects. We review the benefits of cell-type specific manipulations in understanding the root cause of movement disorders and how DBS might optimally combat those causes. We also explore new circuit-inspired applications of DBS suggested by thorough, high-throughput optogenetic techniques. Maximizing the efficacy and outcome of DBS requires a multi-tiered approach; research employing optogenetics provides the specificity and feasibility to uncover the mechanisms that will help realize these gains in patient care.",

    "abstract": "Most neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by progressive loss of neurons throughout the course of disease in the form of specific spatio-temporal patterns. To capture and quantify these coherent patterns across both space and time, traditionally one would either fit a pre-defined model with spatial and temporal parameters or apply analysis in the spatial and temporal domains separately. In this work, we introduce and validate the use of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), a data-driven multivariate approach, to extract coupled spatio-temporal patterns simultaneously.

    "abstract": "The incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, has increased exponentially as the global population continues to age. Although the etiological factors contributing to PD remain uncertain, its average incidence rate is reported to be 1% of the global population older than 60 years. PD is primarily characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons and/or associated neuronal networks and the subsequent depletion of dopamine (DA) levels in the brain. Thus, DA or levodopa (l-dopa), a precursor of DA, represent cardinal targets for both idiopathic and symptomatic PD therapeutics. While several therapeutic strategies have been investigated over the past decade for their abilities to curb the progression of PD, an effective cure for PD is currently unavailable. Even DA replacement therapy, an effective PD therapeutic strategy that provides an exogenous supply of DA or l-dopa, has been hindered by severe challenges, such as a poor capacity to bypass the blood-brain barrier and inadequate bioavailability. Nevertheless, with recent advances in nanotechnology, several drug delivery systems have been developed to bypass the barriers associated with central nervous system therapeutics. In here, we sought to describe the adapted lipid-based nanodrug delivery systems used in the field of PD therapeutics and their recent advances, with a particular focus placed on DA replacement therapies. This work initially explores the background of PD; offers descriptions of the most recent molecular targets; currently available clinical medications/limitations; an overview of several lipid-based PD nanotherapeutics, functionalized nanoparticles, and technical aspects in brain delivery; and, finally, presents future perspectives to enhance the use of nanotherapeutics in PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to well-documented deficits in the core social cognitive domains of social perception and theory of mind (ToM), how Parkinson's disease (PD) affects one's empathic capacity remains poorly understood. The current study provides the first meta-analytic review of both ToM and empathy as broad constructs, and also breaks these constructs down to clearly differentiate their overlapping (affective ToM and cognitive empathy) and distinct (affective empathy and cognitive ToM) components. A total of 38 studies contributed to these analyses, with results revealing that, relative to controls, PD is associated with significant and substantial deficits in the domain of cognitive ToM (g = -0.78), as well as the overlapping domains of affective ToM/cognitive empathy (g = -0.69). However, no group differences were identified for affective empathy (g = -0.08). These data speak to there being a potential preservation of affective empathic processing in PD, but because of the relatively limited research base on this topic, recommendations for future research are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. miR\u2011384\u20115p expression has been shown to be increased in an in\u00a0vitro model of PD; however, it remains unknown whether there are other molecules that can be regulated by miR\u2011384\u20115p in in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro models of PD; thus, the present study aimed to elucidate this matter. Rotenone was applied for the establishment of in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo models of PD in the present study. Motor disability and equilibrium were determined by a swimming test and traction test, respectively. mRNA and protein levels were detected by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2011qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. The association between miR\u2011384\u20115p and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression was verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. The \u03b1\u2011synuclein aggregation was evaluated by immunofluorescence. The results from the in\u00a0vitro model of PD demonstrated that, the mice in the PD group exhibited decreased scores in the swimming test and traction test, which were accompanied by increased \u03b1\u2011synuclein aggregation. In addition, the expression of miR\u2011384\u20115p, which targeted the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of SIRT1, was verified to be increased in mice and SH\u2011SY5Y cells in the PD group, whereas SIRT1 exhibited the opposite changes. Moreover, increased mRNA and protein levels of p53 and FOXO1 were observed in mice and SH\u2011SY5Y cells in the PD group. In addition, the SH\u2011SY5Y cells in the PD group exhibited a higher cell apoptotic rate. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that miRNA\u2011384\u20115p promotes the progression of PD by targeting SIRT1.",

    "abstract": "Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), has now become a very powerful tool for decoding variants of genes involved in pathogenesis of number of human disorders. One of the challenges of this method is to decipher the real pathogenic variants from a number of identified, not related to the disorder in analyzed case. Another issue is recognition of new phenotypes previously unrecognized but related to new variants combinations' in known genes. The other aspect is the HGMD or ClinVar mutation databases usage in data interpretation. The aim of this paper is to discuss pathogenicity of p.(Glu121Lys) missense mutation in the TOR1A gene previously described as dystonia causing variant. The patient diagnosed with typical Parkinson disease and positive family history was included into analysis. Also the internal whole exome sequencing (WES) database containing 600 subjects who has performed WES due to different causes was searched. All subjects had WES performed on SureSelect Human All Exon v.6 enrichment, Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform, (annotations according to internal Institute Mother and Child's pipeline). The TOR1A p.(Glu121Lys) heterozygous mutation was revealed in 1 patient diagnosed with PD and 2 healthy subjects who has no dystonia symptoms. To conclude the TOR1A p.Glu121Lys variant should not be recognized as clearly pathogenic now.",

    "abstract": "Pomegranate juice is a rich source of ellagitannins (ETs) believed to contribute to a wide range of pomegranate's health benefits. While a lot of experimental studies have been devoted to Alzheimer disease and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, our knowledge of pomegranate's effects against Parkinson's disease (PD) is very limited. It is suggested that its neuroprotective effects are mediated by ETs-derived metabolites-urolithins. In this study, we examined the capability of pomegranate juice for protection against PD in a rat model of parkinsonism induced by rotenone. To evaluate its efficiency, assessment of postural instability, visualization of neurodegeneration, determination of oxidative damage to lipids and \u03b1-synuclein level, as well as markers of antioxidant defense status, inflammation, and apoptosis, were performed in the midbrain. We also check the presence of plausible active pomegranate ETs-derived metabolite, urolithin A, in the plasma and brain. Our results indicated that pomegranate juice treatment provided neuroprotection as evidenced by the postural stability improvement, enhancement of neuronal survival, its protection against oxidative damage and \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, the increase in mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and maintenance of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein at the control level. In addition, we have provided evidence for the distribution of urolithin A to the brain.",

    "abstract": "The cause of the L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) has been ascribed to G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) supersensitivity and uncontrolled downstream signaling. It is now supposed that \u03b2-arrestin2 affects GPCR signaling through its ability to scaffold various intracellular molecules. We used the rAAV (recombinant adeno-associated virus) vectors to overexpress and ablation of \u03b2-arrestin2. L-dopa-induced changes in expression of signaling molecules and other proteins in the striatum were examined by western blot and immunohistochemically. Our data demonstrated that via AAV-mediated overexpression of \u03b2-arrestin2 attenuated LID performance in 6-OHDA-lesioned rodent models. \u03b2-arrestin2 suppressed LID behavior without compromising the antiparkinsonian effects of L-dopa. Moreover, we also found that the anti-dyskinetic effect of \u03b2-arrestin2 was reversed by SKF38393, a D1R agonist. On the contrary, the rat knockdown study demonstrated that reduced availability of \u03b2-arrestin2 deteriorated LID performance, which was counteracted by SCH23390, a D1R antagonist. These data not only demonstrate a central role for \u03b2-arrestin2/GPCR signaling in LID, but also show the D1R signal pathway changes occurring in response to dopaminergic denervation and pulsatile administration of L-dopa.",

However, CNS delivery of GDNF in clinical trials has proven challenging due to blood-brain barrier (BBB) impermeability, poor diffusion within brain tissue, and large brain size. We report that using non-toxic mobilization-enabled preconditioning, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation-based macrophage-mediated gene delivery may provide a solution to overcome these obstacles.

More research is needed to better characterize the associations between these two conditions, and to evaluate the effectiveness of prevention strategies such as melanoma screening for adults with PD.\nThe underlying mechanism for the co-occurrence of Parkinson's disease (PD) and malignant melanoma remains unclear but available evidence suggests genetic associations and environmental factors as potential causes.Patients with PD may require closer dermatological surveillance, particularly those with other risk factors for melanoma such as prolonged sun exposure.More research is needed to better characterize the associations between PD and skin cancers, and to evaluate the effectiveness of prevention strategies such as melanoma screening for adults with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss and intracellular inclusions composed mainly of alpha synuclein (\u03b1-syn), but the mechanism of pathogenesis is still obscure. In recent years, more attention has been given to the gut as a key player in the initiation and progression of PD pathology. Several studies characterizing changes in the microbiome, particularly the gut microbiome, have been conducted. Although many studies found a decrease in the bacterial family Prevotellaceae and in butyrate-producing bacterial genera such as Roseburia and Faecalibacteria, and an increase in the genera Akkermansia many of the studies reported contradictory findings. In this review, we highlight the findings from the different studies and reflect on the future of microbiome studies in PD research.",

    "abstract": "Variations in study quality and design complicate interpretation of the clinical significance of consistently reported changes in copper and iron levels in human Parkinson's disease brain and biofluids.\nWe systematically searched literature databases for quantitative reports of biometal levels in the degenerating substantia nigra (SN), CSF, serum, and plasma in Parkinson's disease compared with healthy age-matched controls and assessed the quality of these publications. The primary outcomes of our analysis confirmed SN copper and iron levels are decreased and increased, respectively, in the Parkinson's disease brain. We applied a novel Quality Assessment Scale for Human Tissue to categorize the quality of individual studies and investigated the effects of study quality on our outcomes. We undertook a random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression subgroup analysis.\nIn the 18 eligible studies identified (211 Parkinson's disease, 215 control cases), SN copper levels were significantly lower (d, -2.00; 95% CI, -2.81 to -1.19; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and iron levels were significantly higher (d, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.38-2.24; P\u2009<\u20090.01) in Parkinson's disease. No changes were detected in CSF, serum, or plasma for any metals (29 studies; 2443 Parkinson's disease and 2183 control cases) except serum iron, which was lower in Parkinson's disease (14 studies; 1177 Parkinson's disease and 1447 control cases).\nReductions in copper levels and elevations in iron were confirmed as characteristic of the degenerating SN of Parkinson's disease. Iron in serum was also changed, but in the opposite direction to that in the SN and to a lesser extent. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Although most cases of Parkinson\u00b4s disease (PD) are idiopathic with unknown cause, an increasing number of genes and genetic risk factors have been discovered that play a role in PD pathogenesis. Many of the PD-associated proteins are involved in mitochondrial quality control, e.g., PINK1, Parkin, and LRRK2, which were recently identified as regulators of mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites (MERCs) linking mitochondrial homeostasis to intracellular calcium handling. In this context, Miro1 is increasingly recognized to play a role in PD pathology. Recently, we identified the first PD patients carrying mutations in \nUsing whole exome sequencing we identified two PD patients carrying heterozygous mutations leading to the amino acid exchanges T351A and T610A in Miro1. We analyzed calcium homeostasis and MERCs in detail by live cell imaging and immunocytochemistry in patient-derived fibroblasts.\nWe show that fibroblasts expressing mutant T351A or T610A Miro1 display impaired calcium homeostasis and a reduced amount of MERCs. All fibroblast lines from patients with pathogenic variants in Miro1, revealed alterations of the structure of MERCs.\nOur data suggest that Miro1 is important for the regulation of the structure and function of MERCs. Moreover, our study supports the role of MERCs in the pathogenesis of PD and further establishes variants in ",

Inhibition of the inflammatory response elicited by activated microglia could be an effective strategy to alleviate the progression of PD. Here, we synthesized 2-(5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-oxoacetamide (CDMPO) and studied its protective anti-inflammatory mechanisms following lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in vitro and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity in vivo. CDMPO and its parent compound, rimonabant, significantly attenuated nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-stimulated primary microglia and BV2 cells. Furthermore, CDMPO significantly inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines and prostaglandin E2 (PGE",

    "abstract": "To explore experiences of health services and unmet care needs by people with late-stage Parkinson's in England.\nTen participants, at Hoehn and Yahr stage 4 or 5, were interviewed using semi-structured open-ended questions. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis.\nParticipants reported that whilst under the treatment of specialist hospitals, the majority of care provision had shifted into the community, often because hospital-based services were felt to be difficult to access and have limited benefit to them. When using health-care services, participants frequently experienced having to 'fit-in' to service structures that did not always accommodate their complex needs. Despite high levels of disability, participants expressed their desire to maintain their identity, normality of interests and activities in their lives, including remaining in their own homes. This was facilitated by bespoke care and equipment, and positive relationships with care providers. Knowledge on disease management was a key factor in their perceived ability to remain in control. Family caregivers had a central role in facilitating care at home. There was uncertainty about and little planning for the future, and moving to a residential nursing home was perceived an undesirable but potentially necessary option for future care.\nUnmet care needs identified by people with late stage Parkinson's in England include greater flexibility of healthcare structures and bespoke service provision, to accommodate their individual complex needs. Support in their own homes and positive relationships with healthcare providers help People with Parkinson's (PwP) to maintain a degree of normality and identity, and provision of information help them maintain some control. There is a need for more informed discussions on future care planning for this specific population.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease has multiple detrimental effects on motor and cognitive systems in the brain. In contrast to motor deficits, cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease are usually not ameliorated, and can even be worsened, by dopaminergic treatments. Recent evidence has shown potential benefits from restoring other neurotransmitter deficits, including noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission. Here, we study global and regional brain network organization using task-free imaging (also known as resting-state), which minimizes performance confounds and the bias towards predetermined networks. Thirty-three patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were studied three times in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled counter-balanced crossover design, following placebo, 40\u2009mg oral atomoxetine (selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) or 30\u2009mg oral citalopram (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). Neuropsychological assessments were performed outside the scanner. Seventy-six controls were scanned without medication to provide normative data for comparison to the patient cohort. Graph theoretical analysis of task-free brain connectivity, with a random 500-node parcellation, was used to measure the effect of disease in placebo-treated state (versus unmedicated controls) and pharmacological intervention (drug versus placebo). Relative to controls, patients on placebo had executive impairments (reduced fluency and inhibitory control), which was reflected in dysfunctional network dynamics in terms of reduced clustering coefficient, hub degree and hub centrality. In patients, atomoxetine improved fluency in proportion to plasma concentration (",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder affecting 7-10 million individuals. The pathologic hallmark of PD is nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron loss, leading to several motor and nonmotor disturbances, such as akinesia, gait disturbance, depression, and anxiety. Recent animal studies have demonstrated that physical exercise improves behavioral and neuropathological deficits in PD. However, the exact underlying mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether long-term exercise has neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons and whether it further alleviates impairment of the gait pattern, locomotor activity, akinesia, and anxiety-like behavior in PD rats.\nA hemiparkinsonian rat model, generated by unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle, was applied to evaluate neuroprotective effects and motor behaviors. Comprehensive spatiotemporal gait analysis, open-field locomotor activity, akinesia, apomorphine-induced rotational analysis, and dopaminergic neuron degeneration level were assessed every week and up to 8 weeks after daily voluntary running wheel exercise.\nCompared with the sham-treated group, we found that 10 weeks of voluntary exercise (i.e., 2-week exercise before PD lesion and 8-week exercise post-PD lesion) significantly reduced 6-OHDA-induced motor deficits in the gait pattern, akinesia, and rotational behavior in the exercise group. Immunohistochemically, a tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuron in the substantia nigra was significantly preserved in the exercise group.\nOur results demonstrated that long-term exercise training is effective for neuroprotection and further attenuates motor declines induced by 6-OHDA in an experimental model of PD. Our data further highlighted potential therapeutic effects of long-term physical exercise relevant to clinical effects for further potential application on human PD subjects.",

The hemorrhage index was derived by combining the hemorrhagic volume and clinical manifestations of ICH. All patients with IHC were followed up for 2 years.\nComputed tomography showed 13 events of ICH in 11 patients (nine cases in the subthalamic nucleus), including eight cases with symptomatic hemorrhage (seven cases in the subthalamic nucleus). Hemorrhage was characterized by intracranial hematoma in the electrode puncture tract. Male sex and hypertension were significant risk factors for ICH. Hemorrhage in the preferred puncture side was significantly higher than that in the non-preferred puncture side. The mean hemorrhage index was 2.23\u2009\u00b1\u20090.83 in 11 patients, and no permanent neurological impairment was found during the 2-year follow-up. The effect of DBS on motor symptoms was similar in patients with and without ICH.\nMale sex and hypertension are risk factors of ICH after DBS in PD. The risk of hemorrhage on the first puncture site is significantly higher than that on the second puncture site.",

    "abstract": "The clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is very difficult, especially in the early stage of the disease, because there is no physiological indicator that can be referenced. Drug-free patients with early PD are characterized by clinical symptoms such as impaired motor function and cognitive decline, which was caused by the dysfunction of brain's dynamic activities. The indicators of brain dysfunction in patients with PD at an early unmedicated condition may provide a valuable basis for the diagnosis of early PD and later treatment. In order to find the spatiotemporal characteristic markers of brain dysfunction in PD, the resting-state EEG microstate analysis is used to explore the transient state of the whole brain of 23 drug-free patients with PD on the sub-second timescale compared to 23 healthy controls. EEG microstates reflect a transiently stable brain topological\u00a0structure with spatiotemporal characteristics, and the spatial characteristic microstate classes and temporal parameters provide insight into the brain's functional activities in PD patients. The further exploration was to explore the relation between temporal microstate parameters and significant clinical symptoms to determine whether these parameters could be used as a basis for clinically assisted diagnosis. Therefore, we used a general linear model (GLM) to explore the relevance of microstate parameters to clinical scales and multiple patient attributes, and the Wilcoxon\u00a0rank sum\u00a0test was used to quantify the linear relation between influencing factors and microstate parameters. Results of microstate analysis revealed that there was an unique spatial microstate different from healthy controls in PD, and several other typical microstates had significant differences compared with the normal control group, and these differences were reflected in the microstate parameters, such as longer durations and more occurrences of one class of microstates in PD compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between multiple microstate classes' parameters and significant clinical symptoms, including impaired motor function and cognitive decline. These results indicate that we have found multiple quantifiable feature tags that reflect brain dysfunction in the early stage of PD. Importantly, such temporal dynamics in microstates are correlated with clinical scales which represent the motor function and recognize level. The obtained results may deepen our understanding of the brain dysfunction caused by PD, and obtain some quantifiable signatures to provide an auxiliary reference for the early diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations represent synchronous neuronal activation and are ubiquitous throughout the brain. Oscillatory activity often includes brief high-amplitude bursts in addition to background oscillations, and burst activity may predict performance on working memory, motor, and comprehension tasks.\nWe evaluated beta burst activity as a possible biomarker for motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). The relationship between beta amplitude dynamics and motor symptoms is critical for adaptive DBS for treatment of PD.\nWe applied threshold-based and support vector machine (SVM) analyses of burst parameters to a defined on/off oscillator and to intraoperative recordings of local field potentials from the subthalamic nucleus of 16 awake patients with PD.\nFiltering and time-frequency analysis techniques critically influenced the accuracy of identifying burst activity. Threshold-based analysis lead to biased results in the presence of changes in long-term beta amplitude and accurate quantification of bursts with thresholds required unknowable a priori knowledge of the time in bursts. We therefore implemented an SVM analysis, and we did not observe changes in burst fraction, rate, or duration with the application of cDBS in the participant data, even though SVM analysis was able to correctly identify bursts of the defined on/off oscillator.\nOur results suggest that cDBS of the STN may not change beta burst activity. Additionally, threshold-based analysis can bias the fraction of time spent in bursts. Improved analysis strategies for continuous and adaptive DBS may achieve improved symptom control and reduce side-effects.",

    "abstract": "Clinical motor and non-motor effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinson's disease (PD) seem to depend on the stimulation site within the STN. We analysed the effects of the position of the stimulation electrode within the motor STN on subjective emotional experience, expressed as emotional valence and arousal ratings to pictures representing primary rewards and aversive fearful stimuli in 20 PD patients. Patients' ratings from both aversive and erotic stimuli matched the mean ratings from a group of 20 control subjects at similar position within the STN. Patients with electrodes located more posteriorly reported both valence and arousal ratings from both the rewarding and aversive pictures as more extreme. Moreover, posterior electrode positions were associated with a higher occurrence of depression at a long-term follow-up. This brain-behavior relationship suggests a complex emotion topography in the motor part of the STN. Both valence and arousal representations overlapped and were uniformly arranged anterior-posteriorly in a gradient-like manner, suggesting a specific spatial organization needed for the coding of the motivational salience of the stimuli. This finding is relevant for our understanding of neuropsychiatric side effects in STN DBS and potentially for optimal electrode placement.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the topographic arrangement and strength of whole-brain white matter (WM) structural connectivity in patients with early-stage drug-naive Parkinson disease (PD).\nWe employed a model-free data-driven approach for computing whole-brain WM topologic arrangement and connectivity strength between brain regions by utilizing diffusion MRI of 70 participants with early-stage drug-naive PD and 41 healthy controls. Subsequently, we generated a novel group-specific WM anatomical network by minimizing variance in anatomical connectivity of each group. Global WM connectivity strength and network measures were computed on this group-specific WM anatomical network and were compared between the groups. We tested correlations of these network measures with clinical measures in PD to assess their pathophysiologic relevance.\nPD-relevant cortical and subcortical regions were identified in the novel PD-specific WM anatomical network. Impaired modular organization accompanied by a correlation of network measures with multiple clinical variables in early PD were revealed. Furthermore, disease duration was negatively correlated with global connectivity strength of the PD-specific WM anatomical network.\nBy minimizing variance in anatomical connectivity, this study found the presence of a novel WM structural connectome in early PD that correlated with clinical symptoms, despite the lack of a priori analytic assumptions. This included the novel finding of increased structural connectivity between known PD-relevant brain regions. The current study provides a framework for further investigation of WM structural changes underlying the clinical and pathologic heterogeneity of PD.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the influence of sex on the effects of smoking and alcohol consumption on the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThis population-based cohort study examined data of 6,795,816 Koreans aged \u226540 years from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database who completed a national program for general health check-up at 2009. For a maximum 9 years' observation period, incident PD was tracked, and hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using the Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for potential confounding factors for each sex group. We tested interactions on the addictive scale by estimating the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI).\n3,400,538 men and 3,395,278 women generated 24,365,694 and 24,754,154 person-years, respectively. A total of 13,223 men (0.39%) and 14,818 women (0.44%) developed PD during follow-up. Current smoking and alcohol independently reduced the risk of PD in both sexes. Current male smokers tended to have a lower risk of PD than current female smokers at equal smoking intensity (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 for interaction) and duration (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 for interaction). In contrast, at equal alcohol intakes, PD risk tended to be lower in female drinkers than in male drinkers (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 for interaction). A superadditive interaction between smoking and alcohol was found in current male smokers (RERI, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.34; P\u00a0=\u00a00.015) and female ex-smokers (RERI, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.76; P\u00a0=\u00a00.014).\nOur data suggest sex-related differences in individual and joint impacts of smoking and alcohol intake on the risk of PD.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic functional network analysis may add relevant information about the temporal nature of the neurocognitive alterations in PD patients with impulse control disorders (PD-ICD). Our aim was to investigate changes in dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) in PD-ICD patients, and topological properties of such networks.\nResting state fMRI was performed on 16 PD PD-ICD patients, 20 PD patients without ICD and 17 healthy controls, whose demographic, clinical and behavioral scores were assessed. We conducted a group spatial independent component analysis, sliding window and graph-theory analyses.\nPD-ICD patients, in contrast to PD-noICD and HC subjects, were engaged across time in a brain configuration pattern characterized by a lack of between-network connections at the expense of strong within-network connections (State III) in temporal, frontoinsular and cingulate cortices, all key nodes of the salience network. Moreover, this increased maintenance of State III in PD-ICD patients was positively correlated with the severity of impulsivity and novelty seeking as measured by specific scales. While in State III, these patients also exhibited increased local efficiency in all the aforementioned areas.\nOur findings show for the first time that PD-ICD patients have a dynamic functional engagement of local connectivity involving the limbic circuit, leading to the inefficient modulation in emotional processing and reward-related decision-making. These results provide new insights into the pathophysiology of ICD in PD patients and indicate that the dFC study of fMRI could be a useful biomarker to identify patients at risk to develop ICD.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein and mitochondria dynamics dysfunction are considered to be implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. However, the underlying mechanisms how \u03b1-synuclein abnormal accumulation causes mitochondrial dynamics dysfunction remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that dynamin-related protein 1(DRP1) is a substrate for p38 MAPK, mutant \u03b1-synuclein overexpression in SN4741 cell caused p38 MAPK activation, p38 MAPK-mediated phosphorylation DRP1 at serine 616 to activate DRP1 and is associated with increased mitochondrial fission, which resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss. Inhibition of p38 MAPK or expression of a kinase death form of p38 MAPK not only attenuates DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission\uff0cbut also restores the mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in \u03b1-synuclein A53T model. These findings showed that inhibition of p38 MAPK-DRP1 signaling pathway may be a viable therapeutic strategy of PD on maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease manifested by a whole group of motor, cognitive, affective, and other disorders. Many of them cannot be controlled by modern pharmacotherapy in full measure. New treatments, including nondrug ones, are needed.\nTo evaluate the impact of rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation on motor, cognitive, and affective disorders in Parkinson's disease.\nThe investigation enrolled 55 patients with Stage III Parkinson's disease according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: a study group (n=35) and a control one (n=20). The groups were matched for age, disease type and duration, and symptom severity. The basic therapy for Parkinson's disease included Levodopa in combination with dopamine receptor agonists and monoamine oxidase B inhibitors. All the patients in the study group underwent a cycle of therapeutic transcranial magnetic stimulation. Both patient groups underwent clinical and neurological examinations and tests using various scales. All the patients were followed up for 6 months.\nThe patients who had undergone a cycle of magnetic stimulation showed a significant improvement in motor functions. There was a decrease in the total MDS-UPDRS-III scores by an average of 6.4 (p<0.05) and that in the GABS scores by 5.9 (p<0.05).\nRhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation can be considered as an additional treatment for Parkinson's disease. No significant side effects were noted during and after stimulation.\n\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c

    "abstract": "To better understand the psychiatric disorders and cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD) and its impact on quality of life (QoL), patients need to be studied soon after diagnosis, before initiation of dopamine replacement therapy.\nThis study aims to compare the nature and frequency of psychiatric morbidity, cognitive dysfunction, and quality of life in drug-naive patients with PD and healthy controls.\nThe cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted in tertiary care center. Fifty drug-naive PD patients and fifty healthy controls were included and assessed on Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, PD Questionnaire 8, Kolkata cognitive screening battery, General Health Questionnaire-12, and Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale (HAM-A and HAM-D).\nThe mean scores of HAM-A and HAM-D of patients with PD were significantly higher than that of the comparison group. The patients with PD had statistically significant impairment in verbal fluency, Mini-Mental State Examination, calculation, memory immediate recall, visuoconstructional ability, and memory (delayed recall and recognition) in comparison to patients without PD. No statistically significant difference was observed with respect to object naming between the two groups.\nQoL of a PD patient is adversely affected by both the motor and nonmotor symptoms of the disease such as depression, anxiety, apathy, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairment. The link between nonmotor symptoms and reduced QoL has important implications for the management of PD because the nonmotor symptoms often appear before patients are given anti-parkinsonian therapy. Screening of nonmotor symptoms in early stage of disease will decrease the morbidity and mortality and improve the QoL.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies described a critical role for microglia in Parkinson's disease (PD), where these central nerve system resident immune cells participate in the neuroinflammatory microenvironment that contributes to dopaminergic neurons loss in the substantia nigra. Understanding the phenotype switch of microgliosis in PD could help to identify the molecular mechanism which could attenuate or delay the progressive decline in motor function. KCa3.1 has been reported to regulate the \"pro-inflammatory\" phenotype switch of microglia in neurodegenerative pathological conditions.\nWe here investigated the effects of gene deletion or pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 activity in wild-type or KCa3.1\nWe report that treatment of MPTP-induced PD mouse model with gene deletion or pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 with senicapoc improves the locomotor ability and the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neuron number and attenuates the microgliosis and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). KCa3.1 involves in store-operated Ca\nTaken together, these results demonstrate a key role for KCa3.1 in driving a pro-inflammatory microglia phenotype in PD.",

The association between PD and Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is uncommon, and so far, since 1987, 26 cases have been reported.

In this article, the pathogenesis of MG in patients with PD is discussed, along with a literature review regarding the co-occurrence of these two neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) to reduce the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is important to identify firing patterns within the structure for a better understanding of the electro-pathophysiology of the disease. Using recently established metrics, our study aims to autonomously identify the discharge patterns of individual cells and examine their spatial distribution within the STN.\nWe recorded single unit activity (SUA) from 12 awake PD patients undergoing a standard clinical DBS surgery. Three extracted features from raw SUA (local variation, bursting index and prominence of peak) were used with k-means clustering to achieve the aforementioned unsupervised grouping of firing patterns.\n279 neurons were isolated and four distinct firing patterns were identified across patients: tonic (11%), irregular (55%), periodic (9%) and non-periodic bursts (25%). The mean firing rates for irregular discharges were significantly lower (\nStrengthening the application of unsupervised clustering for firing patterns of individual cells, this study shows a unique spatial affinity of tonic activity towards the ventral and bursting activity towards the dorsal region of STN in PD patients. This spatial preference, together with the correlation of clinical scores, can provide a clue towards understanding Parkinsonian symptom generation.",

    "abstract": "Bladder dysfunction may cause disabling symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The majority patients' experience symptoms as urinary urgency and nocturia suggest overactive bladder. This seems to be due to an altered brain-bladder relationship because of alteration in fronto-basal ganglia D1-dopaminergic circuit that normally suppresses micturition-reflex. Previous studies demonstrated beneficial effect of D1/D2 dopamine-receptors chronic-stimulation on detrusor overactivity of PD-patients.The present study was aimed to evaluate possible effect of extended-release (ER) Levodopa administered at bed-time on both nocturia and nocturia-related quality-of-life (NQoL) in PD-patients.\n106 PD-patients (Hoehn and Yahr>1 and\u00a0<\u00a04, mean age 66\u00a0years, 59 females and 47 males) were enrolled by 7 Movement Disorders out-patients clinics. Patients undergo to International Prostatic Symptoms Scale-IPSS, including 1-item about nocturia (item 7), and to Nocturia Quality of Life-NQoL questionnaire, at baseline and after two-months of Extended-Release L-dopa (L-dopa/carbidopa or L-dopa benserazide) treatment at bed-time.\nStatistical analysis showed significant improvement on both total IPSS, item 7and NQoL scores following two-months ER L-dopa-treatment. \u0394IPSS score inversely correlated with disease duration.\nThis results support previous evidence of pathophysiological involvement of dopaminergic transmission on bladder dysfunction in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is associated with a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Currently available treatments provide only symptomatic relief and there is no proper diagnosis tool to detect early stages of PD. Recently, nanomedicines and nanoformulation strategies have been widely adopted for the diagnosis and treatment of PD owing to their ability to improve treatment efficacy and provide unique diagnostic functions. Furthermore, advances in nanomedicine limit the potential side effects associated with conventional therapy and provide targeted drug delivery. The objective of this review is to discuss nanoformulation strategies used for the treatment as well as the diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence of the relationship between vitamin D receptor (VDR) rs2228570 (FokI) polymorphism and the susceptibility of Parkinson's disease (PD) is inconsistent, partially due to between-study variations in sample size, age, male/female ratio, and 25-OH vitamin D3 levels. Here, we examined the association between VDR rs2228570 polymorphism and PD risk in a Chinese population. A total of 940 subjects were included in this study, which consisted of 470 patients with sporadic PD (mean age: 62.65\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.34\u202fyears) and 470 healthy control subjects (mean age: 62.70\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.42\u202fyears). A TaqMan genotyping assay was applied to identify VDR rs2228570 polymorphism. The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was calculated for both groups with a Chi-square (\u03c72) test. The sample power was calculated with Power V3.0. The crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for sporadic PD in relation to VDR rs2228570 polymorphism were calculated using a logistic regression analysis. The minor A allele frequency was 0.42 and 0.48 in the control and PD groups, respectively. A allele carriers of rs2228570 were associated with an increased overall risk of PD as well as early-onset PD (EOPD) in the allele and additive genetic models. Stratification analyses showed similar results in male subjects in the allele and additive genetic models, but only in the additive genetic model in female subjects. In conclusion, our study suggests that the VDR rs2228570 A allele is associated with an increased risk of PD in a Chinese population. Further investigations with larger sample sizes with consideration of gene-gene and gene-environment interaction are needed to further elucidate the role of vitamin D receptors in the development of PD.",

    "abstract": "As an anesthetic reversal agent, there are concerns with cholinesterase inhibitors regarding worsening of Parkinson's disease (PD)-related symptoms. Sugammadex, a relatively new reversal agent, does not inhibit acetylcholinesterase and does not require co-administration of an antimuscarinic agent. The present study compared the recovery profiles of 2 agents initially administered for reversal of neuromuscular blockade in patients with advanced PD who underwent deep brain stimulator implantation.A total of 121 patients with PD who underwent deep brain stimulator implantation were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into 1 of 2 groups according to the type of neuromuscular blockade reversal agent (pyridostigmine vs sugammadex) initially administered. Recovery profiles reflecting time to extubation, reversal failure at first attempt, and hemodynamic stability, including incidence of hypertension or tachycardia during the emergence period, were compared.Time to extubation in the sugammadex group was significantly shorter (P\u200a<\u200a.001). In the sugammadex group, reversal failure at first attempt did not occur in any patient, while it occurred in seven (9.7%) patients in the pyridostigmine group (P\u200a=\u200a.064), necessitating an additional dose of pyridostigmine (n\u200a=\u200a3) or sugammadex (n\u200a=\u200a4). The incidence of hemodynamic instability during anesthetic emergence was significantly lower in the sugammadex group than in the pyridostigmine group (P\u200a=\u200a.019).Sugammadex yielded a recovery profile superior to that of pyridostigmine during the anesthesia emergence period in advanced PD patients. Sugammadex is also likely to be associated with fewer adverse effects than traditional reversal agents, which in turn would also improve overall postoperative management in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD) predate motor symptoms and substantially decrease quality of life; however, detection, monitoring, and treatments are unavailable for many of these symptoms. Temporal perception abnormalities in PD are generally attributed to altered Basal Ganglia (BG) function. Present studies are confounded by motor control facilitating movements that are integrated into protocols assessing temporal perception. There is uncertainty regarding the BG's influence on timing processes of different time scales and how PD therapies affect this perception. In this study, PD patients using Levodopa (n\u2009=\u200925), Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS; n\u2009=\u20096), de novo\u00a0patients (n\u2009=\u20096), and healthy controls (n\u2009=\u200917) completed a visual temporal perception task in seconds and sub-section timing scales using a computer-generated graphical tool. For all patient groups, there were no impairments seen at the smaller tested magnitudes (using sub-second timing). However, all PD groups displayed significant impairments at the larger tested magnitudes (using interval timing). Neither Levodopa nor DBS therapy led to significant improvements in timing abilities. Levodopa resulted in a strong trend towards impairing timing processes and caused a deterioration in perceptual coherency according to Weber's Law. It is shown that timing abnormalities in PD occur in the seconds range but do not extend to the sub-second range. Furthermore, observed timing deficits were shown to not be solely caused by motor deficiency. This provides evidence to support internal clock models involving the BG (among other neural regions) in interval timing, and cerebellar control of sub-second timing. This study also revealed significant temporal perception deficits in recently diagnosed PD patients; thus, temporal perception abnormalities might act as an early disease marker, with the graphical tool showing potential for disease monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a common mental health problem leading to significant disability world wide. Depression is not only common but also commonly co-occurs with other mental and neurological illnesses. Parkinson's Disease gives rise to symptoms directly impairing a person's ability to function. Early diagnosis and detection of depression can aid treatment, but diagnosis typically requires an interview with a health provider or structured diagnostic questionnaire. Thus, unobtrusive measures to monitor depression symptoms in daily life could have great utility in screening depression for clinical treatment. Vocal biomarkers of depression are a potentially effective method of assessing depression symptoms in daily life, which is the focus of the current research. We have a database of 921 unique patients with Parkinson's disease and their self assessment of whether they felt depressed or not. Voice recordings from these patients were used to extract paralinguistic features, which served as inputs to machine-learning and deep learning techniques to predict depression. The results are presented here and the limitations are discussed given the nature of the recordings which lack language content. Our models achieved accuracies as high as 0.77 in classifying depressed and non-depressed subjects accurately using their voice features and PD severity. We found depression and severity of Parkinson's Disease had a correlation coefficient of 0.3936, providing a valuable feature when predicting depression from voice. Our results indicate a clear correlation between feeling depressed and the severity of the Parkinson's disease. Voice may be an effective digital biomarker to screen for depression among patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease.",

    "abstract": "Syncope is a common manifestation of both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The most common arrhythmia in HCM is ventricular tachycardia (VT) and atrial fibrillation (AF). While preexcitation provides the substrate for reentry and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), AF is more common in patients with preexcitation than the general population. Concurrence of HCM and WPW has been reported in many cases, but whether the prognosis or severity of arrhythmia is different compared to the individual disorders remains unsettled. We report a case of HCM and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in a 28-year-old male Nigerian soldier presenting with recurrent syncope and lichen planus.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is responsible for several functions required for homeostasis. REM sleep could be a rearrangement period where limits of certain functions can be moved to a new state of balance. This study proposes that dopaminergic deficit may be responsible for the circadian dysregulation that occur with neurodegeneration and therefore a restitution of REM sleep and an improvement in Parkinson disease's symptoms can be achieved with the controlled use of dopamine agonists during the night. Twenty parkinsonian patients underwent to a onemonth study of subcutaneous nocturnal apomorphine treatment at the beginning of each REM stage. This therapeutic approach led to a significant benefit for patients in all of the 3 UPDRS scores. The mean change from baseline in the MDS-UPDRS Part I, II and III was significantly greater in the apomorphine ",

Although research in the United States and Europe has generally supported these relations, there is very limited research on PD caregiving in Latin America.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease can be treated with a combination of acupuncture and herbal medicine, but studies on the synergistic effects of the combined treatment have not yet been conducted. Thus, we subjected an MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mouse model to the combined treatment. We used acupoint GB34 for acupuncture and modified Chunggantang (KD5040) as the herbal medicine, as they have been reported to be effective in Parkinson's disease. We investigated the suboptimal dose of KD5040 and then used this dose in the combined treatment. The results showed that the combined treatment had a synergistic effect on improvements in abnormal motor function and neurodegeneration compared with the use of acupuncture or herbal medicine alone. The combined treatment also had a neuroprotective effect via the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. These findings suggest that the combined treatment with acupuncture and KD5040 can help improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder affecting over 10 million people worldwide. In the 1930s and 1940s there was little understanding regarding what caused PD or how to treat it. In a desperate attempt to improve patients' lives different regions of the neuraxis were ablated. Morbidity and mortality were common, but some patients' motor signs improved with lesions involving the basal ganglia or thalamus. With the discovery of l-dopa the advent of medical therapy began and surgical approaches became less frequent. It soon became apparent, however, that medical therapy was associated with side effects in the form of drug-induced dyskinesia and motor fluctuations and surgical therapies reemerged. Fortunately, during this time studies in monkeys had begun to lay the groundwork to understand the functional organization of the basal ganglia, and with the discovery of the neurotoxin MPTP a monkey model of PD had been developed. Using this model scientists were characterizing the physiological changes that occurred in the basal ganglia in PD and models of basal ganglia function and dysfunction were proposed. This work provided the rationale for the return of pallidotomy, and subsequently deep brain stimulation procedures. In this paper we describe the evolution of these monkey studies, how they provided a greater understanding of the pathophysiology underlying the development of PD and provided the rationale for surgical procedures, the search to understand mechanisms of DBS, and how these studies have been instrumental in understanding PD and advancing the development of surgical therapies for its treatment.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a clinically heterogeneous chronic progressive neuro-degenerative disease with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrosome 1 (N1) territory of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). To date, there has been a major effort to identify changes in the N1 territory by monitoring increases of iron in the SNpc. However, there is no standard protocol being used to visualize or characterize the N1 territory. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to create a robust high quality, rapid imaging protocol, determine a slice by slice characterization of the appearance of N1 (the \"N1 sign\") and evaluate the loss of the N1 sign in order to differentiate healthy controls (HCs) from patients with PD. Firstly, one group of 10 HCs was used to determine the choice of imaging parameters. Secondly, another group of 80 HCs was used to characterize the appearance of the N1 sign and train the raters. In this step, the magnitude, susceptibility weighted images (SWI), quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM) and true SWI (tSWI) images were all reviewed using data from a 3D gradient recalled echo sequence. A resolution of 0.67 mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.67\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a01.34\u00a0mm was chosen based on the ability to cover all the basal ganglia, midbrain and dentate nucleus with good signal-to-noise with echo times of 11\u00a0ms and 20\u00a0ms. Thirdly, 80 Parkinsonism and related disorders patients [idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD): 57; atypical\u00a0parkinsonian syndromes (APs): 14; essential tremor (ET): 9] and one additional group of 80 age-matched HCs were blindly analyzed for the presence or absence of the N1 sign for a differential diagnosis. From the first group of 80 HCs, all of the 76 (100%) cases (4 were excluded due to motion artifacts) showed the N1 sign in one form or another after reviewing the first 5 caudal slices of the SN. For the second group of 80 HCs, 78 (97.5%) showed the N1 sign in at least 2 slices. Of the 80 Parkinsonism and related disorders patients, 32 (56.1%, 32/57) IPD and 6 (42.9%, 6/14) APs showed a bilateral loss of the N1 sign, 12 (21.1%, 12/57) IPD and 6 (42.9%, 6/14) APs showed the N1 sign unilaterally and 13 (22.8%, 13/57) IPD and 2 (14.2%, 2/14) APs showed the N1 sign bilaterally. Also, all 9 (100%, 9/9) ET patients showed the N1 sign bilaterally. The mean total structure and mean high susceptibility region for the SN for both IPD and APs patients with bilateral loss of N1 were higher than those of the HCs (p < 0.002). In conclusion, the N1 sign can be consistently visualized using tSWI with a resolution of at least 0.67\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a00.67 mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.34\u00a0mm and can be seen in 95% of HCs.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a common comorbid condition in Parkinson's disease and a major contributor to poor quality of life. Despite this, depression in PD is under-diagnosed due to overlapping symptoms and difficulties in the assessment of depression in cognitively impaired old patients.\nThis study is to explore functional connectivity markers of depression in PD patients using resting-state fMRI and help diagnose whether patients have depression or not.\nWe reviewed 156 advanced PD patients (duration > 5 years; 59 depressed ones) and 45 healthy control subjects who underwent a resting-state fMRI scanning. Functional connectivity analysis was employed to characterize intrinsic connectivity networks using group independent component analysis and extract connectivity features. Features were put into an all-relevant feature selection procedure within cross-validation loops, to identify features with significant discriminative power for classification. Random forest classifiers were built for depression diagnosis, on the basis of identified features.\n42 intrinsic connectivity networks were identified and arranged into subcortical, auditory, somatomotor, visual, cognitive control, default-mode and cerebellar networks. Six features were significantly relevant to classification. They were connectivity within posterior cingulate cortex, within insula, between posterior cingulate cortex and insula/hippocampus+amygdala, between insula and precuneus, and between superior parietal lobule and medial prefrontal cortex. The mean accuracy achieved with classifiers to discriminate depressed patients from the non-depressed was 82.4%.\nOur findings provide preliminary evidence that resting-state functional connectivity can characterize depressed PD patients and help distinguish them from non-depressed ones.",

Their management is still challenging and new treatment options are needed.\nTo test whether transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation can improve gastrointestinal dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nWe performed a randomized double-blind pilot study enrolling patients suffering from Parkinson's disease with gastroenteric complaints. Patients were randomized to use either a sham-device or to stimulate the vagal nerve with an electric device over the course of four weeks with four stimulations per day. Ten patients (aged 69.6\u00b14.6 years) were randomized for the intervention group, and nine patients (aged 67.2\u00b16.3 years) used a sham-device. Clinical outcome was evaluated using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale whereas gastrointestinal motility was measured with the 13C-octanoic acid breath test.\nIn the treatment group, vagal nerve stimulation improved the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale comparing before and after stimulation (before, 8.7\u00b16.09; after 5.67\u00b13.08; p-value 0.48). This improvement was not observed in the sham group (before, 7.44\u00b14.85; after, 5.67\u00b13.08; p-value 0.16). In the 13C-octanoic acid breath test no significant changes were detectable.\nVagal nerve stimulation is well tolerated with no side effects and may be a promising non-invasive therapy option to improve gastroenteric symptoms in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Given the growing population of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) worldwide and the growing need for family members to take on a caregiving role, it is critical that cross-cultural differences be examined in order to better meet the needs of PD caregivers. The purpose of this study was to examine the connections between the unmet needs and mental health of PD caregivers differentially in Mexico and the United States.\nIn Parkinson's clinics at public, academic medical centers, PD caregivers from Mexico (n\u200a=\u200a148) and the United States (n\u200a=\u200a105) completed measures of unmet family needs and mental health.\nCaregivers in the United States had higher unmet needs for emotional support and for a community support network than caregivers in Mexico, although caregivers at the two sites had comparable levels of anxiety and depression. Unmet family needs explained 29.5% of the variance in caregiver anxiety in the United States (p\u200a<\u200a0.001) but only 5.7% in Mexico (p\u200a=\u200a0.209). Unmet family needs explained 30.4% of the variance in caregiver depression in the United States (p\u200a<\u200a0.001) and 14.0% in Mexico (p\u200a=\u200a0.001). In the United States, unmet needs for emotional support and for instrumental support uniquely predicted caregiver anxiety and depression, and in Mexico only the unmet need for instrumental support was a unique predictor.\nPD caregivers in the United States are at increased risk for poor emotional and community support, and these unmet needs channel directly into caregiver anxiety and depression. In Mexico, where caregivers have stronger emotional and community support, caregivers' unmet need for instrumental support generates anxiety and depression. Important targets for PD caregiver interventions may differ between Mexico and the United States.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a complex etiology. Several factors are known to contribute to the disease onset and its progression. However, the complete underlying mechanisms are still escaping our understanding. To evaluate possible correlations between metabolites and metallomic data, in this research, we combined a control study measured using two different platforms. For the different data sources, we applied a Block Sparse Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (Block-sPLS-DA) model that allows for proving their relation, which in turn uncovers alternative influencing factors that remain hidden otherwise. We found two groups of variables that trace a strong relationship between metallomic and metabolomic parameters for disease development. The results confirmed that the redox active metals iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) together with fatty acids are the major influencing factors for the PD. Additionally, the metabolic waste product p-cresol sulfate and the trace element nickel (Ni) showed up as potentially important factors in PD. In summary, the data integration of different types of measurements emphasized the results of both stand-alone measurements providing a new comprehensive set of information and interactions, on PD disease, between different variables sources.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders with a global burden of approximately 6.1 million patients. Alpha-synuclein has been linked to both the sporadic and familial forms of the disease. Moreover, alpha-synuclein is present in Lewy-bodies, the neuropathological hallmark of PD, and the protein and its aggregation have been widely linked to neurotoxic pathways that ultimately lead to neurodegeneration. Such pathways include autophagy/lysosomal dysregulation, synaptic dysfunction, mitochondrial disruption, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress. Alpha-synuclein has not only been shown to alter cellular pathways but also to spread between cells, causing aggregation in host cells. Therapeutic approaches will need to address several, if not all, of these angles of alpha-synuclein toxicity. Here we review the current advances in therapeutic efforts for PD that aim to produce a disease-modifying therapy by targeting the spread, production, aggregation, and degradation of alpha-synuclein. These include: receptor blocking strategies whereby putative alpha-synuclein receptors could be blocked inhibiting alpha-synuclein spread, an alpha-synuclein reduction which will decrease the amount alpha-synuclein available for aggregation and pathway disruption, the use of small molecules in order to target alpha-synuclein aggregation, immunotherapy and the increase of alpha-synuclein degradation by increasing autophagy/lysosomal flux. The research discussed here may lead to a disease-modifying therapy that tackles disease onset and progression in the future.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic deep brain stimulation alleviates motor symptoms of Parkinson disease by activating precise volumes of neural tissue. While electrophysiological and anatomical correlates of clinically effective electrode sites have been described, therapeutic stimulation likely acts through multiple distinct neural populations, necessitating characterization of the full span of tissue activation. Microelectrode recordings have yet to be mapped to therapeutic tissue activation volumes and surveyed for predictive markers.\nCombine high-density, broadband microelectrode recordings with detailed computational models of tissue activation to describe and to predict regions of therapeutic tissue activation.\nElectrophysiological features were extracted from microelectrode recordings along 23 subthalamic deep brain stimulation implants in 16 Parkinson disease patients. These features were mapped in space against tissue activation volumes of therapeutic stimulation, modeled using clinically-determined stimulation programming parameters and fully individualized, atlas-independent anisotropic tissue properties derived from 3T diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images. Logistic LASSO was applied to a training set of 17 implants out of the 23 implants to identify predictors of therapeutic stimulation sites in the microelectrode recording. A support vector machine using these predictors was used to predict therapeutic activation. Performance was validated with a test set of six implants.\nAnalysis revealed wide variations in the distribution of therapeutic tissue activation across the microelectrode recording-defined subthalamic nucleus. Logistic LASSO applied to the training set identified six oscillatory predictors of therapeutic tissue activation: theta, alpha, beta, high gamma, high frequency oscillations (HFO, 200-400\u00a0Hz), and high frequency band (HFB, 500-2000\u00a0Hz), in addition to interaction terms: theta x HFB, alpha x beta, beta x HFB, and high gamma x HFO. A support vector classifier using these features predicted therapeutic sites of activation with 64% sensitivity and 82% specificity in the test set, outperforming a beta-only classifier. A probabilistic predictor achieved 0.87 area under the receiver-operator curve with test data.\nTogether, these results demonstrate the importance of personalized targeting and validate a set of microelectrode recording signatures to predict therapeutic activation volumes. These features may be used to improve the efficiency of deep brain stimulation programming and highlight specific neural oscillations of physiological importance.",

    "abstract": "Voice technology has grown tremendously in recent years and using voice as a biomarker has also been gaining evidence. We demonstrate the potential of voice in serving as a deep phenotype for Parkinson's Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, by presenting methodology for voice signal processing for clinical analysis. Detection of PD symptoms typically requires an exam by a movement disorder specialist and can be hard to access and inconsistent in findings. A vocal digital biomarker could supplement the cumbersome existing manual exam by detecting and quantifying symptoms to guide treatment. Specifically, vocal biomarkers of PD are a potentially effective method of assessing symptoms and severity in daily life, which is the focus of the current research. We analyzed a database of PD patient and non-PD subjects containing voice recordings that were used to extract paralinguistic features, which served as inputs to machine learning models to predict PD severity. The results are presented here and the limitations are discussed given the nature of the recordings. We note that our methodology only advances biomarker research and is not cleared for clinical use. Specifically, we demonstrate that conventional machine learning models applied to voice signals can be used to differentiate participants with PD who exhibit little to no symptoms from healthy controls. This work highlights the potential of voice to be used for early detection of PD and indicates that voice may serve as a deep phenotype for PD, enabling precision medicine by improving the speed, accuracy, accessibility, and cost of PD management.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose data and event-related potentials in the Go/NoGo paradigm in patients with Parkinson's disease with and without cognitive impairment. In the group of cognitively impaired patients, glucose metabolism was decreased in the frontal, parietal, cingulate and posterior temporal cortex. Correlations were found between the cognitive scores and cerebral glucose metabolism in those areas. Event-related potentials analysis revealed a decrease in the amplitude of the late positive wave (P300 NoGo wave) in the group of cognitively impaired patients. The analysis revealed that decline in amplitude of P300 wave was accompanied by decreased glucose metabolism in several cortical areas associated with cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. Correlations of glucose metabolism in these areas with event-related potentials amplitude in the NoGo condition confirm the important role of executive functions disorders in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is an efficacious, underutilized treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies of DBS post-operative outcomes are often restricted to data from a single center and consider DBS in isolation. National estimates of DBS readmission and post-operative outcomes are needed, as are comparisons to commonly performed surgeries.\nThis study used datasets from the 2013 and 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD). Our sample was restricted to PD patients discharged alive after hospitalization for DBS surgery. Descriptive analyses examined patient, clinical, hospital and index hospitalization characteristics. The all-cause, non-elective 30-day readmission rate after DBS was calculated, and logistic regression models were built to examine factors associated with readmission. Readmission rates for the most common surgical procedures were calculated and compared to DBS.\nThere were 6058 DBS surgeries for PD in our sample, most often involving a male aged 65 and older, who lived in a high socioeconomic status zip code. DBS patients had an average of four comorbidities. With respect to outcomes, the majority of patients were discharged home (95.3%). Non-elective readmission was rare (4.9%), and was associated with socioeconomic status, comorbidity burden, and teaching hospital status. Much higher acute, non-elective readmission rates were observed for common procedures such as upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (16.2%), colonoscopy (14.0%), and cardiac defibrillator and pacemaker procedures (11.1%).\nShort-term hospitalization outcomes after DBS are generally favorable. Socioeconomic disparities in DBS use persist. Additional efforts may be needed to improve provider referrals for and patient access to DBS.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to describe the role that telehealth has in the delivery of palliative care to people with Parkinson's disease and related disorders (PDRDs), particularly as their disease advances, and they become homebound. A review of the Cochrane database, PubMed, and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications on this topic. Telehealth has been found to increase access to neurological specialty care for people with PDRDs who live in more under-resourced areas or are homebound due to their advancing neurodegenerative disease. Given the benefits of palliative care for people with PDRDs and their caregivers, increasing access via telehealth to palliative care through research, education and policy efforts has the potential to significantly improve the landscape of care for those with PDRDs.",

    "abstract": "A palliative approach to care is person-centered and aims to minimize overall disease burden among patients with serious illnesses. There is rising interest in the role of palliative care to improve quality of life among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). While there is a clear indication for palliative care involvement in those with advanced disease, there is also increasing evidence for the role palliative care may play earlier in the course of PD. However, optimal methods for timing and implementation of these services remain unclear. Here, we aim to explore the palliative needs of individuals with PD from the time of diagnosis over the entire course of the illness. We discuss methods for delivering palliative care services including consultative specialty palliative care, neurologist or primary care-delivered palliative care (primary palliative care), and the emerging specialty of neuropalliative care. We also explore novel care delivery methods and their role in improving patient access to palliative services. We argue that primary palliative care is optimally positioned for the delivery of palliative care for the majority of patients with PD over the course of their illness and explore how and when palliative medicine or neuropalliative specialists can supplement this care. Finally, we describe gaps in our current understanding of outpatient palliative care delivery among the PD population including the development of better methods to identify the palliative needs of patients, the validation of novel care delivery mechanisms, and the need to enhance neurologists' and other medical providers' education in the provision of palliative care services.",

Associations between clinical symptoms and differential leukocyte count (DLC) or DLC associated peripheral inflammatory biomarkers were examined.\nAltered DLC and DLC associated peripheral inflammatory biomarkers were associated with PD related symptoms even though there was no sign of clinical inflammation. After controlling for covariables, olfaction and body mass index (BMI) were inversely associated with percentage of neutrophil, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and positively associated with percentage of lymphocyte, lymphocyte to monocyte ratio. Patients with tremor-dominant or mixed type had lower peripheral inflammatory indices than those with akinetic rigid type.\nComponents of peripheral blood leukocytes reflect some clinical symptoms of PD. Patients with normosmia, tremor-dominant or mixed type, and patients without low BMI have low peripheral inflammatory indices. Relative mild peripheral inflammation may play one of major roles in developing mild disease phenotype in these patients.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein is a hallmark amyloidogenic protein component of the Lewy bodies (LBs) present in dopaminergic neurons affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite an enormous increase in emerging knowledge, the mechanism(s) of \u03b1-synuclein neurobiology and crosstalk among pathological events that are critical for PD progression remains enigmatic, creating a roadblock for effective intervention strategies. One confounding question is about the potential link between \u03b1-synuclein toxicity and genome instability in PD. We previously reported that pro-oxidant metal ions, together with reactive oxygen species (ROS), act as a \"double whammy\" in dopaminergic neurons by not only inducing genome damage but also inhibiting their repair. Our recent studies identified a direct role for chromatin-bound, oxidized \u03b1-synuclein in the induction of DNA strand breaks, which raised the question of a paradoxical role for \u03b1-synuclein's DNA binding in neuroprotection versus neurotoxicity. Furthermore, recent advances in our understanding of \u03b1-synuclein mediated mitochondrial dysfunction warrants revisiting the topics of \u03b1-synuclein pathophysiology in order to devise and assess the efficacy of \u03b1-synuclein-targeted interventions. In this review article, we discuss the multi-faceted neurotoxic role of \u03b1-synuclein in the nucleus and mitochondria with a particular emphasis on the role of \u03b1-synuclein in DNA damage/repair defects. We utilized a protein-DNA binding simulation to identify potential residues in \u03b1-synuclein that could mediate its binding to DNA and may be critical for its genotoxic functions. These emerging insights and paradigms may guide new drug targets and therapeutic modalities.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease and focal dystonia have difficulty in generating and preventing movement. Reaction time (RT) and stop signal reaction time (SSRT) measure the speed to initiate and stop a movement respectively. We developed a portable device to assess RT and SSRT. This incorporated a novel analysis to measure SSRT more efficiently (optimal combination SSRT, ocSSRT). After validation ocSSRT was measured in Parkinson's disease patients without dyskinesia (PD), cervical dystonia (CD) and writer's cramp. We also assessed how ocSSRT responded to L-dopa in PD patients and botulinum toxin injections in CD patients. Participants were instructed to release a button following a green LED flash on the device. On 25% of trials, a red LED flashed 5-195\u2009ms after the green LED; participations were instructed to abort the button release on these trials. ocSSRT and RT were significantly prolonged in patients with Parkinson's disease and focal dystonia (one-way ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.001). Administration of L-dopa significantly improved ocSSRT and RT in PD patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Administration of botulinum toxin significantly improved ocSSRT, but not RT, in CD patients (p\u2009<\u20090.05). ocSSRT is an easily-administered bedside neuro-physiological tool; significantly prolonged ocSSRT is associated with PD and focal dystonia.",

Despite the high accuracy of this approach in tracking markers' trajectories and acquiring ground reaction forces (GRFs), its dependence on laboratory-mounted equipment restricts its potential use in wider variety of clinical applications.\nWould a full-body musculoskeletal model driven by a single depth sensor data only produce comparable gait kinetic parameters, including GRFs and lower extremity joints moments, for elderly participants, both healthy and those diagnosed with PD?\nNine patients diagnosed with PD and 11 healthy age-matched control participants performed three over-ground gait trials. Full-body kinematic data were collected using a depth sensor and a musculoskeletal model have been constructed using AnyBody musculoskeletal modeling system to predict the three-dimensional GRFs and lower extremity joint moments. Predicted kinetic parameters for both PD and control groups were compared during the braking and propulsive phases of the gait cycle. In addition, ensemble curve analysis with 90% confidence intervals were constructed to compare between group differences across the stance phase of the gait cycle.\nThe findings of this study showed that the PD exhibited a significantly lower braking peak vertical GRF and propulsion peak horizontal GRF while no significant between-group differences were found in peak lower extremity joint moments. However, the PD showed significant alterations in lower extremity joint moments during the early and late phases of stance, which indicate a difference in ambulation strategy.\nThe proposed method adopting full-body musculoskeletal model driven by a depth sensor data proves that it has the potential to be a portable and cost-effective gait analysis tool in the clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is among the most frequently-occurring neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Although mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested to play a central role in PD pathogenesis, few studies have clinically evaluated mitochondrial function in PD patients. We therefore aimed to determine whether mitochondrial function is altered in PD patients by applying two approaches that are normally used for the diagnosis of mitochondrial disorder (MD).\nWe measured serum growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) levels in 36 PD patients, 30 age-matched healthy controls, and 5 MD patients. Among these, 20 PD patients and 18 healthy controls underwent the lactate stress test. Serum GDF15 levels were evaluated with respect to clinical characteristics.\nMean GDF15 levels were significantly higher in the PD (1472\u00a0pg/mL, p\u00a0=\u00a0.034) and MD (3363\u00a0pg/mL, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) groups than in the control group (1093\u00a0pg/mL). The lactate stress test exhibited no significant differences between PD patients and controls. Age was identified as an independent factor that correlated with serum GDF15 levels in both groups. In PD patients, there was no significant difference between serum GDF15 levels and other clinical parameters including sex, cognitive function, and lifestyle.\nSerum GDF15 levels, but not lactate levels, were elevated in Japanese patients with PD, thus highlighting the potential association between PD and GDF15.",

Hoehn & Yahr (HY) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part I-IV (UPDRS I-IV) scales were used to assess the severity of PD, and electromyography was used to measure the sympathetic skin response (SSR). The general clinical characteristics, medication status and assessment of other autonomic nervous functions were also recorded.\nPatients were classified into PDE (edema) and PDNE (non-edema) subgroups, and had similar age, disease duration, HY scale, and autonomic nervous function assessment other than SSR. However, PDE patients had higher UPDRS II and III (activities of daily living and motor examination) subscores compared to PDNE patients (P=0.004 and P=0.012, respectively). The amplitude of SSR in the lower limbs was lower and the latency prolonged in PD patients, and these changes were more pronounced in the PDE subgroup. Finally, 83% of the PDE patients were regularly taking pramipexole, compared to 25% in the PDNE group.\nPD patients with lower limb edema have lower SSR amplitude and longer latency.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by dopaminergic cell loss within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that leads to reduced striatal dopamine content and resulting motor deficits. Identifying new strategies to protect these cells from degeneration and retain striatal dopaminergic innervation is therefore of great importance. Chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are recognised contributors to the inhibitory extracellular milieu known to hinder tissue recovery following CNS damage. Digestion of these molecules by the bacterial lyase chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) has been shown to promote functional recovery in animal models of neurological injury. Although ChABC has been shown to promote sprouting of dopaminergic axons following transection of the nigrostriatal pathway, its ability to protect against nigrostriatal degeneration in a toxin-based module with better construct validity for PD has yet to be explored. Here we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of ChABC treatment in the full and partial 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion mouse models of PD.\nIn mice bearing a full 6-OHDA lesion, ChABC treatment failed to protect against the loss of either nigral cells or striatal terminals. In contrast, in mice bearing a partial 6-OHDA lesion, ChABC treatment significantly protected cells of the rostral SNc, which remained at more than double the numbers seen in vehicle-treated animals. In the partial lesion model, ChABC treatment also significantly preserved dopaminergic fibres of the rostral dorsal striatum which increased from 15.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5% of the intact hemisphere in saline-treated animals to 36.3\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5% in the ChABC-treated group. These protective effects of ChABC treatment were not accompanied by improvements in either the cylinder or amphetamine-induced rotations tests of motor function.\nChABC treatment provided significant protection against a partial 6-OHDA lesion of the nigrostriatal tract although the degree of protection was not sufficient to improve motor outcomes. These results support further investigations into the benefits of ChABC treatment for providing neuroprotection in PD.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we have investigated the differences in the voices of Parkinson's disease (PD) and age-matched control (CO) subjects when uttering three phonemes using two complexity measures: fractal dimension (FD) and normalised mutual information (NMI). Three sustained phonetic voice recordings, /a/, /u/ and /m/, from 22 CO (mean age = 66.91) and 24 PD (mean age = 71.83) participants were analysed. FD was first computed for PD and CO voice recordings, followed by the computation of NMI between the test groups: PD-CO, PD-PD and CO-CO. Four features reported in the literature-normalised pitch period entropy (Norm. PPE), glottal-to-noise excitation ratio (GNE), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and glottal closing quotient (ClQ)-were also computed for comparison with the proposed complexity measures. The statistical significance of the features was tested using a one-way ANOVA test. Support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel was used to classify the test groups, using a leave-one-out validation method. The results showed that PD voice recordings had lower FD compared to CO (",

The association of PLMS severity and PD was analyzed by Fisher exact test, univariate, and multivariate logistic regression.The mean age was 55.6 years old (standard deviation\u200a=\u200a9.8, range\u200a=\u200a40-91) for all subjects. There were 2205 subjects without PD and 25 subjects with PD in this study. The distribution of PLMS severity was not significantly different between subjects without PD and with PD (Fischer exact test, P\u200a=\u200a.215). Also, PLMS was not significantly associated with PD using univariate and multivariate logistic regression.The PLMS severity was not associated with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by various motor symptoms including balance and gait impairment. Several studies have shown that physiotherapy, cueing techniques, treadmill training, and cognitive movement strategies are useful in improving balance and gait in patients with PD. Devices employing virtual reality (VR) have been shown to be promising in neurorehabilitation as they can provide the patients with multisensory stimulation creating a realistic environment and improve the motivation and the adhesion of patients to the rehabilitation program. This preliminary study is aimed at testing the efficacy and feasibility of gait training based on the computer-assisted virtual reality environment (CAREN) in a sample of PD.\nIn this preliminary study, 22 outpatients affected by PD who attended the Behavioral and Robotic Neurorehab Laboratory of the IRCCS Neurolesi between August 2017 and October 2018 were enrolled. All PD patients underwent 20 conventional physiotherapy sessions followed by 3-month of rest. Then, the patients were provided with 20 sessions of CAREN training. Gait and balance performances were rated before, after each training protocol, and 3 months later. Gait analysis was also performed before and after CAREN training.\nAll patients completed both of the rehabilitation trainings without any adverse event. All considered scales improved significantly at the end of both rehabilitation treatments. However, patients presented with a greater clinical improvement after the CAREN training, compared with conventional physiotherapy. In particular, patients walked faster and with more stability, with wider, longer steps.\nEven though further neurophysiological details are required to identify the patients who may benefit from CAREN training, our findings suggest that this innovative device is an effective and feasible tool to train balance and gait in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease, the dopaminergic neurons of the brain are destroyed. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter that acts on the basal ganglia of the brain, allowing precise body movement. In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, levodopa appears to alleviate clinical symptoms; however, during long-term use, motor complications occur. There is no clear treatment or remedy for Parkinson's disease; therefore, the development of novel therapies is urgently required. In the present study, mouse choroid plexus cells were transplanted into ST36 in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease to determine whether the motor function could be restored. Pole tests showed changes in motor dysfunction in the mice. The athletic ability of the mice was significantly lowered after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) injection and significantly increased after choroidal neuron cell treatment. Injection of di-alkyl indocarbocyanine (DiI) (as a trace substance) confirmed that the choroid plexus cells injected into acupuncture point ST36 were transferred to the brain. In the Parkinson's disease model, choroid plexus cell injection into ST36 inhibited the decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and decreased the activation of inflammatory factors mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase (COX2) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Apoptosis factors Cytochrome C and BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (BAX) levels were decreased and B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (BCL2) levels were increased. Taken together, these results suggest that the injection of choroid plexus cell at ST36 had neuroprotective effects in the Parkinson's disease mouse model. The results suggest new possibilities for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Deep-brain stimulation targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) can be used to treat motor symptoms and dyskinesia in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). High-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the STN can lead to consistent, long-term improvement of PD symptoms. However, the effects of HFS on the axial symptoms of PD, specifically freezing of gait, can be limited or cause further impairment. While this can be alleviated via relatively low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in selected patients, LFS does not control all motor symptoms of PD. Recently, the National Engineering Laboratory for Neuromodulation reported preliminary findings regarding an efficient way to combine the advantages of HFS and LFS to form variable-frequency stimulation (VFS). However, this novel therapeutic strategy has not been formally tested in a randomized trial.\nWe propose a multicenter, double-blind clinical trial involving 11 study hospitals and an established deep-brain stimulation team. The participants will be divided into a VFS and a constant-frequency stimulation group. The primary outcome will be changes in stand-walk-sit task scores after 3 months of treatment in the \"medication off\" condition. Secondary outcome measures include specific item scores on the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire and quality of life. The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of VFS compared with constant-frequency stimulation.\nThis is the first randomized controlled trial to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of VFS of the STN in patients with advanced PD. VFS may represent a new option for clinical treatment of PD in the future.\nClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03053726. Registered on February 15, 2017.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that widespread cortical cerebral blood flow deficits occur early in the course of Parkinson's disease. Although cerebral blood flow measurement has been suggested as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, as well as a means for tracking response to treatment, the relationship of cerebral blood flow to \u03b1-synucleinopathy, a major pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease, remains unclear. Therefore, we performed arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging on transgenic mice overexpressing human wild-type \u03b1-synuclein and age-matched controls to measure cerebral blood flow and degenerative changes. As reported for early-stage Parkinson's disease, \u03b1-synuclein mice exhibited a significant reduction in cortical cerebral blood flow, which was accompanied by motor coordination deficits and olfactory dysfunction. Although no overt degenerative changes were apparent in diffusion tensor imaging images, magnetic resonance imaging volumetric analysis revealed a significant reduction in olfactory bulb volume, similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease patients. Our data, representing the first report of cerebral blood flow deficit in an animal model of Parkinson's disease, suggest a causative role for \u03b1-synucleinopathy in cerebral blood flow deficits in Parkinson's disease. Thus, \u03b1-synuclein transgenic mice comprise a promising model to study Parkinson's disease-related mechanisms of cerebral blood flow deficits and to investigate further its utility as a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess, in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), progression of motor dysfunction and the effect of OSA treatment.\nData were analysed from a prospective cohort study of idiopathic PD patients from a movement disorders clinic. Patients found to have OSA on polysomnography (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] \u226515 events/h, OSA+) were offered treatment using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP+ was defined as an average\u00a0\u2265\u00a02\u00a0h/night use at each follow-up. Motor symptoms were assessed using the motor section of the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (mUPDRS) and the Timed-Up-And-Go (TUG). Follow-up times were 3, 6 and 12 months. Mixed models were constructed, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, levodopa equivalent dose and comorbidities.\nWe studied 67 individuals (61.2% male) of mean age 64.7 years (SD\u00a0=\u00a010.1). Baseline mUPDRS was higher in OSA+\u00a0compared to OSA- (24.5 [13.6] vs. 16.2 [7.2], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Motor dysfunction increased at comparable rates in OSA- and OSA+CPAP-. However, in OSA+CPAP+, mUPDRS change was significantly lower compared to OSA- (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.01 vs. 0.61, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03; p\u00a0=\u00a00.12 vs. OSA+CPAP- [\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.39]) and TUG change was lower compared to OSA+CPAP- (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.01 vs. 0.13, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; p\u00a0=\u00a00.05 vs. OSA- [\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.02]).\nIn this PD cohort, OSA was associated with higher baseline mUPDRS. In those with OSA, CPAP use was associated with stabilization of motor function (mUPDRS and TUG) over 12 months. These observations support further research to clarify the role of OSA in PD pathophysiology and motor dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Investigating biomarkers to demonstrate progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) is of high priority. We investigated the association of brain structural properties with progression of clinical outcomes and their ability to differentiate clinical subtypes of PD.\nA comprehensive set of clinical features was evaluated at baseline and 4.5-year follow-up for 144 de-novo PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. We created a global composite outcome (GCO) by combining z-scores of non-motor and motor symptoms, motor signs, overall activities of daily living and global cognition, as a single numeric indicator of prognosis. We classified patients into three subtypes based on multi-domain clinical criteria: 'mild motor-predominant', 'intermediate' and 'diffuse-malignant'. We analyzed diffusion-weighted scans at the early drug-na\u00efve stage and extracted fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD) of basal ganglia and cortical sub-regions. Then, we employed graph theory to calculate network properties and used network-based statistic to investigate our primary hypothesis.\nBaseline MD of globus pallidus was associated with worsening of motor severity, cognition, and GCO after 4.5 years of follow-up. Connectivity disruption at baseline was correlated with decline in cognition, and increase in GCO. Baseline MD of nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus and basal-ganglia were linked to clinical subtypes at 4.5-year of follow-up. Disruption in sub-cortical networks associated with being subtyped as 'diffuse-malignant' versus 'mild motor-predominant' after 4.5 years.\nDiffusion imaging analysis at the early de-novo stage of PD was able to differentiate clinical sub-types of PD after 4.5 years and was highly associated with future clinical outcomes of PD.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of levodopa on functional brain networks in Parkinson's disease.\nWe acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging in 30 drug-na\u00efve participants with Parkinson's disease and 20 age-matched healthy controls. Each participant was studied following administration of a single oral dose of either levodopa or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design.\nThe greatest observed differences in functional connectivity were between Parkinson's disease versus control participants, independent of pharmacologic intervention. By contrast, the effects of levodopa were much smaller and detectable only in the Parkinson's disease group. Moreover, although levodopa administration in the Parkinson's disease group measurably improved motor performance, it did not increase the similarity of functional connectivity in Parkinson's disease to the control group.\nWe found that a single, small dose of levodopa did not normalize functional connectivity in drug-na\u00efve Parkinson's disease. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Over the course of the disease, about 80% of Parkinson's disease patients will develop cognitive impairment. However, predictive factors associated with cognitive decline are still under investigation. Here, we investigated which clinically available markers are predictive of cognitive impairment in a cohort of early drug-na\u00efve Parkinson's disease patients. 294 drug-na\u00efve Parkinson's disease patients, who were cognitively normal at baseline, were recruited from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. At 36-month follow-up, patients were diagnosed with cognitive impairment according to two levels: Level 1 diagnosis was defined as MoCA\u2009<\u200926 and Level 2 diagnosis was defined as MoCA\u2009<\u200926, alongside an impaired score on at least two neuropsychological tests. Predictive variables with a validated cut-off were divided into normal or abnormal measures, whilst others were divided into normal or abnormal measures based on the decile with the highest power of prediction. At 3\u00a0years' follow-up, 122/294 Parkinson's disease (41.5%) patients had cognitive decline. We found that age at Parkinson's disease onset, MDS-UPDRS Part-III, Hopkin's Learning Verbal Test-Revised Recall, Semantic Fluency Test and Symbol Digit Modalities Test were all predictors of cognitive decline. Specifically, age at Parkinson's disease onset, Semantic Fluency Test and symbol Digit Modalities Test were predictors of cognitive decline defined by Level 2. The combination of three abnormal tests, identified as the most significant predictors of cognitive decline, gave a 63.6-86.7% risk of developing cognitive impairment defined by Level 2 and Level 1 criteria, respectively, at 36-month follow-up. Our findings show that these clinically available measures encompass the ability to identify drug-na\u00efve Parkinson's disease patients with the highest risk of developing cognitive impairment at the earliest stages. Therefore, by implementing this in a clinical setting, we can better monitor and manage patients who are at risk of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Focused ultrasound-enhanced intranasal (IN\u2009+\u2009FUS) delivery is a noninvasive approach that utilizes the olfactory pathway to administer pharmacological agents directly to the brain, allowing for a more homogenous distribution in targeted locations compared to IN delivery alone. However, whether such a strategy has therapeutic values, especially in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), remains to be established. Herein, we evaluated whether the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine catalysis, could be enhanced by IN\u2009+\u2009FUS delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a toxin-based PD mouse model. Mice were put on the subacute dosing regimen of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), producing bilateral degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway consistent with early-stage PD. MPTP mice then received BDNF intranasally followed by multiple unilateral FUS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) openings in the left basal ganglia for three consecutive weeks. Subsequently, mice were survived for two months and were evaluated morphologically and behaviorally to determine the integrity of their nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Mice receiving IN\u2009+\u2009FUS had significantly increased TH immunoreactivity in the treated hemisphere compared to the untreated hemisphere while mice receiving only FUS-induced BBB opening or no treatment at all did not show any differences. Additionally, behavioral changes were only observed in the IN\u2009+\u2009FUS treated mice, indicating improved motor control function in the treated hemisphere. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the method and potential of IN\u2009+\u2009FUS for the delivery of bioactive factors for treatment of neurodegenerative disorder.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate resting-state functional connectivity as a potential prognostic biomarker of Parkinson disease (PD) progression. The study examined longitudinal changes in cortical resting-state functional connectivity networks in participants with PD compared to controls as well as in relation to baseline protein measures and longitudinal clinical progression.\nIndividuals with PD without dementia (n = 64) and control participants (n = 27) completed longitudinal resting-state MRI scans and clinical assessments including full neuropsychological testing after overnight withdrawal of PD medications (\"off\"). A total of 55 participants with PD and 20 control participants also completed baseline \u03b2-amyloid PET scans and lumbar punctures for CSF protein levels of \u03b1-synuclein, \u03b2-amyloid, and tau. Longitudinal analyses were conducted with multilevel growth curve modeling, a type of mixed-effects model.\nFunctional connectivity within the sensorimotor network and the interaction between the dorsal attention network with the frontoparietal control network decreased significantly over time in participants with PD compared to controls. Baseline CSF \u03b1-synuclein protein levels predicted decline in the sensorimotor network. The longitudinal decline in the dorsal attention-frontoparietal internetwork strength correlated with the decline in cognitive function.\nThese results indicate that \u03b1-synuclein levels may influence longitudinal declines in motor-related functional connectivity networks. Further, the interaction between cortical association networks declines over time in PD prior to dementia onset and may serve as a prognostic marker for the development of dementia.",

    "abstract": "In some cases, a variety of creative abilities appear in patients with Parkinson's disease receiving dopaminergic therapy. These are the creativity of thinking, unusual motivation and efficiency, which are not inherent to the patients before. The author considers a spectrum of these changes, as well as their possible pathobiochemical and pathophysiological basis. The connection between creativity in art and impulsive-compulsive disorders is discussed. Specific personality traits, type of temperament and emotional stability can play a significant role in the development of creative abilities. It is important to recognize and control the severity of the creative potential of patients with Parkinson's disease, improving the quality of life, and to increase self-esteem, psychological attitude and social adaptation among these patients preventing the excesses of this process.\n\u0423 \u0440\u044f\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c\u044e \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0444\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043c \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043c\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u0421\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0438\u0445 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0445\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435. \u041e\u0431\u0441\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u041e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044b \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u0442\u0438\u043f \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u044d\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u0447\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0412\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u043f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438, \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0434\u0430\u043f\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms following dopaminergic depletion in the substantia nigra. Besides motor impairments, however, several non-motor detriments can have the potential to considerably impact subjectively perceived quality of life in patients. Particularly emotion recognition of facial expressions has been shown to be affected in PD, and especially the perception of negative emotions like fear, anger, or disgust is impaired. While emotion processing generally refers to automatic implicit as well as conscious explicit processing, the focus of most previous studies in PD was on explicit recognition of emotions only, while largely ignoring implicit processing deficits. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is widely accepted as a therapeutic measure in the treatment of PD and has been shown to advantageously influence motor problems. Among various concomitant non-motor effects of STN-DBS, modulation of facial emotion recognition under subthalamic stimulation has been investigated in previous studies with rather heterogeneous results. Although there seems to be a consensus regarding the processing of disgust, which significantly deteriorates under STN stimulation, findings concerning emotions like fear or happiness report heterogeneous data and seem to depend on various experimental settings and measurements. In the present review, we summarized previous investigations focusing on STN-DBS influence on recognition of facial emotional expressions in patients suffering from PD. In a first step, we provide a synopsis of disturbances and problems in facial emotion processing observed in patients with PD. Second, we present findings of STN-DBS influence on facial emotion recognition and especially highlight different impacts of stimulation on implicit and explicit emotional processing.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, resulting in loss of dopamine neurons. Excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy dysfunction play a crucial role on Parkinson's disease (PD) development. It has been showed that acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) alleviates the development of PD by inhibiting ER stress. But the role of autophagy and its relationship with ER stress during aFGF treatment for PD has not been elucidated. We found that both aFGF and rapamycin (Rapa) improved 6-Hydroxy Dopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD development as shown with histomorphology results in striatum and substantia nigra (SNpc). Additionally, aFGF promoted autophagy with increasing mTOR and decreasing p62 expressions, and then exerts its neuroprotective role in 6-OHDA-treated PC12 cells, which were abolished by chloroquine (CQ) treatment. Moreover, 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) administration inhibited the expressions of autophagy markers during 6-OHDA-treated PC12 cells, which was similar with aFGF treating PC12 cells under 6-OHDA condition. Furthermore, we had detected the expressions of CHOP and its downstream factor, tribbles homologue 3 (TRB3), a pro-apoptotic protein. We found that TRB3 and CHOP expressions were significantly downregulated after treating with aFGF and 4-PBA in 6-OHDA-treated PC12 cells and PD model. Taken together, this study has demonstrated that aFGF treatment ameliorates 6-OHDA-induced elevated ER stress and subsequently suppression of autophagy ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are two CNS disorders in which dysfunctions in the dopaminergic system and mitochondria are major pathologies. The symptomology of both, PD a neurodegenerative disorder and SZ a neurodevelopmental disorder, is completely different. However, the pharmacological treatment of each of the diseases can cause a shift of symptoms into those characteristic of the other disease. In this review, I describe a pathological interaction between dopamine and mitochondria in both disorders, which due to differences in the extent of oxidative stress leads either to cell death and tissue degeneration as in PD substantia nigra pars compacta or to distorted neuronal activity, imbalanced neuronal circuitry and abnormal behavior and cognition in SZ. This review is in the honor of Moussa Youdim who introduced me to the secrets of research work. His enthusiasm, curiosity and novelty-seeking inspired me throughout my career. Thank you Moussa.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of and factors related to orthostatic syndromes in recently diagnosed drug-na\u00efve patients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nThis was a cross-sectional study that included 217 drug-na\u00efve patients with PD and 108 sex- and age-matched non-parkinsonian controls from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) prospective cohort study who were devoid of diabetes, alcoholism, polyneuropathy, amyloidosis, and hypotension-inducing drugs. Orthostatic symptoms were evaluated using the Scales for Outcomes in PD-Autonomic Dysfunction (SCOPA-AUT). Ioflupane-I\nCompared with non-parkinsonian controls, patients with PD experienced a mild fall in systolic blood pressure upon standing (p\u2009=\u20090.082). The prevalence of OH was 11.1% in PD patients and 5.6% in controls (p\u2009=\u20090.109). The prevalence of OI was higher in patients with PD than in controls (31.3 vs. 13.3%; p\u2009=\u20090.003). Logistic regression revealed that OH and OI were related to a lower striatal DaT level and higher SCOPA-AUT gastrointestinal score.\nOrthostatic syndromes were common in the recently diagnosed drug-na\u00efve patients with PD enrolled in the study, but only the prevalence of OI was higher in PD patients than in the non-parkinsonian controls. Unlike motor or functional disability indicators, markers of dopaminergic striatal deficit and gastrointestinal dysfunction were associated with OH and OI.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the diagnostic value of tremor analysis in early stages of Parkinson's syndrome, when the clinical symptoms of tremor onset are not unilaterally often able for a definite diagnosis to be made.\nWe included 70 patients with unilateral tremor, under 45 years old and disease duration within 3 years enrolled in Peking University Third Hospital from January, 2014 to December 2015. We recorded clinical features, unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS)-III, non-motor symptom (NMS) scores. Tremor analysis and transcranial sonography were performed for all the patients. Based on the results of tremor analysis, we arbitrarily divided the patients into 3 groups: (1) The patients with classical Parkinson's syndrome manifestations on one side (25 cases); (2) The patients with classical Parkinson's syndrome manifestations on both sides (15 cases); (3) The patients with no classical Parkinson's syndrome manifestations (30 cases). The patients were monitored every 6 months to 3 years, until the final diagnosis was made.\nThere was no significant difference in age, gender distribution, Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) scores and H-Y scores among the three groups (P>0.05). The average UPDRS-III motor scores of the three groups were significantly different (P=0.001), with 18.23, 18.79 and 14.67, respectively. The average scores of NMS were significantly different, with 15.81, 17.07 and 9.90, respectively (P<0.001). The positive rates of transcranial sonography (TCS) in the three groups were 48.0%, 60.0% and 26.67%, with no significant difference (P=0.702). After three years of follow-up, 35 patients (50%) met the diagnostic criteria of Parkinson's disease of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) in 2015, 19 patients (27.1%) met the criteria of idiopathic tremor, and 7 patients (10%) met the criteria of Parkinson's plus syndrome. The sensitivity and specificity of tremor analysis for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease were 82.8% and 68.6%, respectively. Compared with TCS, the sensitivity and specificity of TCS were 65.7% and 62.9%. There were consistency (Kappa=0.568) and significant difference (P=0.031) between the two methods.\nTremor analysis is sensitive and a superior way in identifying early Parkinson's syndrome patients with tremor dominant manifestation. The combination of non-motor symptoms and transcranial sonography are also needed at diagnosis.\n\u7814\u7a76\u9707\u98a4\u5206\u6790\u5728\u4ee5\u9707\u98a4\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\n\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76,\u5165\u7ec4\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e3a\u5e74\u9f84>45\u5c81\u3001\u75c5\u7a0b\u5c0f\u4e8e3\u5e74\u3001\u4e8e2014\u5e741\u6708\u81f32015\u5e7412\u6708\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u7b2c\u4e09\u533b\u9662\u95e8\u8bca\u6216\u4f4f\u9662\u7684\u5355\u4fa7\u80a2\u4f53\u9707\u98a4\u60a3\u8005,\u8bb0\u5f55\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u8d44\u6599\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8bc4\u5b9a\u91cf\u8868-\u2162\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u975e\u8fd0\u52a8\u75c7\u72b6\u91cf\u8868\u8bc4\u5206\u7b49\u3002\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u9707\u98a4\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e2d\u8111\u8d85\u58f0\u68c0\u67e5,\u6309\u7167\u9707\u98a4\u5206\u6790\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u5178\u578b\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ec4:\u5355\u4fa7\u9707\u98a4,\u9707\u98a4\u5206\u6790\u7b26\u5408\u5178\u578b\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8868\u73b0,\u5bf9\u4fa7\u65e0\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8868\u73b0(25\u4f8b);\u5355\u4fa7\u9707\u98a4,\u9707\u98a4\u5206\u6790\u53cc\u4fa7\u5747\u7b26\u5408\u5178\u578b\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8868\u73b0(15\u4f8b);\u5355\u4fa7\u9707\u98a4,\u9707\u98a4\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u5178\u578b\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u8868\u73b0(30 \u4f8b)\u3002\u6bcf\u534a\u5e74\u6216\u4e00\u5e74\u8fdb\u884c\u7535\u8bdd\u968f\u8bbf\u6216\u9762\u8bbf,\u76f4\u5230\u60a3\u8005\u786e\u5b9a\u8bca\u65ad\u3002\n\u4e09\u7ec4\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6c49\u5bc6\u5c14\u987f\u6291\u90c1\u91cf\u8868\u8bc4\u5206\u3001Hoehn-Yahr(H-Y)\u5206\u7ea7\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49(\n\u9707\u98a4\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f83\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee5\u9707\u98a4\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005,\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u7ed3\u5408\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u975e\u8fd0\u52a8\u75c7\u72b6\u548c\u4e2d\u8111\u8d85\u58f0\u68c0\u67e5\u3002",

    "abstract": "To investigate in a cross-sectional study the contributions of altered cerebellar resting-state functional connectivity (FC) to cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD).\nWe conducted morphometric and resting-state FC-MRI analyses contrasting 81 participants with PD and 43 age-matched healthy controls using rigorous quality assurance measures. To investigate the relationship of cerebellar FC to cognitive status, we compared participants with PD without cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] scale score 0, n = 47) to participants with PD with impaired cognition (CDR score \u22650.5, n = 34). Comprehensive measures of cognition across the 5 cognitive domains were assessed for behavioral correlations.\nThe participants with PD had significantly weaker FC between the vermis and peristriate visual association cortex compared to controls, and the strength of this FC correlated with visuospatial function and global cognition. In contrast, weaker FC between the vermis and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was found in the cognitively impaired PD group compared to participants with PD without cognitive impairment. This effect correlated with deficits in attention, executive functions, and global cognition. No group differences in cerebellar lobular volumes or regional cortical thickness of the significant cortical clusters were observed.\nThese results demonstrate a correlation between cerebellar vermal FC and cognitive impairment in PD. The absence of significant atrophy in cerebellum or relevant cortical areas suggests that this could be related to local pathophysiology such as neurotransmitter dysfunction.",

No group differences in cerebellar lobular volumes or regional cortical thickness of the significant cortical clusters were observed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of carrying out this research is to evaluate the characteristics and differences of visuomotor in Bender-Gestalt II performance among Parkinson's disease of type tremor-dominant and akinetic-rigid. The possibility of predicting Parkinson's disease type based on Bender-Gestalt II performance was also assessed. A movement disorder specialist diagnosed all the patients and confirmed Parkinson's disease in them. The patients were classified into different types of Parkinson's disease under the observation of movement specialists. This classification was based on the patient's initial descriptions and dominant symptoms. The patient-related information and the characteristics of visuomotor were collected from Bender-Gestalt II and interview. There was a total of 15 tremor-dominant and 17 akinetic-rigid patients. The average age of patients suffering from tremor type disease was 68.33\u00a0years and for akinetic type patients 68.70\u00a0years, respectively. There were no statistically significant results between the type, socioeconomic status, educational status, sex, and duration of Parkinson's disease. The akinetic-rigid type evidently impaired visuomotor function, visuomotor memory, and the timely reaction of visuomotor function. The visuomotor abilities kept preserved in the tremor type. The akinetic-rigid type also occupies more neurological indicators as compared to the tremor-dominant type (",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that causes both sensorimotor and non-motor impairments, and there is a clear need for non-medical approaches to improve quality of life. Dance is an increasingly popular activity among people with PD, which demonstrates potential therapeutic benefits. However, findings to date have been inconsistent, and little is known about the mechanisms underlying benefits of dance in PD. In this review, we provide an overview of research into dance for people with PD. The majority of quantitative evidence is in the sensorimotor domain, but cognitive, psychological and social effects have also been reported. We consider the role of cognitive representations of action within dance through observation, imitation and imagery, which may contribute to both sensorimotor and non-motor outcomes for people with PD. Moreover, we discuss how these processes may be enhanced through dance to provide further benefits in everyday life. Finally, we propose avenues for future research to increase understanding of action representation in dance for PD, which has the potential to inform practice and maximize benefits.",

    "abstract": "Despite the subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment commonly used to ameliorate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), its effects on somatosensation is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential effects of DBS on temperature, proprioceptive, tactile, exteroceptive, pain and cortical sensations, and odor identification in PD patients.\nThe study included 14 patients (with a mean age of 59.78 \u00b1 11.03 years; range, 44-70 years) with idiopathic PD who underwent DBS surgery for movement disorders caused by PD at the same Neurosurgery Department. All patients were tested while DBS was turned on (DBS-ON) and off (DBS-OFF). To clearly observe the effect of removing stimulation off, DBS devices were turned off by experimental clinical personnel for a minimum duration of 30 min prior to examination. Temperature, proprioceptive, tactile, exteroceptive, pain and cortical sensations, and odor identification were examined.\nWe found that two-point discrimination was significantly lower during DBS-ON than DBS-OFF (p = 0.031). Tactile sensation and kinesthesia deviation degree were lower during DBS-ON than DBS-OFF, but were non-significant (p > 0.05). The number of correct answers on an assessment of graphesthesia was higher during DBS-ON, but was non-significant as well (p > 0.05). Odor identification was better during DBS-OFF.\nDBS may have an effective role to improve somatosensation and DBS-related benefits may not be explained by improvements in motor function alone, but rather by enhanced somatosensory processing. Further studies with larger study groups are needed.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease typically affect executive functions. Recently, the concept of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) has been related to PD (PD-MCI). PD-MCI is considered a transition phase to Parkinson's disease Dementia. Therefore, it is important to identify PD-MCI in a reliable way.\nTo evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the INECO Frontal Screening (IFS) in detecting cognitive deficits in PD-MCI. Additionally, we compare the IFS and the Addenbrook Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) between three groups; PD-MCI, MCI, and controls.\nThe IFS and ACE-R were administered to 36 patients with PD-MCI, 31 with MCI (amnestic-multidomain subtype) and 92 healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity were determined using ROC analysis. The groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance.\nThe IFS had adequate accuracy in differentiating patients with PD-MCI from healthy controls (AUC=0.77, sensitivity=0.82, specificity=0.77), and good accuracy in differentiating PD-MCI from MCI patients (AUC=0.80, sensitivity=0.82, specificity=0.61). However the IFS had low accuracy in differentiating MCI patients from healthy controls (AUC=0.47, sensitivity=0.52, specificity=0.41). On the ACE-R, the PD-MCI group had low performance in Fluency and Language. Only patients with PD-MCI had difficulties on the IFS, specifically in inhibitory control and visual working memory. This dysexecutive profile explains the sensitivity and specificity values found in the IFS.\nThe present study results suggest that the IFS is a suitable screening tool for exploring cognitive dysfunction in PD-MCI, especially in those patients with a dysexecutive profile.\nOs d\u00e9ficits cognitivos na doen\u00e7a de Parkinson geralmente afetam as fun\u00e7\u00f5es executivas.

    "abstract": "The impairments in cognitive functions such as memory, executive function, visuospatial skills and language in Parkinson's disease (PD) are drawing increasing attention in the current literature. Studies dedicated to investigating the relationship between subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and cognitive functioning are contradictory. This systematic review aims to analyze the impact on the cognitive functioning of patients with PD and STN-DBS. Articles published in the 2007-2017 period were retrieved from the Medline/Pubmed databases using PRISMA criteria. The analysis of 27 articles revealed many conflicting results, precluding a consensus on a cognitive functioning standard and hampering the establishment of a neuropsychological profile for PD patients who underwent STN-DBS surgery. Further studies investigating this relationship are needed.\nAs defici\u00eancias nas fun\u00e7\u00f5es cognitivas, como mem\u00f3ria, fun\u00e7\u00e3o executiva, habilidades visuoespaciais e linguagem na doen\u00e7a de Parkinson (DP), est\u00e3o cada vez mais chamando a aten\u00e7\u00e3o na literatura atual.

    "abstract": "A primary cilium is an antenna-like structure on the cell surface that plays a crucial role in sensory perception and signal transduction. Mitochondria, the 'powerhouse' of the cell, control cell survival, and death. The cellular ability to remove dysfunctional mitochondria through mitophagy is important for cell survival. We show here that mitochondrial stress, caused by respiratory complex inhibitors and excessive fission, robustly stimulates ciliogenesis in different types of cells including neuronal cells. Mitochondrial stress-induced ciliogenesis is mediated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation, subsequent activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and autophagy. Conversely, abrogation of ciliogenesis compromises mitochondrial stress-induced autophagy, leading to enhanced cell death. In mice, treatment with mitochondrial toxin, MPTP elicits ciliary elongation and autophagy in the substantia nigra dopamine neurons. Blockade of cilia formation in these neurons attenuates MPTP-induced autophagy but facilitates dopamine neuronal loss and motor disability. Our findings demonstrate the important role of primary cilia in cellular pro-survival responses during mitochondrial stress.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and Lewy pathology. PD is a major concern of today's aging population and has emerged as a global health burden. Despite the rapid advances in PD research over the past decades, the gold standard therapy provides only symptomatic relief and fails to halt disease progression. Therefore, exploring novel disease-modifying therapeutic strategies is highly demanded. Metformin, which is currently used as a first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has recently demonstrated to exert a neuroprotective role in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD, both in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we explore the neuroprotective potential of metformin based on emerging evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies. Regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms, metformin has been shown to inhibit \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) phosphorylation and aggregation, prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, attenuate oxidative stress, modulate autophagy mainly via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, as well as prevent neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Overall, the neuroprotective effects of metformin in PD pathogenesis present a novel promising therapeutic strategy that might overcome the limitations of current PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating condition resulting in motor and non-motor symptoms affecting approximately 10 million people worldwide. Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments that can cure the condition or effectively halt its progression. The focus of PD research has been primarily on the neurobiological basis and consequences of dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration given that the loss of DA neurons projecting from the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum results in the development of cardinal PD motor symptoms. Alternatively, gastrointestinal dysfunction is well recognized in PD patients, and often occurs prior to the development of motor symptoms. The gut microbiota, which contains thousands of bacterial species, play important roles in intestinal barrier integrity and function, metabolism, immunity and brain function. Pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest an important link between alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and psychiatric and neurological conditions, including PD. Several reports have documented gut dysbiosis and alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota in PD patients. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore the contribution of the gut microbiota to the behavioral and neurochemical alterations in a rodent toxin model of DA depletion that reproduces the motor symptoms associated with PD. We observed that chronic treatment of adult rats with non-absorbable antibiotics ameliorates the neurotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in a unilateral lesion model. Specifically, immunohistochemistry against the dopaminergic neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) showed an attenuation of the degree of 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuron loss in antibiotic treated animals compared to control animals. In addition, we observed a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in the striatum of antibiotic-treated animals. The degree of motor dysfunction after 6-OHDA was also attenuated in antibiotic-treated animals as measured by paw-rearing measurements in the cylinder test, forepaw stepping test, and ipsilateral rotations observed in the amphetamine-induced rotation test. These results implicate the gut microbiota as a potential contributor to pathology in the development of PD. Further studies are necessary to understand the specific mechanisms involved in transducing alterations in the gut microbiota to changes in dopaminergic neuron loss and motor dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety is a severe problem for at least one-third of people living with Parkinson's disease (PD). Anxiety appears to have a greater adverse impact on quality of life than motor impairment. Despite its high prevalence and impact on daily life, anxiety is often undiagnosed and untreated. To better address anxiety in PD, future research must improve knowledge about the mechanism of anxiety in PD and address the lack of empirical evidence from clinical trials. In response to these challenges, the Parkinson's Foundation sponsored an expert meeting on anxiety on June 13th and 14th 2018. This paper summarizes the findings from that meeting informed by a review of the existing literature and discussions among patients, caregivers, and an international, clinician-scientist, expert panel working group. The goal is to provide recommendations to improve our understanding and treatment of anxiety in PD.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss is common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been reported that low Body Mass Index (BMI) is associated with disease progression in these patients, but only a few data are available on the relationship between BMI and cognitive dysfunctions in PD patients. In the present study we systematically assessed the possible relationship between BMI index and specific cognitive defects.\nWe enrolled a prospective sample of 37 PD individuals and 30 healthy controls (HC) of similar age, sex, and education. The BMI was calculated in each participant, who underwent a neuropsychological assessment exploring the general cognitive skills, frontal/executive, visuo-spatial, visuo-constructional and memory abilities.\nWe showed that PD group had significant lower BMI value compared to HC group. In PD patients, the BMI was negatively correlated to disease duration and number of errors at the Stroop-Color Word Test, and positively to score on Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Moreover, a regression analysis revealed that, the BMI in PD patients was associated with disease duration and score on FAB.\nOur findings contribute to reveal that the relationship between height and weight is strongly related to frontal cognitive dysfunctions in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "We explored the origin of the impaired control of action stability in Parkinson's disease (PD) by testing levodopa-na\u00efve PD patients to disambiguate effects of PD from possible effects of long-term exposure to levodopa. Thirteen levodopa-na\u00efve PD patients and 13 controls performed single- and multi-finger force production tasks, including producing a self-paced quick force pulse into a target. A subgroup of patients (n\u2009=\u200910) was re-tested about 1\u00a0h after the first dose of levodopa. Compared to controls, PD patients showed lower maximal forces and synergy indices stabilizing total force (reflecting the higher inter-trial variance component affecting total force). In addition, PD patients showed a trend toward shorter anticipatory synergy adjustments (a drop in the synergy index in preparation to a quick action) and larger\u00a0non-motor equivalent finger force deviations. Lower maximal force, higher unintentional force production (enslaving) and higher inter-trial variance indices occurred in PD patients after one dosage of levodopa. We conclude that impairment in synergies is present in levodopa-na\u00efve patients, mainly in indices reflecting stability (synergy index), but not agility (anticipatory synergy adjustments). A single dose of levodopa, however, did not improve synergy indices, as it did in PD patients on chronic anti-PD medication, suggesting a different mechanism of action. The results suggest that indices of force-stabilizing synergies may be used as an early behavioral sign of PD, although it may not be sensitive to acute drug effects in drug-na\u00efve patients.",

    "abstract": "High-intensity training, a still unexplored exercise for individuals with Parkinson's disease, is positively related with increased functionality and aerobic profile in healthy individuals. The aim of this work was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and acceptance of sprint running in individuals with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's. Additionally, we compared sprint biomechanical outputs of force, velocity and power between individuals with Parkinson's disease and healthy.\nPhysically trained subjects with Parkinson's, men, (n\u00a0=\u00a016, 64:9.01\u00a0years, stage between 1 and 3 in the Hoehn and Yahr, 16.8:7.1 at Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scales, and control group (n\u00a0=\u00a021, 65:9.27\u00a0years) performed 20\u00a0m sprint sessions. We analyzed the self-reported satisfaction and acceptance using a self-administered questionnaire, and the sprint biomechanics and performance based on high-speed video recordings.\nAll participants completed the tests with high feasibility, acceptability and satisfaction scores. The sprint maximal force and maximal power outputs were higher in Parkinson's disease. Conversely, control group showed higher mechanical effectiveness values. Interestingly, no difference in velocity capabilities and overall 20-m sprint performance was observed between groups, possibly explained by different mechanical strategies in both groups over the sprint accelerations. Linear regression analyses showed that physical qualities are predictors of mechanical effectiveness, and mechanical variables are important determinants of sprint performance on Parkinson's disease.\nSprint is a feasible exercise for people with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease. Even though differences in physical qualities and mechanical effectiveness exist between subjects with Parkinson's disease and healthy, there is no overall substantial impact on sprint running performance.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases for which there is no disease-modifying treatment. PD and DLB are characterized by aggregation of the synaptic protein \u03b1-synuclein, and there is compelling evidence to suggest that progression of these diseases is associated with the trans-cellular spread of pathogenic \u03b1-synuclein through the brains of afflicted individuals. Therapies targeting extracellular, pathogenic \u03b1-synuclein may therefore hold promise for slowing or halting disease progression. In this regard, it has been suggested that highly-selective antibodies can be administered as therapeutic agents targeting pathogenic proteins. In the current study, we screened a series of antibodies using multiple selection criterion to identify those that selectively bind pathogenic \u03b1-synuclein and show potent inhibition of pathology seeding in a neuronal model of \u03b1-synucleinopathy. A lead antibody was tested in a mouse model of PD, and it was able to reduce the spread of \u03b1-synuclein pathology in the brain and attenuate dopamine reductions in the striatum. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of \u03b1-synuclein immunotherapy for the treatment of PD and DLB, and provides a framework for screening of \u03b1-synuclein antibodies to identify those with preferred properties.",

    "abstract": "Monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors act in Parkinson's disease (PD) via potentiation of dopamine, but may also have neuroprotective effects by reducing oxidative damage. Oxidative damage is also a feature of environmental toxins, including pesticides, that are an established risk factor for PD. Another risk factor is low circulating uric acid (UA), which may relate to UA being the major endogenous antioxidant in the human body. We have undertaken a study of 192 initial admissions for PD in a general hospital neurology department in a partly rural region of Southern China to determine if there is an increased rate of PD in agricultural workers who have a high risk of exposure to pesticides, and how it may relate to deficits in UA. We found a disproportionately high number of agricultural workers admitted with PD (66.7% vs. 54.3% of all neurology admissions) and that PD subjects have a substantial reduction in UA. This is further reduced in agricultural workers and thus may contribute to the increased vulnerability of this group to PD.",

    "abstract": "Literature documents the impact of Parkinson's Disease (PD) on speech but no study has analyzed in detail the importance of the distinct phonemic groups for the automatic identification of the disease. This study presents new approaches that are evaluated in three different corpora containing speakers suffering from PD with two main objectives: to investigate the influence of the different phonemic groups in the detection of PD and to propose more accurate detection schemes employing speech. The proposed methodology uses GMM-UBM classifiers combined with a technique introduced in this paper called phonemic grouping, that permits observation of the differences in accuracy depending on the manner of articulation. Cross-validation results reach accuracies between 85% and 94% with AUC ranging from 0.91 to 0.98, while cross-corpora trials yield accuracies between 75% and 82% with AUC between 0.84 and 0.95, depending on the corpus. This is the first work analyzing the generalization properties of the proposed approaches employing cross-corpora trials and reaching high accuracies. Among the different phonemic groups, results suggest that plosives, vowels and fricatives are the most relevant acoustic segments for the detection of PD with the proposed schemes. In addition, the use of text-dependent utterances leads to more consistent and accurate models.",

    "abstract": "Progressive gait dysfunction is one of the primary motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). It is generally expressed as reduced step length and gait speed and as increased variability in step time and step length. People with PD also exhibit stooped posture which disrupts gait and impedes social interaction. The gait and posture impairments are usually resistant to the pharmacological treatment, worsen as the disease progresses, increase the likelihood of falls, and result in higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. These impairments may be caused by perceptual deficiencies (poor spatial awareness and loss of temporal rhythmicity) due to the disruptions in processing intrinsic information related to movement initiation and execution which can result in misperceptions of the actual effort required to perform a desired movement and maintain a stable posture. Consequently, people with PD often depend on external cues during execution of motor tasks. Numerous studies involving open-loop cues have shown improvements in gait and freezing of gait (FoG) in people with PD. However, the benefits of cueing may be limited, since cues are provided in a consistent/rhythmic manner irrespective of how well a person follows them. This limitation can be addressed by providing feedback in real-time to the user about performance (closed-loop cueing) which may help to improve movement patterns. Some studies that used closed-loop cueing observed improvements in gait and posture in PD, but the treadmill-based setup in a laboratory would not be accessible outside of a research setting, and the skills learned may not readily and completely transfer to overground locomotion in the community. Technologies suitable for cueing outside of laboratory environments could facilitate movement practice during daily activities at home or in the community and could strongly reinforce movement patterns and improve clinical outcomes. This narrative review presents an overview of cueing paradigms that have been utilized to improve gait and posture in people with PD and recommends development of closed-loop wearable systems that can be used at home or in the community to improve gait and posture in PD.",

    "abstract": "Currently, clinical evaluation represents the primary outcome measure in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, clinical evaluation may underscore some subtle motor impairments, hidden from the visual inspection of examiners. Technology-based objective measures are more frequently utilized to assess motor performance and objectively measure motor dysfunction. Gait and balance impairments, frequent complications in later disease stages, are poorly responsive to classic dopamine-replacement therapy. Although recent findings suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can have a role in improving motor skills, there is scarce evidence for this, especially considering the difficulty to objectively assess motor function. Therefore, we used wearable electronics to measure motor abilities, and further evaluated the gait and balance features of 10 PD patients, before and (three days and one month) after the tDCS. To assess patients' abilities, we adopted six motor tasks, obtaining 72 meaningful motor features. According to the obtained results, wearable electronics demonstrated to be a valuable tool to measure the treatment response. Meanwhile the improvements from tDCS on gait and balance abilities of PD patients demonstrated to be generally partial and selective.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed gender differences in the progressive dopamine (DA) deficiency phenotype in the MitoPark (MP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) with progressive loss of DA release and reuptake in midbrain DA pathways. We found that the progressive loss of these DA presynaptic parameters begins significantly earlier in male than female MP mice. This was correlated with behavioral gender differences of both forced and spontaneous motor behavior. The degeneration of the nigrostriatal DA system in MP mice is earlier and more marked than that of the mesolimbic DA system, with male MP mice again being more strongly affected than female MP mice. After ovariectomy, DA presynaptic and behavioral changes in female mice become very similar to those of male animals. Our results suggest that estrogen, either directly or indirectly, is neuroprotective in the midbrain DA system. Our results are compatible with epidemiological data on incidence and symptom progression in PD, showing that men are more strongly affected than women at early ages.",

    "abstract": "- Our objectives were to determine the differences in the vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) responses in patients diagnosed with early staged idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to the normal population and evaluate the vestibular system disorder causing balance-posture disorders. Second aim of this study was to investigate caloric test responses particularly in early staged PD compared to normal popu-lation.\nThirty patients (14 females and 16 males; mean age, 60.6 \u00b1 13.1 years) diagnosed with idiopathic PD and 28 healthy subjects (20 males and 8 females; mean age, 59.1 \u00b1 6.4 years) were included. The patient and control groups were subdivided according to their age, gender and the patient group was subdivided according to onset time of the Parkinson symptoms, Hoehn-Yahr staging. The subgroups were compared for VEMP and caloric test responses.\nThere were no significant differences between the study and control groups for right and left VEMP measurements. Patients over 60 years and under 60 years did not show significant differences in terms of right and left mean VEMP measurements. However, P1 amplitude was significantly lower in patients over 60 years old (P = .004). Gender, disease duration, BERG balance scale and Hoehn-Yahr stage had no effect on the VEMP amplitudes. There was no significant correlation with the side of Parkinsonian symptoms to the side of canal paresis (P = .566) and the side on which no VEMP response was obtained in caloric test.\nVEMP responses were not different between PD and healthy subjects. VEMP P1 amplitude was decreased with age in PD group. Canal paresis and symptoms side were not statistically correlated in caloric test.\nA vizsg\u00e1lat c\u00e9lja az volt, hogy meg\u00e1llap\u00edtsuk, milyen k\u00fcl\u00f6nbs\u00e9g van a Parkinson-k\u00f3r korai st\u00e1dium\u00e1ban szenved\u0151k \u00e9s az eg\u00e9szs\u00e9ges popul\u00e1ci\u00f3 tagjai eset\u00e9n a vestibularis kiv\u00e1ltott myogen v\u00e1laszokban (VEMP), valamint azonos\u00edtsuk az egyens\u00faly- \u00e9s testtart\u00e1szavart okoz\u00f3 vestibularis probl\u00e9m\u00e1t.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra region and the presence of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in the striatum and surrounding areas of brain. Evidences suggest that neuroinflammation plays a role in the progression of PD. We examined the neuro-protective effects of Bacopa monnieri (BM) in regulating neuroinflammation. Administration of BM suppressed the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreased the levels of \u03b1-synuclein, and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in PD animal model. Pre-treatment of BM showed more prominent results as compare to co- and post-treatment. Results suggest that Bacopa can limit inflammation in the different areas of brain, thus, offers a promising source of novel therapeutics for the treatment of many CNS disorders.",

    "abstract": "Several studies suggested a potential role of viral infection in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the association between herpes zoster and PD was not investigated well till now.\nUsing the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 13\u00a0083 patients aged \u226545 years with herpes zoster and 52\u00a0332 (1:4) age-/sex-matched controls were enrolled between 1998 and 2008 and followed to the end of 2011. Those who developed PD during the follow-up period were identified.\nThe Cox regression analysis with adjustment of demographic characteristics, health system utilization, and comorbidities demonstrated that patients with herpes zoster had an increased risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.43-2.28) of developing PD in later life compared to the control group. Sensitivity tests after excluding the first year (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.16-1.93) and first 2-year (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.10-1.88) observation periods showed consistent results.\nPatients with herpes zoster were more likely to develop PD in later life compared to the controls. Additional studies are necessary for validating our results and to clarify the underlying pathophysiology between herpes zoster and PD.",

    "abstract": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglial surface receptor that mediates the degradation disorder of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) in Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of TREM2 in Parkinson's disease (PD) and \u03b1-Synclein (\u03b1-Syn) degradation is largely unknown.\nIn this case-control study on Chinese population, we sequenced for polymorphisms in exon 2 of the TREM2 gene in 1,292 individuals, PD cases (n = 612), healthy controls (n = 680) by Sanger sequence, and compared the distribution of allelic frequencies between the two groups by the Fisher's exact test. Additionally, we developed and used the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to evaluated soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma in partial of sequenced groups (55 PD and 40 healthy controls) analyzed their relationship with total a-syn (t-a-Syn).\nTwo novel variants were detected in exon 2 of the TREM2 gene, namely, p.S81 N, p.G58D; however, these were not significantly associated with PD (612 PD and 680 healthy controls). sTREM2 in CSF was significantly upregulated in PD patients compared to healthy controls (433.1 \u00b1 24.7 pg/mL vs. 275.2 \u00b1 17.9 pg/mL, p < 0.0001), but not in plasma (281.7 \u00b1 29.3 pg/mL vs. 257.8 \u00b1 16.5 pg/mL, p = 0.805). In PD patients, sTREM2 was positively correlated with t-\u03b1-syn (r = 0.62, p = 0.0001) in CSF, but not in plasma (r = 0.02, p = 0.89).\nAlthough it may not indicate that exon 2 polymorphisms of TREM2 play a role in the pathogenesis of PD in the Chinese population, our findings described above highlight the relevance of CSF sTREM2 as a promising biomarker and are extremely possible to the therapeutic target for PD in the future.",

Thorough physical examinations and auxiliary tests suggested secondary Parkinson's disease, but the pathogenesis was unknown. During the cesarean section at the 31 weeks plus 6 d, an exploration and liver biopsy revealed a metastatic, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The positron emission tomography and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed a breast ductal carcinoma of stage IV. To our knowledge, only two reports have documented the association between the breast cancer and the Parkinson disease, and neither occurred in pregnant women.\nOur case alerts the secondary Parkinson disease as the possible presentation of breast cancer, the most common malignancy during pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Monoamine neurotransmitters play essential roles in the regulation of arousal and sleep. Impaired metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitters could result in the accumulation of neurotoxic aldehyde metabolites and, hence, neuronal degeneration. Aldehyde dehydrogenases play an important role in the metabolism of the neurotoxic aldehyde metabolites, including the aldehyde metabolites of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline. Deficient aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) has been suggested to result in the accumulation of these biogenic aldehydes. An ALDH2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs671 (A), results in significantly reduced ALDH2 enzyme activity. A total of 83 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients were recruited in this study. In addition to the genotypes of rs671, the patients were assessed with the PD sleep scale-2nd version (PDSS-2) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) for symptoms of daytime and nocturnal sleep disturbances. The patients carrying rs671 (A) had more frequent dozing while lying down to rest in the afternoon (ESS item5) (F\u2009=\u20097.308, p\u2009=\u20090.008) than the rs671 (GG) patients. The patients with rs671 (A) reported a trend toward more frequent difficulty staying asleep than the patients with rs671 (GG). (F\u2009=\u20093.278, p\u2009=\u20090.074). The results indicate that patients carrying allele rs671 (A) are more likely to experience impairment in the regulation of arousal and sleep. The results also support the hypothesis that the accumulation of neurotoxic monoamine neurotransmitter aldehyde metabolites secondary to reduced ALDH2 enzyme activity may cause more severe monoaminergic neuronal loss and, hence, more severe symptoms in the regulation of wakefulness and sleep.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) remain elusive, but recent opinions and perspectives have focused on whether the inflammation process induced by microglia contributes to \u03b1-synuclein-mediated toxicity. Migration of microglia to the substantia nigra (SN) could precede neurodegeneration in A53T mice. We hypothesized that CXCL12 could be a mediator in the \u03b1-synuclein-induced migration of microglia.\nAfter establishing appropriate animal and cell culture models, we explored the relationship between \u03b1-synuclein and CXCL12 in A53T mice, primary microglia, and BV-2 cell lines. We also explored the mechanisms of these interactions and the signaling processes involved in neuroinflammation.\nWe confirmed the positive correlation between \u03b1-synuclein and CXCL12 in the postmortem brain tissue of PD patients and the upregulated CXCR4 expression in SN microglia of A53T mice. In addition, as expected, \u03b1-synuclein increased the production of CXCL12 in microglia via TLR4/I\u03baB-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB signaling. Importantly, CXCL12/CXCR4/FAK/Src/Rac1 signaling was shown to be involved in \u03b1-synuclein-induced microglial accumulation.\nOur study suggests that CXCL12 could be a novel target for the prevention of \u03b1-synuclein-triggered ongoing microglial responses. Blocking CXCL12/CXCR4 may be a potential therapeutic approach for PD progression.",

    "abstract": "Assessment and rating of Parkinson's Disease (PD) are commonly based on the medical observation of several clinical manifestations, including the analysis of motor activities. In particular, medical specialists refer to the MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society - sponsored revision of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) that is the most widely used clinical scale for PD rating. However, clinical scales rely on the observation of some subtle motor phenomena that are either difficult to capture with human eyes or could be misclassified. This limitation motivated several researchers to develop intelligent systems based on machine learning algorithms able to automatically recognize the PD. Nevertheless, most of the previous studies investigated the classification between healthy subjects and PD patients without considering the automatic rating of different levels of severity.\nIn this context, we implemented a simple and low-cost clinical tool that can extract postural and kinematic features with the Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor in order to classify and rate PD. Thirty participants were enrolled for the purpose of the present study: sixteen PD patients rated according to MDS-UPDRS and fourteen healthy paired subjects. In order to investigate the motor abilities of the upper and lower body, we acquired and analyzed three main motor tasks: (1) gait, (2) finger tapping, and (3) foot tapping. After preliminary feature selection, different classifiers based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were trained and evaluated for the best solution.\nConcerning the gait analysis, results showed that the ANN classifier performed the best by reaching 89.4% of accuracy with only nine features in diagnosis PD and 95.0% of accuracy with only six features in rating PD severity. Regarding the finger and foot tapping analysis, results showed that an SVM using the extracted features was able to classify healthy subjects versus PD patients with great performances by reaching 87.1% of accuracy. The results of the classification between mild and moderate PD patients indicated that the foot tapping features were the most representative ones to discriminate (81.0% of accuracy).\nThe results of this study have shown how a low-cost vision-based system can automatically detect subtle phenomena featuring the PD. Our findings suggest that the proposed tool can support medical specialists in the assessment and rating of PD patients in a real clinical scenario.",

    "abstract": "Handwriting represents one of the major symptom in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. The computer-aided analysis of the handwriting allows for the identification of promising patterns that might be useful in PD detection and rating. In this study, we propose an innovative set of features extracted by geometrical, dynamical and muscle activation signals acquired during handwriting tasks, and evaluate the contribution of such features in detecting and rating PD by means of artificial neural networks.\nEleven healthy subjects and twenty-one PD patients were enrolled in this study. Each involved subject was asked to write three different patterns on a graphic tablet while wearing the Myo Armband used to collect the muscle activation signals of the main forearm muscles. We have then extracted several features related to the written pattern, the movement of the pen and the pressure exerted with the pen and the muscle activations. The computed features have been used to classify healthy subjects versus PD patients and to discriminate mild PD patients from moderate PD patients by using an artificial neural network (ANN).\nAfter the training and evaluation of different ANN topologies, the obtained results showed that the proposed features have high relevance in PD detection and rating. In particular, we found that our approach both detect and rate (mild and moderate PD) with a classification accuracy higher than 90%.\nIn this paper we have investigated the representativeness of a set of proposed features related to handwriting tasks in PD detection and rating. In particular, we used an ANN to classify healthy subjects and PD patients (PD detection), and to classify mild and moderate PD patients (PD rating). The implemented and tested methods showed promising results proven by the high level of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Such results suggest the usability of the proposed setup in clinical settings to support the medical decision about Parkinson's Disease.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this work was to study how voice use in daily life is impacted by Parkinson's disease (PD), specifically if there is a difference in voice sound level and phonation ratio during everyday activities for individuals with PD and matched healthy controls. A further aim was to study how variations in environmental noise impact voice use. Method Long-term registration of voice use during 1 week in daily life was performed for 21 participants with PD (11 male, 10 female) and 21 matched healthy controls using the portable voice accumulator VoxLog. Voice use was assessed through registrations of spontaneous speech in different ranges of environmental noise in daily life and in a controlled studio recording setting. Results Individuals with PD use their voice 50%-60% less than their matched healthy controls in daily life. The difference increases in high levels of environmental noise. Individuals with PD used an average voice sound level in daily life that was 8.11 dB (female) and 6.7 dB (male) lower than their matched healthy controls. Difference in mean voice sound level for individuals with PD and controls during spontaneous speech during a controlled studio registration was 3.0 dB for the female group and 4.1 dB for the male group. Conclusions The observed difference in voice use in daily life between individuals with PD and matched healthy controls is a 1st step to objectively quantify the impact of PD on communicative participation. The variations in voice use in different levels of environmental noise and when comparing controlled and variable environments support the idea that the study of voice use should include methods to assess function in less controlled situations outside the clinical setting.",

The surgical procedures, clinical outcomes, costs and complications of each technique were compared in detail through literature review.\nThe surgical procedures of awake and asleep DBS surgeries rely upon different methods for verification of intended target acquisition. The existing research results demonstrated that the stereotactic targeting accuracy of lead placement obtained by either method is reliable. There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes, costs, or complications between the two techniques.\nThe surgical and clinical outcomes of asleep DBS for PD are comparable to those of awake DBS.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous cognitive disorder that is often comorbid with Parkinson's diseases (PD). The amnestic subtype of PD-MCI (PD-aMCI) has a higher risk to develop dementia. However, there is a lack of studies on the white matter (WM) structural changes of PD-aMCI. We characterized the WM structural changes of PD-aMCI (n = 17) with cognitively normal PD (PD-CN, n = 19) and normal controls (n = 20), using voxel-based and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses on fractional anisotropy (FA) axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). By excluding and then including the motor performance as a covariate in the comparison analysis between PD-aMCI and PD-CN, we attempted to discern the influences of two neuropathological mechanisms on the WM structural changes of PD-aMCI. The correlation analyses between memory and voxel-based WM measures in all PD patients were also performed (n = 36). The results showed that PD-aMCI had smaller FA values than PD-CN in the diffuse WM areas, and PD-CN had higher AD and RD values than normal controls in the right caudate. Most FA difference between PD-aMCI and PD-CN could be weakened by the motor adjustment. The FA differences between PD-aMCI and PD-CN were largely spatially overlapped with the memory-correlated FA values. Our findings demonstrated that the WM structural differences between PD-aMCI and PD-CN were mainly memory-related, and the influence of motor adjustment might indicate a common mechanism underlying both motor and memory impairment in PD-aMCI, possibly reflecting a predominant influence of dopaminergic neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease can be controlled with dopamine antagonists and agonists. In order to improve the understanding of the reaction mechanism of these drugs, in this investigation we present a quantum chemical study of 20 antagonists and 10 agonists. Electron donor acceptor capacity and global hardness are analyzed using Density Functional Theory calculations. Following this theoretical approach, we provide new insights into the intrinsic response of these chemical species. In summary, antagonists generally prove to be better electron acceptors and worse electron donors than dopamine, whereas agonists present an electron donor-acceptor capacity similar to that of dopamine. The chemical hardness is a descriptor that captures the resistance of a chemical compound to change its number of electrons. Within this model, harder molecules are less polarizable and more stable systems. Our results show that the global hardness is similar for dopamine and agonists whilst antagonists present smaller values. Following the Hard and Soft Acid and Bases principle, it is possible to conclude that dopamine and agonists are hard bases while antagonists are soft acids, and this can be related to their activity. From the electronic point of view, we have evolved a new perspective for the classification of agonist and antagonist, which may help to analyze future results of chemical interactions triggered by these drugs.",

We recently characterized and quantified a skeletal muscle pathology in PD represented by exaggerated type I myofiber grouping presumed to result from denervation-reinnervation processes. Our previous findings indicated that impaired neuromuscular junction integrity may be involved in type I grouping, which is associated with excessive motor unit activation during weight-bearing tasks. In this study, we performed transcriptional profiling to test the hypothesis that type I grouping severity would link to distinct gene expression networks.

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is one of the most important processes in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Sensory disturbances are common in patients with PD, but the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. This study aimed to characterize the activation of Schwann cells (SCs) and the increase of expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in the sural nerve of PD, and further explore whether peripheral nerve inflammation is the cause of PD sensory disturbances.\nA total of 14 patients with PD (including 5 with sensory disturbances and 9 without sensory disturbances) and 6 controls were included. The excitation and conduction function of sural nerve was detected by sural nerve electrophysiological examination. With sural nerve biopsy samples, ultrastructural changes of sural nerve were observed by electron microscopy; Schwann cell biomarker glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were detected by immunohistochemistry, and the outcome of immunostaining slice was semiquantitatively counted; double immunofluorescence was used to identify the locus immunoreactive for inflammatory cytokines.\nCompared with healthy controls, nerve conduction velocity (NCV) slowed down and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude decreased in PD patients, accompanied by axonal degeneration and demyelinating lesions, and expression of GFAP and inflammatory cytokines was increased. Inflammatory cytokines were significantly colocalized with GFAP and slightly colocalized with NF. These indicators did not differ significantly between PD patients with and without sensory disturbances.\nOur study results suggest that peripheral sensory nerve injury exists in PD patients, accompanied by Schwann cell activation and inflammation, thus demonstrate peripheral nerve inflammation participates in the pathophysiological process of PD but it is not necessarily related to the patient's sensory disturbance.",

    "abstract": "The aim was too study the correlations between blood lipid, serum cystatin C (Cys C) and homocysteine (Hcy) levels in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA total of 322 PD patients and 214 healthy subjects were selected as case and control groups, respectively. The risk factors were explored by logistic regression analysis. The case group was subtyped according to main motor symptoms and age of onset. The correlations of significantly different indices with age, duration of disease, and equivalent dose of levodopa were studied by Spearman's correlation analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted to analyze diagnostic values.\nCompared to the control group, the PD group had lower serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) levels and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Hcy, and Cys C levels (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Decreased Apo B level and increased HDL-C and Hcy levels were independent risk factors (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The Cys C level of early-onset patients was lower than of late-onset patients (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Hcy (r = 0.198, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and Cys C (r =\u20090.281, P\u2009<\u20090.05) levels were positively correlated with age. Triglyceride level was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.202, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and disease duration (r = -0.198, P\u2009<\u20090.05). Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III score was positively correlated with disease duration (r = 0.435, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and equivalent dose of levodopa (r = 0.423, P\u2009<\u20090.05). The areas under the curve for Apo B, HDL-C, and Hcy levels were 0.341, 0.588, and 0.643, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The combination of Apo B, HDL-C, and Hcy levels showed high diagnostic value, with a sensitivity of 76.4% and specificity of 69.5%.\nLow serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and Apo B, and high levels of HDL-C, Hcy, and Cys C may be correlated with PD onset and progression. Decreased Apo B level and elevated HDL-C and Hcy levels are independent risk factors. Early-onset and late-onset PD may have different progression mechanisms.",

Decreased Apo B level and increased HDL-C and Hcy levels were independent risk factors (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The Cys C level of early-onset patients was lower than of late-onset patients (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Hcy (r = 0.198, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and Cys C (r =\u20090.281, P\u2009<\u20090.05) levels were positively correlated with age. Triglyceride level was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.202, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and disease duration (r = -0.198, P\u2009<\u20090.05). Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III score was positively correlated with disease duration (r = 0.435, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and equivalent dose of levodopa (r = 0.423, P\u2009<\u20090.05). The areas under the curve for Apo B, HDL-C, and Hcy levels were 0.341, 0.588, and 0.643, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The combination of Apo B, HDL-C, and Hcy levels showed high diagnostic value, with a sensitivity of 76.4% and specificity of 69.5%.",

    "abstract": "We studied dopamine levels in three compartments of the dopaminergic synapse, including the presynaptic neuron cytosol, dopamine storage vesicles, and the synaptic gap. By considering three transport pathways (dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular transporter (VT), and exocytosis), four simulated scenarios were investigated: homeostasis, application of cocaine, methamphetamine, and reserpine. Recent experiments show that upon cocaine administration, the Drosophila melanogaster DAT permeation rate constant is decreased by 55% and we adopted this value for the human DAT. Amphetamine and methamphetamine block DAT and VT, while reserpine blocks VT; however, their decreased permeation rate constants are not available. A system of three differential equations of dopamine levels as a function of time was developed respectively for the synaptic compartments and was solved numerically. Per computational inference, the cytosol dopamine concentration was noted to increase in the case of methamphetamine and reserpine, but was practically unchanged in the case of the cocaine administration. Accordingly, our study suggests that amphetamines and other substances that block VT, but not cocaine or substances that only block DAT, may be etiologically important in the cytosolic dopamine mediation of neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease/Parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive geriatric disease, which can be one of the leading causes of serious socioeconomic burden in the aging society. Clinical trials suggest that prompt treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease (EPD) may slow down the disease progress and have a better response. Therefore, conducting proteomics study to identify biomarkers for the diagnosis and disease-modifying therapies of EPD is vital. We aimed at identifying distinct protein autoantibody biomarkers of EPD by using the database of GSE62283 based on the platform GPL13669 downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the EPD group (n = 103) and the normal control (NC) group (n = 111) were identified by protein-specific t test. Cluster analysis of DEPs was conducted by protein-protein interaction network to detect hub proteins. The hub proteins were then evaluated to determine the distinct biomarkers by principal component analysis, as well as functional and pathway enrichment analysis. Their biological functions were confirmed by gene ontology functional (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment (KEGG). Two biomarkers, mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor (MRRF) and ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18), distinguished the EPD samples from the NC samples, and they were regarded as high-confidence distinct protein autoantibody biomarkers of EPD. The most significant GO function was protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO: 0004674) and most of DEPs were enriched in ATP binding in molecular function category (GO: 0005524). These results may help in establishing the prompt and accurate diagnosis of EPD and may also contribute to develop mechanism-based treatments.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Behind the symptoms there is a complex pathological mechanism which leads to a dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Despite the strong efforts, curative treatment has not been found yet. To prevent a further cell death, numerous molecules were tested in terms of neuroprotection in preclinical (in vitro, in vivo) and in clinical studies as well. The aim of this review article is to summarize our knowledge about the extensively tested neuroprotective agents (Search period: 1991-2019). We detail the underlying pathological mechanism and summarize the most important results of the completed animal and clinical trials. Although many positive results have been reported in the literature, there is still no evidence that any of them should be used in clinical practice (Cochrane analysis was performed). Therefore, further studies are needed to better understand the pathomechanism of PD and to find the optimal neuroprotective agent(s).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and there is no cure for it at present. We have previously reported that the tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) derivative T-006 exhibited beneficial effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models. However, its effect on PD remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms of T-006 against 6-hydroxydopamine- (6-OHDA-) induced lesions in ",

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders are frequently diagnosed in Parkinson's disease and manifested in the prodromal and advanced stages of the disease. These conditions, which in some cases affect more than 50% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, include hypersomnia, often manifested as excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, characterized by delayed initiation and fragmentation of sleep at night, and disruption of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, resulting in loss of atonia and dream enactment. Standard dopamine replacement therapies for the treatment of motor symptoms are generally inadequate to combat sleep abnormalities, which seriously affect the quality of life of PD patients. Rodent models still represent a major tool for the study of many aspects of PD. They have been primarily designed to eliminate midbrain dopamine neurons and elicit motor impairment, which are the traditional pathological features of PD. However, rodent models are increasingly employed to investigate non-motor symptoms, which are often caused by degenerative processes affecting multiple monoaminergic and peptidergic structures. This review describes how neurotoxic and genetic manipulations of rats and mice have been utilized to reproduce some of the major sleep disturbances associated with PD and to what extent these abnormalities can be linked to nondopaminergic dysfunction, affecting for instance noradrenaline, serotonin, and orexin transmission. Strengths and limitations are discussed, as well as the consistency of results obtained so far, and the need for models that better reproduce the multisystemic neurodegenerative nature of PD, thereby allowing to replicate the complex etiology of sleep-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Variants associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) have generally a small effect size and, therefore, large sample sizes or targeted analyses are required to detect significant associations in a whole exome sequencing (WES) study. Here, we used protein-protein interaction (PPI) information on 36 genes with established or suggested associations with PD to target the analysis of the WES data. We performed an association analysis on WES data from 439 Finnish PD subjects and 855 controls, and included a Finnish population cohort as the replication dataset with 60 PD subjects and 8214 controls. Single variant association (SVA) test in the discovery dataset yielded 11 candidate variants in seven genes, but the associations were not significant in the replication cohort after correction for multiple testing. Polygenic risk score using variants rs2230288 and rs2291312, however, was associated to PD with odds ratio of 2.7 (95% confidence interval 1.4-5.2; p\u2009<\u20092.56e-03). Furthermore, an analysis of the PPI network revealed enriched clusters of biological processes among established and candidate genes, and these functional networks were visualized in the study. We identified novel candidate variants for PD using a gene prioritization based on PPI information, and described why these variants may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Falls are common among persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). On the other hand, predicting falls is complex as there are both generic and PD-specific contributors. In particular, the role of non-motor symptoms has been less studied.\nThe objective of this study was to identify the role of non-motor predictors of falling in persons with PD (PwP).\nA cross-sectional study was carried out in PwP recruited from a movement disorders clinic. Clinical and demographical data were collected. All PwP were assessed using the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Variables were assessed at the bivariate level. Significant variables were put into a logistic regression model.\nA total of 179 PwP were included. Overall, 16.8% of PwP had fallen in the past 12 months, with 53.3% of them being recurrent fallers. The mean number of monthly falls was 2.5 \u00b1 3.3. Factors associated with falling in the bivariate analysis included the disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr stage, MDS-UPDRS part I and II, postural instability/gait disturbance (PIGD) subtype, NMSS urinary domain, NMSS miscellaneous domain, and non-motor severity burden (all p-values < 0.05). After multivariate analysis, only the disease duration (p = 0.03) and PIGD (p = 0.03) remained as independent risk factors.\nDisease duration and the PIGD subtype were identified as relevant risk factors for falls in PwP Non-motor symptoms appear to have a less important role as risk factors for falls.",

    "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (DS) is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which can occur at any stage of the disease and decrease the quality of life of patients. The relationship between excessive daytime sleepiness and Parkinson's disease is determined by neurodegenerative process in the brain structures. However, there are many other factors, which can contribute to this phenomenon.\nTo assess the prevalence and causes of DS as well as its impact on the quality of life of patients.\nSeventy patients (mean age 65.0\u00b18.4 years) with PD, stage I-III, including 48 patients with DS and 22 without DS, were examined. All patients underwent clinical/neurological and neuropsychological examinations using a set of scales and polysomnography, if necessary.\nSleep disorders are the most frequent non-motor symptoms of PD. The prevalence of subjective DS is determined for the first time. The disassociation between subjective and objective DS is observed in 32,5% of patients. Clinical combinations of DS with other sleep disorders are described. Taking dopaminergic medication contributes significantly to the development of DS and affective disorders (anxiety, depression) play a role in subjective DS.\n\u0412\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0414\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043e\u043d\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c (\u0414\u0421) \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f), \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a \u0441\u043d\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445. \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0437\u044c \u0414\u0421 \u0438 \u0411\u041f \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0430. \u0422\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u044f\u0434 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044e \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438. \u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u041e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u044b \u0414\u0421, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0435\u0435 \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0411\u041f. \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u044b. \u041e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 70 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 (\u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 65,0\u00b18,4 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430) \u0441 I-III \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0434\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0411\u041f: 48 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0414\u0421, 22 -

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease of the elderly caused by the neurodegenerative process in different parts of the brain, which resulted in motor and non-motor symptoms. Investigation of non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease is increasingly rising for the last years. Social cognition is a special type of cognitive process, which provides people interaction in the society and their impairment also can be observed in Parkinson's disease. Social cognitive functions include many aspects: the theory of the mind, morality, personality changes and behavioral disorders. Each of these aspects is based on different neurophysiological, neurochemical and neuroanatomical substrates. This article is an effort to get closer to understanding of the changes, which occur in the brain of a patient with Parkinson's disease.\n\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f) - \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430, \u0432 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0430, \u0432\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u043a \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c. \u0412 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u0411\u041f - \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0439, \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0437\u0430\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0438 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0430\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432: \u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043c\u0430, \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u041a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u0430\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435, \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0445\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044b. \u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0438 - \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043a \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0411\u041f \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b.",

    "abstract": "Speech disorders are widely spread in patients with Parkinson's disease, and these symptoms are only getting worse as the disease progresses. Nevertheless, only a few percent of the population have an access to an adequate and qualified care. This review describes the pathophysiology of parkinsonian speech disorders, methods of diagnostics and monitoring and treatment modalities, which include pharmacotherapy, speech therapy and surgical approaches. The authors believe that treatment of parkinsonism-related speech disorder is an integral part of a multidisciplinary patient care.\n\u0420\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0448\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c\u044e \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430, \u0430 \u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0412 \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u044b \u0434\u0438\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0430 \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044b \u043a \u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e, \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0444\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u044f, \u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0445\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u044b. \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0442\u044a\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0441\u0446\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043a \u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e.",

    "abstract": "To determine the relationship between alterations in resting state functional connectivity and social cognition dysfunction among patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and healthy controls (HC).\nFifty-seven participants (FTD = 10, AD = 18, PD = 19, and HC = 10) underwent structural and functional imaging and completed the Awareness of Social Inference Test-Emotion Evaluation Test (TASIT-EET), Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) scale, Revised Self-Monitoring Scale (RSMS), Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ). A multi-variate pattern analysis (MVPA) was carried out to determine activation differences between the groups. The clusters from the MVPA were used as seeds for the ROI-to-voxel analysis. Relationship between social cognition deficits and uncinate integrity was also investigated.\nBOLD signal activation differed among the four groups of AD, PD, FTD, and HC in the left inferior temporal gyrus-anterior division [L-ITG (ant)], right central opercular cortex (R-COp), right supramarginal gyrus, posterior division (R-SMG, post), right angular gyrus (R-AG), and R-ITG. The BOLD co-activation of the L-ITG (ant) with bilateral frontal pole (FP) and paracingulate gyrus was positively associated with IRI-perspective taking (PT) (\nPatients with neurodegenerative diseases showed alterations in connectivity in brain regions important for social cognition compared with HCs. Functional connectivity correlated with performance on social cognition tasks and alterations could be responsible for some of the social cognition deficits observed in all neurodegenerative diseases.",

Seventy-two PD cases [59 patients suffering from PD for >1 year (OPD) and 13 new PD (NPD) patients] were studied. Microflora communities in the feces of the patients and corresponding healthy controls (HCs) were examined using high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The gut microflora of OPD patients contained high levels of Rikenellaceae compared to corresponding HCs. In addition, significantly higher levels of Turicibacteraceae were found in the NPD group compared to the corresponding HCs. The genera ",

A computerized search identified relevant articles using a priori defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A descriptive analysis was calculated for the main outcome parameters body mass and BMI. Thirty-eight out of 206 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria (979 patients aged 59.0\u00b17.5 years). Considering the longest follow-up time for each study, body mass and BMI showed a mean increase across studies of +5.71kg (p < .0001; d = 0.64) and +1.8kg/m",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. In most cases, the development of the disease is sporadic and is not associated with any currently known mutations associated with PD. It is believed that changes associated with the epigenetic regulation of gene expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The study of individuals with an almost identical genetic background, such as monozygotic twins, is one of the best approaches to the analysis of such changes. A whole-transcriptome analysis of dermal fibroblasts obtained from three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PD was carried out in this work. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes were identified in the three pairs of twins. These genes were included in seven processes within two clusters, according to the results of an enrichment analysis. The cluster with the greatest statistical significance included processes associated with the regulation of the differentiation of fat cells, the action potential, and the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The most significant genes, which occupied a central position in this cluster, were PTGS2, SCN9A, and GRIK2. These genes can be considered as potential candidate genes for PD.",

    "abstract": "Different animal and human studies from last two decades in the case of Parkinson's disease (PD) have concentrated on oxidative stress due to increased inflammation and cytokine-dependent neurotoxicity leading to induction of dopaminergic (DA) degeneration pathway in the nigrostriatal region. Chronic inflammation, the principle hallmark of PD, forms the basis of neurodegeneration. Aging in association with activation of glia due to neuronal injury, perhaps because of immune alterations and genetic predispositions, leads to deregulation of inflammatory pathways premising the onset of PD. A family of inducible transcription factors, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), is found to show expression in various cells and tissues, such as microglia, neurons, and astrocytes which play an important role in activation and regulation of inflammatory intermediates during inflammation. Both canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways are involved in the regulation of the stimulated cells. During the prodromal/asymptomatic stage of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., PD and AD), chronic neuroinflammation may act silently as the driver of neuronal dysfunction. Though research has provided an insight over age-related neurodegeneration in PD, elaborative role of NF-\u03baB in neuroinflammation is yet to be completely understood and thus requires more investigation. Polyphenols, a group of naturally occurring compound in medicinal plants, have gained attention because of their anti-oxidative and anti-neuroinflammatory properties in neurodegenerative diseases. In this aspect, this review highlights the role of NF-\u03baB and the possible therapeutic roles of polyphenols in NF-\u03baB-mediated neuroinflammation in PD.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the therapeutic effects of non-pharmacological interventions (cognitive training, physical activity, and non-invasive brain stimulation) on cognitive symptoms in Parkinson's disease. A comprehensive literature search for non-pharmacological intervention randomized controlled trials was performed and effect sizes were calculated for each suitable study intervention approach and cognitive domain. Despite the heterogeneity of the study results, we report level B evidence for the probable efficacy of cognitive training in improving or maintaining attention/working memory and memory domains. Level C (possible efficacy) evidence was found for specific physical training types with respect to enhancing executive functions. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and combinatorial approaches show preliminary but promising results. Prediction markers evaluating distinct treatment responses should be identified that would help to choose the best candidates for specific treatment strategies and cognitive symptoms. Future directions and recommendations are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study in Parkinson's disease examined how spatiotemporal parameters in gait bradykinesia link to difficulty in terminating posture and initiating gait locomotion. 41 idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients and 15 age-matched healthy subjects participated in this study. After the patients fixated on a visual-fixation-target, gait was triggered by visual or vocal cue-stimulus. The LED instructed subjects to quickly achieve their own comfortable walking speed on a level floor. The posterior-anterior force of the y-axis vectors of sole relating to soleus and tibialis-anterior EMGs were examined. Step-gain was defined as the duration of the swing-phase relative that of the contralateral stance-phase. Dynamic-ratio was defined as the duration the fore-foot phase relative to that of the ipsilateral stance-phase as forward-oriented movement in each step. The pause in tonic soleus EMG was defined as the off-latency of posture (termination) and the onset of a tibialis-anterior EMG-burst as the on-latency of gait. In Parkinson's disease, soleus off-latencies were prolonged, whereas tibialis-anterior on-latencies were less prolonged. Unsynchronized off/on-latency differences correlated with spatiotemporal parameters of dynamic-ratios, step-gains, gait-initiation, and gait speed in gait bradykinesia. Delayed EMG off-latencies correlated with prolonged motor-latencies in gait bradykinesia as delayed initial backward body-shift. A delayed and deficient initial backward body-shift of y-axis vector was linked to each difficulty in terminating posture and initiating gait, changing to random gait akinesia. Gait bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease stemmed from unsynchronized off/on-latency EMG activities, linking to each difficulty in terminating posture and initiating gait synergic movement through an initial backward body-shift.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is commonly observed in Parkinson's disease (PD), even in the early stages. However, the neural substrates of cognitive impairment in PD remain unclear. The aim of the current study was to investigate the change of local brain function in PD patients with MCI.\nFifty patients with PD, including 25 PD patients with MCI (PD-MCI) and 25 PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC), and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 3D structural images, and resting state-functional MRI (rs-fMRI) were performed in all subjects. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was measured based on the rs-fMRI images to investigate the altered local brain functions.\nBrain regions with decreased ReHo were located in the left posterior cerebellar lobe in PD sub-groups compared to the HC group, and the brain regions with increased ReHo were located in the limbic lobe (right precuneus/bilateral middle cingulate cortex) in PD-MCI compared with HC group. PD-MCI presented with increased ReHo in the bilateral precuneus/left superior parietal lobe and decreased ReHo in the left insula compared to PD-NC. ReHo values for the left precuneus were negatively related to neuropsychological scores, and ReHo values for the left insula were positively related to neuropsychological scores in PD subjects.\nThe present study demonstrated abnormal spontaneous synchrony in the left insula and left precuneus in patients with PD-MCI compared to PD-NC, which might provide a novel insight into the diagnosis and clinical treatment of cognitive impairment in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) have an increased risk of developing dementia (PDD). As activities of daily living (ADL) impairment is mandatory for the diagnosis of PDD, assessing early signs of instrumental ADL (iADL) dysfunction, especially in PD-MCI, is essential. In PD, self- and caregiver-reported iADL performance is often confounded by motor dysfunction and mood. Objective and time-efficient performance-based measurements are needed to screen for cognitive-related iADL dysfunction. We evaluated the Erlangen Test of Activities of Daily Living in Mild Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (ETAM) in PD and determined its value for characterizing a subgroup of PD-MCI patients with mild performance-based iADL impairment.\nTwenty-one cognitively normal PD patients (PD-NC), 24 PD-MCI patients, and 18 healthy controls (HC) were analyzed. Assessments included the ETAM, a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, iADL, mood, and motor measurements.\nPD-MCI patients scored significantly lower on the ETAM total score compared to PD-NC patients (p = .002), whereas HC and PD-NC patients did not statistically differ. No HC scored lower than 27 points (diagnostic cutoff for mild iADL impairment); only PD-MCI patients scored below this cutoff (29.2%) suggesting the ETAM is able to characterize a PD-MCI subgroup with early iADL impairment. PD-MCI patients below the cutoff were more impaired in the attention domain (p = .04).\nThe ETAM is a potentially valuable clinical assessment, able to detect first signs of iADL dysfunction in PD-MCI. Further studies in larger cohorts are needed to evaluate the prognostic ability for predicting PDD.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit impaired semantic and socioemotional processes, which are thought to be related to dysfunctions in the fronto-striatal circuit. However, little is known about how the memory enhancement by these processes was reduced in PD. The present study investigated this issue.\nThe retrieval performance of face memories encoded by semantic and socioemotional processes was compared between 24 PD patients and 24 age-matched healthy controls (HC). During encoding, participants were presented with unfamiliar faces and made judgment about them in three encoding conditions of semantic judgment (Semantics), attractiveness judgment (Attractiveness), and form judgment (Form). In Semantics, participants rated to what degree each face looked like an office worker, whereas in Attractiveness, participants rated how attractive each face was. The Form condition as a control required participants to judge the shape of each face. During retrieval after encoding, participants made old or new judgment for target and distracter faces.\nIn HC, the retrieval of faces encoded by Semantics and Attractiveness was significantly more accurate than that encoded by Form, whereas this memory enhancement was not identified in PD. In addition, individual scores in frontal lobe function and long-term memory correlated with the retrieval performance of memories encoded in Semantics and Attractiveness but not Form.\nThese findings suggest that the processing of semantic and socioemotional signals conveyed from faces could be impaired in PD and that the impairment of these processes could decrease the enhancement of face memories by semantic and socioemotional elaborations.",

    "abstract": "As Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses, the number/frequency of PD medications tend to increase, which is correlated with decreased patient compliance and suboptimal control of PD symptoms. We investigated efficacy and safety of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) daytime monotherapy (with or without nighttime oral levodopa-carbidopa) compared with polytherapy (LCIG with \u22651 adjunctive PD therapy) in advanced PD patients.\nThis post hoc descriptive study compared LCIG stable daytime monotherapy with LCIG stable polytherapy in all six phase 3/3b open-label studies from both US and international sites; because of study design variability, pooling data for comparison was not appropriate. Efficacy assessments included PD diary data (mean change from baseline in \"Off\" time and \"On\" time with or without troublesome dyskinesia), mean Unified PD Rating Scale scores (Parts II and III), and 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) summary index. Adverse events were also assessed.\nOverall, LCIG daytime monotherapy and polytherapy demonstrated similar efficacy/safety profiles in advanced PD patients, regardless of treatment duration or population. LCIG monotherapy vs. polytherapy groups experienced similar mean decreases in \"Off\" time (4.6 vs. 4.1\u202fh/day) and similar increases in \"On\" time without troublesome dyskinesia (4.6 vs. 4.1\u202fh/day). In most studies, PDQ-39 summary index scores were reduced from baseline by \u22655 points, regardless of patient population or study duration. Adverse events not related to the procedure/device were similar in both groups.\nOur data suggest that, for appropriate patients, LCIG monotherapy can provide a more simplified treatment option with similar efficacy and safety.",

    "abstract": "An early clinical differentiation between Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the combination use of midbrain-to-pontine ratio (M/P ratio) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with cardiac \nNinety-six parkinsonian patients (70 PD, aged 68.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.5\u202fyears; 16 MSA, aged 67.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.5\u202fyears; 10 PSP, aged 70.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.4\u202fyears) who underwent MRI and cardiac MIBG scintigraphy were included in this study. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing PD from MSA and PSP patients. The diagnostic accuracy of these tests was also assessed among patients at the early disease stage (defined as patients with a disease duration of 3\u202fyears or less).\nThe individual diagnostic sensitivity of the M/P ratio and cardiac MIBG scintigraphy was 87.1% and 67.1% in PD vs. MSA and 78.6% and 67.1% in PD vs. PSP, respectively. The diagnostic specificity of the M/P ratio and cardiac MIBG scintigraphy was 56.3% and 100% in PD vs. MSA and 70.0% and 90% in PD vs. PSP, respectively.

    "abstract": "to update understanding of the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease, since the last review was published in 2016.\nin order to identify suitable publications for inclusion, an online search of the Pubmed, Scopus and Cochrane databases was carried out. Searches of relevant full-text articles were performed through specific keywords. The final database check was performed in July 2019. Papers were restricted to studies investigating motor rehabilitative effects of tDCS in adult patients with Parkinson's disease. Studies involving either single or repeated tDCS sessions with a sham or controlled trial type design (which incorporated outcomes on motor performance measures) were considered. As studies varied widely in terms of methodology, a qualitative analysis of the selected studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale or the Delphi list (depending on the study design).\ntwenty-nine studies were retained in this systematic review. Of the studies included, fifteen involved single tDCS session (patients = 256) and fourteen involved repeated tDCS sessions (patients = 294). Eight investigations of single tDCS and ten investigations of repeated tDCS demonstrated significant results. Studies involving multi- target stimulation demonstrated significant improvements on mobility (p=0.006), balance (by 50.9%), gait velocity (by 29%), fall reduction (p0.05) compared to mono-target stimulations.\ndespite increasing evidence that tDCS may improve motor symptoms, the results showed that fully optimized tDCS protocols are not yet established.",

    "abstract": "To explore the use of applied cognitive strategy behaviours during performance of daily activities in people with Parkinson's disease.\nQuantitative cross-sectional design.\nA total of 190 persons living at home with non-dementing Parkinson's disease were videotaped while performing a self-chosen activity in their natural environment. The videotaped performance was scored using the \"Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform System of Task Analysis\" to measure: (i) performance mastery; and (ii) effective use of 34 cognitive strategy behaviours covering: attention and sensory processing (Perceive), accessing task-related knowledge (Recall), response planning and evaluation (Plan) and performance control (Perform). Mean performance mastery and a hierarchy of least to most effective applied cognitive strategy behaviours were determined for the total group and for 2 sub-groups based on disease severity. A multi-faceted Rasch model was used for data analysis.\nMean performance mastery was 56% (standard deviation (SD) 28). Least efficient cognitive strategy behaviours were those used for planning, evaluating and controlling performance and most efficient strategies were those used for sensory discrimination and recalling factual information. More advanced disease indicated less efficient use of applied cognition.\nThe results suggest that the efficiency of applied cognitive strategy behaviours is compromised in a certain pattern in people with Parkinson's disease, and that it declines with disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative pathology resulting from the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) and their receptors are key regulators of the survival, differentiation, and development of neurons. However, the role of these factors in the pathogenesis of PD is still unclear. Here, we analyzed the expression of NTFs and their receptors in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from the fibroblasts of patients with PD and healthy donors (HDs). Four PD-derived iPSC lines with different mutations and three cell lines from HDs at different stages of neuronal differentiation were used for RT-qPCR analysis and ELISA. We found that the mRNA levels of most analyzed genes were altered in PD-derived cells compared with those in HD-derived cells at all stages. Importantly, irrespective of PD-associated mutations, the mRNA levels of the BDNF and GDNF genes were mostly increased or unchanged in predominantly DA terminally differentiated neurons (TDNs) compared with those in HD-derived cells. Strikingly, in contrast to BDNF and GDNF mRNA levels, BDNF and GDNF protein levels were lower in almost all PD-derived TDNs than in HD-derived cells, thus indicating the dysregulation of NTF expression at the post-transcriptional level. We suggest that this dysregulation is one of the important signs of PD development.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in diagnostic techniques in cardiology, electrocardiography (ECG) has yet remained the first and corner stone of detecting emergency cardiac events including myocardial infarction (MI). There are some ECG findings which are considered as equivalents to MI. De Winter ST-T wave pattern is one of the important ECG findings which is thought to be related to left anterior descending artery occlusion. However, the coexistence of this ECG pattern with other ECG abnormalities are not reported widely. In this report, we discussed a unique case of de Winter ST-T wave pattern in a patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome for the first time.\nA 43-year-old man was referred because of an intermittent typical chest pain. The patient had no cardiovascular risk factor, and was not on any medication; laboratory tests showed elevated and raising troponin I. The first ECG showed pre-excitation (WPW) as well as de winter pattern. According to patient's symptoms and suggestive ECG for probable left anterior descending (LAD) occlusion, emergent angiography was scheduled. The coronary angiography revealed sever LAD artery occlusion. The patient was symptom free after successful percutaneous coronary intervention, and was discharged on medication. The patient remained asymptomatic in 1-year follow-up period.\nPresence of de Winter ST-T changes with other ECG abnormalities is a rare issue, and here we addressed the first case of WPW and de Winter. The physicians should be aware that ECG changes in patients with WPW should not be interpreted as de Winter ST-T changes and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "Many patients with Parkinson's disease have potentially disabling off episodes that are not predictably responsive to levodopa. In this study, we assessed the safety and efficacy of apomorphine sublingual film as an on-demand therapy for off episodes in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nThis randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was done by movement disorder specialists at 32 sites in the USA and one in Canada. Patients with Parkinson's disease who had 2 h or more of off time per day with predictable morning off periods, were responsive to levodopa, and were on stable doses of anti-parkinsonian medication were eligible. In an open-label titration phase, increasing doses of apomorphine sublingual film (10-35 mg) were administered until a tolerable full on response was achieved. Patients were then randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive web-response system to receive the effective dose of apomorphine sublingual film or matching placebo in a 12-week, double-blind maintenance phase. Randomisation was not stratified, and the block size was four. All patients and study personnel were masked to treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was the in-clinic change from predose to 30 min post-dose in the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part 3 (motor) score at week 12, analysed on a modified intention-to-treat population by use of a mixed-effect model for repeated measures. Safety analyses were done on all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02469090.\nBetween June 18, 2015, and Dec 11, 2017, 109 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive apomorphine sublingual film (n=54) or placebo (n=55). All patients received the assigned study treatment, and 34 (63%) of 54 patients receiving apomorphine sublingual film and 46 (84%) of 55 receiving placebo completed the study. Least squares mean (SE) change from predose to 30 min post-dose in MDS-UPDRS part 3 score at week 12 was -11\u00b71 (SE 1\u00b746, 95% CI -14\u00b70 to -8\u00b72) with apomorphine sublingual film and -3\u00b75 (1\u00b729, -6\u00b71 to -0\u00b79) with placebo (difference -7\u00b76, SE 1\u00b796, 95% CI -11\u00b75 to -3\u00b77; p=0\u00b70002). Mild-to-moderate oropharyngeal events were the most common side-effect, reported in 17 (31%) of 54 patients receiving apomorphine sublingual film and in four (7%) of 55 patients receiving placebo, leading to treatment discontinuation in nine (17%) patients treated with apomorphine and in one (2%) patient treated with placebo. Other treatment-emergent adverse events were transient nausea (in 15 [28%] patients receiving apomorphine sublingual film), somnolence (seven [13%]), and dizziness (five [9%]). Orthostatic hypotension, syncope, dyskinesia, hallucinations, prolongation of the QT interval, and impulse control disorders were infrequent (prevalence \u22642% of all patients) or did not occur. One patient treated with apomorphine sublingual film (with known cardiac risk factors) had a fatal cardiac arrest.\nAlthough nearly a third of patients discontinued treatment primarily because of oropharyngeal side-effects, apomorphine sublingual film provided an efficacious, on-demand treatment for off episodes for most patients with Parkinson's disease in this trial. The long-term safety and efficacy of apomorphine sublingual film are currently being investigated.\nCynapsus Therapeutics and Sunovion.",

    "abstract": "Several genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses on Parkinson's disease (PD)-related genes have identified several risk foci in Ras-related genes, particularly among Caucasian individuals. However, the corresponding results have been controversial among Asian individuals. We investigated whether 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of Ras-related genes, RIT2 (rs12456492) and RAB7L1 (rs823118), are associated with PD risk in Taiwanese individuals. In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis of all studies related to rs12456492 in Asian populations to resolve inconsistency in this locus. In total, 1103 Taiwanese individuals (588 patients with PD and 515 controls) and 1111 Taiwanese individuals (594 patients with PD and 517 controls) were genotyped for rs12456492 and rs823118. However, we could not confirm the association of rs12456492 and rs823118 with PD. Our current meta-analysis involving the rs12456492(A/G) variant demonstrated that the GG\u00a0+ GA genotypes, GG genotypes, and G allele may be risk factors for PD. RIT2 may increase PD risk in Asian individuals. The discrepancies between Caucasian and Asian populations may be due to differences in geographic region-specific genetic backgrounds and gene-environmental interactions.",

    "abstract": "Previous genome-wide association studies in Caucasians suggest genetic loci of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR region may be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these gene-disease associations were limitedly reported in Asian populations. Herein, we investigated the effects of 5 top PD-associated genetic variants within HLA-DR region in Caucasians, including rs4248166, rs9268515, rs2395163, rs75855844, and rs660895, by genotyping 486 Taiwanese patients with PD and 473 age-matched control subjects. Although the association between rs2395163 C allele and patients with PD demonstrated marginal significance (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0= 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99, p\u00a0= 0.045). The frequency of rs2395163 C allele (8.65%) in male patients with PD was significantly lower than in male control subjects (14.02%; OR\u00a0= 0.58, 95% CI: 0.39-0.88, p\u00a0= 0.009). The genetic associations between patients with PD and other tested genetic variants were negative. Although strong linkage disequilibrium (rs4248166-rs9626515-s2395163 and rs9626515-rs660895) were observed, the haplotype analysis did not find any significant risk-associated allelic combinations.

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Parkinson's diseases (PD) is challenging; applying machine learning (ML) models to gait characteristics may support the classification process. Comparing performance of ML models used in various studies can be problematic due to different walking protocols and gait assessment systems. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of walking protocols and gait assessment systems on the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) for classification of PD. 93 PD and 103 controls performed two walking protocols at their normal pace: (i) four times along a 10 m walkway (intermittent walk-IW), (ii) walking for 2 minutes on a 25 m oval circuit (continuous walk-CW). 14 gait characteristics were extracted from two different systems (an instrumented walkway-GAITRite; and an accelerometer attached at the lower back-Axivity). SVM and RF were trained on normalized data (accounting for step velocity, gender, age and BMI) and evaluated using 10-fold cross validation with area under the curve (AUC). Overall performance was higher for both systems during CW compared to IW. SVM performed better than RF. With SVM, during CW Axivity significantly outperformed GAITRite (AUC: 87.83 \u00b1 7.81% vs. 80.49 \u00b1 9.85%); during IW systems performed similarly. These findings suggest that choice of testing protocol and sensing system may have a direct impact on ML PD classification results and highlight the need for standardization for wide scale implementation.",

    "abstract": "Independence in activities of daily living (ADL) is one of the most important aspects in planning treatment for people with Parkinson disease (PD). The Barthel Index (BI) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) are commonly used in neurological diseases.\nThis study was conducted to confirm the validity and reliability of the BI and mRS in PD during ON and OFF medication phases.\nWe included 260 individuals with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD. The disability in ADL was measured by the BI, mRS, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-Activities of Daily Living (UPDRS-ADL), and Schwab and England ADL scale (SE). Test-retest, inter-rater reliability, and internal consistency were assessed by the intra-class correlation (ICC) and Cronbach \u03b1 coefficients. Dimensionality was evaluated by factor analysis. Convergent validity was assessed by the SE, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), PDQ-39 and UPDRS-ADL.\nFor the 260 participants (187 [71.9%] males; mean [SD] age 60.3 [12.3] years), both the BI and mRS achieved an acceptable level of test-retest and inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.77 to 0.91) in ON and OFF medication phases. The Cronbach \u03b1 for BI was 0.85 and 0.88, respectively. We found 1 and 2 factors for BI in ON and OFF phases, respectively. Investigation of convergent validity showed moderate to high correlation for the BI with the UPDRS-ADL, SE, PDQ-39 (ADL), BBS and mRS scores in ON and OFF phases (\u03c1=0.51-0.74) and mRS with SE, UPDRS-ADL, PDQ-39 (ADL) and BBS scores (\u03c1=0.48-0.82).\nThe BI and mRS showed acceptable validity and reliability to measure the degree of disability in patients with PD in daily activities in both ON and OFF medication phases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. PD patients suffer from gastrointestinal dysfunctions and alterations of the autonomous nervous system, especially its part in the gut wall, i.e., the enteric nervous system (ENS). Such alterations and functional gastrointestinal deficits often occur years before the classical clinical symptoms of PD appear. Until now, only little is known about PD-associated changes in gut microbiota composition and their potential implication in PD development. In order to increase knowledge in this field, fecal samples of 34 PD patients and 25 healthy, age-matched control persons were investigated. Here, the V4 and V5 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was PCR-amplified and sequenced using an Ion Torrent PGM platform. Within the PD group, we observed a relative decrease in bacterial taxa which are linked to health-promoting, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective or other beneficial effects on the epithelial barrier, such as ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common movement disorder for which diagnosis mainly depends on the medical history and clinical symptoms. Exosomes are now considered an additional mechanism for intercellular communication, allowing cells to exchange proteins, lipids, and genetic material. Long noncoding (lnc) RNA in exosomes plays a critical role in many diseases, including neurodegenerative disease.\nTo study expression differences for lncRNAs in peripheral blood exosomes of PD patients compared with healthy individuals and to look for lncRNAs that might be related to the pathogenesis of PD.\nWe recruited PD patients along with age- and sex-matched healthy individuals as healthy controls and evaluated levels of lncRNAs extracted from exosomes in plasma samples via next-generation sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR. Correlation analysis was conducted for the clinical characteristics of PD patients and the expression of selected lncRNAs.\nWe found 15 upregulated and 24 downregulated exosomal lncRNAs in the PD group. According to bioinformatics analyses, we chose lnc-MKRN2-42:1 for further study. Interestingly, lnc-MKRN2-42:1 was positively correlated with the MDS-UPDRS III score for PD patients.\nOur study suggested that lnc-MKRN2-42:1 may be involved in the occurrence and development of PD.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) neurosurgery is a new option for medication-resistant Parkinson's disease (PD), but its safety and efficacy remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of MRgFUS for PD by systematically reviewing related literature. PubMed and EMBASE were searched to identify related studies. Inclusion criteria were (1) reported the efficacy or safety of MRgFUS for PD and (2) published in English. Exclusion criteria were (1) nonhuman study, (2) review or meta-analysis or other literature types without original data, and (3) conference abstract without full text. Data on study characteristics, treatment parameters, efficacy, and adverse events were collected. Descriptive synthesis of data was performed. Eleven studies containing 80 patients were included. Nine studies were observational studies with no controls. Two studies included a randomized and controlled phase. Most studies included tremor-dominant PD. Ten studies reported decline of UPDRS-III scores after MRgFUS, and five reported a statistically significant decline. Nine studies evaluated the quality of life (QOL). Significant improvement of QOL was reported by four studies using the 39-item Parkinson's disease questionnaire. Four studies investigated the impact of MRgFUS on non-motor symptoms. Most tests indicated that MRgFUS had no significant effect on neuropsychological outcomes. Most adverse events were mild and transient. MRgFUS is a potential treatment for PD with satisfying efficacy and safety. Studies in this field are still limited. More studies with strict design, larger sample size, and longer follow-up are needed to further investigate its efficacy and safety for PD.",

    "abstract": "Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is efficacious in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, this treatment is often not well tolerated in this disabled population. We explored, in a pilot study, the efficacy, observance, and usability of mandibular advancement device (MAD) for the treatment of OSAS in this peculiar population.\nTwenty patients with PD and moderate or severe OSAS were included in the study. Ten patients had refused or not tolerated the validated treatment with CPAP so that they were treated with MAD. The patients treated with MAD were matched for sex, age and body mass index (BMI) to 10 patients with PD treated with CPAP. We explored the efficacy of MAD on sleep disorders complaints (PDSS-2) and on sleep recordings. We compared adherence, tolerance and usability with MAD and with CPAP.\nMAD improved sleep complaints increasing PDSS-2 scores (85 [55-106] vs 106 [88-126], p\u00a0<\u00a00.005), and sleep respiratory measures reducing apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) (50.8 [30.0-76.4] vs 9.4 [5.0-45.2], <0.001) and oxygen desaturation index (22.9 [2.1-92.0] vs 3.8 [0.2-34.2], p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Observance was higher with MAD than with CPAP. Usability and caregiver satisfaction were higher with MAD than with CPAP whereas side effects were similarly reported.\nMandibular advancement device may be an noteworthy alternative treatment of OSAS in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis is attributed to multiple pathways involved in the neurodegeneration process. Among these pathways arise the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis, where inhibition of this cascade has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Crocin, a carotenoid found in saffron, has shown beneficial effects against neurodegenerative diseases via anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. However, the exact molecular pathways involved in crocin's neuroprotective effects have not been fully elucidated. This drove our attention to unravel the possible involvement of PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway in the neuroprotective effect of crocin against rotenone (ROT)-induced PD in rats. Sixty adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, crocin (30\u00a0mg/kg/day; i.p.), ROT (1.5\u00a0mg/kg/day, i.p.) and ROT pre-treated with crocin for 30 days. Crocin administration showed a substantial behavioral improvement. At the cellular level, crocin significantly stimulated the PI3K/Akt pathway, augmented phospho-proline-rich Akt substrate 40\u00a0kDa (p-PRAS40), mTOR and p-p70S6K levels. Consequently, glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), forkhead box transcription factor of the O class (FoxO3a), and the downstream caspase-9 were decreased; thus, attenuating neurodegeneration, which was witnessed through increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine (DA), and hampered \u03b1-synuclein levels. Moreover, crocin showed enhanced expression of microRNA-7 (miRNA-7) and miRNA-221, which contributed to Akt/mTOR activation. These results were verified by improved histopathological portrait and increased number of intact neurons. In conclusion, crocin showed promising neuroprotective effects in ROT-induced PD via activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis and enhanced miRNA-7 and miRNA-221.",

    "abstract": "Bi-allelic mutations in the gene for glucocerebrosidase (GBA) cause Gaucher disease, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. Gaucher disease causing GBA mutations in the heterozygous state are also high risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). GBA analysis is challenging due to a related pseudogene and structural variations (SVs) that can occur at this locus. We have applied and refined a recently developed nanopore DNA sequencing method to analyze GBA variants in a clinically assessed New Zealand longitudinal cohort of PD.\nWe examined amplicons encompassing the coding region of GBA (8.9\u00a0kb) from 229 PD cases and 50 healthy controls using the GridION nanopore sequencing platform, and Sanger validation.\nWe detected 23 variants in 21 PD cases (9.2% of patients). We detected modest PD risk variant p.N409S (rs76763715) in one case, p.E365K (rs2230288) in 12 cases, and p.T408\u00a0M (rs75548401) in seven cases, one of whom also had p.E365K. We additionally detected the possible risk variants p.R78C (rs146774384) in one case, p.D179H (rs147138516) in one case which occurred on the same haplotype as p.E365K, and one novel variant c.335C\u00a0>\u00a0T or p.(L335\u00a0=\u00a0), that potentially impacts splicing of GBA transcripts. Additionally, we found a higher prevalence of dementia among patients with GBA variants.\nThis work confirmed the utility of nanopore sequencing as a high-throughput method to identify known and novel GBA variants, and to assign precise haplotypes. Our observations may contribute to improved understanding of the effects of variants on disease pathogenesis, and to the development of more targeted treatments.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a 200 year-long research history. Our understanding about its clinical phenotype and pathogenesis remains limited, although dopaminergic replacement therapy has significantly improved patient outcomes. Autonomic dysfunction is an essential category of non-motor phenotypes that has recently become a cutting edge field that directs frontier research in PD. In this review, we initially describe the epidemiology of dysautonomic symptoms in PD. Then, we perform a meticulous analysis of the pathophysiology of autonomic dysfunction in PD and propose that the peripheral autonomic nervous system may be a key route for \u03b1-synuclein pathology propagation from the periphery to the central nervous system. In addition, we recommend that constipation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, and pure autonomic failure should be viewed as prodromal dysautonomic markers in PD prediction and diagnosis. Finally, we summarize the strategies currently available for the treatment of autonomic dysfunction in PD and suggest that high-quality, better-designed, randomized clinical trials should be conducted in the future.",

Recent studies have revealed the involvement of several regions along the visual information-processing system that contribute to the pathophysiological mechanism of VHs: the eyes and retina, retinofugal projection, lateral geniculate nucleus, striate cortex, ventral pathways in the temporal cortices, and frontal and parietal cortices. In addition, the concurrent involvement of other systems in the brainstem and basal forebrain further modify VHs in PD. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiological association between the regional involvement of these areas and VHs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is managed primarily by dopamine agonists and physiotherapy while virtual reality (VR) has emerged recently as a complementary method. The present study reviewed the effectiveness of VR in rehabilitation of patients with PD.\nLiterature search up to June 2019 identified ten studies (n = 343 participants) suitable for meta-analysis and 27 studies (n = 688 participants) for systematic review. Standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model.\nIn meta-analysis, compared with active rehabilitation intervention, VR training led to greater improvement of stride length, SMD = 0.70 (95%CI = 0.32-1.08, p = 0.0003), and was as effective for gait speed, balance and co-ordination, cognitive function and mental health, quality of life and activities of daily living. Compared with passive rehabilitation intervention, VR had greater effects on balance: SMD = 1.02 (95%CI = 0.38-1.65, p = 0.002). Results from single randomised controlled trials showed that VR training was better than passive rehabilitation intervention for improving gait speed SMD = 1.43 (95%CI = 0.51-2.34, p = 0.002), stride length SMD = 1.27 (95%CI = 0.38-2.16, p = 0.005) and activities of daily living SMD = 0.96 (95%CI = 0.02-1.89). Systematic review showed that VR training significantly (p < 0.05) improved motor function, balance and co-ordination, cognitive function and mental health, and quality of life and activities of daily living.\nVR used in rehabilitation for patients with PD improves a number of outcomes and may be considered for routine use in rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Clock drawing test (CDT) is a screening tool used in neuropsychological assessment for evaluating comprehensively multiple cognitive functions. Aberrant performance at CDT was observed in Parkinson's disease, due to impaired executive functioning as well as visuospatial difficulties. However, previous studies suffered from different limitations, such as reduced sample size as well as no comparison with healthy individuals. This retrospective study aimed to verify CDT accuracy in discriminating between 240 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 205 healthy subjects. We verified CDT accuracy in discriminating patients when classified according to their global cognitive functioning measured through the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Frontal Assessment Battery. Our results showed that affected individuals reported a worse performance in CDT than healthy controls. Instead, no difference was found between patients when categorized according to their performance at the Mini-Mental State Examination or Frontal Assessment Battery. We confirmed that patients with Parkinson's disease reported low performance at the CDT. We encouraged the use of CDT for early detection of possible cognitive difficulties in Parkinson's disease for clinical and research purposes.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety, established since the 1960s in the USA, and now in Europe, and all over the world has been found to be effective for treating depression in Parkinson's disease (PD). CBT is further developed to acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in Europe and the USA. The neural mechanism of CBT or ACT is still under investigation. In Japan, Morita therapy, a psychotherapy founded in 1919 by Masatake (Shoma) Morita, has been used for common mental problems such as anxiety and depression, but rarely for the psychological symptoms in PD. Morita Therapy is in sharp contrast to western CBT in teaching that undesired mental symptoms such as anxiety and depression are natural features of human emotion in health and disease rather than something to control or eliminate, but it is speculated to be similar to ACT in the approach to acceptance but not elimination of mental symptoms. I speculate that the neural basis might be similar in CBT, ACT, and Morita Therapy. In this commentary, a hypothesis is proposed that CBT, ACT, as well as Morita Therapy might be effective for the treatment of the psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression in PD and in other mental and physical diseases, probably by similar neural mechanisms in the brain.",

    "abstract": "The non-motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasingly being recognised. This review deals with the spectrum of sleep disorders associated with PD, which have a multifactorial aetiology and can significantly have an impact on the quality of life of patients and their carers. Some sleep disorders represent a prodromal phase of PD, with REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) being of particular interest in this regard, whereas others become more common as the disease advances. Understanding the pathophysiology of these sleep disturbances will hopefully lead to new treatment opportunities in the future. The recent discovery of the glymphatic system for removal of waste products from the brain has also raised the possibility that sleep disruption may cause or accelerate the underlying disease process.",

    "abstract": "Different oscillations of brain networks could carry different dimensions of brain integration. We aimed to investigate oscillation-specific nodal alterations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) across early stage to middle stage by using graph theory-based analysis.\nEighty-eight PD patients including 39 PD patients in the early stage (EPD) and 49 patients in the middle stage (MPD) and 36 controls were recruited in the present study. Graph theory-based network analyses from three oscillation frequencies (slow-5: 0.01-0.027\u2009Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.073\u2009Hz; slow-3: 0.073-0.198\u2009Hz) were analyzed. Nodal metrics (e.g. nodal degree centrality, betweenness centrality and nodal efficiency) were calculated.\nOur results showed that (1) a divergent effect of oscillation frequencies on nodal metrics, especially on nodal degree centrality and nodal efficiency, that the anteroventral neocortex and subcortex had high nodal metrics within low oscillation frequencies while the posterolateral neocortex had high values within the relative high oscillation frequency was observed, which visually showed that network was perturbed in PD; (2) PD patients in early stage relatively preserved nodal properties while MPD patients showed widespread abnormalities, which was consistently detected within all three oscillation frequencies; (3) the involvement of basal ganglia could be specifically observed within slow-5 oscillation frequency in MPD patients; (4) logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses demonstrated that some of those oscillation-specific nodal alterations had the ability to well discriminate PD patients from controls or MPD from EPD patients at the individual level; (5) occipital disruption within high frequency (slow-3) made a significant influence on motor impairment which was dominated by akinesia and rigidity.\nCoupling various oscillations could provide potentially useful information for large-scale network and progressive oscillation-specific nodal alterations were observed in PD patients across early to middle stages.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the value of external anal-sphincter electromyography (EAS-EMG) and urethral-sphincter electromyography (US-EMG) in differentiating MSA from PD.\nA total of 201 patients, - 101 MSA and 100 PD - were recruited in this study. Average duration and amplitude of motor unit potentials (MUPs), percentage of polyphasic MUPs, amplitude during strong contractions, and recruitment patterns during maximal voluntary contractions were recorded and analyzed to assess diagnostic efficiency of EAS-EMG and US-EMG for MSA.\nSignificant differences in average MUP duration and recruitment patterns during maximal voluntary contractions were found between patients with MSA and patients with PD using both EAS-EMG (\nEAS-EMG and US-EMG were sensitive and specific methods for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of MSA, and the combination of both would improve the diagnostic rate of MSA compared to only one method being used.",

Variants in the alcohol dehydrogenase genes ADH1C and ADH1B are among the genes that have been associated with PD, suggesting that this family of genes may be important in PD. As part of the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium's efforts to scrutinize previously reported risk factors for PD, we explored genetic variation in the alcohol dehydrogenase genes ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C, ADH4, ADH5, ADH6, and ADH7 using imputed genome-wide association study data from 15,097 cases and 17,337 healthy controls. Rare-variant association tests and single-variant score tests did not show any statistically significant association of alcohol dehydrogenase genetic variation with the risk for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta and clinically manifested mainly with motor dysfunctions. Plants are rich source of medicinally important bioactive compounds and inhabitants of underdeveloped countries used plants for treatment of various ailments. Albizia lebbeck has been reported to possess antioxidant and neuroprotective properties that suggest the evaluation of its traditional therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of present study was to validate the traditional use of Albizia lebbeck (L.) and delineate its mechanism of action in PD. The systems pharmacology approach was employed to explain the Albizia lebbeck (L.) mechanism of action in PD.\nThe haloperidol-induced catalepsy was adopted as experimental model of PD for in-vivo studies in wistar albino rats. The systems pharmacology approach was employed to explain the Albizia lebbeck (L.) mechanism of action in PD.\nIn-vivo studies revealed that Albizia lebbeck improved the motor functions and endurance as demonstrated in behavioral studies which were further supported by the rescue of endogenous antioxidant defense and reversal of ultrastructural damages in histological studies. System pharmacology approach identified 25 drug like compounds interacting with 132 targets in a bipartite graph that revealed the synergistic mechanism of action at system level. Kaemferol, phytosterol and okanin were found to be the important compounds nodes with prominent target nodes of TDP1 and MAPT.\nThe therapeutic efficiency of Albizia lebbeck in PD was effectively delineated in our experimental and systems pharmacology approach. Moreover, this approach further facilitates the drug discovery from Albizia lebbeck for PD.",

    "abstract": "We bilaterally injected 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle of rats and developed bilateral Parkinson's disease (PD) model rats in order to experimentally investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the alteration of nociception in the orofacial region of patients with PD. We explored the effects of dopamine depletion on nociception by investigating behavioral responses (face rubbing) triggered by subcutaneous administration of formalin into the vibrissa pad. We also assessed the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive (c-Fos-IR) cells in the superficial layers of the trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis (Vc). Subcutaneous formalin administration evoked a two-phase increase in face rubbing. We observed the first increase 0-5 min after formalin administration (first phase) and the second increase 10-60 min after administration (second phase). The number of face rubbing behaviors of 6OHDA-injected rats did not significantly change compared with saline-injected rats in both phases. Significant increase of c-Fos-IR cells in the Vc was found in 6-OHDA-injected rats after formalin administration compared with those in saline-injected rats after formalin administration. We also assessed expression of c-Fos-IR cells in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and significant decrease of c-Fos-IR cells in the PVN of 6-OHDA-injected rats was found. Taken together, these findings suggest that bilateral dopaminergic denervation evoked by 6-OHDA administration causes hyperalgesia in the trigeminal region and the PVN may be involved in the hyperalgesia.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by a pivotal progressive loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein protein encoded by the SNCA gene. Genome-wide association studies identified almost 100 sequence variants linked to PD in SNCA. However, the consequences of this genetic variability are rather unclear. Herein, our analysis on selective single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which are highly associated with the PD susceptibility revealed that several SNP sites attribute to the nucleosomes and overlay with bivalent regions poised to adopt either active or repressed chromatin states. We also identified large number of transcription factor (TF) binding sites associated with these variants. In addition, we located two docking sites in the intron-1 methylation prone region of SNCA which are required for the putative interactions with DNMT1. Taken together, our analysis reflects an additional layer of epigenomic contribution for the regulation of the SNCA gene in PD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in LRRK2 and GBA1 are common genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD) and major efforts are underway to develop new therapeutics that target LRRK2 or glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Here we describe a mechanistic and therapeutic convergence of LRRK2 and GCase in neurons derived from patients with PD. We find that GCase activity was reduced in dopaminergic (DA) neurons derived from PD patients with LRRK2 mutations. Inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity results in increased GCase activity in DA neurons with either LRRK2 or GBA1 mutations. This increase is sufficient to partially rescue accumulation of oxidized dopamine and alpha-synuclein in PD patient neurons. We have identified the LRRK2 substrate Rab10 as a key mediator of LRRK2 regulation of GCase activity. Together, these results suggest an important role of mutant LRRK2 as a negative regulator of lysosomal GCase activity.",

A total of 39 patients with high-risk antegrade conduction and 45 patients with inducible orthodromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia underwent catheter ablation. In addition, 14 patients underwent catheter ablation due to family preference.\nHigh-risk antegrade conduction properties are exhibited by more than one-quarter of asymptomatic children and adolescents with WPW.

    "abstract": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which secrete transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and interleukin (IL)-10, have essential role in anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic functions. Herein, we explore the neuroprotection of Tregs in Parkinson's disease (PD) by adoptive transfer of Tregs. Tregs, isolated by magnetic sorting, were activated in vitro and then were adoptively transferred to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice. Neuroinflammation, dopaminergic neuronal loss and behavioral changes of PD mice were evaluated. Live cell imaging system detected a dynamic contact of Tregs with MN9D cells that were stained with CD45 and galectin-1, respectively. Tregs prevented MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss, behavioral changes, and attenuated the inflammatory reaction in the brain. When blockade the LFA-1 activity in Tregs or the ICAM-1 activity in endothelial cells, the percentage of Tregs in substantia nigra (SN) decreased. CD45 and galectin-1 were expressed by Tregs and MN9D cells, respectively. CD45-labeled Tregs dynamically contacted with galectin-1-labeled MN9D cells. Inhibiting CD45 in Tregs impaired the ability of Tregs to protect dopaminergic neurons against MPP",

    "abstract": "There is sufficient evidence that the pathological process that causes Parkinson's disease begins years before the clinical diagnosis is made. Over the last 15\u00a0years, there has been much interest in the existence of a prodrome in some patients, with a particular focus on non-motor symptoms such as reduced sense of smell, REM-sleep disorder, depression, and constipation. Given that the diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease depends on the presence of bradykinesia, it is somewhat surprising that there has been much less research into the possibility of subtle motor dysfunction as a pre-diagnostic pointer. This review will focus on early motor features and provide some advice on how to detect and measure them.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to determine suicide risk and lifetime suicidal ideation in Parkinson disease (PD) patients versus controls and how depression, demoralization, and insomnia are associated with suicidality.\nIn this case-control study, PD patients and matched controls were recruited from movement disorder clinics, Michael J. Fox Foundation, and Research Match websites. Suicide risk and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Suicidal Behavior Questionnaire-revised (SBQ-R) and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Lifetime depression was assessed using the Brief Lifetime Depression Scale, sleep using Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), demoralization using Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research and Kissane Demoralization Scales, and non-motor symptoms using UPDRS Non-Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living scale (nM-EDL).\n186 PD participants and 177 controls were matched for age (64.2\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7\u00a0years), sex (48.8% female), and socioeconomics. PD participants were not more likely than controls to have high suicide risk (SBQ-R\u2009\u2265\u20097) (7.5% vs. 11.3%; p\u2009=\u20090.22) or to have had a lifetime suicide plan or attempt (2.7% vs. 5.1%; p\u2009=\u20090.24), but were less likely to have had lifetime suicidal ideation (23.1% vs. 35.0%; p\u2009=\u20090.01). PD participants were more likely than controls to have lifetime depression history (34.4% vs. 20.9%; p\u2009=\u20090.004), and demoralization (19.9% vs. 10.7%; p\u2009=\u20090.02), and had higher ISI scores (8.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8 vs. 5.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). PD patients with high versus normal suicide risk had higher nM-EDL scores (16.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.8 vs. 10.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9; p\u2009=\u20090.002), and more demoralization (71.4% vs. 21.5%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nSuicide risk is not elevated and suicidal ideation is uncommon in PD, despite the high prevalence of depression and demoralization.",

Based on the essentiality of ascertaining which wearable devices have clinical literary evidence and with the purpose of analyzing the information revealed by such technologies, we conducted this scientific article of integrative review. It is an integrative review, whose main objective is to carry out a summary of the state of the art of wearable devices used in patients with Parkinson's disease. After the review, we retrieved 8 papers. Of the selected articles, only 3 were not systematic reviews; one was a series of cases and two prospective longitudinal studies. These technologies have a very rich field of application; however, research is still necessary to make such evaluations reliable and crucial to the well-being of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) display cognitive dysfunction. However, few studies have investigated how facial and musical emotion recognition are affected in individuals with PD.\nTo explore the relationship between facial and musical emotion recognition and executive functions in Chinese individuals with PD.\nWe showed 40 Chinese individuals with PD and 40 Chinese healthy controls 24 black-and-white portraits and 24 musical excerpts that were designed to express happiness, sadness, fear, and anger. Then, we used four tests to assess the participants' executive functions, including the Trail Making Test (TMT), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), semantic Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), and Digit Span Test (DST).\nThe PD group showed significant impairment in recognizing anger from facial expressions, although their emotion recognition from musical excerpts was similar to that of the control group. Recognition of an angry face was significantly correlated to scores on the TMT and DST. Recognition of happy music was significantly correlated to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score, whereas recognition of angry music was significantly correlated to musical knowledge background. Recognition of happy, sad, or angry music was significantly correlated to tests of executive function, whereas recognition of fearful music was not.\nThe PD group showed impaired recognition of angry faces, which may be related to executive dysfunction. However, the PD group did not show any difficulties in recognizing emotions in music. This dissociation indicates that the mechanisms underlying the recognition of emotions in faces and music are partly independent.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder among adults, affecting 2% of the world population older than 65\u2009years of age. No diagnostic biomarker for routine use in clinical settings currently exists. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in various neurodegenerative conditions, including PD. Distinct miRNAs have been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of \u03b1-synuclein, a key player in PD pathogenesis; miR-153 and miR-223 are downregulated in the brain and serum of parkinsonian GFAP.HMOX1 transgenic mice where they directly regulate \u03b1-synuclein.\nTo ascertain whether salivary miR-153 and miR-223 are similarly downmodulated in, and may serve as diagnostic biomarkers of, idiopathic PD.\nUsing reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction, miR-153 and miR-223 levels were evaluated in the saliva of 77 non-neurological controls and 83 PD patients. Levels of heme oxygenase-1 and \u03b1-synuclein were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Analyses were adjusted by age, sex, medication exposure, disease duration, and relevant comorbidities.\nLog-transformed expression levels of miR-153 and miR-223 were significantly decreased in the saliva of human PD patients in comparison with nonneurological controls. The miRNA expression levels did not change as a function of disease progression (Hoehn and Yahr staging). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve separating controls from PD patients was 79% (95% confidence interval, 61%-96%) for miR-153 and 77% (95% confidence interval, 59%-95%) for miR-223. The ratios of miRNAs to oligomeric \u03b1-synuclein, total \u03b1-synuclein, or heme oxygenase-1 protein did not improve accuracy of the test.\nSalivary miR-153 and miR-223 levels may serve as useful, noninvasive, and relatively inexpensive diagnostic biomarkers of idiopathic PD. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine loss beyond the mesostriatal system might be relevant in pathogenic mechanisms and some clinical manifestations in PD. The primate thalamus is densely and heterogeneously innervated with dopaminergic axons, most of which express the dopamine transporter, as does the nigrostriatal system. We hypothesized that dopamine depletion may be present in the thalamus of the parkinsonian brain and set out to ascertain possible regional differences.\nThe toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine was administered to adult macaque monkeys using a slow intoxication protocol. The treated macaques were classified into 2 groups according to their motor status: nonsymptomatic and parkinsonian. Dopamine innervation was studied with immunohistochemistry for the dopamine transporter. Topographic maps of the dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon distribution were generated and the total length and length density of these axons stereologically estimated using a 3-dimensional fractionator.\nParkinsonian macaques exhibited lower dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon length density than controls in mediodorsal and centromedian-parafascicular nuclei. Dopamine denervation in the mediodorsal nucleus was already noticeable in nonsymptomatic macaques and was even greater in parkinsonian macaques. Reticular nucleus dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon length density presented an inverse pattern, increasing progressively to the maximum density seen in parkinsonian macaques. No changes were observed in ventral thalamic nuclei. Dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon maps supported the quantitative findings.\nChanges in the dopamine innervation of various thalamic nuclei are heterogeneous and start in the premotor parkinsonian stage. These changes may be involved in some poorly understood nonmotor manifestations of PD. \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

Dopamine denervation in the mediodorsal nucleus was already noticeable in nonsymptomatic macaques and was even greater in parkinsonian macaques. Reticular nucleus dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon length density presented an inverse pattern, increasing progressively to the maximum density seen in parkinsonian macaques. No changes were observed in ventral thalamic nuclei. Dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon maps supported the quantitative findings.",

    "abstract": "A minimally invasive test for early detection and monitoring of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a highly unmet need for drug development and planning of patient care. Blood plasma represents an attractive source of biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved noncoding RNA molecules that serve as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. As opposed to ubiquitously expressed miRNAs that control house-keeping processes, brain-enriched miRNAs regulate diverse aspects of neuron development and function. These include neuron-subtype specification, axonal growth, dendritic morphogenesis, and spine density. Backed by a large number of studies, we now know that the differential expression of neuron-enriched miRNAs leads to brain dysfunction.\nThe aim was to identify subsets of brain-enriched miRNAs with diagnostic potential for familial and idiopathic PD as well as specify the molecular pathways deregulated in PD.\nInitially, brain-enriched miRNAs were selected based on literature review and validation studies in human tissues. Subsequently, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed in the plasma of 100 healthy controls and 99 idiopathic and 53 genetic (26 alpha-synuclein\nAn explicit molecular fingerprint for each of the 3 PD cohorts was generated. Although the idiopathic PD fingerprint was different from that of genetic PD, the molecular pathways deregulated converged between all PD subtypes.\nThe study provides a group of brain-enriched miRNAs that may be used for the detection and differentiation of PD subtypes. It has also identified the molecular pathways deregulated in PD. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait is considered one of the most disabling gait disorders in patients with PD. An effective treatment for freezing of gait is missing, thus current management requires a multidisciplinary approach. Among treatment options, physiotherapy is acknowledged to be crucial; however, a systematic review that demonstrates its efficacy is missing. This review aims at examining the short- and long-term effects of physiotherapy in improving freezing of gait in PD patients. Five electronic databases were searched for English-language full-text articles, and only randomized controlled trials were considered. The freezing of gait questionnaire was selected as the primary outcome measure because it is the only validated measure used to evaluate the severity and impact of freezing of gait on patients' daily life. From 1,130 trials, 19 relevant studies, including 913 patients, were selected. The included studies varied for sample size, methodology, and type of intervention. None of the studies had a low risk of bias, but the majority of randomized control trials presented a low risk for at least 6 of 13 biases. Our findings provide evidence for short-term effectiveness of physiotherapy in improving freezing of gait (physiotherapy vs. no treatment: effect size = -0.28 [-0.45, -0.11], P = 0.001; physiotherapy vs. control: effect size = 0.43 [-0.65, -0.21], P\u2009<\u20090.0001), particularly when tailored interventions are applied. These results seem to be maintained at the follow-up examinations (effect size = -0.52 [-0.78, -0.26]; P = 0.001). Promising findings on the potential benefits of physiotherapy in improving freezing of gait were found, although further randomized control trial studies are still needed. Questions remain on the type and duration of intervention that best fits for treating freezing of gait symptom in PD. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "A recent survey reported a high risk of drowning in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. This study intended to assess PD patients' swimming ability and explore the disease-related characteristics that may affect this.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted in idiopathic PD patients. The assessment included swimming in 2 different styles and the evaluation of isolated technical gestures. The primary outcome was the frequency of patients who were able to swim. Limb coordination, blockage episodes, and capacity to maintain the body in a horizontal position were also evaluated.\nThirteen patients were evaluated. Three patients were able to swim according to the predefined definition. The inability to maintain the horizontal position and floatability were the main reasons identified for the decrease in swimming performance.\nSwimming ability is compromised in some PD patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate the global frequency of swimming difficulties in PD patients and their contributing factors. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Study objectives included testing whether presumed levodopa-unresponsive freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) actually persists in the presence of adequate dopaminergic dosing and to investigate whether the presence of other parkinsonian features and their responsiveness to therapy varies across patients without FOG (NO-FOG), with levodopa-responsive FOG (OFF-FOG), and with levodopa-unresponsive FOG (ONOFF-FOG). Fifty-five PD patients completed levodopa challenges after >12-h OFF with supratherapeutic doses of dopaminergic medications. Observed responses in FOG, measured with MDS-UPDRS-III during the patient reported full \"ON\", were used to classify them as NO-FOG, OFF-FOG, or ONOFF-FOG. Serum levodopa levels were measured. Only those with \u226520% improvement in MDS-UPDRS-III score were included in analyses. Levodopa challenge was sufficient to bring about a full \"ON\" state with \u226520% improvement in 45 patients. Levodopa-equivalent-dose utilized was 142\u2009\u00b1\u200956% of patients' typical morning doses. Overall, 19/45 patients exhibited FOG in the full \"ON\" state (ONOFF-FOG), 11 were classified as OFF-FOG, and 15 NO-FOG. Linear mixed models revealed a highly significant association between serum levodopa level and total MDS-UPDRS-III score that was similar across groups. The ONOFF-FOG group exhibited significantly higher New-FOG-questionnaire and MDS-UPDRS-II scores compared to the OFF-FOG group. Among MDS-UPDRS-III subdomains significant effects of group (highest in ONOFF-FOG) were identified for other axial parkinsonian features. We found that FOG can persist in the full \"ON\" state brought about by ample dopaminergic dosing in PD. Other axial measures can also be levodopa-unresponsive among those with ONOFF-FOG only. These data provide evidence that ONOFF-FOG is distinct from responsive freezing.",

    "abstract": "Recent discoveries support the principle that palliative care may improve the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease and those who care for them. Advance care planning, a component of palliative care, provides a vehicle through which patients, families, and clinicians can collaborate to identify values, goals, and preferences early, as well as throughout the disease trajectory, to facilitate care concordant with patient wishes. While research on this topic is abundant in other life-limiting disorders, particularly in oncology, there is a paucity of data in Parkinson's disease and related neurological disorders. We review and critically evaluate current practices on advance care planning through the analyses of three bioethical challenges pertinent to Parkinson's disease and propose recommendations for each.",

Cognitive deficits in other domains (recognition memory, attention processes and visuospatial abilities) become apparent with the progression of PD and development of dementia. In dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) the cognitive impairment develops early or even precedes parkinsonism and it is more pronounced in visuospatial skills and memory.

    "abstract": "The clinical phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD) encompasses a wide range of non-motor symptoms (NMS) compromising the quality of life of affected patients. Currently, information about NMS in PD is scarce among Hispanic populations. Furthermore, few studies have reported the temporal pattern of NMS presentation. We conducted a cross-sectional study aimed to describe the frequency and time of NMS occurrence in Hispanic patients with PD using the self-completed NMS questionnaire (NMSQuest). Participants were interrogated about the time of each NMS presentation respect to the onset of motor symptoms. The frequency of NMS was described according to gender, age at disease onset, disease duration and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage. We enrolled 120 patients, 73.33% males and 26.66% females, with a mean age of 63.33 \u00b1 8.60 years. All the participants presented at least 1 NMS. The median number of NMS per patient was 12. The most frequent NMS domains were miscellaneous, urinary tract, sleep/fatigue, and gastrointestinal tract symptoms, with no significant gender differences. The most frequent individual NMS were nocturia, urinary urgency, feeling sadness, and constipation. Any patient reported NMS before the onset of motor manifestations. The pattern of occurrence of NMS domains in our population was as follows: attention/memory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal tract, perceptual problems/hallucinations, mood/cognition, urinary, miscellaneous, sleep/fatigue, and sexual function. Nausea/vomiting was the earliest symptom observed in all patients, whereas sexual dysfunction and changes in interest for sex were the last symptoms to occur. We found no differences in the total number and frequency of NMS between participants grouped according to their age at disease onset. Conversely, patients with a duration of disease >10 years reported a higher frequency of NMS compared to participants with a duration of disease < 10 years. The total number of NMS per patient increased as the HY stage progressed. The proportion of patients presenting symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, mood/cognition, cardiovascular, and sexual function domains was higher in the HY 4-5 group. Our study provides relevant data to improve our understanding of NMS in PD, which may contribute to anticipate and plan diagnostic and therapeutic strategies among Hispanic PD patients.",

    "abstract": "The question whether facial expression processing may be impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients so far has yielded equivocal results - existing studies, however, have focused on testing expression processing in recognition tasks with static images of six standard, emotional facial expressions. Given that non-verbal communication contains both emotional and non-emotional, conversational expressions and that input to the brain is usually dynamic, here we address the question of potential facial expression processing differences in a novel format: we test a range of conversational and emotional, dynamic facial expressions in three groups - PD patients (",

    "abstract": "This study was addressed to determine the presence of Parkinson disease (PD) manifestations, their distribution according to motor subtypes, and the relationships with health-related quality of life (QoL) using the recently validated European Parkinson's Disease Association sponsored Parkinson's Disease Composite Scale (PDCS). Frequency of symptoms was determined by the scores of items (present if\u2009>0). Using ROC analysis and Youden method, MDS-UPDRS motor subtypes were projected on the PDCS to achieve a comparable classification based on the PDCS scores. The same method was used to estimate severity levels from other measures in the study. The association between the PDCS and QoL (PDQ-39) was analyzed by correlation and multiple linear regression. The sample consisted of 776 PD patients. We found that the frequency of PD manifestations with PDCS and MDS-UPDRS were overlapping, the average difference between scales being 5.5% only. Using the MDS-UPDRS subtyping, 215 patients (27.7%) were assigned as Tremor Dominant (TD), 60 (7.7%) Indeterminate, and 501 (64.6%) Postural Instability and Gait Difficulty (PIGD) in this cohort. With this classification as criterion, the analogous PDCS-based ratio provided these cut-off values: TD subtype, \u22651.06; Indeterminate, <1.06 but >0.65; and PIGD, <0.65. The agreement between the two scales on this classification was substantial (87.6%; kappa\u2009=\u20090.69). PDCS total score cut-offs for PD severity were: 23/24 for mild/moderate and 41/42 for moderate/severe. Moderate to high correlations (",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the world's fastest growing neurological disorder disabling patients through a broad range of motor and non-motor symptoms. For the clinical management, a multidisciplinary approach has increasingly been shown to be beneficial. In Germany, inpatient Parkinson's Disease Multimodal Complex Treatment (PD-MCT) is a well-established and frequent approach, although data on its effectiveness are rare. We conducted a prospective real-world observational study in 47 subjects [age (M\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD): 68.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.0\u00a0years, disease duration: 8.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3\u00a0years, modified Hoehn and Yahr stage (median, IQR): 3, 2.5-3] aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of 14-day PD-MCT in terms of quality of life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, EuroQol), motor [Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (MDS-UPDRS III], Timed Up and Go Test, Purdue Pegboard Test) and non-motor symptoms (revised Beck Depression Inventory). Six weeks after hospital discharge, a follow-up examination was performed. PD patients with a predominantly moderate disability level benefited from PD-MCT in terms of health-related quality of life, motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms (depression). Significant improvements were found for social support, emotional well-being and bodily discomfort domains of health-related quality of life. Sustainable improvement occurred for motor symptoms and the subjective evaluation of health state. We found a higher probability of motor response especially for patients with moderate motor impairment (MDS-UPDRS III\u2009\u2265\u200933). In conclusion, Parkinson's Disease Multimodal Complex Treatment improves motor symptoms, depression and quality of life. A more detailed selection of patients who will benefit best from this intervention should be examined in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Synucleinopathies [Parkinson's disease with or without dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy] are neurodegenerative diseases that are defined by the presence of filamentous \u03b1-synuclein inclusions. We investigated the ability of luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes to stain the inclusions of Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. They stained the Lewy pathology of Parkinson's disease and the glial cytoplasmic inclusions of multiple system atrophy. Spectral analysis of HS-68-stained inclusions showed a red shift in multiple system atrophy, but the difference with Parkinson's disease was not significant. However, when inclusions were double-labelled for HS-68 and an antibody specific for \u03b1-synuclein phosphorylated at S129, they could be distinguished based on colour shifts with blue designated for Parkinson's disease and red for multiple system atrophy. The inclusions of Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy could also be distinguished using fluorescence lifetime imaging. These findings are consistent with the presence of distinct conformers of assembled \u03b1-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy.",

    "abstract": "Disruption to white matter pathways is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Fixel-based analysis has recently emerged as a useful fiber-specific tool for examining white matter structure. In this longitudinal study, we used Fixel-based analysis to investigate white matter changes occurring over time in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nFifty patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (27 men and 23 women; mean age: 61.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1 years), were enrolled. Diffusion-weighted imaging and clinical examinations were performed at three different time points (baseline, first follow-up [after a mean of 24\u00b12 months], and second follow-up [after a mean of 40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 months]). Additional 76 healthy control subjects (38 men and 38 women; mean age: 62.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.5 years) were examined at baseline. The following fixel-based metrics were obtained: fiber density (FD), fiber bundle cross-section (FC), and a combined measure of both (FDC). Paired comparisons of metrics between three different time points were performed in patients. Linear regression was implemented between longitudinal changes of fixel-based metrics and the corresponding modifications in clinical parameters. A family-wise error corrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant.\nEarly degeneration in the splenium of corpus callosum was identified as a typical alteration of Parkinson's disease over time. At follow-up, we observed significant FDC reductions compared with baseline in white matter, noticeably in corpus callosum; tapetum; cingulum, posterior thalamic radiation, corona radiata, and sagittal stratum. We also identified significant FC decreases that reflected damage to white matter structures involved in Parkinson's disease -related pathways. Fixel-based metrics were found to relate with a deterioration of 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and activity of daily living. A Parkinson's disease -facilitated aging effect was observed in terms of white matter disruption.\nThis study provides a thorough fixel-based profile of longitudinal white matter alterations occurring in patients with Parkinson's disease and new evidence of FC as an important role in white matter degeneration in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a paroxysmal gait disorder that often occurs at advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). FOG consists of abrupt walking interruption and severe difficulty in locomotion with an increased risk of falling. Pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning FOG in PD are still unclear. However, advanced MRI and nuclear medicine studies have gained relevant insights into the pathophysiology of FOG in PD. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated structural and functional abnormalities in a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions in PD patients with FOG. In this paper, we systematically review existing neuroimaging literature on the structural and functional brain changes described in PD patients with FOG, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We evaluate previous studies using various MRI techniques to estimate grey matter loss and white matter degeneration. Moreover, we review functional brain changes by examining functional MRI and nuclear medicine imaging studies. The current review provides up-to-date knowledge in this field and summarizes the possible mechanisms responsible for FOG in PD.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently suffer from visual misperceptions and hallucinations, which are difficult to objectify and quantify. We aimed to develop an image recognition task to objectify misperceptions and to assess performance fluctuations in PD patients with and without self-reported hallucinations. Thirty-two non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (16 with and 16 without self-reported visual hallucinations) and 25 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were tested. Participants performed a dynamic image recognition task with real and scrambled images. We assessed misperception scores and intra-individual variability in recognition times. To gain insight into possible neural mechanisms related to misperceptions and performance fluctuations we correlated resting state network connectivity to the behavioral outcomes in a subsample of Parkinson's disease patients (N\u202f=\u202f16). We found that PD patients with self-reported hallucinations (PD-VH) exhibited higher perceptual error rates, due to decreased perceptual sensitivity and not due to changed decision criteria. In addition, PD-VH patients exhibited higher intra-individual variability in recognition times than HC or PD-nonVH patients. Both, misperceptions and intra-individual variability were negatively correlated with resting state functional connectivity involving frontal and parietal brain regions, albeit in partly different subregions. Consistent with previous research suggesting that hallucinations arise from dysfunction in attentional networks, misperception scores correlated with reduced functional connectivity between the dorsal attention and salience network. Intra-individual variability correlated with decreased connectivity between somatomotor and right fronto-parietal networks. We conclude that our task can detect visual misperceptions that are more prevalent in PD-VH patients. In addition, fluctuating visual performance appear to be a signature of PD-VH patients, which might assist further studies of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and cognitive processes.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy of a proprietary method based on stimulation of the hindfoot when lifting the foot from the surface of the support and bringing it forward in the treatment of walking disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe study included 19 patients with walking disorders, akinetic-rigid and mixed form of PD. The stage of the disease on the Hoehn-Yahr scale at the time of the study was 2.56\u00b10,41. During the treatment of walking disorders using the proprietary method, correction of anti-parkinsonian therapy was not carried out. Correction of walking disorders was carried out by using 'activating platforms', which allow mechanical stimulation of the hindfoot at the moment of lifting the foot from the surface of the support. Neurological examination, computer stabilometry (CS), gait function evaluation by means of the LA-1 laser analyzer of kinematic parameters of gait, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were used before and after treatment.\nA significant decrease in core values of LA-1 and positive dynamics on BBS, DGI, UPDRS was revealed after treatment.\nThe original method based on stimulation of foot lifting from the surface and moving the foot forward, effectively improves the pattern of walking in patients with PD and can be recommended as a non-pharmacological method of treatment of impaired walking at the third stage of PD.\n\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c

This study aimed to investigate WM structural network connectome alterations in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and assess the relationship between cognitive impairment and structural topological network changes in PD patients.\nAll 31 healthy controls (HCs) and 71 PD patients (43 PD-NC and 28 PD-MCI) matched for age, sex and education underwent 3.0 T MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan. Graph theoretical analyses and network-based statistical (NBS) analyses were performed to identify the structural WM networks and subnetwork changes in PD-MCI.\nPD-MCI patients showed significantly decreased global efficiency (E\nThis study provided new evidence that PD with cognitive dysfunction is associated with WM structural alterations. The nodal efficiency and sub-network analyses focusing on the orbitofrontal part might provide new ideas to explore the physiological mechanism of PD-MCI.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, the development of agents that can control neuroinflammation has been suggested as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD. In the present study, we investigated whether the phosphodiesterase (PDE) 10 inhibitor has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in neuroinflammation and PD mouse models.\nPapaverine (PAP) was utilized as a selective inhibitor of PDE10. The effects of PAP on the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules were examined in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells by ELISA, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis. The effects of PAP on transcription factors were analyzed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the reporter gene assay, and Western blot analysis. Microglial activation and the expression of proinflammatory molecules were measured in the LPS- or MPTP-injected mouse brains by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analysis. The effect of PAP on dopaminergic neuronal cell death and neurotrophic factors were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. To assess mouse locomotor activity, rotarod and pole tests were performed in MPTP-injected mice.\nPAP inhibited the production of nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated microglia by modulating various inflammatory signals. In addition, PAP elevated intracellular cAMP levels and CREB phosphorylation. Treatment with H89, a PKA inhibitor, reversed the anti-inflammatory effects of PAP, suggesting the critical role of PKA signaling in the anti-inflammatory effects of PAP. We verified the anti-inflammatory effects of PAP in the brains of mice with LPS-induced systemic inflammation. PAP suppressed microglial activation and proinflammatory gene expression in the brains of these mice, and these effects were reversed by H89 treatment. We further examined the effects of PAP on MPTP-injected PD model mice. MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal cell death and impaired locomotor activity were recovered by PAP. In addition, PAP suppressed microglial activation and proinflammatory mediators in the brains of MPTP-injected mice.\nPAP has strong anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and thus may be a potential candidate for treating neuroinflammatory disorders such as PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is common in older individuals. PD patients have an increased risk of fractures compared to the general population, perhaps due to multiple falls. However, the fracture risk has not been fully assessed. To assess the impact of PD on the risk of hip and non-vertebral fractures, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Comprehensive searches of three key bibliographic databases were conducted to identify reviews and primary studies relating to the risk of fractures in patients with PD. Search terms included all relevant terms for Parkinson's disease and for fractures. We selected observational studies with data on the risk of fractures in adults with PD compared to controls without the diagnosis. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. The random-effects model was used to pool the results. Eighteen studies were included in the review. Seventeen independent studies (14 cohort and 3 case-control studies) were included in the hip fracture analysis. Nine studies (all cohorts, no case-control studies) were included in the non-vertebral fracture analysis. Study quality was judged to be moderate to good. Overall, PD patients had an increased risk for both hip fractures (2.40, 95% CI 2.04 to 2.82) and non-vertebral fractures (1.80, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.01) compared to controls. The relative risk for hip fractures was higher in men (2.93, 95% CI 2.05 to 4.18) than in women (1.81, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.04). There were no effects of the study design, geographical region, or criteria for diagnosing Parkinson's disease on these estimates of fracture risk. There is an increase in the risk of hip and non-vertebral fractures in patients with Parkinson's disease and we recommend a re-evaluation of the clinical guidelines on bone health in patients with PD to address this.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the brain atrophy distribution pattern and rate of regional atrophy change in Parkinson's disease (PD) in association with the cognitive status to identify the morphological characteristics of conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (PDD). T1-weighted longitudinal 3T MRI data (up to four follow-up assessments) from neuropsychologically well-characterized advanced PD patients (n = 172, 8.9\u2009years disease duration) and healthy elderly controls (n = 85) enrolled in the LANDSCAPE study were longitudinally analyzed using a linear mixed effect model and atlas-based volumetry and cortical thickness measures. At baseline, PD patients presented with cerebral atrophy and cortical thinning including striatum, temporoparietal regions, and primary/premotor cortex. The atrophy was already observed in \"cognitively normal\" PD patients (PD-N) and was considerably more pronounced in cognitively impaired PD patients. Linear mixed effect modeling revealed almost similar rates of atrophy change in PD and controls. The group comparison at baseline between those PD-N whose cognitive performance remained stable (n = 42) and those PD-N patients who converted to MCI/PDD (\"converter\" cPD-N, n = 26) indicated suggested cortical thinning in the anterior cingulate cortex in cPD-N patients which was correlated with cognitive performance. Our results suggest that cortical brain atrophy has been already expanded in advanced PD patients without overt cognitive deficits while atrophy progression in late disease did not differ from \"normal\" aging regardless of the cognitive status. It appears that cortical atrophy begins early and progresses already in the initial disease stages emphasizing the need for therapeutic interventions already at disease onset.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) generally have a higher proportion of suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) than normal aged adults. This study aimed to identify the specific neuroanatomical alterations in early, drug-naive PD with MCI (PD-MCI) by comparing to those PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) and healthy controls (HCs), which could help to elucidate the underlying neuropathology and facilitate the development of early therapeutic strategies for treating this disease. Structural MRI data of 237 early, drug-naive non-demented PD patients (classified as 61 PD-MCI and 176 PD-NC) and 69 HCs were included from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database after data quality control. Within these data, a subset of 61 HCs and a subset of 61 PD-NC who were matched to the 61 PD-MCI group for age, gender, and education-level were selected to further eliminate the sample size effect. The gray matter (GM) volume changes between groups were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Furthermore, correlations between GM volume alterations and neuropsychological performances and non-cognitive assessments (including olfactory performance) were further examined. Compared to HC, patients with PD-NC and PD-MCI commonly exhibited atrophies in the bilateral amygdala (AM) and the left primary motor cortex (M1). Patients with PD-MCI exclusively exhibited atrophy in the right entorhinal cortex (ENT) compared to PD-NC. Significantly negative correlations were found between GM loss in the bilateral AM and olfactory performance in all PD patients, and between ENT loss and memory performance in PD-MCI. The findings suggest that the right ENT atrophy may subserve as a biomarker in early, drug-naive PD-MCI, which shed light on the neural underpinnings of the disease and provide new evidence on differentiating the neuroanatomical states between PD-MCI and PD-NC.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM), a group of diseases characterized by defective glucose metabolism, is the most widespread metabolic disorder affecting over 400 million adults worldwide. This pathological condition has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of central encephalopathies and peripheral neuropathies. In further support of this notion, recent epidemiological evidence suggests a link between DM and Parkinson's disease (PD), with hyperglycemia emerging as one of the culprits in neurodegeneration involving the nigrostriatal pathway, the neuroanatomical substrate of the motor symptoms affecting parkinsonian patients. Indeed, dopaminergic neurons located in the mesencephalic substantia nigra appear to be particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and degeneration, likely because of their intrinsic susceptibility to mitochondrial dysfunction, which may represent a direct consequence of hyperglycemia and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress. Other pathological pathways induced by increased intracellular glucose levels, including the polyol and the hexosamine pathway as well as the formation of advanced glycation end-products, may all play a pivotal role in mediating the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia on nigral dopaminergic neurons. In this review article, we will examine the epidemiological as well as the molecular and cellular clues supporting the potential susceptibility of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons to hyperglycemia.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is common in Parkinson's disease and represents a risk for dementia. Identifying associated factors will help implement early interventions and study its progression.\nTo identify factors associated with cognitive impairment.\nCross-sectional study of 306 subjects with Parkinson's disease who were assessed for 12 months. Demographics and clinical variables were analyzed as explanatory variables, and cognitive impairment as outcome variable. Significant variables were used to construct a cognitive impairment predictive model.\nCognitive impairment was reported in 43.8%. Female gender (p = 0.001, odds ratio [OR] = 1.77), age at diagnosis (p < 0.001, mean deviation [MD] = 5.7), level of education (p < 0.001, MD = -2.9), disease duration (p = 0.003, MD = 1.7), MDS-UPDRS part III score (p < 0.001, MD = 9.7), presence of anxiety (p = 0.007, OR = 2.11), hallucinations (p = 0.029, OR = 2.27) and freezing of gait (p = 0.048, OR = 1.91) were predictors for cognitive impairment. The use of type B monoamine oxidase inhibitors was associated with less cognitive impairment (p = 0.001).\nPredictive factors that were consistent with those previously reported were identified. Prospective studies are required in order to clarify the effect of type B monoamine oxidase inhibitors on cognition.\nEl deterioro cognitivo en Parkinson es com\u00fan y representa un riesgo para demencia.

El uso de inhibidores \u00admonoamina-oxidasa tipo B se asoci\u00f3 con menor deterioro cognitivo (p = 0.001).\nSe identificaron factores predictores consistentes con lo reportado previamente.

BRCC3 have been shown to promote the inflammasome activation by deubiquitinating NOD-like receptor containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3). We reported the involvement of neuronal inflammasome in Parkinson's Disease (PD), but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we showed that BRCC3 expression was increased in PD models. Knock-down of BRCC3 with shRNA lentivirus decreased NLRP3 neuronal inflammasome. Interestingly, upregulating cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) increased the expression of BRCC3 in HEK293\u00a0cell, while inhibition of Cdk5 decreased the upregulated BRCC3 level in MPP",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the online modulation of motor speech in Parkinson's disease (PD) have not been determined. Moreover, medical and rehabilitation interventions for PD-associated motor speech disorder (MSD) have a poor long-term prognosis.\nTo compare risk factors in PD patients with MSD to those without MSD (non-MSD) and determine predictive independent risk factors correlated with the MSD phenotype, we enrolled 314 PD patients, including 250 with and 64 without MSD. We compared demographic, characteristic data, as well as PD-associated evaluations between the MSD group and non-MSD group.\nUnivariate analysis showed that demographic characteristics, including occupation, educational level, monthly income and speaking background; clinical characteristics, including lesions in the frontal and temporal lobes, and concurrent dysphagia; and PD-associated evaluations, including the activity of daily living (ADL) score, non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) domain 4 score (perceptual problem), and NMSS domain 5 score (attention/memory) were all significantly different between the MSD and non-MSD group (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that educational level, frontal lesions, and NMSS domain 5 score (attention/memory) were independent risk factors for PD-associated MSD (all P\u2009<\u20090.005).\nWe determined an association between MSD phenotype and cognitive impairment, reflected by low-level education and related clinical profiles. Moreover, attention and memory dysfunction may play key roles in the progression of MSD in PD patients. Further studies are required to detail the mechanism underlying abnormal speech motor modulation in PD patients. Early cognitive intervention may enhance rehabilitation management and motor speech function in patients with PD-associated MSD.",

Fatigue was diagnosed according to current diagnostic criteria. Mann-Whitney test or Pearson chi-square test were used to compare fatigued and nonfatigued patients for prevalence of SMD and for demographic, clinical, and behavioural features, memory complaint, and objective cognitive measures. The confounding effect of sample's features on results was controlled by logistic regression and Quade's rank analysis.\nTwenty-three patients were diagnosed as fatigued whereas 15 patients met SMD criteria. Fatigued patients showed higher levodopa equivalent daily dose and more marked behavioural symptoms than nonfatigued patients (p\nFatigue in PD is associated with SMD mainly characterized by less contentment with one's own memory ability.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurological disease in elderly people, and its morbidity and mortality are increasing with the advent of global ageing. The traditional paradigm of moving from small data to big data in biomedical research is shifting toward big data-based identification of small actionable alterations. To highlight the use of big data for precision PD medicine, we review PD big data and informatics for the translation of basic PD research to clinical applications. We emphasize some key findings in clinically actionable changes, such as susceptibility genetic variations for PD risk population screening, biomarkers for the diagnosis and stratification of PD patients, risk factors for PD, and lifestyles for the prevention of PD. The challenges associated with the collection, storage, and modelling of diverse big data for PD precision medicine and healthcare are also summarized. Future perspectives on systems modelling and intelligent medicine for PD monitoring, diagnosis, treatment, and healthcare are discussed in the end.",

This study examined the effects of a Strength, Hope, and Resources Program for People with PD (SHARP-PWP), based on the principles of positive psychology.\nA mixed method design examined the effects of a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial of SHARP-PWP. 31 PD patients diagnosed in the last 5 years (average age\u00a0=\u00a066; 13 men, 18 women) participated in a 6-session program. All participants completed self-report measures at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-week follow-up. Data were analyzed using ANOVA. After the program, 15 participants completed a semi-structured interview. Qualitative interview data were analyzed using Interpretive Description.\nNo significant differences in improvement were found between the Immediate and Delayed intervention groups. However, significant effects for time (i.e., pre-treatment to post-treatment) were found for health-related quality of life and well-being in both Immediate and Delayed conditions. Additional quantitative analysis revealed significant improvement in both groups on hope from pre-treatment to follow-up. Qualitative findings revealed that clients identified social, emotional, behavioral and cognitive changes experienced in the group.\nParticipating in positive psychology research improved health-related quality of life (HrQoL) and mental health and patients identified additional benefits at 6-week follow-up. Our results provide insight about the placebo effect and Hawthorne pre-placebo effects in the context of PD research. The findings can inform trial design and clinical care of patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, with current treatment being mainly symptomatic and often accompanied by serious side effects. In search of novel and safe therapeutic agents for PD, natural flavonoids have been shown to exert significant neuroprotective effects. Among them, chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone) has been demonstrated to exhibit anti-oxidative effects to dopaminergic neurons mainly by increasing the expression of Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (NRF2) which reduces intracellular nitric oxide (NO) levels and regulates anti-oxidant pathways. Moreover, chrysin activates Myocyte Enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), a critical transcription factor involved in dopaminergic survival. It suppresses the MPP-induced upregulation of c-caspase and Bax as well as the downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl 2. Chrysin also enhances the production of neurotrophic factors, contributing to neuronal survival. Of interest, the combination of chrysin with protocatechuic acid (PCA) has been demonstrated to inhibit neuronal loss in PD animal models. Along with anti-inflammatory properties, chrysin has also been shown to increase dopamine levels in the striatum via monoamino-oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibition while it restores the behavioral deficits in PD animal models. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that underlie the possible neuroprotective effects of chrysin in PD pathogenesis along with its therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "There are conflicting findings in the literature regarding the association of body mass index and incidence of PD.\nThis study aimed to investigate the association of body mass index with the risk of PD incidence while considering diabetes mellitus as a major confounding factor.\nWe examined 6,800,601 individuals (aged \u226540\u2009years) who were free of PD using the database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to assess adjusted hazard ratios for PD with adjustment for potential confounders. Stratified analyses by diabetes status were also performed.\nA total of 33,443 individuals were diagnosed with PD during the follow-up period (7.3\u2009years). An increased risk of PD incidence was observed in the underweight group versus the normal group (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 1.21-1.36), whereas a decreased risk of PD incidence was observed (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.88; 95% confidence interval: 0.88-0.93) in the obese group and (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.77; 95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.82) in the severely obese group. This association consistently persisted after stratification by diabetes mellitus status, with the steepest downward slope for PD risk present with increasing body mass index in patients with severe diabetes mellitus (i.e., long duration or complication).\nBeing underweight and diabetes mellitus were associated with an increased risk of PD incidence, and effect of being underweight was more prominent in those with diabetes mellitus, with a dose-response relationship existing according to diabetes mellitus status. Further research is warranted to understand the clinical implications of the significant interaction between being underweight and diabetes mellitus status in the development of PD. \u00a9 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Classical randomisation of clinical trial patients creates a source of genetic variance that may be contributing to the high failure rate seen in neurodegenerative disease trials. Our objective was to quantify genetic difference between randomised trial arms and determine how imbalance can affect trial outcomes.\n5851 patients with Parkinson's disease of European ancestry data and two simulated virtual cohorts based on public data were used. Data were resampled at different sizes for 1000 iterations and randomly assigned to the two arms of a simulated trial. False-negative and false-positive rates were estimated using simulated clinical trials, and per cent difference in genetic risk score (GRS) and allele frequency was calculated to quantify variance between arms.\n5851 patients with Parkinson's disease (mean (SD) age, 61.02 (12.61) years; 2095 women (35.81%)) as well as simulated patients from virtually created cohorts were used in the study. Approximately 90% of the iterations had at least one statistically significant difference in individual risk SNPs between each trial arm. Approximately 5%-6% of iterations had a statistically significant difference between trial arms in mean GRS. For significant iterations, the average per cent difference for mean GRS between trial arms was 130.87%, 95%\u2009CI 120.89 to 140.85 (n=200). Glucocerebrocidase (GBA) gene-only simulations see an average 18.86%, 95%\u2009CI 18.01 to 19.71 difference in GRS scores between trial arms (n=50). When adding a drug effect of -0.5 points in MDS-UPDRS per year at n=50, 33.9% of trials resulted in false negatives.\nOur data support the hypothesis that within genetically unmatched clinical trials, genetic heterogeneity could confound true therapeutic effects as expected. Clinical trials should undergo pretrial genetic adjustment or, at the minimum, post-trial adjustment and analysis for failed trials.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify factors influencing self-management in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) based on social cognitive theory. A cross-sectional design was used; data were collected at three tertiary medical centers in Korea from a convenience sample of 356 PD patients. Higher self-management scores were associated with higher education level, having a religion, and higher family income. Self-management score was positively correlated with activities of daily living, self-efficacy, and social support, and negatively correlated with non-motor symptoms. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that demographic factors and non-motor symptoms explained 26.2% of the variance in self-management in PD. The explanatory power increased by 7.5% when self-efficacy was added, and by 6.7% when social support was added. Assessment of self-management in patients with PD should consider self-efficacy and social support, along with demographic factors and non-motor symptoms. Self-management programs that reflect these factors may be useful for improving self-management in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to show non-motor symptoms (NMS), in addition to motor symptoms, in the foreground of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). We also examined the prevalence of dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which can be evaluated based on NMS, its risk factors, and its effects on quality of life (QOL) by using various scales and questionnaires.\nIn total, 75 patients with IPD (46 men, 29 women) who attend the outpatient neurology clinic of our hospital were included in the study. The motor symptoms and NMS of IPD were examined. The severity of parkinsonism was evaluated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Cognitive tests, the NMS questionnaire, the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale, and the Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome-Patient and Caregiver Inventory were used to identify NMS. The 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire evaluated QOL.\nWe observed a significant increase in scores on the tests assessing NMS, specifically the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, NMS questionnaire, Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale, and Geriatric Depression Scale (P\u2009<\u20090.05). These increases correlated with an increase in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score and a stage increase on the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Based on the scores, motor severity most affected QOL.\nIgnoring NMS while focusing primary on motor symptoms in IPD can cause serious insufficiencies in treatment plans. Assessing NMS and dopamine dysregulation syndrome with structured scales that employ an integrated approach can improve QOL in IPD.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated if a prior long-term physical exercise protocol protects the substantia nigra and the striatum against oxidative stress and motor deficits in a Parkinson Disease model induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. Three animal treatment groups were included in the study: sham; 6-hydroxydopamine and 6-hydroxydopamine/exercise. Previously to the intrastriatal lesion by 6-hydroxydopamine, rats in the exercise groups performed a swimming program for 18\u00a0weeks. The rats were submitted to behavioral tests before and after intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine injection. The oxidative stress was analyzed by Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances and Glutathione reductase activity methods. The exercise decreased lipid peroxidation and increased glutathione reductase activity in the substantia nigra. In contrast, in the striatum, exercise increased lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione reductase activity. Exercise increased contralateral rotations and reduces immobility levels at 14\u00a0days post lesion. The exercise prior to 6-OHDA lesion had protective action only in substantia nigra against oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "To explore the differences of immune disorders in peripheral blood between patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) and late-onset Parkinson's disease (LOPD).\nWe retrospectively reviewed medical records of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy controls between June 2002 and July 2017. At last, we included 117 PD patients who were divided into EOPD and LOPD according to whether onset age of PD was after 50 and 99 controls divided into E-Control (match for EOPD) and L-Control (match for LOPD) according to whether their age was after 53 which was onset age plus median of disease duration. We compared the ratios of cells between multiple groups and performed the multinominal logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between ratios and subtypes of PD. We also carried out the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to estimate the diagnostic value of the variable.\nLymphocyte-red blood cell ratio (LRR) was lower in LOPD compared with that in EOPD or L-Control. LRR was also negatively associated with LOPD (OR: 0.623; 95% CI: 0.397-0.980; \nPeripheral immune disorders might play an important part in the pathological progression of LOPD. Also, LRR has potential diagnostic value.",

In the present study, we investigated the antioxidative protective effects of the indole-derivative compound NC001-8 in DAergic neurons derived from SH-SY5Y cells and PD-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (PD-iPSCs) carrying a ",

    "abstract": "It is well-recognized that the gut microbiota (GM) is crucial for gut function, metabolism, and energy cycles. The GM also has effects on neurological outcomes via many mechanisms, such as metabolite production and the gut-brain axis. Emerging evidence has gradually indicated that GM dysbiosis plays a role in several neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease, depression, and multiple sclerosis. Several studies have observed that PD patients generally suffer from gastrointestinal disorders and GM dysbiosis prior to displaying motor symptoms, but the specific link between the GM and PD is not clearly understood. In this review, we aim to summarize what is known regarding the correlation between the GM and PD pathologies, including direct, and indirect evidence.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common feature in Parkinson's Disease (PD), even at the time of diagnosis. Some levels of heterogeneity in nature and severity of cognitive impairment and risk of conversion to Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) exist. This brief overview summarized the current understanding of MCI in PD, by considering the following major points: historical development of the clinical entity, evaluation, epidemiology, predictors and outcomes, neuroimaging findings, pathophysiology, treatment, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention. MCI in PD represents a concept in evolution and plays a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the disease mechanisms, with the ultimate goal of building effective strategies to prevent conversion into PDD. Challenges for future research are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Constipation is one of the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Acupuncture can have a positive on chronic functional constipation and PD, but its efficacy for the treatment of constipation in PD has not yet been confirmed by high-quality clinical trials. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in the treatment of constipation in PD.\nThis study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial. A total of 124 qualified patients with PD and constipation will be randomly divided into the intervention group (62 participants will receive 12 weeks of EA +usual\u2009care) or the waitlist control group (62 participants will receive 12 weeks of usual care). EA will be performed three times per week from weeks 1-8, two times per week during weeks 9 and 10, and once a week during weeks 11 and 12. The primary outcome is the change in mean weekly spontaneous bowel movements from baseline to weeks 8 and 9. The secondary outcomes are the changes from baseline in mean weekly bowel movements, mean weekly stool consistency, and mean weekly straining. Other secondary outcomes include the weekly doses of defecation drugs, Visual Analogue Scale for subjective improvements in stool symptoms, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and the time and number of steps required to walk 20 m. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, week 4, 8, 12 (intervention period); as well as at week 16, 24 (follow-up period).\nEthical approval has been obtained from four local ethics committees. The results of the study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be disseminated through national and international conferences.\nChiCTR1900021053.",

    "abstract": "Genetic atypical Parkinson's disease (PD) describes monogenic forms of PD that resemble idiopathic PD but feature prominent atypical clinical signs and symptoms and can be sub-grouped into i) atypical monogenic forms caused by mutations in the ATP13A2, DNAJC6, FBXO7, SYNJ1, VPS13C, and DCTN genes; ii) monogenic PD more closely resembling idiopathic PD, but associated with atypical features in at least a subset of cases (SNCA-, LRRK2-, VPS35-, Parkin-, PINK1-, and DJ-1-linked PD; iii) carriers of mutations in genes that are usually associated with other movement disorders but may present with parkinsonism, such as dopa-responsive dystonia. Some atypical features are shared by almost all forms, such as an overall early age at onset. Other clinical signs are present in carriers of mutations across several different genes, such as for example, early cognitive decline. Finally, several clinical features can serve as red flags for specific forms of atypical PD including a supranuclear gaze palsy in ATP13A2 mutation carriers or hypoventilation linked to mutations in the DCTN1 gene.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease still is a clinical diagnosis. Also, the MDS Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson's disease published in 2015 are based on clinical characteristics and were designed codifying the diagnostic process of an expert. The purpose was to support less experienced neurologists to achieve the diagnostic procedure up to the level of an expert. The criteria include both negative and positive properties. However, some features exclude patients with typical Parkinson's disease mainly during their early or late stages. These includes symptoms such as the absence of the combination of typical motor symptoms, the insufficient response to dopaminergic treatment, autonomic dysfunction, dystonia, postural instability or cognitive impairment. This chapter discusses those \"atypical\" symptom constellations that complicate the differential diagnosis of PD versus atypical parkinsonism and illustrates additional considerations that might be helpful to achieve a correct diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Performing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients may encounter a higher complication rate or worse functional outcomes compared with common patients. The relationship between PD and clinical outcomes after TJA is not fully understood.\nRetrospectively, we used manual charts to investigate the clinical outcomes in 41 patients including 24 total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients (28 hips) and 18 total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients (22 knees) with a diagnosis of PD from 2009 to 2016. The stage of PD was confirmed by Hoehn and Yahr scale. Prosthesis survivorship was estimated with revision for any reason as the endpoint.\nAll the clinical outcomes improved significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Subgroup analysis revealed worse functional outcomes in mid- or end-stage PD patients. Sixteen short-term mild to moderate complications were noted. Two revisions were conducted for hip periprosthetic osteolysis and postoperative knee pain. The prosthesis survivorship at 60\u2009months for TJA, total hip arthroplasty (THA), or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was 91.6%, 94.1%, and 87.5%, respectively.\nPatients with PD who underwent TJA would result in excellent pain relief and gain of function. However, patients at late-stage PD may suffer from functional loss. The effectiveness of TJA in patients with severe PD remains a concern. Physician should help delay the progression of PD which may optimize and stabilize the functional outcomes of TJA.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a highly individual disease-profile as well as fluctuating symptoms. Consequently, 24-h home monitoring in a real-world environment would be an ideal solution for precise symptom diagnostics. In recent years, small lightweight sensors which have assisted in objective, reliable analysis of motor symptoms have attracted a lot of attention. While technical advances are important, patient acceptance of such new systems is just as crucial to increase long-term adherence. So far, there has been a lack of long-term evaluations of PD-patient sensor adherence and acceptance. In a pilot study of PD patients (N = 4), adherence (wearing time) and acceptance (questionnaires) of a multi-part sensor set was evaluated over a 4-week timespan. The evaluated sensor set consisted of 3 body-worn sensors and 7 at-home installed ambient sensors. After one month of continuous monitoring, the overall system usability scale (SUS)-questionnaire score was 71.5%, with an average acceptance score of 87% for the body-worn sensors and 100% for the ambient sensors. On average, sensors were worn 15 h and 4 min per day. All patients reported strong preferences of the sensor set over manual self-reporting methods. Our results coincide with measured high adherence and acceptance rate of similar short-term studies and extend them to long-term monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of Gait (FoG) is one of the most debilitating symptoms of Parkinson's disease and is an important contributor to falls. When the management of freezing episodes cannot be achieved through medication or surgery, non-pharmacological methods, such as cueing, have emerged as effective techniques, which ameliorates FoG. The use of On-Demand cueing systems (systems that only provide cueing stimuli during a FoG episode) has received attention in recent years. For such systems, the most common method of triggering the onset of cueing stimuli, utilize autonomous real-time FoG detection algorithms. In this article, we assessed the potential of a simple double-tap gesture interaction to trigger the onset of cueing stimuli. The intended purpose of our study was to validate the use of double-tap gesture interaction to facilitate Self-activated On-Demand cueing. We present analyses that assess if PwP can perform a double-tap gesture, if the gesture can be detected using an accelerometer's embedded gestural interaction recognition function and if the action of performing the gesture aggravates FoG episodes. Our results demonstrate that a double-tap gesture may provide an effective actuation method for triggering On-Demand cueing. This opens up the potential future development of self-activated cueing devices as a method of On-Demand cueing for PwP and others.",

    "abstract": "Familial Parkinson's disease (PD) can be caused by deleterious mutations in PINK1 (encoding PINK1) in an autosomal recessive manner. Functional studies suggest that PINK1 works as a regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis. However, how loss of PINK1 induces dopaminergic neuron degeneration is still unclear. Here, we have generated a patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line with mutant PINK1 (p. I368N). This cell line will facilitate PD disease modeling in vitro and can be used for generating isogenic cell lines through gene correction.",

    "abstract": "An emerging perspective describes beta-band (15-28\u202fHz) activity as consisting of short-lived high-amplitude events that only appear sustained in conventional measures of trial-average power. This has important implications for characterising abnormalities observed in beta-band activity in disorders like Parkinson's disease. Measuring parameters associated with beta-event dynamics may yield more sensitive measures, provide more selective diagnostic neural markers, and provide greater mechanistic insight into the breakdown of brain dynamics in this disease. Here, we used magnetoencephalography in eighteen Parkinson's disease participants off dopaminergic medication and eighteen healthy control participants to investigate beta-event dynamics during timed movement preparation. We used the Hidden Markov Model to classify event dynamics in a data-driven manner and derived three parameters of beta events: (1) beta-state amplitude, (2) beta-state lifetime, and (3) beta-state interval time. Of these, changes in beta-state interval time explained the overall decreases in beta power during timed movement preparation and uniquely captured the impairment in such preparation in patients with Parkinson's disease. Thus, the increased granularity of the Hidden Markov Model analysis (compared with conventional analysis of power) provides increased sensitivity and suggests a possible reason for impairments of timed movement preparation in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Microstructural changes associated with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been studied using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). However, these studies show inconsistent results, mainly due to methodological variations in delineation of SNc. To mitigate this, our work aims to construct a probabilistic atlas of SNc based on a 3D Neuromelanin Sensitive MRI (NMS-MRI) sequence and demonstrate its applicability to investigate microstructural changes on a large dataset of PD. Using manual segmentation and deformable registration we created a novel SNc atlas in the MNI space using NMS-MRI sequences of 27 healthy controls (HC). We first quantitatively evaluated this atlas and then employed it to investigate the micro-structural abnormalities in SNc using diffusion MRI from 133 patients with PD and 99 HCs. Our results demonstrated significant increase in diffusivity with no changes in anisotropy. In addition, we also observed an asymmetry of the diffusion metrics with a higher diffusivity and lower anisotropy in the left SNc than the right. Finally, a multivariate classifier based on SNc diffusion features could delineate patients with PD with an average accuracy of 71.7%. Overall, from this work we establish a normative baseline for the SNc region of interest using NMS-MRI while the application on PD data emphasizes on the contribution of diffusivity measures rather than anisotropy of white matter in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), which involves the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia, has long been associated with motor deficits. Increasing evidence suggests that language can also be impaired, including aspects of syntactic and lexical processing. However, the exact pattern of these impairments remains somewhat unclear, for several reasons. Few studies have examined and compared syntactic and lexical processing within subjects, so their relative deficits remain to be elucidated. Studies have focused on earlier stages of PD, so syntactic and lexical processing in later stages are less well understood. Research has largely probed English and a handful of other European languages, and it is unclear whether findings generalize more broadly. Finally, few studies have examined links between syntactic/lexical impairments and their neurocognitive substrates, such as measures of basal ganglia degeneration or dopaminergic processes. We addressed these gaps by investigating multiple aspects of Farsi syntactic and lexical processing in 40 Farsi native-speaking moderate-to-severe non-demented PD patients, and 40 healthy controls. Analyses revealed equivalent impairments of syntactic comprehension and syntactic judgment, across different syntactic structures. Lexical processing was impaired only for motor function-related objects (e.g., naming 'hammer', but not 'mountain'), in line with findings of PD deficits at naming action verbs as compared to objects, without the verb/noun confound. In direct comparisons between lexical and syntactic tasks, patients were better at naming words like 'mountain' (but not words like 'hammer') than at syntactic comprehension and syntactic judgment. Performance at syntactic comprehension correlated with the last levodopa equivalent dose. No other correlations were found between syntactic/lexical processing measures and either levodopa equivalent dose or hypokinesia, which reflects degeneration of basal ganglia motor-related circuits. All critical significant main effects, interactions, and correlations yielded large effect sizes. The findings elucidate the nature of syntactic and lexical processing impairments in PD.",

    "abstract": "Due to their high prevalence, Parkinson's syndromes are exemplary geriatric syndromes. In addition to idiopathic Parkinson's disease, drug-induced and vascular Parkinson's syndromes are especially relevant in older age. A comprehensive anamnesis, thorough clinical neurological examination and rational additional diagnostics ensure the correct differential diagnostic classification. The multidimensional geriatric assessment is used to quantify the syndrome-specific ability impairments. The primary therapeutic objective in old age is the preservation of everyday competences. Drug treatment is centered around L\u2011dopa because of its favorable effect-side effect ratio. In cases of motor fluctuations, entacapone, opicapone or safinamide can be added, whereas dopamine agonists are generally unsuitable. Rivastigmine is indicated in mild to moderate Parkinson's dementia and furthermore can possibly improve gait stability. Speech therapy, as well as physical and occupational therapy, including the Parkinson's disease-specific Lee Silverman voice treatment are indispensable components of the multiprofessional treatment concept.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is an important cause of dopaminergic (DA) neuron apoptosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) possess antioxidative features. In this study, we investigated whether MSCs could reduce oxidative stress and protect DA neurons from apoptosis by intravenous (I.V.) injection in the early stage of a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD model. MSCs were injected into the tail vein of mice, and behavioral tests, immunofluorescence staining, western blot, and oxidative stress levels were assessed at different time points. After 6-OHDA exposure, DA neuron apoptosis was detected, together with severe oxidative stress in brain and periphery. Compared with the non-transplanted sham controls, motor function in the 6-OHDA-lesioned group after I.V. injection of MSCs was significantly improved, and the levels of DA neuron apoptosis and oxidative stress decreased. The results demonstrate that MSCs can rescue DA neurons from ongoing apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress, and provide insights on developing new therapeutic strategies to offset the degenerative process of PD.",

    "abstract": "The response to levodopa (LR) is important for managing Parkinson's Disease and is measured with clinical scales prior to (OFF) and after (ON) levodopa. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether an ambulatory wearable device could predict the LR from the response to the first morning dose. The ON and OFF scores were sorted into six categories of severity so that separating Parkinson's Kinetigraph (PKG) features corresponding to the ON and OFF scores became a multi-class classification problem according to whether they fell below or above the threshold for each class. Candidate features were extracted from the PKG data and matched to the class labels. Several linear and non-linear candidate statistical models were examined and compared to classify the six categories of severity. The resulting model predicted a clinically significant LR with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.92. This study shows that ambulatory data could be used to identify a clinically significant response to levodopa. This study has also identified practical steps that would enhance the reliability of this test in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Pain is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the prevalence of pain among PD patients varies because of the disease stage, co-morbidities, and evaluating tools. Risk factors for pain in PD include an early age of onset, long disease duration, motor complications, concomitant depressive symptoms, female gender, and associated medical conditions. In patients with PD, pain can be classified as musculoskeletal pain, chronic body pain (central or visceral), fluctuation-related pain, nocturnal pain, orofacial pain, pain with discolouration/oedema/swelling, and radicular/neuropathic pain; musculoskeletal pain as the most common type. Potential underlying mechanisms include a disruption of peripheral nociception and alterations in central pain threshold/processing. Genetic polymorphisms in genes that confer pain susceptibility might also play a role in the occurrence of pain in PD. In advanced stage of patients with PD, polyneuropathy could occur in patients using high dosage of levodopa. Pain often correlates to other non-motor symptoms of PD, including depression, sleep, and autonomic symptoms. Dopaminergic drugs, non-dopaminergic medications, botulinum toxin, deep brain stimulation, and physiotherapy have shown some benefits for certain types of PD-related pain. An increased awareness of pain as a common non-motor symptom of PD provides further insights into sensory system dysregulation in this disease. In this review, we aim to summarizes the clinical features of pain in patients with PD and emphasize the latest evidence of pain related to levodopa treatment.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the innovation of gene-editing tools such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system improves the translational gap of treatments mediated by gene therapy. The privileges of CRISPR/Cas9 such as working in living cells and organs candidate this technology for using in research and treatment of the central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, debilitating, neurodegenerative disorder which occurs due to loss of dopaminergic neurons and is associated with progressive motor dysfunction. Knowledge about the pathophysiological basis of PD has altered the classification system of PD, which manifests in familial and sporadic forms. The first genetic linkage studies in PD demonstrated the involvement of Synuclein alpha (SNCA) mutations and SNCA genomic duplications in the pathogenesis of PD familial forms. Subsequent studies have also insinuated mutations in leucine repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2), Parkin, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), as well as DJ-1 causing familial forms of PD. This review will attempt to discuss the structure, function, and development in genome editing mediated by CRISP/Cas9 system. Further, it describes the genes involved in the pathogenesis of PD and the pertinent alterations to them. We will pursue this line by delineating the PD linkage studies in which CRISPR system was employed. Finally, we will discuss the pros and cons of CRISPR employment vis-\u00e0-vis the process of genome editing in PD patients' iPSCs.",

    "abstract": "Although numerous clinical neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that there are functional abnormalities of motor-related regions in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), little studies have explored the causal interactions within these motor-related regions. The present study aimed to examine Granger causality connectivity patterns within motor-related regions in PD patients.\nResting-state fMRI was conducted to investigate the causal connectivity differences within motor-related regions between 17 PD patients and 17 matched healthy controls. Subsequently, the relationship between the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores and causal connectivity values within motor-related regions was examined in PD patients.\nAn increased causal connectivity from the left premotor cortex (PMC) to right primary motor cortex (M1) was found in PD patients compared with that of healthy controls.

    "abstract": "Postural instability in Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly assessed by the pull test. This clinical test may be biased by the variability of the pull force applied. Our objective was to study the postural responses elicited by reproducible pull forces in healthy subjects and PD patients at different stages of the disease. We performed a multimodal approach that included a systematic analysis of the pull force needed to reach the backward limit of stability (FBLoS) assessed by mechanically produced forces, the displacements of the center of pressure (CoP) recorded on a force platform, and the latencies and patterns of activation of the stabilizing muscles. Comparisons between groups were performed by univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Sixty-four healthy subjects and 32 PD patients, 22 Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) stages I-II and 10 H-Y stage III, were studied. In healthy subjects, FBLoS decreased with aging and was lower in females. Mean (SD) FBLoS was 98.1 (48.9) Newtons (N) in healthy subjects, 70.5 (39.8) N in PD patients H-Y stages I-II, and 37.7 (18.9) N in PD patients H-Y stage III. Compared to healthy subjects and when adjusted for age and gender, PD patients H-Y stages I-II exhibited the following: (a) a reduced FBLoS; (b) larger CoP displacements and higher velocities for the same applied force; and (c) combined ankle and hip strategies elicited by less intense pull forces. All of these abnormalities were more pronounced in H-Y stage III PD patients compared to H-Y stages I-II PD patients. In conclusion, patients in the early stages of PD already exhibit a degree of postural instability due to inefficient postural adjustments, and they can more easily be destabilized by small perturbations than healthy subjects. This balance impairment becomes more pronounced in more advanced PD. In the pull test, pull force to step back should be a variable to consider when testing balance in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a serious gait disturbance, common in mid- and late-stage Parkinson's disease, that affects mobility and increases fall risk. Wearable sensors have been used to detect and predict FOG with the ultimate aim of preventing freezes or reducing their effect using gait monitoring and assistive devices. This review presents and assesses the state of the art of FOG detection and prediction using wearable sensors, with the intention of providing guidance on current knowledge, and identifying knowledge gaps that need to be filled and challenges to be considered in future studies. This review searched the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases to identify studies that used wearable sensors to detect or predict FOG episodes in Parkinson's disease. Following screening, 74 publications were included, comprising 68 publications detecting FOG, seven predicting FOG, and one in both categories. Details were extracted regarding participants, walking task, sensor type and body location, detection or prediction approach, feature extraction and selection, classification method, and detection and prediction performance. The results showed that increasingly complex machine-learning algorithms combined with diverse feature sets improved FOG detection. The lack of large FOG datasets and highly person-specific FOG manifestation were common challenges. Transfer learning and semi-supervised learning were promising for FOG detection and prediction since they provided person-specific tuning while preserving model generalization.",

The relationship between second-hand smoke (SS) and PD risk is also inconclusive. We aimed to systematically review epidemiological studies investigating the association between these AP exposures and PD risk.\nThis was a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating the relationship of ambient AP and SS with PD risk.\nPubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were searched. We used a random-effects model to derive pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per increment in pollutant concentration. The studied AP included particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM\nIn total, 21 studies with 222,051 patients with PD were eligible for inclusion.

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) detects local structural differences in brain tissue such as grey matter volume (GMV) between groups, which is helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of PD. Published VBM studies of GMV changes in PD have shown inconsistent results. Therefore, a voxel-wise meta-analysis of VBM studies was conducted to detect consistent GMV changes in PD.\nThe published literature was searched comparing whole-brain GMV between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs) using VBM. Coordinates were extracted for the clusters of significant GMV differences between PD patients and HCs. The meta-analysis was performed by seed-based d mapping software.\nA total of 63 studies with 2867 PD patients and 1990 HCs were included. Significant GMV reductions in some brain regions were detected in PD patients, which were involved in the basal ganglia, theory of mind, vocal and visual networks. These findings remained largely unchanged in the jackknife sensitivity analysis, and no significant heterogeneity or publication bias was detected.\nParkinson's disease patients have GMV reductions in a number of brain regions involved in specific networks. These findings provide morphological evidence for the pathophysiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Alterations in primary auditory functioning have been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the current findings, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these alterations remain unclear, and the effect of dopaminergic medication on auditory functioning in PD has been explored insufficiently. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically investigate primary auditory functioning in patients with PD by using both subjective and objective audiological measurements. Method In this case-control study, 25 patients with PD and 25 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls underwent an audiological test battery consisting of tonal audiometry, short increment sensitivity index, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), and speech audiometry. Patients with PD were tested in the on- and off-medication states. Results Increased OAE amplitudes were found when patients with PD were tested without dopaminergic medication. In addition, speech audiometry in silence and multitalker babble noise demonstrated higher phoneme scores for patients with PD in the off-medication condition. The results showed no differences in auditory functioning between patients with PD in the on-medication condition and healthy controls. No effect of disease stage or motor score was evident. Conclusions This study provides evidence for a top-down involvement in auditory processing in PD at both central and peripheral levels. Most important, the increase in OAE amplitude in the off-medication condition in PD is hypothesized to be linked to a dysfunction of the olivocochlear efferent system, which is known to have an inhibitory effect on outer hair cell functioning. Future studies may clarify whether OAEs may facilitate an early diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait is a disabling phenomenon that appears in a substantial number of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients as the disease evolves. It is considered to be one of the most relevant contributing factors to worsening of quality of life. Current pharmacological or surgical treatment options have limited efficacy. Thus, alternative nonpharmacological/nonsurgical approaches have emerged in recent years in an attempt to improve quality of life in PD. This systematic review summarizes studies of such therapies over the past 5\u2009years. Thirty-five studies were evaluated by use of a qualitative evaluation, while the methodological quality was assessed using validated tools. According to our results, there appear to be two broad categories of nonpharmacological therapies: those that seek a long-lasting benefit and those that aim to achieve a transient effect to overcome the freezing of gait episode. Among the former, it is possible to differentiate between \"passive\" therapies, which include transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation, and \"active\" therapies, which are based on different cognitive or physical training programs. Finally, \"transient effect\" therapies use different types of cues, such as visual, auditory, or proprioceptive stimuli, to attempt to shift the patient's habitual motor control to a goal-directed one. In conclusion, a broad spectrum of nonpharmacological/nonsurgical approaches for freezing of gait has emerged in recent years with promising results. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the gradual appearance of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn)-containing neuronal protein aggregates. Although the exact mechanism of \u03b1-syn-mediated cell death remains elusive, recent research suggests that \u03b1-syn-induced alterations in neuronal excitability contribute to cell death in PD. Because the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) controls the expression and function of numerous neuronal genes related to neuronal excitability and synaptic function, we here investigated the role of FMRP in \u03b1-syn-associated pathological changes in cell culture and mouse models of PD as well as in post-mortem human brain tissue from PD patients. We found FMRP to be decreased in cultured DA neurons and in the mouse brain in response to \u03b1-syn overexpression. FMRP was, furthermore, lost in the SNc of PD patients and in patients with early stages of incidental Lewy body disease (iLBD). Unlike fragile X syndrome (FXS), FMR1 expression in response to \u03b1-syn was regulated by a mechanism involving Protein Kinase C (PKC) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Reminiscent of FXS neurons, \u03b1-syn-overexpressing cells exhibited an increase in membrane N-type calcium channels, increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, eIF4E and S6, increased overall protein synthesis, and increased expression of Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). FMRP affected neuronal function in a PD animal model, because FMRP-KO mice were resistant to the effect of \u03b1-syn on striatal dopamine release. In summary, our results thus reveal a new role of FMRP in PD and support the examination of FMRP-regulated genes in PD disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Although functional brain imaging has been used for the early and objective assessment of cognitive dysfunction, there is a lack of generalized image-based biomarker which can evaluate individual's cognitive dysfunction in various disorders. To this end, we developed a deep learning-based cognitive signature of FDG brain PET adaptable for Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nA deep learning model for discriminating AD from normal controls (NCs) was built by a training set consisting of 636 FDG PET obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The model was directly transferred to images of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients (n\u2009=\u2009666) for identifying who would rapidly convert to AD and another independent cohort consisting of 62 PD patients to differentiate PD patients with dementia. The model accuracy was measured by area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The relationship between all images was visualized by two-dimensional projection of the deep learning-based features. The model was also designed to predict cognitive score of the subjects and validated in PD patients. Cognitive dysfunction-related regions were visualized by feature maps of the deep CNN model.\nAUC of ROC for differentiating AD from NC was 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.98). The transfer of the model could differentiate MCI patients who would convert to AD (AUC\u2009=\u20090.82) and PD with dementia (AUC\u2009=\u20090.81). The two-dimensional projection mapping visualized the degree of cognitive dysfunction compared with normal brains regardless of different disease cohorts. Predicted cognitive score, an output of the model, was highly correlated with the mini-mental status exam scores. Individual cognitive dysfunction-related regions included cingulate and high frontoparietal cortices, while they showed individual variability.\nThe deep learning-based cognitive function evaluation model could be successfully transferred to multiple disease domains. We suggest that this approach might be extended to an objective cognitive signature that provides quantitative biomarker for cognitive dysfunction across various neurodegenerative disorders.",

The two-dimensional projection mapping visualized the degree of cognitive dysfunction compared with normal brains regardless of different disease cohorts. Predicted cognitive score, an output of the model, was highly correlated with the mini-mental status exam scores.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine impacts on walking ability of spinal deformity and imbalance as distinct from movement disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThirty-two patients (15 males, 17 females; mean age 72.5 years) were analyzed. Three, thirteen, eleven, and five were at Hoehn-Yahr stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively. In addition to various spinal imbalance and deformity classifications the following were assessed: Cobb angle (CA) for scoliosis, thoracic kyphosis (TK) at T2-12, thoracolumbar kyphosis(TLK) at T12-L2, lumbar lordosis(LL) at L1-S1, pelvic tilt(PT), pelvic incidence(PI), and sagittal vertical axis(SVA). The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was used to measure walking ability. Patients were evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III, and bone mineral density (BMD) scans.\nNineteen patients (59%) had spinal deformity and imbalance within the following classifications: thoracic scoliosis, 1; thoracic kyphosis, 2; lumbar scoliosis, 15; Pisa syndrome, 3; camptocormia, 2. Mean values were 20.0\u00b0 CA for scoliosis, 42.3\u00b0 TK, 14.8\u00b0 TLK, 26.7\u00b0 LL, 20.8\u00b0 PT, 48.8\u00b0 PI, and 66.4 mm SVA. The mean TUG score was 13.9s. The UPDRS III mean was 36.6\u00b124.5 points. Mean BMD was 0.856 g/cm\nDistinct from the movement disorders of PD (UPDRS III), loss of normal LL and loss of BMD at the femoral neck were shown to be correlated with diminished walking ability (TUG test) in PD patients. When UPDRS improved in response to L-dopa, walking ability improved. In addition to any PD-specific interventions that contribute to the maintenance of ambulation, interventions specific to the restoration of LL, as well as early treatment for osteoporosis may positively affect HRQOL in PD.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and biochemical diversity of Parkinson's disease (PD) presents a major challenge for accurate diagnosis and prediction of its progression. We propose, develop and optimize PD clinical scores as efficient integrated progression biomarkers for prediction of the likely rate of cognitive decline in PD patients. We considered 269 drug-na\u00efve participants from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative database, diagnosed with idiopathic PD and observed between 4 and 6 years. Nineteen baseline clinical and pathological measures were systematically considered. Relative variable importance and logistic regressions were used to optimize combinations of significant baseline measures as integrated biomarkers. Parkinson's disease cognitive decline scores were designed as new clinical biomarkers using optimally categorized baseline measures. Specificities and sensitivities of the biomarkers reached ~93% for prediction of severe rate of cognitive decline (with more than 5 points decline in 4 years on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale), and up to ~73% for mild-to-moderate decline (between 1 and 5 points decline). The developed biomarkers and clinical scores could resolve the long-standing clinical problem about reliable prediction of PD progression into cognitive deterioration. The outcomes also provide insights into the contributions of individual clinical and pathological measures to PD progression, and will assist with better-targeted treatment regiments, stratification of clinical trial and their evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Following Braak's hypothesis on the infectious pathogenesis of sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD), several bacteria and viruses have been investigated as likely culprits. Recent research has focused on neuroinvasive influenza A viruses (IAV), whereas a genetic link between sPD and tuberculosis has arisen in LRRK2 - dependent maturation of the phagosome. An integrative, outside - in, multi - hit hypothesis is presented here, where (a) mycobacterial immunomodulation creates a phagocyte niche along with cytokine mediated, site specific (i.e. the gut) alterations of both immunity and the microbiome, (b) copper modulating IAVs gain latency in and control over phagocytes and their phenotypes, (c) gain access to the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory and vagus nerves in subsequent infection cycles, (d) induce indolent neuroinflammation characterized by perturbed intraneuronal copper compartmentalization and (e) produce \u03b1 - synuclein (aSyn) pathology at least in part via copper - induced aggregation and misfolding as well as potential synergy with other underlying, corroborating factors (either genetic or acquired) contributing to dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This hypothesis explores recently arisen evidence for each step of this process, as well as pre-existing, yet unexplored overlapping pathophysiological characteristics of sPD with mycobacterial and IAV infections. The implications of this proposed pathogenic model extend both in sPD research (i.e. determining non - tuberculous mycobacteria as the first hit organism, inactivating IAV - induced copper hijacking), as well as therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms which relentlessly and progressively lead to substantial disability and economic burden. Pathologically, these symptoms follow the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) associated with abnormal \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) deposition as cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies in pigmented brainstem nuclei, and in dystrophic neurons in striatal and cortical regions (Lewy neurites). Pharmacotherapy for PD focuses on improving quality of life and primarily targets dopaminergic pathways. Dopamine acts through two families of receptors, dopamine D1-like and dopamine D2-like; dopamine D3 receptors (D3R) belong to dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) family. Although D3R's precise role in the pathophysiology and treatment of PD has not been determined, we present evidence suggesting an important role for D3R in the early development and occurrence of PD. Agonist activation of D3R increases dopamine concentration, decreases \u03b1-Syn accumulation, enhances secretion of brain derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF), ameliorates neuroinflammation, alleviates oxidative stress, promotes neurogenesis in the nigrostriatal pathway, interacts with D1R to reduce PD associated motor symptoms and ameliorates side effects of levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment. Furthermore, D3R mutations can predict PD age of onset and prognosis of PD treatment. The role of D3R in PD merits further research. This review elucidates the potential role of D3R in PD pathogenesis and therapy.",

    "abstract": "At times of an aging population and increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders, effective medical treatments remain limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapies to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is thought to address the neuronal network dysfunction of this disorder and may offer new therapeutic options. Preliminary evidence suggests that DBS of the fornix may have effects on cognitive decline, brain glucose metabolism, hippocampal volume and cortical grey matter volume in certain patients with mild AD. Rodent studies have shown that increase of cholinergic neurotransmitters, hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and reduction of amyloid plaques are associated with DBS. Currently a large phase III study of fornix DBS is assessing efficacy in patients with mild AD aged 65 years and older. The Nucleus basalis of Meynert has also been explored in a phase I study in of mild to moderate AD and was tolerated well regardless of the lack of benefit. Being an established therapy for Parkinson's Disease (PD), DBS may exert some disease-modifying traits rather than being a purely symptomatic treatment. There is evidence of dopaminergic neuroprotection in animal models and some suggestion that DBS may influence the natural progression of the disorder. Neuromodulation may possibly have beneficial effects on course of different neurodegenerative disorders compared to medical therapy alone. For dementias, functional neurosurgery may provide an adjunctive option in patient care. This article is part of the special issue entitled 'The Quest for Disease-Modifying Therapies for Neurodegenerative Disorders'.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor impairment and the accumulation of alpha-synucleinopathy (\u03b1-syn), which can affect different levels of the brain-gut axis. There is a two-way communication between the gastrointestinal tract, and brain that includes the gut microbiota. This bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain includes many pathways, such as immune mechanisms, the vagus nerve, and microbial neurometabolite production. The common cause of constipation in PD is thought to be the accumulation of \u03b1-syn proteins in the enteric nervous system. Recent studies have focused on changes in microbial metabolites and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Microbiota dysbiosis is associated with increased intestinal permeability, intestinal inflammation, and neuroinflammation. Many factors, such as unbalanced nutrition, antibiotic use, age, and infection, result in alteration of microbial metabolites, triggering \u03b1-syn accumulation in the intestinal mucosa cells. Increased evidence indicates that the amount, type, and balance of dietary macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats); high consumption of vegetables, fruits, and omega-3 fatty acids; and healthy diet patterns such as the Mediterranean diet may have a great protective impact on PD. This review focuses on the potential benefits of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics to regulate microbiota dysbiosis along with the effect of diet on the gut microbiota in PD.",

    "abstract": "The electrocardiogram of a 14-year-old boy with recurrent palpitation showed a wide QRS regular tachycardia with a right bundle branch block and right-axis deviation of 226 beats per minute. Verapamil infusion terminated the tachycardia after a few minutes. Electrophysiological study revealed that this tachycardia was considered as a reentrant tachycardia associated with the anterograde left posterior accessory pathway (AP) and retrograde right septal AP. Radiofrequency application was performed and eliminated both APs, and there was no recurrence of wide QRS tachycardia. <",

    "abstract": "Over the course of treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), the clinical effects of dopaminergic medication diminish and side effects emerge. Therefore, searching for new therapeutic alternatives or complementary treatments is required. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could potentially complement the current therapeutic armamentarium, but only a few studies have investigated the therapeutic effects of tDCS in PD. The present pilot study aimed to investigate the effects of repeated tDCS treatment on motor symptoms and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with PD using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).\nFour patients with PD received tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex two times per week (anode F3/cathode F4, 2\u00a0mA for 30 minutes) over a period of 12 months. Patients underwent brain SPECT scans and clinical motor evaluation at baseline and 12-month follow-up. For SPECT data, voxel-wise changes in rCBF were analyzed.\nThere was no significant change of the motor severity scale, but the follow-up SPECT showed significant hyperperfusion in the left superior frontal gyrus medial segment and left superior parietal lobule compared to baseline (P < .001).\nThis study shows that tDCS application may improve rCBF in the frontal and parietal lobes in patients with PD, suggesting beneficial effects of tDCS on brain function. Our results are preliminary and further large-scale studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "Facial expressions are often impaired in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Few studies have examined the effects of head and neck rehabilitation in patients with PD using a facial expression analysis. In the present study, to further elucidate the effects of facial rehabilitation exercise in patients with PD, a three-dimensional facial expression analysis with FaceReader\u2122 and surface electromyography (EMG) were performed in order to assess the facial expressions and muscle activities, respectively. The effects of such exercises on the mood and mental health were also evaluated.\nTwenty-one patients with PD (63.3\u00b112.1 years) participated in the present study and were randomly assigned to an intervention group and non-intervention group. Facial rehabilitation exercise was performed for 60 minutes once a week for 12 weeks in the intervention group. GHQ-12, the facial expression analysis with FaceReader\u2122, surface EMG, and the VAS scale for mood changes were used to evaluate the effects of the program. The results from both groups were compared.\nThe results from eight patients in the intervention group and five in the non-intervention group were analyzed. FaceReader\u2122 revealed a higher \"Happy\" index and lower \"Sad\" index in the intervention group than in the non-intervention group, and a significant interaction \"Happy\" index by an analysis of variance was noted between the two groups. EMG also showed increases in the activity of facial muscles in the intervention group. The subjects' mood improved after each facial rehabilitation exercise session.\nThe results of the present study suggest that the facial rehabilitation exercise affected the mood, facial expression, and facial muscle activities in patients with PD and indicate that the expression analysis with the FaceReader\u2122 and surface EMG are useful for evaluating the effects of facial rehabilitation exercise.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, multiple lines of evidence from human genetic and molecular studies have highlighted the importance of the autophagy lysosomal pathway (ALP) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Genes such as GBA and LRRK2, which harbor some of the most common mutations associated with PD, have essential roles in the ALP. \u03b1-synuclein, encoded by the SNCA gene, is degraded mainly by the ALP, and mutations/multiplications in SNCA may lead to impairment of chaperone mediated autophagy or other ALP functions. Numerous other PD-related genes, such as PRKN, PINK1, TMEM175, SMPD1, CTSD, CTSB and many more, have also been reported to have important roles in the ALP. Understanding the relationship between ALP impairment and PD pathogenesis may be crucial for uncovering the mechanisms underlying PD, and for the development of long-awaited neuroprotective therapies. In this review, we will discuss the data linking the ALP to PD (other, atypical forms of Parkinsonism, will not be discussed in this review). We will focus on evidence from studies on specific genes and proteins, their roles in the ALP, and the potential mechanisms underlying the involvement of these genes in PD.",

    "abstract": "Exercise therapy is becoming extremely relevant as a new efficacious intervention in multiple medical fields. Although several clinical trials have reported benefits of exercise therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), recommendations and prescriptions for its use in clinical practice remain limited.\nTo evaluate the methodological quality and publication rate of clinical trials on exercise therapy for PD.\nWe analyzed all clinical trials assessing exercise therapy for PD registered in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the ClinicalTrials.gov registries, from 2000 to 2017. We evaluated the methodological quality of trials using the Cochrane Risk of Bias criteria.\nA total of 236 clinical trials were identified. Only 70 (29.7%) trials reported their findings, and 61 (25.8%) had results published in scientific journals. Most trials had an unclear risk of bias concerning incomplete and selective outcome reporting and lacked data on the randomization process, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, and outcomes assessors. Aerobic capacity was the most frequent type of exercise intervention.\nAlthough a large number of trials on exercise are registered in international portals, the quality of reporting remains suboptimal and only a quarter of trials have their results published in scientific journals. These two factors, in addition to the heterogeneity of the interventions tested and the unsatisfactory reported methodological quality of most trials, compromise the interpretation of study results. Therefore, higher quality clinical trials reports are needed to establish exercise as part of the PD armamentarium.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) that afflicts millions of individuals worldwide is associated with deposits of aggregate-prone proteins (e.g., \u03b1-synuclein) and with mitochondrial dysfunction in neuronal cells. Mitochondria are the main source of reactive oxygen species, provide energy for neuronal cells, and are regarded as dynamic organelles that are determined by mitochondrial fission, fusion, and mitophagy to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. Growing evidence reveals that several dynamics-related proteins, such as dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), mediate mitochondrial fission, fusion, and mitophagy, to protect against neurodegeneration in PD. More importantly, not only is Drp1-mediated fission required for mitophagy that exerts a protective effect on neurons, but abnormal mitochondrial fission and mitophagy can drive neuronal survival or cell death (i.e., autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis), suggesting that Drp1 may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PD. Also, PD-related proteins such as \u03b1-synuclein, leucine-rich repeat kinase-2, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1, and Parkin have been proven to interact with Drp1, thus contributing to mitochondrial dynamics and clearance, as well as neuronal fate. Here, we review the roles of Drp1 in mitochondrial fission, dynamics, mitophagy, bulk autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis for a better understanding of mitochondrial disturbances in PD-associated neurodegeneration and summarize the advances of novel chemical compounds targeting Drp1 to provide new insight into potential PD therapies.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidences indicated that elevated iron levels in the substantia nigra (SN) have been concerned as the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study used the 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated cynomolgus monkeys for PD to evaluate the usability of SWI for assessing iron deposition in the cerebral nuclei of PD. The results showed that susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) phase values of the ipsilateral (MPTP-lesion side) SN of MPTP-treated monkeys were lower than those in the contralateral SN of MPTP-treated monkeys and the same side of Control monkeys, suggesting that iron deposition were elevated in the affected side SN of MPTP-treated monkeys. Whereas MPTP has not effects on the SWI phase values in other detected brain regions of monkeys, including red nucleus (RN), putamen (PUT) and caudate nucleus (CA). Furthermore, ICP-MS results showed that MPTP increased the iron levels in MPTP injection side, but no in the ipsilateral striatum. Additionally, MPTP treatment did not affect the calcium and manganese levels in the detected brain regions of monkeys. However, Pearson correlation analysis results indicated that there were not relationship between SWI phase values in MPTP-lesion side of SN with the behavioral score, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells number and iron levels in the MPTP-lesion side of midbrain. Taken together, the results confirm the involvement of SN iron accumulations in the MPTP-treated monkey models for PD, and indirectly verify the usability of SWI for the measurement of iron deposition in the cerebral nuclei of PD.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal infusion is an effective treatment for motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. However, it has been recently associated with emergent complex/atypical dyskinesias. We sought to characterize patients who developed these dyskinesias after levodopa infusion initiation, and to compare these patients to a control population with conventional motor fluctuations.\n208 Parkinson's disease patients, treated with levodopa intestinal infusion due to motor fluctuations, were screened for onset and/or worsening of dyskinesias after initiation of levodopa infusion, resistant to the routine titration, and presenting with atypical or unexpected patterns. Patients with extensive follow-up data were enrolled for a longitudinal analysis. Cases were compared to a control sample with conventional motor fluctuations in order to investigate predisposing factors, difference in dyskinesia phenotype, management strategies and dropouts.\nThirty patients out of 208 (14.4%) reported atypical (i.e. long-lasting) biphasic, biphasic-like (i.e. continuous) or mixed (peak-dose and continuous biphasic) dyskinesias after levodopa infusion. They were compared at baseline and follow-up to a sample of 49 patients with conventional motor fluctuations on levodopa infusion. Both groups had similar demographic and clinical features, except the former having higher prevalence of biphasic dyskinesias while on oral therapy. Biphasic-like dyskinesias in nearly half the number of cases improved with increasing the dopaminergic load, while mixed dyskinesias had the worst outcome and highest dropout rate (58%).\nAtypical biphasic, biphasic-like and complex dyskinesias could hinder the course of patients treated with levodopa infusion. This study further informs the selection process of advanced therapies, particularly in dyskinetic patients.",

    "abstract": "Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has been well documented in glycolytic pathway. Independent of this, it has various other functions including stimulator of programmed cell death. Reports suggest that glutamate receptor AMPA type-2 subunit (GluA2) forms protein complex with GAPDH and internalized during excitotoxicity. Further, nuclear accumulation of GluA2 and GAPDH have been studied in neurological disorders like epilepsy and multiple sclerosis, and disruption of this complex rescued neurological symptoms such as astrogliosis, AMPA mediated excitotoxicity and p53 phosphorylation. On the other hand, study on ischemic rat model showed that nucleus translocated GAPDH binds with p53 leading to apoptosis. However, the molecular events underlying these processes remained to be established in Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study focused on investigating the levels of GAPDH, GluA2 and p53 in the nuclear fraction (NF) and total homogenate (TH) of substantia nigral (SN) region obtained from post-mortem PD brains and their age-matched controls. The level of caspase 3, an apoptotic marker and mediator for p53 induced cell death was also measured. A significant increase in nuclear GAPDH, GluA2 and p53 were observed in PD SN region, compared to the controls. Similarly, increased caspase 3 level was observed in PD SN region. Data obtained from the present study suggest that nuclear accumulation of GAPDH, GluA2 and p53 plays a key role in the pathophysiology of neuronal cell death in PD. Thus decreasing nuclear translocation of these death pro-death signaling markers may attenuate neurodegeneration that aids in the development of potential therapeutic targets in the management of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra. The exact mechanism by which dopaminergic neurodegeneration occurs is still unknown; however, mitochondrial dysfunction has long been implicated in PD pathogenesis. To investigate the sub-cellular events that lead to disease progression and to develop personalized interventions, non-neuronal cells which are collected in a minimally invasive manner can be key to test interventions aimed at improving mitochondrial function. We used human skin fibroblasts from sporadic PD (sPD) patients as a cell proxy to detect metabolic and mitochondrial alterations which would also exist in a non-neuronal cell type. In this model, we used a glucose-free/galactose- glutamine- and pyruvate-containing cell culture medium, which forces cells to be more dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy production, in order to reveal hidden metabolic and mitochondrial alterations present in fibroblasts from sPD patients. We demonstrated that fibroblasts from sPD patients show hyperpolarized and elongated mitochondrial networks and higher mitochondrial ROS concentration, as well as decreased ATP levels and glycolysis-related ECAR. Our results also showed that abnormalities of fibroblasts from sPD patients became more evident when stimulating OXPHOS. Under these culture conditions, fibroblasts from sPD cells presented decreased basal respiration, ATP-linked OCR and maximal respiration, and increased mitochondria-targeting phosphorylation of DRP1 when compared to control cells. Our work validates the relevance of using fibroblasts from sPD patients to study cellular and molecular changes that are characteristic of dopaminergic neurodegeneration of PD, and shows that forcing mitochondrial OXPHOS uncovers metabolic defects that were otherwise hidden.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a frequent nonmotor symptom of Parkinson's disease. Depending on severity, patients are considered to have mild cognitive impairment or dementia. However, among the cognitively intact patients, some may have deficits in a less severe range. The early detection of such subtle symptoms may be important for the initiation of care strategies.\nTo identify imaging markers of early cognitive symptoms, potentially before usual signs, such as atrophy, become manifest.\nA total of 102 patients with Parkinson's disease and 17 age-matched cognitively intact healthy controls underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Parkinson's disease patients were separated into 3 groups according to their cognitive status: intact, with slight slowing, and with mild deficits in executive functions. Texture features as measured by first-order and second-order statistics were computed in the following 6 brain regions: the hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, putamen, caudate nucleus, and pallidum. They were tested between the groups, and their correlation with cognition was examined. Volumetric measurements were made for comparison.\nTexture analysis showed significant between-group differences for 2 features-skewness and entropy in the hippocampus, the thalamus, and the amygdala-and the volume analysis revealed no between-group difference. These features were significantly correlated with cognitive performance.\nThese results support the assumption that signal alterations associated with Parkinson's disease-related cognitive decline can be captured very early by texture analysis. As these changes appear to reflect clinical phenomena, texture analysis may be a promising marker for helping cognitive phenotyping in Parkinson's disease. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Identification of a peripheral biomarker is a major roadblock in the diagnosis of PD. Immunohistological identification of p-serine 129 \u03b1-synuclein in the submandibular gland tissues of PD patients has been recently reported.\nWe report on a proof-of-principle study for using an ultra-sensitive and specific, real-time quaking-induced conversion assay to detect pathological \u03b1-synuclein in the submandibular gland tissues of PD patients.\nThe \u03b1-synuclein real-time quaking-induced conversion assay was used to detect and quantify pathological \u03b1-synuclein levels in PD, incidental Lewy body disease, and control submandibular gland tissues as well as in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections.\nWe determined the quantitative seeding kinetics of pathological \u03b1-synuclein present in submandibular gland tissues from autopsied subjects using the \u03b1-synuclein real-time quaking-induced conversion assay. A total of 32 cases comprising 13 PD, 3 incidental Lewy body disease, and 16 controls showed 100% sensitivity and 94% specificity. Interestingly, both PD and incidental Lewy body disease tissues showed 100% concordance for elevated levels of pathological \u03b1-synuclein seeding activity compared to control tissues. End-point dilution kinetic analyses revealed that the submandibular gland had a wide dynamic range of pathological \u03b1-synuclein seeding activity.\nOur results are the first to demonstrate the utility of using the real-time quaking-induced conversion assay on peripherally accessible submandibular gland tissues and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections to detect PD-related pathological changes with high sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, the detection of seeding activity from incidental Lewy body disease cases containing immunohistochemically undetected pathological \u03b1-synuclein demonstrates the \u03b1-synuclein real-time quaking-induced conversion assay's potential utility for identifying prodromal PD in submandibular gland tissues. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common forms of neurodegenerative disorders, and its etiology remains unclear. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) have been found to be significantly associated with PD risk. In particular, the variant rs11931074 was found in one meta-analysis to appear to play a role in the occurrence of PD. This finding has been questioned in subsequent studies, however. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between PD risk and rs11931074 polymorphism.\nWe performed a systematic online search, including PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), aiming to identify case-control studies looking at the role of rs11931074 in PD. We performed calculations of pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) to assess the associations, and subgroup meta-analyses to verify differences between various ethnicities of different study populations.\nA total of 13 studies involving 13,403 cases and 28,408 controls met the inclusion criteria after assessment by two reviewers. Overall, there exists significant associations between SNCA rs11931074 polymorphism and the risk of PD under five genetic models (allele contrast model: T vs. G, OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.12-1.45, P = 0.0001; homozygote model: TG vs. GG, OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.17-2.05, P = 0.002; heterozygote model (TT vs. GG, OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.05-1.42, P = 0.009; dominant model: TG+TT vs. GG: OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05-1.50, P = 0.01 and recessive model: TT vs. TG+GG: OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.18-1.68, P = 0.0002). When ethnicities were stratified, significant associations were found in the allelic, homozygote, and recessive models for Asians, and in the allelic model for Caucasians.\nSNCA rs11931074 polymorphism is found to be associated with PD risk and this risk appears to be influenced by genetic status and ethnicity.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an \u03b1-synucleinopathy characterized by the progressive loss of specific neuronal populations. Here, we develop a novel approach to transvascularly deliver proteins of complex quaternary structures, including \u03b1-synuclein preformed fibrils (pff). We show that a single systemic administration of \u03b1-synuclein pff triggers pathological transformation of endogenous \u03b1-synuclein in non-transgenic rats, which leads to neurodegeneration in discrete brain regions. Specifically, pff-exposed animals displayed a progressive deterioration in gastrointestinal and olfactory functions, which corresponded with the presence of cellular pathology in the central and enteric nervous systems. The \u03b1-synuclein pathology generated was both time dependent and region specific. Interestingly, the most significant neuropathological changes were observed in those brain regions affected in the early stages of PD. Our data therefore demonstrate for the first time that a single, transvascular administration of \u03b1-synuclein pff can lead to selective regional neuropathology resembling the premotor stage of idiopathic PD. Furthermore, this novel delivery approach could also be used to deliver a range of other pathogenic, as well as therapeutic, protein cargos transvascularly to the brain.",
