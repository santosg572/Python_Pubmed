    "abstract": "Alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine use are highly comorbid and alarmingly prevalent in young adults. The hippocampus may be particularly sensitive to substance exposure. This remains largely untested in humans and familial risk may confound exposure effects. We extend prior work on alcohol and hippocampal volume in women by testing common and unique substance use effects and the potential moderating role of sex on hippocampal volume during emerging adulthood. A quasi-experimental cotwin control (CTC) design was used to separate familial risk from exposure consequences.\nIn a population-based sample of 435 24-year-old same-sex twins (58% women), dimensional measures (e.g. frequency, amount) of alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine use across emerging adulthood were assessed. Hippocampal volume was assessed using MRI.\nGreater substance use was significantly associated with lower hippocampal volume for women but not men. The same pattern was observed for alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine. CTC analyses provided evidence that hippocampal effects likely reflected familial risk and the consequence of substance use in general and alcohol and nicotine in particular; cannabis effects were in the expected direction but not significant. Within-pair mediation analyses suggested that the effect of alcohol use on the hippocampus may reflect, in part, comorbid nicotine use.\nThe observed hippocampal volume deviations in women likely reflected substance-related premorbid familial risk and the consequences of smoking and, to a lesser degree, drinking. Findings contribute to a growing body of work suggesting heightened risk among women toward experiencing deleterious effects of substance exposure on the still-developing young adult hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Many theories in the social sciences assume that parenting affects child development. Previous research mostly supports the notion that parenting affects the skill development of children in early childhood. There are fewer studies testing whether parenting in early adolescence has such an influence. We estimate the effects of parenting on early adolescents' noncognitive skills using data from the German Twin Family Panel (TwinLife). Specifically, we look at the effects of parenting styles, parental activities, and extracurricular activities on the academic self-concept, motivation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and locus of control of 10 to 14 years old children. To control for unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality, we employ twin fixed-effects models combined with longitudinal information. In addition, MZ twin fixed effects models also control for genetic confounding. Our findings provide no support to the notion that parenting styles, parental activities, and extracurricular activities in early adolescence affect the development of children's noncognitive skills. We conclude that our results, in combination with the majority of evidence from previous research, are in line with a model according to which parenting has larger effects on the skill development of children in early childhood than in early adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Classroom placement of twins is an ongoing issue for educational policy. Many educational jurisdictions have standard policy most commonly founded in the belief that separation supports individual identity, personal development and academic opportunity. This study examined the effects of classroom placement in a sample of 560 twin pairs whose behaviors were assessed from ages 5 to 12 years. We found no detrimental effect of classroom sharing on twins' social development. In contrast, this study provides evidence that educating twins together is associated with modest positive twins' behaviors and social functioning at school. Implications for educational policies are further discussed.",

    "abstract": "The literature on neonatal outcomes in preterm twins delivered before 34 weeks but within and after 14 days of a single initial steroid course is limited.\nThis bidirectional (226 prospective and 42 retrospectives) cohort study was performed at a tertiary care teaching hospital in South India. We compared the respiratory distress syndrome and neonatal death amongst preterm twins from 28 to 34 weeks born < 14 days (Group A, n=268) and after 14 days (Group B, n=268) of completion of a single course of antenatal steroids. We used multivariable regression analysis (log-binomial model) to adjust for confounding variables. We generated a propensity-matched score with probit regression to analyse outcomes (respiratory distress and neonatal deaths).\nThe two groups had significant differences in the distribution of birthweight, gestation period and mode of delivery. On adjusted analysis, the period of gestation below 33 weeks and weight below 1.5 kg had the maximum influence on respiratory and other morbidities, and weight less than 1 kg on neonatal death. [adjusted relative risk (ARR) 26.06, (95%CI=2.37-285.5), p=0.008]. On propensity scoring after matching all these variables, we found an [ARR of 2.0 (95% CI: 1.03-3.88), P=0.017] for neonatal death after 14 days of steroid injection. The ARR for respiratory distress syndrome was 1.13 in those born after 14 days of steroids, though it did not reach statistical significance.\nOn propensity scoring, the steroid-delivery interval more than 14 days was associated with a significantly increased risk (ARR of 2) of neonatal death.",

    "abstract": "Disturbances in positive affect and reductions in social reward/interpersonal pleasure are common across a range of clinical disorders and are often related. We examined the relationship between the Anticipatory and Consummatory Interpersonal Pleasure Scale (ACIPS-A), and other measures of positive affect in adolescents in a genetically informative research design. The sample consisted of 177 MZ and 136 same sex DZ twins drawn from a study of adolescent twins (M = 16.4 \u00b1 .97 years) who were part of the Wisconsin Twin Project. The self-report questionnaires included the Behavioral Activation Scale (BAS), Psychological Well-Being Scale, revised Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire (EATQR) and the adolescent version of the ACIPS (ACIPS-A). Structural equation modeling estimated the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the phenotypic variance in each of the measures. Follow-up bivariate analyses parsed the genetic and environmental contributions to the phenotypic covariances between the ACIPS-A and each of the other measures of positive affect. We found evidence of moderate heritability for the ACIPS-A scale scores. Overall, models specifying additive genetic and unique environmental effects (AE models) were the most parsimonious models for each of the measures. Several of the measures showed moderate positive phenotypic intercorrelations, and all but one of these intercorrelations showed significant partial genetic underpinnings. Moreover, the bivariate biometric analyses indicated that the ACIPS-A also captures unique heritable variation. Thus, the ACIPS-A captures unique heritable contributions to social/interpersonal pleasure, as well as shared genetic variance with other measures of positive affectivity.",

    "abstract": "Glenoid version is the most variable parameter of the shoulder joint. No authors investigated if intrinsic genetic factors or influences from extrinsic sources are responsible for its variability.\nWe compared glenoid version between elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twins intending to separate the contributions of genetics from shared and unique environments.\nGlenoid version of the dominant shoulder was assessed by MRI using Friedman's method in 30 pairs of elderly twins (16 monozygotic-14 dizygotic; mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD: 63.72\u2009\u00b1\u20093.37, 53-72). Heritability was estimated as twice the difference between the intraclass correlation coefficients for monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. The influence of shared environment was calculated as the difference between monozygotic correlation coefficient and the heritability index. According to job category, one way analysis of variance was used to estimate the differences between groups in the total sample and within zygosity groups.\nGlenoid version angle in monozygotic and dizygotic twins was -2\u00b0 (SD: 2\u00b0) and -3\u00b0 (SD: 3\u00b0), respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.334). Heritability index was 0.98, while the contributions of shared and unique environment were 0 and 0.02, respectively. According to working classes, no significant differences were found between the groups (p\u2009=\u20090.732, F\u2009=\u20090.31).\nGlenoid version is mainly genetically determined and only marginally influenced by environments.",

    "abstract": "Parents of newborn twins are at risk for both shortened sleep duration and sleep discontinuity. The purpose of this study was to characterize weekday and weekend sleep duration, sleep continuity, and awakenings in both mothers and fathers of newborn twins during the first 3 months at home.\nSleep-wake parameters were assessed at two time points using self-report diaries and actigraphy in 75 families with newborn twins. To assess sleep on weekdays and weekends with minimal subject burden, actigraphy recordings of both parents commenced at 9:00 p.m. Saturday and terminated at 9:00 p.m. Tuesday.\nMean sleep duration over 24 hours for parents of twins ranged between 6.7 and 7.5 hours during the first 3 months postpartum and did not significantly differ on weekdays or weekends for mothers. Weekend sleep was more fragmented for fathers at both one month and three months with more awakenings, compared to weekday sleep. Mothers had more fragmented night sleep compared to fathers at one month. In contrast, at three months postpartum fathers had shorter total sleep time and night sleep time, but fewer night awakenings on weekdays than mothers. No differences were observed in weekend sleep duration or sleep patterns between mothers and fathers at three months.\nConsolidated sleep periods for both parents averages three hours or less during the first three months postpartum and sleep for both parents is fragmented. In families with newborn twins, the extent of sleep disruption for mothers and fathers is similar.",

This article describes various theories of MZ twinning that have been examined over the years, although they continue to be speculative. It has also been impossible to know if a singleton began life as an MZ twin; however, a critical technological breakthrough can now reveal this important birth history information with a high degree of certainty. The section that follows presents reviews of current research regarding rare twin loss, development of a twin registry, twins' communicative delays and DNA testing for vanishing twins. The article concludes with a survey of newsworthy twins, namely identical twins discordant for COVID vaccination, the world's oldest identical twins, an Olympic athletic stand-in and fraternal twin football players.",

    "abstract": "Modified metabolites play significant roles in disease occurrence, progression and diagnosis. Sensitive and accurate analytical methods for the quantification of these metabolites are therefore of great importance. In this study, a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the simultaneous measurement of 13 pairs of prototypes and their modified forms covering nucleobases, nucleosides and amino acids. In order to improve the quantification sensitivity and accuracy, two structure analogs named N-dimethyl-amino naphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride (Dns-Cl) and N-diethyl-amino naphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride (Dens-Cl) were introduced for twins labeling derivatization. Dns-labeling was utilized to react with target analytes while the Dens-labeling of standard compounds provided one-to-one internal standards. With the introduce of naphthalene and easily ionizable moiety tertiary ammonium, chromatography retention and separation of these polar metabolites were notably improved on C18 columns and the detection sensitivity was increased up to 400 folds. The method is sensitive with the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) values of 0.002-0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Comparisons of the performance of twins labeling derivatization and traditional chemical isotope labeling (CIL) derivatization verified the ability of our method in the absolute quantification. The established method was applied to human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and its cisplatin resistant derivative A549/DDP. Significant shifts in 12 metabolites as well as 9 modified-to-prototypical ratios in A549/DDP were observed, demonstrating the utility of our method and the potential role of modified metabolites in mediating anticancer drug resistance.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that dramatically impacted human lives and economic activities. Due to the high risk of getting affected in high-density population areas and the implementation of national emergency measures under the COVID-19 pandemic, both travel and transportation among cities become difficult for engineers and equipment. Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line. The results showed that combining the open architecture design paradigm with the proposed digital twins-based approach makes the commissioning of a new flow-type smart manufacturing system more sustainable.",

    "abstract": "Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a disorder encountered in infancy that is caused by hypertrophy of the musculature of the pylorus of the stomach. It may present as partial or complete gastric outlet obstruction. Multiple previous literatures have discussed the incidences and variability in the presentation of IHPS. However, there are very few reports of IHPS occurring in dizygotic twins, especially dizygotic twins of different sexes. Here we present a very rare case of dizygotic twins (a male and a female) affected with IHPS. With this study, we aim to identify the factors that lead to variability in severity and onset of symptoms in dizygotic twins of the opposite sex. We also aim to pay special attention to the etiology and mechanism of development of IHPS in dizygotic twins of the opposite sex.",

    "abstract": "We report an extraordinary case of double pregnancy in patient with uterus didelphys. This anatomic anomaly originates from the lack of fusion of the paired Mullerian ducts during embryological development with 0.3% prevalence in the population. The patient presented to our department with initial diagnosis which was confirmed during ultrasound examination at 12 weeks - uterus didelphys with dichorionic diamniotic twin gestation. Further ultrasound scans were performed every 4 weeks and revealed small for gestational age fetuses. Due to the uterine malformation and the history of cesarean section, the patient was qualified for an elective cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation - two premature neonates were delivered in good general conditions.",

    "abstract": "The food industry faces many challenges, including the need to feed a growing population, food loss and waste, and inefficient production systems. To cope with those challenges, digital twins that create a digital representation of physical entities by integrating real-time and real-world data seem to be a promising approach. This paper aims to provide an overview of digital twin applications in the food industry and analyze their challenges and potentials. Therefore, a literature review is executed to examine digital twin applications in the food supply chain. The applications found are classified according to a taxonomy and key elements to implement digital twins are identified. Further, the challenges and potentials of digital twin applications in the food industry are discussed. The survey revealed that the application of digital twins mainly targets the production (agriculture) or the food processing stage. Nearly all applications are used for monitoring and many for prediction. However, only a small amount focuses on the integration in systems for autonomous control or providing recommendations to humans. The main challenges of implementing digital twins are combining multidisciplinary knowledge and providing enough data. Nevertheless, digital twins provide huge potentials, e.g., in determining food quality, traceability, or designing personalized foods.",

    "abstract": "The beta-actin gene (ACTB) encodes a ubiquitous cytoskeletal protein, essential for embryonic development in humans. De novo heterozygous missense variants in the ACTB are implicated in causing Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFFS; MIM#243310). ACTB pathogenic variants are rarely associated with intestinal malformations. We report on a rare case of monozygotic twins presenting with proximal small bowel atresia and hydrops in one, and apple-peel bowel atresia and laryngeal dysgenesis in the other. The twin with hydrops could not be resuscitated. Intensive and surgical care was provided to the surviving twin. Rapid trio genome sequencing identified a de novo missense variant in ACTB (NM_00101.3:c.1043C>T; p.(Ser348Leu)) that guided the care plan. The identical variant subsequently was identified in the demised twin. To characterize the functional effect, the variant was recreated as a pseudoheterozygote in a haploid wild-type S. cerevisiae strain. There was an obvious growth defect of the yACT1",

    "abstract": "In this work, the structures of chemically related uranyl-oxide minerals agrinierite and rameauite have been revisited and some corrections to the available structure data are provided. Both structures were found to be twinned. The two minerals are chemically similar, and though their structures differ considerably, their unit-cell metrics are similar. Agrinierite was found to be twinned by metric merohedry (diffraction type I), whereas the structure of rameauite is twinned by reticular merohedry (diffraction type II). The twinning of the monoclinic unit cells (true cells) leads to pseudo-orthorhombic or pseudo-tetragonal supercells in the single-crystal diffraction patterns of both minerals. According to the new data and refinement, agrinierite is monoclinic (space group ",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem, autoimmune inflammatory disease with genomic and non-genomic contributions to risk. We hypothesize that epigenetic factors are a significant contributor to SLE risk and may be informative for identifying pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets. To test this hypothesis while controlling for genetic background, we performed an epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in genomic DNA from whole blood in three pairs of female monozygotic (MZ) twins of European ancestry, discordant for SLE. Results were replicated on the same array in four cell types from a set of four Danish female MZ twin pairs discordant for SLE. Genes implicated by the epigenetic analyses were then evaluated in 10 independent SLE gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). There were 59 differentially methylated loci between unaffected and affected MZ twins in whole blood, including 11 novel loci. All but two of these loci were hypomethylated in the SLE twins relative to the unaffected twins. The genes harboring these hypomethylated loci exhibited increased expression in multiple independent datasets of SLE patients. This pattern was largely consistent regardless of disease activity, cell type, or renal tissue type. The genes proximal to CpGs exhibiting differential methylation (DM) in the SLE-discordant MZ twins and exhibiting differential expression (DE) in independent SLE GEO cohorts (DM-DE genes) clustered into two pathways: the nucleic acid-sensing pathway and the type I interferon pathway. The DM-DE genes were also informatically queried for potential gene-drug interactions, yielding a list of 41 drugs including a known SLE therapy. The DM-DE genes delineate two important biologic pathways that are not only reflective of the heterogeneity of SLE but may also correlate with distinct IFN responses that depend on the source, type, and location of nucleic acid molecules and the activated receptors in individual patients. Cell- and tissue-specific analyses will be critical to the understanding of genetic factors dysregulating the nucleic acid-sensing and IFN pathways and whether these factors could be appropriate targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a widespread severe neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by pronounced deficiency of the dopaminergic system and disruption of the function of other neuromodulator systems. Although heritable genetic factors contribute significantly to PD pathogenesis, only a small percentage of sporadic cases of PD can be explained using known genetic risk factors. Due to that, it could be inferred that changes in gene expression could be important for explaining a significant percentage of PD cases. One of the ways to investigate such changes, while minimizing the effect of genetic factors on experiment, are the study of PD discordant monozygotic twins. In the course of the analysis of transcriptome data obtained from IPSC and NPCs, 20 and 1906 differentially expressed genes were identified respectively. We have observed an overexpression of ",

A hyaluronan-containing transfer medium was used in 875 (54.1%) cycles. Programmed cycles were used for 1,385 (85.5%) FETs and 234 (14.5%) cycles were natural. The mean age at FET, oocyte age, endometrial echo thickness, inner cell mass grade, trophectoderm grade, expansion, and day of blastocyst vitrification were similar between the groups. The use of a hyaluronan-containing transfer medium resulted in fewer MZTs. After controlling potential confounders with a multivariate regression, the use of the hyaluronan-containing medium still resulted in fewer MZTs. Monozygotic twins were colinear with preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), so PGT was excluded as a variable in our regression. A regression of PGT only cycles showed that the use of the hyaluronan-containing medium was still associated with a reduction in MZT pregnancies.\nThe use of a hyaluronan-containing transfer medium was associated with a lower rate of MZTs. Other clinical parameters, including cycle type, were not associated with changes in the number of MZTs. The use of PGT needs to be further investigated as a risk factor for MZTs.",

We describe the use of 3D technologies, including 3D virtual and 3D physical models on prenatal evaluation of one parapagus CT. A 16-year-old G1P0 woman was referred for fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) anatomical evaluation of a CT at 28 weeks of gestation. 3D images of the fetal surface were generated by the software during the examination for spatial comprehension of the relationship between the fetal parts. The pair of CTs died at the 32\nG\u00eameos unidos (GUs) s\u00e3o uma complica\u00e7\u00e3o rara de gesta\u00e7\u00f5es gemelares monocori\u00f4nicas e monoamni\u00f3ticas. Descrevemos o uso de tecnologias 3D, incluindo modelos 3D virtuais e f\u00edsicos, na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9-natal de GU parapagus. Mulher de 16 anos, G1P0, foi encaminhada para avalia\u00e7\u00e3o anat\u00f4mica por resson\u00e2ncia magn\u00e9tica (RM) fetal de GU com 28 semanas de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o. Imagens 3D da superf\u00edcie fetal foram geradas pelo software durante o exame para compreens\u00e3o espacial da rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre as partes fetais. O par de GUs morreu na 32\u00aa semana de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o, poucas horas ap\u00f3s a cesariana. As tecnologias 3D s\u00e3o uma importante ferramenta de aconselhamento dos pais e de prepara\u00e7\u00e3o da equipe multiprofissional para o parto e a assist\u00eancia neonatal, al\u00e9m de poss\u00edvel planejamento cir\u00fargico para separa\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00f3s-natal em casos de GUs.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to airborne microorganisms has been linked to the development of health detriments, particularly in children. Microbial pollution can constitute a relevant health concern indoors, where levels of airborne microorganisms may be specially increased. This work aimed to characterize the airborne bacterial levels, and fungal concentration and diversity to which twins are exposed in their bedrooms (n\u00a0=\u00a030) during the first year of life. Bacterial and fungal levels varied widely across the studied bedrooms, with 10% of the rooms presenting values exceeding the national limit for both indoor bacterial and fungal counts. Cladosporium was the predominant genera, but Penicillium, Aspergillus, Alternaria, Trichoderma and Chrysonilia were also identified in the samples collected. In addition, two toxicogenic species, A. flavus and T. viride, were identified at counts that exceeded the established limit (12\u00a0CFU/m",

    "abstract": "Exposure to natural environments, known as greenspace, appears to positively influence health, yet the mechanisms are unclear. Given that gut microbiota are associated with inflammatory disorders more prevalent in urban areas and individuals with lower greenspace exposure, microbiota may act as a mediator between greenspace and health. Using 2443 participants of the TwinsUK cohort, microbiota differences were compared in relation to rural/urban living and with quantiles of area-level greenspace at three different neighbourhood distances: 800\u00a0m, 3000\u00a0m and 5000\u00a0m. Using microbiota data captured from faecal samples using 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing, small compositional differences in association with 3000\u00a0m greenspace (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) in models adjusted for confounders of microbiota variance (sequencing depth, antibiotics use, body mass index, frailty, age, diet, region and socioeconomic variables) were observed. Differences in abundances of genus were observed for all measures of greenspace in adjusted models; a key pathogenic genus was increased in abundance in association with urbanicity (Escherichia/Shigella, logFC\u00a0=\u00a00.73742, padj <0.001). Further, utilising the twin structure, within-pair differences in microbiota composition were compared and associations with 800\u00a0m greenspace observed (factor level significance in association with greatest difference, \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.08, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0162) as were differences in Escherichia/Shigella. The microbiota signature of those with a greater exposure to greenspace, but not necessarily explicitly rural individuals, was distinct from other individuals, suggesting microbiota as a potential mediator for greenspace and health.",

    "abstract": "Zimmermann-Laband syndrome is a rare, heterogeneous disorder characterized by gingival hypertrophy or fibromatosis, aplastic/hypoplastic nails, hypoplasia of the distal phalanges, hypertrichosis, various degrees of intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features. Three genes are considered causative for ZLS: KCNH1, KCNN3, and ATP6V1B2. We report on a pair of female concordant monozygotic twins, both carrying a novel pathogenic variant in the KCNN3 gene, identified using exome sequencing. Only six ZLS patients with the KCNN3 pathogenic variant have been reported so far. The twins show facial dysmorphism, hypoplastic distal phalanges, aplasia or hypoplasia of nails, and hypertrichosis. During infancy, they showed mild developmental delays, mainly speech. They successfully completed secondary school education and are socio-economically independent. Gingival overgrowth is absent in both individuals. Our patients exhibited an unusually mild phenotype compared to published cases, which is an important diagnostic finding for proper genetic counseling for Zimmermann-Laband syndrome patients and their families.",

    "abstract": "To compare latency to delivery and perinatal outcomes between twin and singleton pregnancies undergoing physical examination-indicated cerclage.\nRetrospective observational study (2007-2017) of women who underwent physical examination-indicated cerclage at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. Primary outcomes were latency from cerclage to delivery and gestational age at delivery. Secondary outcomes included: neonatal morbidity and mortality, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, clinical chorioamnionitis and cerclage displacement. Wilcoxon-test and \u03c7\nSixty women were included (17 twins and 43\u00a0singletons). There were no differences in gestational age at cerclage or presence of bulging membranes between groups. Median (25th;75th percentile) gestational age at delivery was 27.1 (24.5;32.3) weeks in the twin group and 27.6 (25.3;35.3) weeks in the singleton group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.594). There were no statistically significant differences in latency from cervical cerclage to delivery between the two groups (43\u00a0days [21;64] vs. 29\u00a0days [16;76], respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a00.938). There were no differences in neonatal mortality (2/26 [7.7%] vs. 1/33 [3.1%]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.578) or in composite neonatal morbidity (14 [53.9%] vs. 14 [42.4%]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.283) between groups, respectively.\nThese results suggest that physical examination-indicated cerclage placement in twins could prolong latency to delivery similarly to singleton pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Induction motors play a key role in the industrial sector. Thus, the correct diagnosis and classification of faults on these machines are important, even in the initial stages of evolution. Such analysis allows for increased productivity, avoids unexpected process interruptions, and prevents damage to machines. Usually, fault diagnosis is carried out by analyzing the characteristic effects caused by the faults. Thus, it is necessary to know and understand the behavior during the operation of the faulty machine. In general, monitoring these characteristics is complex, as it is necessary to acquire signals from the same motor with and without failures for comparison purposes. Whether in an industrial environment or in laboratories, the experimental characterization of failures can become unfeasible for several reasons. Thus, computer simulation of faulty motors digital twins can be an important alternative for failure analysis, especially in large motors. From this perspective, this paper presents and discusses several limitations found in the technical literature that can be minimized with the implementation of digital twins. In addition, a 3D finite element model of an induction motor with broken rotor bars is demonstrated, and motor current signature analysis is used to verify the fault effects. Results are analyzed in the time and frequency domain. Additionally, an artificial neural network of the multilayer perceptron type is used to classify the failure of broken bars in the 3D model rotor.",

    "abstract": "Twins regularly score nearly a standard deviation below the population mean on standardized measures of cognitive development in infancy but recover to the population mean by early childhood, making rapid gains through the toddler years. To date, only polynomial growth models have been fit to model cognitive recovery across childhood, limiting the applicability of the growth parameters to later developmental periods. We fit a nonlinear asymptotic Gompertz growth model to prospective cognitive scores from 1,153 individual twins from 578 families (47.9% male, 91.5% White, 61.6% monozygotic) measured at 16 time points between 3 months and 15 years. Twins displayed a lower asymptote of 86.47 (.90 ",

    "abstract": "We report a case of a monochorionic diamniotic twin with an uncomplicated pregnancy, but with an unexpected large intertwin hemoglobin (Hb) difference at birth. Twin 1 was delivered vaginally and had an uneventful neonatal course. The umbilical cord of Twin 1 was clamped approximately 5 min after birth. After the birth of Twin 1, Twin 2 developed severe bradycardia and showed limited cardiac output on ultrasound, for which an emergency cesarean section was performed. A full blood count revealed an Hb of 20.1 g/dL for Twin 1 and 10.2 g/dL for Twin 2 (intertwin difference 9.9 g/dL). Reticulocyte counts were similar, 40\u2030 and 38\u2030, respectively. Placental examination revealed 10 vascular anastomoses, including one arterio-arterial anastomosis with a diameter of 1.4 mm. Additionally, a large chorangioma was present on the placental surface of Twin 2. There was no color difference on the maternal side of the placenta. Based on the reticulocyte count ratio and the placental characteristics, twin anemia polycythemia sequence was ruled out as the cause of the large intertwin Hb difference. In this report, we discuss the various potential causes that could explain the large intertwin Hb difference including the role of delayed cord clamping in Twin 1, and the role of a large chorangioma, which may have attracted blood from the fetal circulation of Twin 2.",

    "abstract": "There is no unified treatment standard for patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL). Cancer neoantigens are the result of somatic mutations and cancer-specific. Increased number of somatic mutations are associated with anti-cancer effects. Screening out ENKTL-specific neoantigens on the surface of cancer cells relies on the understanding of ENKTL mutation patterns. Hence, it is imperative to identify ENKTL-specific genes for ENKTL diagnosis, the discovery of tumor-specific neoantigens and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. We investigated the gene signatures of ENKTL patients.\nWe collected the peripheral blood of a pair of twins for sequencing to identify unique variant genes. One of the twins is diagnosed with ENKTL. Seventy samples were analyzed by Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA). Two methods (elastic net and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination) were used to select unique genes. Next, we performed functional enrichment analysis and pathway enrichment analysis. Then, we conducted single-sample gene set enrichment analysis of immune infiltration and validated the expression of the screened markers with limma packages.\nWe screened out 126 unique variant genes. Among them, 11 unique genes were selected by the combination of elastic net and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination. Subsequently, GO and KEGG analysis indicated the biological function of identified unique genes. GSEA indicated five immunity-related pathways with high signature scores. In patients with ENKTL and the group with high signature scores, a proportion of functional immune cells are all of great infiltration. We finally found that CDC27, ZNF141, FCGR2C and NES were four significantly differential genes in ENKTL patients. ZNF141, FCGR2C and NES were upregulated in patients with ENKTL, while CDC27 was significantly downregulated.\nWe identified four ENKTL markers (ZNF141, FCGR2C, NES and CDC27) in patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins are generally considered to be monozygotic, as monochorionic dizygotic (MCDZ) twins are extremely rare in natural pregnancies. Several studies have reported this rare occurrence, and most of these pregnancies have been conceived by assisted reproductive technology (ART). These reports mostly focused on MCDZ twin pregnancies and the childhood development of the twins; a follow-up into adulthood and the effect on their reproduction has not been reported. In this case study, we report a case of chimerism in opposite-sex MCDZ twins who were naturally conceived and have reached reproductive maturity. We collected oral mucosal, endometrial, and germ cells from the twins and evaluated their chimerism using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The SNP array showed that they had 4,049 non-allele shared loci, and they inherited nearly 50% informative SNP loci from each parent, confirming that they are dizygotic twins. We found that the female twin had a 46, XX (2)/46, XY (78) karyotype in her peripheral blood. The SNP array confirmed that the female twin and male twin had the same blood haplotype. The ddPCR result showed 92.84 (\u00b1 1.80%) chimerism in her blood. In case of chimerism in her germline, the female twin chose preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy for her blastocysts. Fortunately, the patient only had blood chimerism. A healthy boy was born at 39\u00a0weeks of gestation.",

    "abstract": "Executive functions (EF) are a set of higher-order cognitive abilities that enable goal-directed behavior by controlling lower-level operations. In the brain, those functions have been traditionally associated with activity in the Frontoparietal Network, but recent neuroimaging studies have challenged this view in favor of more widespread cortical involvement. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether the network that serves as critical hubs at rest, which we term network reliance, differentiate individuals as a function of their level of EF. Furthermore, we investigated whether such differences are driven by genetic as compared to environmental factors. For this purpose, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data and the behavioral testing of 453 twins from the Colorado Longitudinal Twins Study were analyzed. Separate indices of EF performance were obtained according to a bifactor unity/diversity model, distinguishing between three independent components representing: Common EF, Shifting-specific and Updating-specific abilities. Through an approach of step-wise in silico network lesioning of the individual functional connectome, we show that interindividual differences in EF are associated with different dependencies on neural networks at rest. Furthermore, these patterns show evidence of mild heritability. Such findings add knowledge to the understanding of brain states at rest and their connection with human behavior, and how they might be shaped by genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "Breakthrough imaging technologies may challenge the plant phenotyping bottleneck regarding marker-assisted breeding and genetic mapping. In this context, X-Ray CT (computed tomography) technology can accurately obtain the digital twin of root system architecture (RSA) but computational methods to quantify RSA traits and analyze their changes over time are limited. RSA traits extremely affect agricultural productivity. We develop a spatial-temporal root architectural modeling method based on 4D data from X-ray CT. This novel approach is optimized for high-throughput phenotyping considering the cost-effective time to process the data and the accuracy and robustness of the results. Significant root architectural traits, including root elongation rate, number, length, growth angle, height, diameter, branching map, and volume of axial and lateral roots are extracted from the model based on the digital twin. Our pipeline is divided into two major steps: (i) first, we compute the curve-skeleton based on a constrained Laplacian smoothing algorithm. This skeletal structure determines the registration of the roots over time; (ii) subsequently, the RSA is robustly modeled by a cylindrical fitting to spatially quantify several traits. The experiment was carried out at the Ag Alumni Seed Phenotyping Facility (AAPF) from Purdue University in West Lafayette (IN, USA).\nRoots from three samples of tomato plants at two different times and three samples of corn plants at three different times were scanned. Regarding the first step, the PCA analysis of the skeleton is able to accurately and robustly register temporal roots. From the second step, several traits were computed. Two of them were accurately validated using the root digital twin as a ground truth against the cylindrical model: number of branches (RRMSE better than 9%) and volume, reaching a coefficient of determination (R\nThe experimental results support the viability of the developed methodology, being able to provide scalability to a comprehensive analysis in order to perform high throughput root phenotyping.",

    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated research and development not only in infectious diseases but also in digital technologies to improve monitoring, forecasting, and intervening on planetary and ecological risks. In the European Commission, the Destination Earth (DestinE) is a current major initiative to develop a digital model of the Earth (a \"digital twin\") with high precision. Moreover, omics systems science is undergoing digital transformation impacting nearly all dimensions of the field, including real-time phenotype capture to data analytics using machine learning and artificial intelligence, to name but a few emerging frontiers. We discuss the ways in which the current ongoing digital transformation in omics offers synergies with digital twins/DestinE. Importantly, we note here the rise of a new field of scholarship, planetary health genomics. We conclude that digital transformation in public and private sectors, digital twins/DestinE, and their convergence with omics systems science are poised to build robust capacities for pandemic preparedness and resilient societies in the 21st century.",

    "abstract": "We analyze data from the Minnesota Twin Registry (MTR), combined with the Socioeconomic Survey of Twins (SST), and new mortality data, and contribute to two bodies of literature. First, we demonstrate a beneficial causal effect of education on health and longevity in contrast to other twin-based studies of the US population, which show little or no effect of education on health. Second, we present evidence that is consistent with parental compensation through education for differences in their children's endowments that predict health, but find no evidence that parents reinforce differences in endowments that predict earnings. We argue that there is a bias towards detecting reinforcement both in this paper and in the literature. Despite this bias, we still find statistical evidence of compensating behavior. We account for observed and unobserved confounding factors, sample selection bias, and measurement error in education.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have determined the epigenetic association between DNA methylation and pulmonary function among various ethnics, whereas this association is largely unknown in Chinese adults. Thus, we aimed to explore epigenetic relationships between genome-wide DNA methylation levels and pulmonary function among middle-aged Chinese monozygotic twins.\nThe monozygotic twin sample was drawn from the Qingdao Twin Registry. Pulmonary function was measured by three parameters including forced expiratory volume the first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio. Linear mixed effect model was used to regress the methylation level of CpG sites on pulmonary function. After that, we applied Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) to predict the genomic regions enrichment, and used comb-p python library to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Gene expression analysis was conducted to validate the results of differentially methylated analyses.\nWe identified 112 CpG sites with the level of P\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nOur DNA methylation sequencing analysis on identical twins provides new references for the epigenetic regulation on pulmonary function. Several CpG sites, genes, biological pathways and DMRs are considered as possible crucial to pulmonary function.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the safety of vaginal delivery with a non-vertex second twin when the first twin is in the vertex presentation.\nA retrospective analysis was undertaken, utilizing a cohort of twin gestations in which the presenting twin was vertex and the second twin was either vertex (group A) or non-vertex (group B). We assessed maternal and neonatal outcomes including emergency cesarean delivery, 5-minute Apgar scores, cord arterial pH, NICU admissions, and adverse maternal postpartum outcomes including ICU admissions and the requirement of blood products.\nSix hundred and eighty-five women with a vertex presenting twin were admitted to labor and delivery. Three hundred and ninety-five women were included in group A (vertex/vertex) and 290 were included in group B (vertex/non-vertex). No statistically significant differences were found in the 5-minute Apgar scores, cord arterial pH, or in the rates of emergency cesarean deliveries, NICU admission, maternal blood transfusion or ICU admissions.\nIn conclusion, vaginal delivery of a breech second twin when the presenting twin is vertex was found as safe as vaginal delivery of twins in the vertex/vertex presentation.",

    "abstract": "Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by tics and multiple comorbidities. The pathophysiology is not yet fully understood, but both environmental and genetic risk factors seem to be involved. Twin studies provide important knowledge on genetic factors. We assessed the concordance of GTS and chronic tic disorders (CTD) in monozygotic (MZ) twins, and examined tic severity, symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Twin pairs, where at least one twin was diagnosed with any tic disorder, were identified through Danish Twin Registry, Psychiatric Central Registry, Danish National Patient Registry and National Tourette Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev. Zygosity was tested with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and clinical assessment was done with validated tools. 14 MZ twin pairs were included: five were discordant. Seven twin pairs were concordant for GTS, and for two pairs one twin had GTS and the other CTD. Among the twins with CTD or GTS, 50% had at least one comorbidity, which is higher than in background populations. The GTS\u00a0+\u00a0OCD-phenotype was significantly more frequent among GTS-concordant than among discordant twins. No statistically significant differences were found between the GTS-concordant and discordant twin pairs regarding tic severity or comorbidities. Thorough clinical assessment and SNP-based genotyping are important when conducting clinical twin studies. We found high concordance of GTS and CTD, which supports the notion that both disorders have common genetic risk factors. Further studies with larger cohorts including dizygotic twins are warranted for more conclusive results.",

    "abstract": "The management of multiple pregnancies is still a challenge. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of triplet pregnancies managed expectantly or by multifetal pregnancy reduction to twins.\nFor this retrospective, comparative and monocentric study, the medical files of all women with triplets who admitted to our institution over a 13-year period were examined. Women requesting multifetal pregnancy reduction to have twins formed the study group, and women with triplets who wished to continue their pregnancies formed the control group. Main outcome measures were durations of pregnancies presented as number of weeks gestation, abortion rates, term and preterm birth rates, fetal loss and live birth rates.\nDuring the study period, 171 women with triplets admitted to our institution. One hundred fifty one patients are included in this study. Forty-five women carrying triplets wished to continue their pregnancies and 106 women requested multifetal pregnancy reduction to have twins. Fetal reduction of triplets to twins was associated with a significantly lower incidence of birth before 34th gestational week and higher incidence of late preterm and term birth rates without changing live birth rates.\nMultifetal pregnancy reduction of triplet pregnancies to twins resulted in a later gestational age at birth compared with the triplet gestations managed expectantly.",

In this case, a 26-year-old woman with previously undiagnosed uterus didelphus spontaneously conceived dicavitary twins. Although initially wanting a vaginal birth, when both twins were in a breech presentation, a caesarean section was performed at 36 weeks, delivering two healthy babies. We will discuss the risk of obstetric complications in uterus didelphus and the challenges surrounding a vaginal delivery.",

    "abstract": "Although the perinatal mortality of monochorionic twins has been reported to be higher, the role of chorionicity is debated and data from Finland are still lacking. To examine the effect of chorionicity on the main outcome measures, perinatal and neonatal mortality and neonatal morbidity of Finnish twins, a comprehensive population-based historical cohort study was performed at Helsinki University Hospitals.\nAll 1034 dichorionic and monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies managed at Helsinki University Hospital area during 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 were collected from patient databases. Information on chorionicity was retrieved from ultrasound reports and all relevant clinical information from patient records. Differences in perinatal and neonatal mortality and neonatal morbidity were analyzed by performing group comparisons between the twins and chorionicity. The role of chorionicity was also assessed in logistic regression analyses.\nThere were 1034 dichorionic-diamniotic (DCDA, n\u00a0=\u00a0789, 76.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 73.6-78.9) and monochorionic-diamniotic (MCDA, n\u00a0=\u00a0245, 23.7%, 95% CI 21.4-26.0) twin pregnancies during the studied years. Most (n\u00a0=\u00a0580, 56.1%, 95% CI 52.8-59.2) twins were born at term, but 151 (61.6%, 95% CI 55.8-67.3) of MCDA twins were preterm and had lower birthweight and Apgar scores and higher risk of death of one twin. Perinatal and neonatal mortality did not differ between twins A and B, but the immediate outcome of twin B was worse, with lower arterial pH and Apgar scores and increased need of neonatal intensive care unit treatment.\nChorionicity contributes to the perinatal and neonatal outcome in favor of dichorionic twins. This disadvantage of MCDA twinning is likely explained by earlier gestational age at birth and inequal placental sharing. Irrespective of chorionicity, twin B faces more complications.",

    "abstract": "More than 30 genes are known to take part in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis development at the date and role of more than 10 other genes is studied. Despite it about 50% of isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism cases still have no molecular genetic explanation.A number of specific associations between iHH and different not-reproductive manifestations called syndromic forms are distinguished in general group of iHH. For example, the combination of Kalmann syndrome with sensorineural hearing loss is known as manifestation for defects of some genes encoding factors of neuronal migration; in patients with this phenotype CHD7, SOX10 genes defects are most frequent. However, defects in the genes of neuronal migration factors are characterized by a wide variability of phenotype, which is explained by the epigenetic mechanisms influence. Carriers of the mutation within the same family may lack some non-reproductive manifestations as well as hypogonadism.Here we present a case of Kalmann syndrome in monozygous twins, caused by a previously not described heterozygous mutation c.462C&gt; G: p.I154M in the SOX10 gene in the absence of sensorineural hearing loss. The mutation was inherited from a father who has only isolated anosmia in the phenotype. This mutation was identified during full exome sequencing. This unique observation for Russia shows on the one hand expediency to check SOX10 sequence in addition to the other factors of neuronal migration and differentiation and, on the other hand, the prospect of full exome sequencing in a group of patients with undifferentiated iHH.\n\u041d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c

    "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex disease of unknown aetiology in which inflammation and fibrosis lead to multiple organ damage. There is currently no effective therapy that can halt the progression of fibrosis or reverse it, thus studies that provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and identify novel potential therapeutic targets are critically needed.\nWe used global gene expression and genome-wide DNA methylation analyses of dermal fibroblasts (dFBs) from a unique cohort of twins discordant for SSc to identify molecular features of this pathology. We validated the findings using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models.\nOur results revealed distinct differentially expressed and methylated genes, including several transcription factors involved in stem cell differentiation and developmental programmes (\nOur data support a role for epigenetic dysregulation in mediating SSc susceptibility in dFBs, illustrating the intricate interplay between CpG methylation, miRNAs and transcription factors in SSc pathogenesis, and highlighting the potential for future use of epigenetic modifiers as therapies.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and genetic findings of 53-year-old monozygotic twins who had bilateral otosclerosis and right-sided superior semicircular canal near dehiscence (SSCND). Monozygotic twins at the age of 53 presented with conductive hearing loss and normal tympanic membranes. Detailed audiovestibular testing and computed tomography scan revealed that both patients had concurrent otosclerosis and SSCND. Conservative management (hearing aids) was the treatment for these patients. Exome sequencing (ES) for the twins and their affected mother identified a heterozygous missense variant in the EYA4 (c.1744G>A; p.Glu582Lys) gene. This is the first case report to present these separate entities identified in monozygotic twins with a heterozygous missense variant in the EYA4 gene. Our ES data may imply a possible causal relationship or association between variants in the EYA4 gene and concurrent otosclerosis and SSCND.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to variations in dental dimensions in a sample of Turkish twins, and to estimate heritability using dental casts.\nThe study samples were selected from the twin children between 3-15 years old who referred for their first dental examination. Fifty nine monozygotic and one hundred and forty three dizygotic twin pairs were examined in the study. The alginate impression material used to create the plaster model of maxilla and mandible. Anterior arch width, posterior arch width, arch length and arch circumference were measured on models prepared from measurements taken for both maxilla and mandible with digital caliper. The similarities and differences of the measurements were compared between pairs of twins and zygocytes. Morever, the effects of bad oral habits, bruxism, a result of psychosocial factors on measurements were examined. Statistical analysis was performed using Paired T Test, Wilcoxon Test and Mann Whitney U test.\nA total of 404 dental models of 118 (29.2%) monozygotic and 286 (70.8%) dizygotic twins were evaluated. There was no statistical difference between sibling pairs in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The measurement similarity between twin siblings differed according to zygosity in all measurements (p<0.05). It has been observed that the finger sucking and mouth breathing affect the dental arch measurements (p<0.05).\nThese results indicate that the differences in dental arch dimensions between monozygotic twin pairs are less than the difference between dizygotic twin pairs.",

Thoracopagus are the twins attached by chest and umbilicus and are the commonest among all the varieties but carries a poor survival rate. We describe our approach and experience of management of thoracopagus twins who were separated at eighty-three day of life and are alive and well after 4 years of follow up. The most important decisive parameter for successful separation is the extent of sharing of organs between twins but the role of a motivated multidisciplinary team is also indispensable.",

    "abstract": "Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) plays a key role in diabetes development and prognosis through its role in pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction and death as well as in upregulating the inflammatory response in hyperglycemia. DNA methylation (DNAm) of TXNIP (TXNIP-cg19693031) is associated with the prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, its role in inflammation and its relationship with T2D remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the epigenetic associations of TXNIP-cg19693031 with a panel of inflammatory biomarkers and to examine whether these inflammatory biomarkers modify the association between TXNIP-cg19693031 methylation and diabetes in 218 middle-aged male twins from the Emory Twin Study. We confirmed the association of TXNIP-cg19693031 DNAm with T2D, as well as with HbA1c, insulin and fasting glucose. We found that hypomethylation at TXNIP-cg19693031 is strongly associated with both type 2 diabetes and higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, MMP-2, sRAGE and P-selectin); however, the relationship between TXNIP-cg19693031 and T2D is independent of the levels of these inflammatory biomarkers. Our results suggest that DNA methylation of TXNIP is linked with multiple biological processes, through which the TXNIP may have broad influence on chronic disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (sPDA) is common among preterm infants, and can lead to several complications. This is particularly true for extremely preterm infants, as closure of the ductus arteriosus using cyclooxygenase inhibitors is often difficult. A recent study using a preterm sheep model showed that intimal thickening-required for anatomical closure of the ductus arteriosus-is less developed in twins than in singletons. Therefore, this study primarily aimed to prove that the ductus arteriosus of extremely preterm twins is more resistant to cyclooxygenase inhibitors than those of extremely preterm singletons. Its secondary aim was to assess whether the resistance against cyclooxygenase inhibitors differed according to chorionicity. In this retrospective case-control study, medical records of 162 extremely preterm infants (gestational age\u2009<\u200928\u00a0weeks) were reviewed, and the treatment course of sPDA was subsequently compared between singletons (n\u2009=\u2009131) and twins (n\u2009=\u200931). The median indomethacin doses for sPDA and the necessity for surgical ligation were significantly higher in twins than in singletons (5 vs 2 [p\u2009<\u20090.001] and 42% vs 21% [p\u2009=\u20090.018], respectively). No significant differences in sPDA treatment, including the number of indomethacin doses and the necessity for surgical ligation, were observed between monochorionic diamniotic and dichorionic diamniotic twins. This study confirms that the ductus arteriosus of extremely preterm twins is more resistant to cyclooxygenase inhibitors than those of singletons. However, there was no significant difference in sPDA treatment by chorionicity.",

    "abstract": "A 56-year-old woman presented with an extensive sarcoma requiring nearly total back resection. She had limited donor sites for reconstruction because of a previous laparotomy, but presented with a significantly larger, identical twin. Cancer has traditionally been considered a contraindication for vascularized composite allotransplantation; however, immunosuppression is potentially avoidable between monozygotic twins.\nA preoperative genetic workup revealed 10/10 human leukocyte antigen homozygosity. Despite substantial phenotypic divergence in size and facial features, the sisters were genotypically identical. A two-stage, double deep inferior epigastric perforator transplant was planned for delayed reconstruction. At the first stage following the resection, an arteriovenous loop was performed to provide recipient vasculature to the back. At a second stage, the transplantation was performed. In addition, bilateral lumbar artery perforator flaps were created to reduce the length of the defect. Intraoperative steroid bolus and a short taper alone were used for immunosuppression.\nThe resection resulted in a 22 \u00d7 29-cm specimen down to the spine. After a 4-day interval for permanent pathologic evaluation, the transplant was successfully transferred between twins. Two arteries and six veins were anastomosed to establish perfusion. Postoperatively, there have been no episodes of rejection or flap compromise at last follow-up (>36 months).\nThis case represents one of the few vascularized composite allotransplantations between monozygotic twins, and the only reported successful vascularized composite allotransplantation for a recurrent cancer diagnosis. Oncologic safety depended on 100 percent histocompatibility to avoid immunosuppression. Limited patient donor sites precluded total autologous coverage, and a substantial size discrepancy between the twins favored a transplant.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now spread throughout the globe infecting over 150 million people and causing the death of over 3.2 million people. Thus, there is an urgent need to study the dynamics of epidemiological models to gain a better understanding of how such diseases spread. While epidemiological models can be computationally expensive, recent advances in machine learning techniques have given rise to neural networks with the ability to learn and predict complex dynamics at reduced computational costs. Here we introduce two digital twins of a SEIRS model applied to an idealised town. The SEIRS model has been modified to take account of spatial variation and, where possible, the model parameters are based on official virus spreading data from the UK. We compare predictions from one digital twin based on a data-corrected Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network with predictions from another digital twin based on a predictive Generative Adversarial Network. The predictions given by these two frameworks are accurate when compared to the original SEIRS model data. Additionally, these frameworks are data-agnostic and could be applied to towns, idealised or real, in the UK or in other countries. Also, more compartments could be included in the SEIRS model, in order to study more realistic epidemiological behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Infertility treatments have allowed millions of couples to have their own children, but resultant multiple pregnancies with their increased morbidity and mortality have been a significant complication. Fetal reduction was developed to ameliorate this issue. Over 30 years of publications show that fetal reduction has been highly successful in substantially reducing both mortality and morbidity related to multiple pregnancies. As with most radically new techniques, initial cases were in the \"nothing to lose\" category. With experience, indications liberalize, and quality of life issues gain relevance. The overall risks of twin pregnancy are not twice that of singleton pregnancy; they are about 4 to 5 times higher. In experienced hands, the combination of genetic testing by chorionic villus sampling followed by fetal reduction has made the outcomes of most multiple pregnancies statistically equivalent to those of pregnancies with lower fetal numbers. Use of microarray analysis to better determine fetal genetic health before deciding on which fetus(es) to keep or reduce further improves pediatric outcomes. With increasing experience and lower average starting numbers, the proportion of fetal reductions to a singleton has increased considerably. Twins to a singleton fetal reductions now constitute an increasing proportion of cases performed. Data on such cases show improved outcomes, and we believe fetal reduction should be at least discussed and offered to all patients with a dichorionic twin pregnancy or higher. With the increasing reliance on elective single-embryo transfers, monochorionic twins, which have much higher complication rates than dichorionic twins, have increased substantially. Furthermore, monochorionic twins cannot be readily and safely reduced, so the adverse perinatal statistics of elective single-embryo transfer are a major setback for good outcomes. Although elective single-embryo transfer is appropriate for some, we believe that for many couples, the transfer of 2 embryos is generally a more rational approach.",

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 applications help digital industrial transformation to be achieved through smart, data-driven solutions that improve production efficiency, product consistency, preventive maintenance, and the logistics of industrial applications and related supply chains. To enable and accelerate digital industrial transformation, it is vital to support cost-efficient Industry 4.0 application development. However, the development of such Industry 4.0 applications is currently expensive due to the limitations of existing IoT platforms in representing complex industrial machines, the support of only production line-based application testing, and the lack of cost models for application cost/benefit analysis. In this paper, we propose the use of Cyber Twins (CTs), an extension of Digital Twins, to support cost-efficient Industry 4.0 application development. CTs provide semantic descriptions of the machines they represent and incorporate machine simulators that enable application testing without any production line risk and cost. This paper focuses on CT-based Industry 4.0 application development and the related cost models. Via a case study of a CT-based Industry 4.0 application from the dairy industry, the paper shows that CT-based Industry 4.0 applications can be developed with approximately 60% of the cost of IoT platform-based application development.",

    "abstract": "In the search for increased productivity and efficiency in the industrial sector, a new industrial revolution, called Industry 4.0, was promoted. In the electric sector, power plants seek to adapt these new concepts to optimize electric power generation processes, as well as to reduce operating costs and unscheduled downtime intervals. In these plants, PID control strategies are commonly used in water cooling systems, which use fans to perform the thermal exchange between water and the ambient air. However, as the nonlinearities of these systems affect the performance of the drivers, sometimes a greater number of fans than necessary are activated to ensure water temperature control which, consequently, increases energy expenditure. In this work, our objective is to develop digital twins for a water cooling system with auxiliary equipment, in terms of the decision making of the operator, to determine the correct number of fans. This model was developed based on the algorithm of automatic extraction of fuzzy rules, derived from the SCADA of a power plant located in the capital of Para\u00edba, Brazil. The digital twins can update the fuzzy rules in the case of new events, such as steady-state operation, starting and stopping ramps, and instability. The results from experimental tests using data from 11 h of plant operations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed digital twin model. Furthermore, in all scenarios, the average percentage error was less than 5% and the average absolute temperature error was below 3 \u00b0C.",

    "abstract": "Although vitamin D is related to cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength, there is no evidence in the literature about the genetic influence of the response to vitamin D supplementation and improvements in these parameters. Therefore, we evaluate the effect of longitudinal supplementation of vitamin D on parameters of physical fitness in monozygotic twins. In total, 74 participants were included, with a mean age of 25\u00a0years, divided into two groups, one group received supplementation with cholecalciferol for 60\u00a0days and the other group did not. Cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength were measured before and after supplementation through maximal treadmill tests and dynamometry, respectively. Wilcoxon tests were used to compare intragroup results and the Mann-Whitney test to examine intergroup differences. There was an increase in the serum concentration of vitamin D in participants who ingested the supplementation. Cardiorespiratory fitness improved after supplementation through increases in the values of maximum oxygen consumption of 28% (p < .001). Muscle strength in left hand grip increased 18% in participants who received the supplement (p = .007). Sixty days of cholecalciferol supplementation improved cardiorespiratory fitness and upper limb muscle strength.",

    "abstract": "Tic spectrum disorder (TSD) is an umbrella term which includes Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) and chronic tic disorder (CTD). They are considered highly heritable, yet the genetic components remain largely unknown. In this study we aimed to investigate disease-associated DNA methylation differences to identify genes and pathways which may be implicated in TSD aetiology. For this purpose, we performed an exploratory analysis of the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in whole blood samples of 16 monozygotic twin pairs, of which eight were discordant and six concordant for TSD, while two pairs were asymptomatic. Although no sites reached genome-wide significance, we identified several sites and regions with a suggestive significance, which were located within or in the vicinity of genes with biological functions associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all our lives, not only through the infection itself, but also through the measures taken to control the virus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spread (e.g., lockdown). Here we investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented lockdown affected the mental health of young adults in England and Wales. We compared the mental health symptoms of up to 4,000 twins in their mid-twenties in 2018 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (T1) to those in a four-wave longitudinal data collection during the pandemic in April, July, and October 2020, and in March 2021 (T2-T5). The average changes in mental health were small-to-medium and mainly occurred from 2018 (T1) to March 2020 (T2, one month following the start of lockdown; average Cohen d=0.14). Despite the expectation of catastrophic effects on the pandemic on mental health of our young adults, we did not observe trends in worsening mental health during the pandemic (T3-T5). Young people with pre-existing mental health problems were adversely affected at the beginning of the pandemic, but their increased problems largely subsided as the pandemic persisted. Twin analyses indicated that the aetiology of individual differences did not change during the lockdown. The average heritability of mental health symptoms was 33% across 5 waves of assessment, and the average genetic correlation between T1 and T2-T5 was .95, indicating that genetic effects before the pandemic (T1) are substantially correlated with genetic effects up to a year later (T2-T5). We conclude that on average the mental health of young adults in England and Wales has been remarkably resilient to the effects of the pandemic and associated lockdown.",

    "abstract": "Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have grown rapidly in recent years and are considered by both academia and industry to be key enablers for Industry 4.0. As a digital replica of a physical entity, the basis of DT is the infrastructure and data, the core is the algorithm and model, and the application is the software and service. The grounding of DT and AI in industrial sectors is even more dependent on the systematic and in-depth integration of domain-specific expertise. This survey comprehensively reviews over 300 manuscripts on AI-driven DT technologies of Industry 4.0 used over the past five years and summarizes their general developments and the current state of AI-integration in the fields of smart manufacturing and advanced robotics. These cover conventional sophisticated metal machining and industrial automation as well as emerging techniques, such as 3D printing and human-robot interaction/cooperation. Furthermore, advantages of AI-driven DTs in the context of sustainable development are elaborated. Practical challenges and development prospects of AI-driven DTs are discussed with a respective focus on different levels. A route for AI-integration in multiscale/fidelity DTs with multiscale/fidelity data sources in Industry 4.0 is outlined.",

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problem of the poor plasticity of magnesium alloy leading to serious edge cracks in the rolling process, this paper conducts a systematic study on the crack suppression mechanism of rolling under different thickness reductions. Using restricted rolling and conventional rolling, comparing the microstructure evolution of the plate after rolling, and combining the information of the simulated temperature field and stress field of the plates, the behavior of twins and dislocations under different thickness reductions is explained, and the influence of serious damage caused by single-pass hot rolling of magnesium alloy is explored. The compressive stress fields along with the transverse and normal directions under restricted rolling cause the compression twins to mature into secondary twins under rolling with small thickness reduction and induce a large number of tensile twins when the thickness reduction amount is increased. The multiple slips activated by the higher temperature field at the edge of the small thickness reduction amount cause dislocations to be distributed inside and outside the twins, while the edge with large thickness reduction can activate more slip due to the high-temperature field resulting from friction, resulting in the twin be destroyed.",

This review describes available aneuploidy screening options and their benefits and limitations in twin pregnancy, along with describing special circumstances, such as vanishing twins and diagnostic testing in twin pregnancy. No method of aneuploidy screening is as accurate in twin pregnancies as singleton pregnancies. Cell-free DNA screening should be considered a first-line approach; however, this option may not be available or may have limitations in certain clinical scenarios, such as vanishing twins. If cell-free DNA screening is not available, nuchal translucency and/or maternal serum marker screening can be offered.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare and serious complication of monochorionic twins. The total incidence is 1.5 per 100,000 births, and about 50% are liveborn. Prenatal screening and diagnosis of conjoined twins is usually performed by ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assist in the diagnosis if necessary. Conjoined twins in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy are extremely rare.\nWe reported three cases of dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy with conjoined twins. Due to the poor prognosis of conjoined twins evaluated by multidisciplinary teams, selective termination of conjoined twins was performed in three cases. In case 1, selective reduction of the conjoined twins was performed at 16 gestational weeks, and a healthy female baby weighing 3270\u2009g was delivered at 37\u2009weeks. In case 2, the conjoined twins were selectively terminated at 17\u2009weeks of gestation, and a healthy female baby weighing 2760\u2009g was delivered at 37\u2009weeks and 4\u2009days. In case 3, the conjoined twins were selectively terminated at 15\u2009weeks and 2\u2009days, and a healthy female baby weighing 2450\u2009g was delivered at 33\u2009weeks and 6\u2009days. The babies of all three cases were followed up and are in good health.\nSurgical separation is the only treatment for conjoined twins after birth. Early determination of chorionicity and antenatal diagnosis of conjoined twins in triplet gestations are critical for individualized management options and the prognosis of normal triplets. Expecting parents should be extensively counseled by multidisciplinary teams. If there are limitations in successful separation after birth, early selective termination of the conjoined twins by intrathoracic injection of potassium chloride may be a procedure in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy to improve perinatal outcomes of the normal triplet.",

    "abstract": "A 3-month-old first of dizygotic male twins, born at 34\u00a0+ 5 weeks gestational age, presented with a 4-week history of increasing head circumference and vomiting. He had a tense anterior fontanelle and a head circumference above the 97th percentile. Magnetic resonance imaging showed large bilateral subdural collection with hemosiderin deposits suggestive of hemorrhage. Nine days of bilateral subdural drainage reduced the collection size and blood load. On postoperative day 16, magnetic resonance imaging confirmed persistent but smaller subdural collections, unmasking the underlying subarachnoid space enlargement. On day 18, a right subdural-peritoneal valveless shunt was inserted as definitive treatment. As part of a nonaccidental injury investigation, Twin 2 was also found to have macrocephaly secondary to benign enlargement of subarachnoid space, which was managed conservatively. Benign enlargement of subarachnoid space has an assumed autosomal/multifactorial inheritance and predisposes to subdural hemorrhage. Ultimately, no safeguarding issues were raised. Both twins continued to be neurologically stable at 2-year follow-up with head circumferences between the 98th and 99th percentiles.",

This case report describes a case of 30-year-old monozygotic adult twin brothers diagnosed with nonmosaic Klinefelter syndrome following the complaint of infertility. The result of semen analysis showed cryptozoospermia (very low sperm count) and azoospermia (zero sperm count) with physical findings and lifestyles being very similar. They both underwent microtesticular sperm extraction. One had successful sperm retrieval and achieved pregnancy through intracytoplasmic sperm injection, whereas the other did not. Testicular pathological findings showed Sertoli cell-only syndrome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on monozygotic adult twins both of whom underwent microtesticular sperm extraction and resulted in different outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To compare maternal and neonatal outcomes after preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) from 23 to 34 weeks of gestation in twin compared with singleton gestations.\nWe conducted a secondary analysis of an obstetric cohort of 115,502 individuals and their singleton or twin neonates born in 25 hospitals nationwide (2008-2011). Those with preterm PROM from 23 0/7 through 33 6/7 weeks of gestation were included; neonates with major fetal anomalies were excluded. The coprimary outcomes for this analysis were composite maternal morbidity (chorioamnionitis, blood transfusion, postpartum endometritis, wound infection, sepsis, venous thromboembolism, intensive care unit admission, or death) and composite major neonatal morbidity (persistent pulmonary hypertension, intraventricular hemorrhage grade III or IV, seizures, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, necrotizing enterocolitis stage II or III, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, stillbirth subsequent to admission, or neonatal death before discharge). Logistic regression was used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for twin compared with singleton gestations.\nOf 1,531 (1.3%) individuals who met eligibility criteria for this analysis, 218 (14.2%) had twin gestations. The median gestational age at preterm PROM was similar between those with twins and singletons (31.2 weeks [interquartile range 27.4-32.9] vs 30.6 weeks [interquartile range 26.9-32.7], P=.23); however, those with twin gestations had a shorter median latency period (2.0 days [interquartile range 1.0-5.0] vs 3.0 days [interquartile range 2.0-8.0], P<.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, odds of experiencing composite maternal morbidity (17.9% vs 19.3%, adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66-1.42) or composite neonatal morbidity (20.4% vs 20.5%, OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72-1.31) did not differ between groups.\nIn a large, diverse cohort, the likelihood of composite maternal or neonatal morbidity per fetus after preterm PROM was similar for twin and singleton gestations.",

The data were analysed from facial 3D images and manually added landmarks. 3D images were analysed by Rapidform2006 software and statistical analyses were done by using the R software environment version 4.1.0.\nThe contralateral effect of PCS and larger chin side was dominant among right and non-right side chewing twins. Being female increased the whole face symmetry.\nThe volume of the chin becomes larger on the side opposite to the twins' habitual chewing side.

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness that involves both genetic and environmental factors. Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is a well-established therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. In this study, we focused on a set of monozygotic twins with treatment-resistant schizophrenia in which one twin effectively responded to clozapine treatment and the other did not. Our previous study generated neurons from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from these patients and compared the transcriptome profiles between mock- and clozapine-treated neurons. In this study, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling to investigate the mechanisms underlying gene expression changes. First, we extracted the differentially methylated sites from each twin based on statistical analysis. Then, we combined the DNA methylation profiling with transcriptome profiling from our previous RNA-seq data. Among the genes with altered methylation and expression, we found the different proportions of the genes related to neuronal and synaptic functions between the clozapine responder and non-responder (35.7 and 6.7%, respectively). This trend was observed even when the basal differences between the responder and non-responder was excluded. These results suggest that effective clozapine action may correct the abnormalities of neuronal and synapse functions in schizophrenia via changes in methylation.",

    "abstract": "The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of several muscular components that act in a coordinated manner to control airflow through the nose and mouth. Proper velopharyngeal function is essential for normal speech, swallowing, and breathing. The genetic basis of normal-range velopharyngeal morphology is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to estimate the heritability of velopharyngeal dimensions. We measured five velopharyngeal variables (velar length, velar thickness, effective velar length, levator muscle length and pharyngeal depth) from MRIs of 155 monozygotic and 208 dizygotic twin pairs and then calculated heritability for these traits using a structural equation modeling approach. The heritability estimates were statistically significant (95% confidence intervals excluded zero) and ranged from 0.19 to 0.46. There was also evidence of significant genetic correlations between pairs of traits, pointing to the influence of common genetic effects. These results indicate that genetic factors influence variation in clinically relevant velopharyngeal structures.",

    "abstract": "Olmsted syndrome is a rare and complex skin disorder affecting 46 (published) infants as of 2012. The infants affected in this case were born premature at 28 weeks' gestation. Infants affected by this syndrome demonstrate numerous plaques on several specific areas of the skin. Common treatments include exfoliation in addition to psoriasis treatments. The extremely fragile nature of the premature infants' skin complicates treatment modalities.\nThe progression of the infants' dermatologic findings and plaque formation is discussed in this case study.\nThe primary diagnosis of Olmsted syndrome was made with the assistance of a multidisciplinary team to work through several differential diagnoses presenting with severe forms of palmoplantar keratoderma.\nThe management of skin plaques in twin premature infants is presented in this case study. An evidence-based approach, utilizing the model of family-centered care, is presented with multidisciplinary involvement and an outline of the specific plan of care for the extensive skin care regimen used.\nAn interdisciplinary skin care regimen was created to provide consistency in transition from hospital to home. Using a consistent approach, the plaques were able to be softened and many removed. Continual maintenance is required to manage continual buildup of skin plaques.\nPremature infants are at increased risk for infection due to the immaturity of their skin. The complexity of their skin complicates the ability to recognize and care for rare skin disorders. This case study illuminates the practicality of a consistent and evidence-based approach to a complex and rare skin disorder.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins and higher-order multiples arise when a zygote splits during pre-implantation stages of development. The mechanisms underpinning this event have remained a mystery. Because MZ twinning rarely runs in families, the leading hypothesis is that it occurs at random. Here, we show that MZ twinning is strongly associated with a stable DNA methylation signature in adult somatic tissues. This signature spans regions near telomeres and centromeres, Polycomb-repressed regions and heterochromatin, genes involved in cell-adhesion, WNT signaling, cell fate, and putative human metastable epialleles. Our study also demonstrates a never-anticipated corollary: because identical twins keep a lifelong molecular signature, we can retrospectively diagnose if a person was conceived as monozygotic twin.",

    "abstract": "The acceleration of the epigenetic clock has been associated with a reduction in life expectancy. Individuals diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder have a reduction in life expectancy, and some studies have correlated it with accelerated aging.\nThe present study aims to explore whether the presence of any psychiatric disorder could accelerate the epigenetic clock in monozygotic twins.\nA total of 15 pairs of monozygotic twins were included. Epigenetic age in peripheral blood cells was estimated by previously published algorithms, using the 450K Beadchip microarray.\nWe found that in twins with a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, the epigenetic clock could increase compared to their twin without a psychiatric disorder.\nThe presence of some psychiatric disorder could accelerate the epigenetic clock in homozygous twins, but studies with larger samples are required to clarify this relationship.",

    "abstract": "The purposes are to explore the effect of Digital Twins (DTs) in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) on providing medical resources quickly and accurately during COVID-19 prevention and control. The feasibility of UAV DTs during COVID-19 prevention and control is analyzed. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are introduced. A UAV DTs information forecasting model is constructed based on improved AlexNet, whose performance is analyzed through simulation experiments. As end-users and task proportion increase, the proposed model can provide smaller transmission delays, lesser energy consumption in throughput demand, shorter task completion time, and higher resource utilization rate under reduced transmission power than other state-of-art models. Regarding forecasting accuracy, the proposed model can provide smaller errors and better accuracy in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), bit quantizer, number of pilots, pilot pollution coefficient, and number of different antennas. Specifically, its forecasting accuracy reaches 95.58% and forecasting velocity stabilizes at about 35 Frames-Per-Second (FPS). Hence, the proposed model has stronger robustness, making more accurate forecasts while minimizing the data transmission errors. The research results can reference the precise input of medical resources for COVID-19 prevention and control.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to comprehensively assess fetal hemodynamic adaptions to occlusive procedures. Twin pregnancies complicated with acardiac twin and hydrops fetalis of the pump twin were recruited. The occlusive procedures - either alcoholization, radiofrequency ablation, coil embolization or occlusive glue - were performed under ultrasound guidance. Various hemodynamic parameters were assessed before, shortly after, then every 6 h for 48 h and 2-4 weeks after the procedures. Seven pregnancies were recruited. The median (range) gestational age of intervention was 21 (17-26) weeks of gestation. Before the procedures, all cases showed normal cardiac function. Just after the procedures, all cases showed an increase in Tei index and isovolumic relaxation time but returned to preocclusion levels within 6-48 h, except for two cases that were persistently high. Increased preload and poor shortening fraction were observed in two cases, leading to heart failure, with one recovery and one death in\u00a0utero. Five out of the seven cases got through the critical period with a gradual return to normal hemodynamics, ending with the disappearance of hydrops and successful outcomes. It was concluded that the occlusive procedure could aggravate the overworked heart, leading to heart failure. Preocclusion preload index and Tei index may predict risk of heart failure due to the occlusion. This small series strongly suggests that the occlusion should be performed before the deterioration of cardiac function.",

    "abstract": "Over the past year, there has been a rise in twin births. The current scientific consensus recommended breast-feed milk for all newborns for at least 6 months. They stated that it is possible to meet the nutritional needs of two or more newborns with only one mother's milk. More information would be desirable about the factors that influence or lead to the initiation and interruption of breastfeeding. The quality of the evidence available from multiple studies has been inconclusive and therefore led to controversial interpretations and practices.\nThe first aim of this study was to analyze the extent of the feeding of multiples with breast milk in the experience of our clinical unit in terms of incidence and duration. The second objective was to evaluate the correlation between maternal, perinatal and neonatal variables with breast milk feeding rates and duration.\nThe study was conducted between 2015 and 2020, in a NICU in Southern Italy (San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia). Sixty-one women who have given birth to multiples were enrolled into the study. Newborn data were retrospectively collected by informatic database and breastfeeding information were collected by a questionnaire.\nIn our centre, the percentage of twins out of the total number of births over the years has almost doubled from 1.28% in 2015 to 2.48% in 2020 and the 88% of twins are premature. 18.1% received breast milk for more than 6 months and 6.3% received it for more than 12 months. Infants of lower gestational age and weight, born to multiparous, more mature and medium-high schooling mothers received breast milk for a longer period. 35% of women explained that the interruption of breastfeeding was due to the insufficient milk production and 41% to the stress and difficulties in managing the twins. Qualitative analysis of maternal narrative revealed, for many of them, the awareness of the importance of breastfeeding and the efforts made to try to give breast milk, but also fears about the quantity of milk and satiety of their children.\nIt is important to identify the factors both favoring and obstructing maternal milk feeding of multiples and it would be desirable the activation of a network of training and support for mothers after discharge, with particular regard to the categories found to be less inclined.",

    "abstract": "There is a lack of consensus about the management of twins with significant cervical length (CL) shortening, especially if CL is above 25\u2009mm. Therefore, it is important to define \"abnormal\" CL change over time, and to compare the performance of different strategies. The aim of this study was twofold, to describe the performance of the cervical shortening and that of an integrated strategy that includes both the cervical shortening and a fixed CL cutoff <25\u2009mm in any measurement as predictor of spontaneous PTB (sPTB) < 34\u2009weeks in uncomplicated twin pregnancies.\nRetrospective cohort study of twins followed in our Twins Clinic at Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires from 2013 to 2017. Inclusion criteria were dichorionic or monochorionic diamniotic twins with CL measurement between 18 and 33\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks with available data of the delivery. Exclusion criteria included any of the following complications: iatrogenic preterm delivery <34\u2009weeks, cerclage, fetal growth restriction, fetal death, structural anomalies, polyhydramnios, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, selective fetal growth restriction, twin anemia-polycythemia sequence, and twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence. Spontaneous preterm birth was defined as spontaneous delivery <34\u2009weeks. Cervical shortening was analyzed in the following periods: 20-24\u2009weeks, 20-28\u2009weeks, 24-28\u2009weeks, 24-32\u2009weeks and 28-32\u2009weeks. Cervical changes were analyzed as \nWe included 378 patients and 1417 measurements, 284 (75%) dichorionic and 94 (25%) monochorionic. Between 20 and 28\u2009weeks, with a change in CL cutoff = 1.6\u2009mm/week or 4.1%/week the detection rate was 54.2% (32.8-74.4%) and the specificity 80.5% (75.1-85.1%) and 83.5% (78.5-87.8%) respectively. In the integrated strategy, the detection rate was 65.7% (47.8-80.9%) and the specificity 69 (63.7-74). All the ROC curves of the periods studied showed an AUC < 0.7. In the group of patients that delivered preterm the initial mean CL was shorter than in the term group, 39 (\u00b112) mm vs. 43 (\u00b1 7.7) mm (\nThe performance of all the strategies analyzed as a predictor of sPTB <34\u2009weeks was moderate. The period 20-28\u2009weeks detected half of the patients at risk with a FPR around 10-20% and the integrated strategy increased the sensitivity up to a detection of two thirds of the patients at risk but with a FPR of \u223c30%. Future analyses need to explore other strategies to improve the performance and to really identify the patients at higher risk.",

    "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is considered a rare malignant head and neck tumour. However, the importance of genetics and environmental factors in the epidemiology of NPC is still unclear. Twins represent an excellent study population for genetic epidemiology; this is especially true of monozygotic-type twins because they are genetically identical. The difference in cancer occurrence between monozygotic twins is typically interpreted as a result of possible environmental factors.\nWe present the first case report of monozygotic twins with NPC. The twins' significant features are homogenous presentation, tumour location (both left-sided) and identical histology; therefore, the prognoses may be similar. Environmental factors could not be addressed in these twins because they shared the same background, and at the same time, they had no potential known contributing factors.\nHaving one of the twins affected is a strong and easily recognisable risk factor for developing NPC in the other. This strong association suggests the need for regular screening of the second twin for early diagnosis of NPC.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to compare the rate of preterm birth (PTB) and growth from birth to 18 years between twins conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) and twins conceived by spontaneous conception (SC) in mainland China. The retrospective cohort study included 1164 twins resulting from IVF and 25,654 twins conceived spontaneously, of which 494 from IVF and 6338 from SC were opposite-sex twins. PTB and low birth weight (LBW), and growth, including length/height and weight, were compared between the two groups at five stages: infancy (0 year), toddler period (1-2 years), preschool (3-5 years), primary or elementary school (6-11 years), and adolescence (10-18 years). Few statistically significant differences were found for LBW and growth between the two groups after adjusting for PTB and other confounders. Twins born by IVF faced an increased risk of PTB compared with those born by SC (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 8.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] [3.19, 21.13], p < .001 in all twins and aOR 10.12, 95% CI [2.32, 44.04], p = .002 in opposite-sex twins). Twins born by IVF experienced a similar growth at five stages (0-18 years old) when compared with those born by SC. PTB risk, however, is significantly higher for twins conceived by IVF than those conceived by SC.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart defects (CHDs) refer to abnormalities in the heart function that arise at the fetal stages. It is the most common birth defect that affects 0.8% of all liveborn infants. There is an increase in the incidence of congenital heart disease in monochorionic twin gestation. A six-fold increase in CHDs exists among monochorionic twins especially in association with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) compared to dichorionic twin pregnancy. In this review article, we discussed the epidemiology, the role of genetics like protein-coding genes, epigenetics, placenta, hemodynamics and environmental factors in the etiology of CHD in twins. We conducted a literature search in PubMed indexed journals using the medical terms \"twin pregnancy\" and \"congenital heart defect\" to provide an overview of the uptrend in CHD in twin pregnancies, primarily due to assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) and\u00a0multiple other factors. Both the heart and placenta are vascular and share a common development window; therefore, CHD can develop secondary to placental pathologies. Among environmental factors, the strongest association of maternal smoking with CHD has been seen. We studied the causative factors to suggest\u00a0improvement in echocardiographic skills in case of abnormal findings in twin gestations to decrease the CHD-associated morbidity and mortality, as early diagnosis allows doctors to precisely determine the risk of CHD. Systemic ultrasound scanning with five transverse views is very effective in diagnosing fetal CHD in twin pregnancy. In the case of genetics, prenatal counseling allows\u00a0the expectant to understand the full ramifications of possible events after the pregnancy. The pathological basis of malformations specific to\u00a0conjoined twinning and twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence is addressed. Also, there is evidence that folate supplementation may be protective against CHD but more research is needed to clarify the mechanisms. We concluded from the literature that monochorionic twins are at high risk of CHD.\u00a0Chorionicity seems to play a more vital role than zygosity. Even the type of heart defect in monochorial twin pregnancies was unique from single, dizygotic, or dichorionic twin pregnancies. We also emphasize improving echocardiographic skills of technicians in referring ART dichorionic twin fetuses with suspicious findings to fetal cardiologists and performing postnatal scans in the case of TTTS. To understand the role of the placenta, making use of newer technologies and examining the placenta both during pregnancy and beyond delivery will play a vital role in understanding the etiology. Even identifying early signals impacting the heart and placental vasculature and correcting them using advanced technology could downtrend the incidence in coming years. Increased maternal age\u00a0as well as multiple pregnancies increasing the risk of CHD has also been implicated. For more clarity on the role of genetics, the cost of DNA sequencing needs to decrease. This will enable whole-genome sequencing in the future thus\u00a0helping to discover the gene responsible for CHD ultimately proving beneficial for future generations. For environmental factors, we have to rely on observational studies to assess the risk to the unborn child. There is difficulty in studying\u00a0natural factors due to the unreliability of exposure to contaminants like pesticides and air pollution.",

    "abstract": "Large cupping of the optic disk in a baby or a child can be indicative of primary congenital glaucoma. Primary congenital glaucoma is often refractory to treatment, and lifelong management and follow-up are necessary; therefore, diagnosis requires careful consideration. In this study, we describe the case of twins in whom primary congenital glaucoma was initially suspected due to large cupping of the optic disks. Twin babies\u00a0(a boy and a girl weighing\u00a0455 g and\u00a0592 g respectively), born prematurely (at 28 gestational weeks), were referred to our hospital eight months after birth because large cupping of the optic disks was detected during follow-up for retinopathy of prematurity. According to color fundus photographs, the cup/disk ratios in both eyes of both babies ranged from 0.75 to 0.86. However, the axial length ranged from 18.57 to 19.91\u00a0mm, the anterior chamber depth ranged from 2.68 to 2.93 mm, and the horizontal diameters of the corneas, which were clear, ranged from 10 to 10.5\u00a0mm. The intraocular pressures (IOPs), as measured by a rebound tonometer, were 15.3-19.7 mmHg. Glaucoma was strongly suspected due to the large cupping of the optics disks; however, other ocular biometric tests demonstrated that the eyes were normal. After eight months of follow-up without any medication or intervention, the IOPs stabilized between 6-22.1 mmHg, the refractive errors were between -2.5 and 0 diopters, and we found no apparent enlargement of the optic disks. In addition, we investigated both parents' optic disks to evaluate the genetic factors and found that they had relatively large C/D ratios (0.68-0.79). These premature twins exhibited glaucoma-like optic disks with large cupping, but no solid glaucomatous changes were observed with ocular biometry and IOP testing. We concluded, therefore, that the early birth and lower birth weights may have been associated with the large cupping of the patients' optic disks. To differentiate between normal physiological cupping and primary congenital glaucoma, ocular morphological examination of the eye, IOP measurements, and investigation of the parents' optic disks were useful.",

    "abstract": "Comparing twins from same- and opposite-sex pairs can provide information on potential sex differences in a variety of outcomes, including socioeconomic-related outcomes such as educational attainment. It has been suggested that this design can be applied to examine the putative role of intrauterine exposure to testosterone for educational attainment, but the evidence is still disputed. Thus, we established an international database of twin data from 11 countries with 88,290 individual dizygotic twins born over 100\u00a0years and tested for differences between twins from same- and opposite-sex dizygotic pairs in educational attainment. Effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by linear regression models after adjusting for birth year and twin study cohort. In contrast to the hypothesis, no difference was found in women (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.05 educational years, 95% CI -0.11, 0.02). However, men with a same-sex co-twin were slightly more educated than men having an opposite-sex co-twin (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.14 educational years, 95% CI 0.07, 0.21). No consistent differences in effect sizes were found between individual twin study cohorts representing Europe, the USA, and Australia or over the cohorts born during the 20th century, during which period the sex differences in education reversed favoring women in the latest birth cohorts. Further, no interaction was found with maternal or paternal education. Our results contradict the hypothesis that there would be differences in the intrauterine testosterone levels between same-sex and opposite-sex female twins affecting education. Our findings in men may point to social dynamics within same-sex twin pairs that may benefit men in their educational careers.",

    "abstract": "The multifactorial nature of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has led to increased efforts in establishing various risk factors. Well-known environmental risk factors for HNSCC include tobacco use, heavy alcohol consumption, immunosuppression, and more recently human papillomavirus infection. Familial clustering has been observed in cancers occurring at other sites, but not so much with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) without exposure to shared environmental risk factors. An unusual case of identical twins who presented with OSCC involving an identical site and exhibiting similar histological features is reported here. The two patients underwent identical surgery with curative intent, culminating in good outcomes. It appears that no other cases of identical twins with a similar presentation in time, anatomical site, and histopathology have been reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to evaluate the perinatal outcome of selective termination of dichorionic twin pregnancies with discordant anomalies, according to gestational age at time of procedure.\nRetrospective review of 147 dichorionic twin pregnancies referred to our Fetal Medicine Unit between 2003 and 2018 for selective termination. Gestational age at delivery, fetal loss, and overall and 28-day post-delivery survival rates, were evaluated according to gestational age at time of procedure. Selective termination procedure was defined as early, intermediate, and late when performed before 18\u00a0weeks, between 18 and 23\u00a0weeks, and after 23\u00a0weeks, respectively. Kruskal-Wallis and chi-squared test were used to compare groups.\nOverall survival at 28\u00a0days post-delivery, pregnancy loss, and preterm delivery before 32\u00a0weeks of gestation rates were 93.4%, 6.9%, and 15.5%, respectively. When stratified by gestational age at procedure, intermediate selective termination was associated with a lower survival rate than early and late procedures (86% vs. 96.9% and 100%, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.035), and a nonsignificant trend for higher pregnancy loss (12% vs. 3.1%). Preterm delivery before 32\u00a0weeks of gestation occurred in 27% of late procedures, which was significantly higher than in early (9.5%) and intermediate (18.2%) procedures.\nSelective termination in dichorionic twin pregnancies with discordant fetal anomaly is associated with low pregnancy loss and preterm delivery rate, primarily when performed before 18\u00a0weeks. When legally possible, late procedures can be a good alternative, particularly in those cases diagnosed beyond the 18th week of gestation.",

The mean gestational age at delivery was 33.48\u00a0weeks for reduced twins, 34.52\u00a0weeks for primary twins (P\u00a0=\u00a00.10) and 38.14\u00a0weeks for singletons (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Compared with primary twins, the adjusted odds of preterm delivery before 34\u00a0weeks and before 36\u00a0weeks for reduced twins were 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48-3.54, P\u00a0=\u00a00.62) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.78-8.85, P\u00a0=\u00a00.08), respectively. There was no significant difference in rates of pre-eclampsia, Cesarean delivery, birth weight below the 10th and 3rd centiles, and perinatal mortality among primary and reduced twins. All risks were significantly lower in singleton pregnancies.\nReduced twins have similar obstetric and perinatal outcomes as primary twins, but adverse outcomes are significantly higher in both groups when compared with singleton pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases that have in common the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (mucopolysaccharides) within the lysosome. The diseases are caused by a deficiency of the enzyme \u03b1-L-iduronidase which is responsible for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs or mucopolysaccharides). More than 100 mutations in the gene have been reported, resulting in marked clinical/response variability. MPSs usually present as multisystem and progressive clinical disorders which affect psychomotor and cardiovascular development, the cornea and the musculoskeletal system. Seven phenotypically distinct diseases have been described, and MPS type I (MPS-I) is divided into three clinical forms: severe (Hurler syndrome), intermediate (Hurler-Scheie syndrome) or mild (Scheie syndrome). For the treatment of MPS-I, Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) with \u03b1-L-iduronidase and Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation (HSCT), separately or in combination, have produced clinical improvement, especially with regards cardiovascular symptoms and psychomotor development. This article presents the long-term (more than seven years) follow-up of monochorionic, diamniotic twins who were diagnosed with MPS-I at an early stage, and treated with ERT (from age 10 months) plus HSCT (from age 18 months). Overall, the treatment has facilitated stable development with an overall good response and better control of symptoms associated with MPS-I.",

Studies of twins' gut microbiota found that gut microbiota composition and diversity tend to be mature and stable with increasing postnatal age (PNA). Preterm infant gut microbiome shifts dramatically when they were staying in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Compositions and shifting characteristics of gut microbiota among neonatal preterm twins and triplets during their early life are still unknown, which impedes a better understanding of the mechanism underpinning neurobehavioral development and precise intervention/health of preterm neonates.

    "abstract": "The data produced by sensors of IoT devices are becoming keystones for organizations to conduct critical decision-making processes. However, delivering information to these processes in real-time represents two challenges for the organizations: the first one is achieving a constant dataflow from IoT to the cloud and the second one is enabling decision-making processes to retrieve data from dataflows in real-time. This paper presents a cloud-based Web of Things method for creating digital twins of IoT devices (named ",

Digital twins are increasingly used today in different industry sectors. Applied to medicine and public health, digital twin technology can drive a much-needed radical transformation of traditional electronic health/medical records (focusing on individuals) and their aggregates (covering populations) to make them ready for a new era of precision (and accuracy) medicine and public health. Digital twins enable learning and discovering new knowledge, new hypothesis generation and testing, and ",

    "abstract": "Epigenetics is a mechanism underlying cardiovascular disease. It is unknown whether DNA hydroxymethylation is prospectively associated with the risk for cardiovascular death independent of germline and common environment. Male twin pairs middle-aged in 1969-1973 and discordant for cardiovascular death through December 31, 2014, were included. Hydroxymethylation was quantified in buffy coat DNA collected in 1986-1987. The 1893 differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) were identified after controlling for blood leukocyte subtypes and age among 12 monozygotic (MZ) pairs (Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate < 0.01), of which the 102 DhMRs were confirmed with directionally consistent log",

    "abstract": "Personalized models of cardiac electrophysiology (EP) that match clinical observation with high fidelity, referred to as cardiac digital twins (CDTs), show promise as a tool for tailoring cardiac precision therapies. Building CDTs of cardiac EP relies on the ability of models to replicate the ventricular activation sequence under a broad range of conditions. Of pivotal importance is the His-Purkinje system (HPS) within the ventricles. Workflows for the generation and incorporation of HPS models are needed for use in cardiac digital twinning pipelines that aim to minimize the misfit between model predictions and clinical data such as the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG). We thus develop an automated two stage approach for HPS personalization. A fascicular-based model is first introduced that modulates the endocardial Purkinje network. Only emergent features of sites of earliest activation within the ventricular myocardium and a fast-conducting sub-endocardial layer are accounted for. It is then replaced by a topologically realistic Purkinje-based representation of the HPS. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated. Equivalence between both HPS model representations is investigated by comparing activation patterns and 12 lead ECGs under both sinus rhythm and right-ventricular apical pacing. Predominant ECG morphology is preserved by both HPS models under sinus conditions, but elucidates differences during pacing.",

    "abstract": "Every reared-apart monozygotic (MZ) twin pair offers a fresh perspective on human developmental questions. This is true regardless of whether the co-twins were raised in the same country or across the globe. The members of two pairs of separated MZ female twins have recently come to attention. In one case the twins were raised by different families in Argentina; in the other case the twins were raised by different families in Sweden and Vietnam. The perceptions and perspectives of these twins are insightful. The twin research section that follows begins with a tribute to our late esteemed colleague, Dr Isaac Blickstein (1953-2020). Research concerning the infanticide and sacrifice of Archaic-aged twins and triplets and prehistoric twin burials is reviewed next. Highlights from a conference focused on the 2018 film Three Identical Strangers are also included in this portion. The final section of this article includes media reports of an atypical twin father, an actor's twin brother, a twin link to the 1921 Tulsa, Oklahoma massacre, the birth of superfetated twins, twin comedians and script writers and Indian twins' tragic loss to COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "A presumably rare, but naturally occurring twinning event is heteropaternal (HP) twinning. HP twinning results from superfecundation, a reproductive process in which offspring share their mothers, but not their fathers. The resulting twins share an average of 25% of their segregating genes, the same proportion as half-siblings. A recently identified case of HP opposite-sex twins was confirmed by DNA analyses available for the twins and for multiple family members. Thus, an exceptional feature of the current report is the inclusion of data for the twins' brothers, sisters, half-siblings, nieces, nephews and cousins, as well as several parent-child pairs. HP twins often go unnoticed so are typically classified as dizygotic (DZ) twins whose genetic overlap is 50%, on average, but varies across traits. As a unique category of non-identical twins, HP twinning is important to acknowledge as it may affect twins' physical resemblance, behavioral similarity, personal identity, family relations and health concerns. While including HP pairs in twin research has been shown to have minimal impact on heritability estimates, it could conceivably affect the outcomes of small-scale studies. Given a lack of consistent and known prevalence, case studies provide valuable knowledge regarding the occurrence of HP twinning. Its implications for forensic science and for twin research are considerable.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a biological process linked to specific patterns and changes in the epigenome. We hypothesize that age-related variation in the DNA methylome could reflect cumulative environmental modulation to the epigenome which could impact epigenomic instability and survival differentially by sex. To test the hypothesis, we performed sex-stratified epigenome-wide association studies on age-related intra-pair DNA methylation discordance in 492 twins aged 56-80\u00a0years. We identified 3084 CpGs showing increased methylation variability with age (FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05, 7 CpGs with p\u00a0<\u00a01e-07) in male twins but no significant site found in female twins. The results were replicated in an independent cohort of 292 twins aged 30-74\u00a0years with 37% of the discovery CpGs successfully replicated in male twins. Functional annotation showed that genes linked to the identified CpGs were significantly enriched in signaling pathways, neurological functions, extracellular matrix assembly, and cancer. We further explored the implication of discovery CpGs on individual survival in an old cohort of 224 twins (220 deceased). In total, 264 CpGs displayed significant association with risk of death in male twins. In female twins, 175 of the male discovery CpGs also showed non-random correlation with mortality. Intra-pair comparison showed that majority of the discovery CpGs have higher methylation in the longer-lived twins suggesting that loss of DNA methylation during aging contributes to increased risk of death which is more pronounced in male twins. In conclusion, age-related epigenomic instability in the DNA methylome is more evident in males than in females and could impact individual survival and contribute to sex difference in human lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Although the pathophysiology of cognitive decline is multifactorial, and modifiable by lifestyle, the evidence for the role of diet on cognitive function is still accumulating, particularly the potentially preventive role of constituents of plant-based foods.\nWe aimed to determine whether higher habitual intake of dietary flavonoids, key components of plant-based diets, were associated with improved cognition and medial temporal lobe volumes using three complementary approaches (longitudinal, cross-sectional and co-twin analyses). In 1126 female twins (n=224 with a 10-year follow-up of diet and cognition data) aged 18-89 years, habitual intakes of total flavonoids and seven subclasses (flavanones, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, flavones, polymeric flavonoids (and proanthocyanidins separately)) were calculated using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cognition was assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery test. Hippocampal volumes were measured in a subset using magnetic resonance imaging (16 monozygotic-twin pairs). Statistical models were adjusted for a range of diet and lifestyle factors.\nHigher intakes of flavanones (tertile (T)3-T1=0.45, 95%CI 0.13,0.77; p=0.01) and anthocyanins (T3-T1=0.45, 95%CI 0.08,0.81; p=0.02) were associated with improvements in age-related cognition score over 10 years. In cross-sectional analysis higher intake of flavanones (T3-T1= 0.12, 95% CI 0.02, 0.21; p=0.02) and proanthocyanidins (T3-T1= 0.13, 95% CI 0.02, 0.24; p=0.02) were associated with improved paired-associates learning. Higher intake of anthocyanins was significantly associated with improved executive function (T3-T1= -0.52, 95% CI 0.19, 0.84; p=0.001) and with faster simple reaction times (T3-T1= -18.1, 95% CI -35.4, -0.7; p=0.04). In co-twin analysis, those with higher anthocyanin (2.0%, p=0.01) and proanthocyanidin (2.0%, p=0.02) intakes at baseline had the largest left hippocampal volumes after 12 years.\nSmall increases in habitual intake of flavonoid-rich foods (containing anthocyanins, flavanones and proanthocyanidins; equivalent to approximately two servings of oranges and blueberries per day) over long time periods have the potential to attenuate cognitive ageing.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants in ARX lead to a variety of phenotypes with intellectual disability being a uniform feature. Other features can include severe epilepsy, spasticity, movement disorders, agenesis of the corpus callosum, lissencephaly, hydranencephaly and ambiguous genitalia in males. We present the first report of monozygotic female twins with a de novo ARX pathogenic variant (c.1406_1415del; p. Ala469Aspfs*20), predicted to result in a truncated ARX protein missing the important regulatory Aristaless domain. The twins presented with profound developmental delay and seizures, consistent with the known genotype-phenotype correlation. Twin 2's features were significantly more severe. She also developed chorea; the first time this movement disorder has been seen in an ARX variant other than an expansion of the first polyalanine tract. Differential X-chromosome inactivation was the most likely explanation for the differing severities but could not be conclusively proven.",

    "abstract": "Limited data exist about the potential developmental delays in appropriately grown twins; furthermore, twins may be at higher risk of developmental delay than singletons. Small-for-gestational age is a risk factor for developmental delay and is based on singleton birthweight references, which may misclassify small-for-gestational age in a subset of appropriately grown twins.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the risk of developmental delay in twins classified as small-for-gestational age according to the twin and singleton birthweight references (<10th percentile).\nIn a birth cohort (2008-2010) of twins (n=1790) and singletons (n=3829) where parents completed Ages & Stages Questionnaires for child development between 4 and 36 months, we used a US population-based birthweight reference to categorize singletons and twins as small-for-gestational age. Uncertain small-for-gestational age twins were defined as small-for-gestational age by a singleton reference (<10th percentile) and not by a twin reference, and twin-reference small-for-gestational age twins were defined as small-for-gestational age by a twin reference. Adjusted generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the odds of failure on any Ages & Stages Questionnaires domain and on each of the 5 domains (fine motor, gross motor, communication, personal-social, and problem-solving domains); random intercepts accounted for repeated measures and twin clustering.\nCompared with non-small-for-gestational age twins (>10th percentile), uncertain small-for-gestational age twins did not have higher odds of Ages & Stages Questionnaires failure (adjusted odds ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.80). Compared with non-small-for-gestational age singletons, both twin-reference and uncertain small-for-gestational age twins had higher odds of Ages & Stages Questionnaires failure, with the highest risk conferred to twin-reference small-for-gestational age twins (twin-reference adjusted odds ratio, 3.14 [95% confidence interval, 1.94-5.10]; uncertain adjusted odds ratio, 2.35 [95% confidence interval, 1.69-3.26]; P<.01 for trend). Results remained consistent when limiting analyses to term births (\u226537 weeks' gestation).\nAlthough a singleton reference may overestimate small-for-gestational age in twins, the findings indicated that a singleton birthweight reference may be appropriate for twins because it identifies more twins at risk of developmental delay than a twin reference.",

    "abstract": "Modern production systems can benefit greatly from integrated and up-to-date digital representations. Their applications range from consistency checks during the design phase to smart manufacturing to maintenance support. Such digital twins not only require data, information and knowledge as inputs but can also be considered integrated models themselves. This paper provides an overview of data, information and knowledge typically available throughout the lifecycle of production systems and the variety of applications driven by data analysis, expert knowledge and knowledge-based systems. On this basis, we describe the potential for combining data analysis and knowledge-based systems in the context of production systems and describe two feasibility studies that demonstrate how knowledge-based systems can be created using data analysis.

    "abstract": "Digital twins (DT) are emerging as an extremely promising paradigm for run-time modelling and performability prediction of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in various domains. Although several different definitions and industrial applications of DT exist, ranging from purely visual three-dimensional models to predictive maintenance tools, in this paper, we focus on data-driven evaluation and prediction of critical dependability attributes such as safety. To that end, we introduce a conceptual framework based on autonomic systems to host DT run-time models based on a structured and systematic approach. We argue that the convergence between DT and self-adaptation is the key to building smarter, resilient and trustworthy CPS that can self-monitor, self-diagnose and-ultimately-self-heal. The conceptual framework eases dependability assessment, which is essential for the certification of autonomous CPS operating with artificial intelligence and machine learning in critical applications.

The platform is based on the following approaches: group technology, adaptive and selective assembling, and digital twin of production systems and processes. The article presents a mechanism for constructing a unified manufacturing process, and results of an integrated multiscale simulation of an injection moulding process. The issues of ensuring identification and monitoring of objects of the industrial cyber-physical platform are considered. Specific service applications required to implement the smart product concept are discussed. The combination of the considered technologies is used to create digital twins of production system objects. All humans that have different roles in the product value stream can interact with the industrial cyber-physical platform at the three levels, receiving support in performing their tasks.

    "abstract": "A digital twin (DT) is classically defined as the virtual replica of a real-world product, system, being, communities, even cities that are continuously updated with data from its physical counterpart, as well as its environment. It bridges the virtual cyberspace with the physical entities and, as such, is considered to be the pillar of Industry 4.0 and the innovation backbone of the future. A DT is created and used throughout the whole life cycle of the entity it replicates, from cradle to grave, so to speak. This article focuses on the present state of the art of DTs, concentrating on the use of DTs in industry in the context of smart manufacturing, especially from the point of view of plantwide optimization. The main capabilities of DTs (mirroring, shadowing and threading) are discussed in this context. The article concludes with a perspective on the future.

    "abstract": "Parental criticism is correlated with internalising symptoms in adolescent offspring. This correlation could in part reflect their genetic relatedness, if the same genes influence behaviours in both parents and offspring. We use a Children-of-Twins design to assess whether parent-reported criticism and offspring internalising symptoms remain associated after controlling for shared genes. To aid interpretation of our results and those of previous Children-of-Twins studies, we examine statistical power for the detection of genetic effects and explore the direction of possible causal effects between generations.\nData were drawn from two Swedish twin samples, comprising 876 adult twin pairs with adolescent offspring and 1,030 adolescent twin pairs with parents. Parent reports of criticism towards their offspring were collected concurrently with parent and offspring reports of adolescent internalising symptoms. Children-of-Twins structural equation\u00a0models were used to control for genetic influence on the intergenerational association between parental criticism and adolescent internalising.\nParental criticism was associated with adolescent internalising symptoms after controlling for genetic influence. No significant role was found for shared genes influencing phenotypes in both generations, although power analyses suggested that some genetic effects may have gone undetected. Models could not distinguish directionality for nongenetic, causal effects between generations.\nParental criticism may be involved in psychosocial family processes in the context of adolescent internalising. Future studies should seek to identify these processes and provide clarity on the direction of potential causal effects.",

    "abstract": "Originated at heterogeneous interfaces with distinct coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), thermal mismatch stress is one of the critical influential factors to mechanical properties of metal matrix composites (MMCs). This stress is normally accommodated plastically by various defects, for example, high-density dislocations and twins in Al near heterogeneous interfaces in SiC/Al composites. Basic knowledge on the influence of defect characteristics is important but difficult to extrapolate from experimental results. However, existed theoretical models more focus on the influence of dislocation density, but less focus on defects variety, volume and distribution. In this paper, we propose a physics-based crystal plasticity model that has the capability of dealing with thermal mismatch stress induced dislocations and twins (denoted as TMDT model). The proposed TMDT model that is implemented in the Visco-Plastic Self-Consistent (VPSC) method considers defect heterogeneous distribution (gradient range), defect type (dislocations vs. twins) and defect volume fraction (twin spacing vs. twin volume). We demonstrate the validity and the capability of the VPSC-TMDT model in SiC/Al composites with thermal mismatch induced dislocations or twins. Furthermore, this model predicts the ultra-high strength of Graphene/Copper composites with high-density nanoscale twins, which is in turn the future aim for such nanocomposites.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are rare, and each set of conjoined twins has a unique conjoined anatomy. It is necessary to perform separation to increase the chance of patient survival. Tissue expansion is an advanced technique for providing sufficient soft tissue and skin for wound closure. We report the successful application of rapid tissue expansion in 10-month-old xipho-omphalopagus conjoined twins in Vietnam. A tissue expander was placed on the anterior body between the sternum and umbilicus with a baseline of 70 mL sterile saline (0.9% NaCl). The first injection into the tissue expander began on the 6th day after expander insertion, and injections continued every 2 days with approximately 30-70 mL per injection according to the expansion of the skin. The expander reached 335 mL after six injections and within 10 days. In order to prepare for surgical separation, expansion was completed on the 15th day after insertion. The expanded skin area was estimated to be 180 cm2, which was sufficient to cover both patients' skin deficiencies. The twins presented for surgical separation 6 days following the completion of tissue expansion. Both babies were discharged in good health 1 month after separation.",

    "abstract": "Axial alignment of the talar implant in total ankle arthroplasty remains a major issue, since the real axis of motion of each patient is impossible to determine with usual techniques. Further knowledge regarding individual axis of motion of the ankle is therefore needed.\nTherefore, digital twins, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technology were used to identify a real personalized motion axis of the tibiotalar joint. Three-dimensional (3D) models of distal extremities were generated using computed tomography data of normal patients. Digital twins were used to reproduce the mobility of the ankles, and the real ankle of the patients was matched to the digital twin with machine learning technology.\nThe results showed that a personalized axis can be obtained for each patient. When the origin of the axis is the centre of mass of the talus, this axis can be represented in a geodesic system. The mean value of the axis is a line passing in first approximation through the centre of the sphere (with a variation of 3\u00a0mm from the centre of the mass of the talus) and through a point with the coordinates 91.6\u00b0 west and 7.4\u00b0 north (range 84\u00b0 to 98\u00b0 west;\u2009-\u20092\u00b0 to 12\u00b0 north). This study improves the understanding of the axis of the ankle, as well as its relationship to the possibility to use the geodesic system for robotic in ankle arthroplasty.\nThe consideration of a personalized axis of the ankle might be helpful for better understanding of ankle surgery and particularly total ankle arthroplasty.",

We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in a sample of 58 depression score-discordant monozygotic twin pairs, aiming to detect specific epigenetic variants potentially related to depression and further integrate with gene expression profile data. Association between the methylation level of each CpG site and depression score was tested by applying a linear mixed effect model. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed for gene expression data. The association of DNA methylation levels of 66 CpG sites with depression score reached the level of P < 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910",

    "abstract": "Age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) is considered an unpreventable disorder. We aimed to detect specific genetic variants that are potentially related to ARHI via genome-wide association study (GWAS).\nA sample of 131 dizygotic twins was genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphism- (SNP-) based GWAS. Gene-based test was performed using VEGAS2. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted by PASCAL.\nThe twins are with a median age of 49 years, of which 128 were females and 134 were males. rs6633657 was the only SNP that reached the genome-wide significance level for better ear hearing level (BEHL) at 2.0\u2009kHz (\nThe genetic variations reported herein are significantly involved in functional genes and regulatory domains that mediate ARHI pathogenesis. These findings provide clues for the further unraveling of the molecular physiology of hearing functions and identifying novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of ARHI.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether deferred cord clamping (DCC) compared with early cord clamping (ECC) was associated with reduction in death and/or severe neurologic injury among twins born at <30\u00a0weeks of gestation.\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study including all liveborn twins of <30\u00a0weeks admitted to a tertiary-level neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Canada between 2015 and 2018 using the Canadian Neonatal/Preterm Birth Network database. We compared DCC \u226530\u00a0seconds vs ECC <30\u00a0seconds. Our primary outcome was a composite of death and/or severe neurologic injury (severe intraventricular hemorrhage grade III/IV and/or periventricular leukomalacia). Secondary outcomes included neonatal morbidity and health care utilization outcomes. We calculated aORs and \u03b2 coefficients for categorical and continuous variables, along with 95% CI. Models were fitted with generalized estimated equations accounting for twin correlation.\nWe included 1597 twins (DCC, 624 [39.1%]; ECC, 973 [60.9%]). Death/severe neurologic injury occurred in 17.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a0111) of twins who received DCC and in 21.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a0211) of those who received ECC. The rate of death/severe neurologic injury did not differ significantly between the DCC and ECC groups (aOR 1.07; 95% CI, 0.78-1.47). DCC was associated with reduced blood transfusions (adjusted \u03b2 coefficient, -0.49; 95% CI, -0.86 to -0.12) and NICU length of stay (adjusted \u03b2 coefficient, -4.17; 95% CI, -8.15 to -0.19).\nThe primary composite outcome of death and/or severe neurologic injury did not differ between twins born at <30\u00a0weeks of gestation who received DCC and those who received ECC, but DCC was associated with some benefits.",

    "abstract": "Conventional ultrafine-grains can generate high strength in Mg alloys, but significant tradeoff of corrosion resistance due to inclusion of a large number of non-equilibrium grain boundaries. Herein, an ultrafine-grain structure consisting of dense ultrafine twins is prepared, yielding a high strength up to 469\u2009MPa and decreasing the corrosion rate by one order of magnitude. Generally, the formation of dense ultrafine twins in Mg alloys is rather difficult, but a carefully designed multi-directional compression treatment effectively stimulates twinning nucleation within twins and refines grain size down to 300\u2009nm after 12-passes compressions. Grain-refinement by low-energy twins not only circumvents the detrimental effects of non-equilibrium grain boundaries on corrosion resistance, but also alters both the morphology and distribution of precipitates. Consequently, micro-galvanic corrosion tendency decreases, and severe localized corrosion is suppressed completely. This technique has a high commercial viability as it can be readily implemented in industrial production.",

    "abstract": "In twin pregnancies, amnionicity and chorionicity are crucial as they strongly determine prenatal and perinatal management. First trimester ultrasound allows a highly reliable diagnosis of amnionicity and chorionicity, making it an internationally accepted standard in antenatal care. However, in rare cases, amnionicity can change from diamniotic to monoamniotic throughout pregnancy, substantially impacting perinatal management. We report the case of a confirmed monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy with a diagnosis of spontaneous septostomy of the dividing membrane (SSDM) at 28 weeks of gestation, resulting in a pseudomonoamniotic pregnancy. Even though SSDM is a rare condition and its sonographic diagnosis might be challenging, it should be considered if, in a known diamniotic pregnancy, there is a sudden failure to visualise the intertwin membrane truly separating both twins.",

    "abstract": "Formation of identity and differentiation is crucial in the development process of adolescents and young people. Despite many studies on identity status and self-differentiation in adolescence and early adulthood stages, this issue has been less examined among twins. This study was conducted to compare self-differentiation and identity statuses in twins and nontwins. The sample of the study consisted of 128 identical twins, 176 nonidentical twins and 170 nontwins aged from 13 to 30 years and living in Mashhad in Iran, who completed the Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status and Self-Differentiation questionnaires. The results showed that the self-differentiation of identical and nonidentical twins was significantly higher than nontwins. The results also showed that level of Foreclosure identity, Moratorium identity and Achieved identity was similar among identical twins, nonidentical twins and nontwins, but significantly different in terms of Diffusion identity. Further, the results showed that twins younger than 18 years had scores higher than nontwins and twins over 18 years in terms of Diffusion identity. Findings revealed that females were significantly lower than males for Moratorium identity. The adolescence period and co-twins may be the reason for the high levels of Diffusion identity and self-differentiation. Also, it seems that identity development and differentiation are related to emotional and cognitive development.",

    "abstract": "Multifetal pregnancy reduction is a technique used to reduce the fetal number to mitigate the risks of adverse outcomes associated with multiple gestations. Monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies are subject to unique complications, contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus, patients have an option to electively reduce 1 fetus to improve outcomes.\nThis study aimed to compare outcomes of elective reduction of monochorionic diamniotic twins by radiofrequency ablation to planned ongoing monochorionic diamniotic twins.\nWe performed a retrospective review of 315 monochorionic diamniotic twin gestations that underwent first-trimester ultrasound within 1 institution. Planned electively reduced twins were compared with ongoing monochorionic diamniotic twins. All reductions were performed via radiofrequency ablation of the cord insertion site into the fetal abdomen. The primary outcome was preterm birth at <36 weeks' gestation. Secondary outcomes included gestational age at delivery; preterm birth at less than 37-, 34-, 32-, and 28-weeks' gestation; unintended loss; and adverse perinatal outcomes.\nAmong 315 monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies, 14 (4.4%) underwent elective multifetal pregnancy reduction, and 301 (95.6%) were planned ongoing twins. The mean gestational age of radiofrequency ablation in the elective multifetal pregnancy reduction group was 15.1\u00b10.68 weeks. Patients who underwent elective multifetal pregnancy reduction had significantly higher maternal age (P<.01) and were more likely to be Asian (P<.01). Moreover, they were more likely to have undergone in vitro fertilization (P=.03) and chorionic villus sampling (P<.01). There was a significantly higher rate of term deliveries in the elective radiofrequency ablation group compared with ongoing twins (gestational age, 38 weeks [interquartile range, 36.1-39.1] vs 35.9 weeks [interquartile range, 34.0-36.9]; P<.01). Patients with ongoing pregnancies had a trend of increased rate of preterm birth at <36 weeks' gestation (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-12.0; P=.06), a significantly increased risk of preterm birth at <37 weeks' gestation (odds ratio, 8.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-26.4; P<.01), and no difference at less than 34-, 32-, or 28- weeks' gestation. All patients who underwent elective radiofrequency ablation had successful pregnancies with no pregnancy losses or terminations. Of ongoing gestations, 36 required procedures, including 16 (5.3%) medically indicated radiofrequency ablation, 14 (4.6%) laser ablation, and 6 (1.9%) amnioreductions. Furthermore, 22 patients (7.3%) with planned ongoing twins had total pregnancy loss at <24 weeks' gestation. Notably, 12 patients (4.0%) had unintended loss of 1 fetus before 24 weeks' gestation in the ongoing pregnancy cohort, and 12 patients (4.0%) had unintended loss of both fetuses before 24 weeks' gestation. Moreover, 5 patients (1.7%) in the ongoing pregnancy group had intrauterine fetal demise at >24 weeks' gestation and 10 patients (3.3%) electively terminated both fetuses. There was no significant difference in loss rates between the 2 groups.\nIn this study of monochorionic diamniotic twins, patients who elected to undergo multifetal pregnancy reduction had significantly lower rates of preterm birth at <37 weeks and a lower trend of preterm birth at <36 weeks' gestation without an increased risk of pregnancy loss. Median gestational age at delivery was significantly higher in the elective multifetal pregnancy reduction group (38 weeks) than in the ongoing pregnancy group (35.9 weeks). Further research is needed to clarify if multifetal pregnancy reduction improves long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Although trigger finger is common, pediatric trigger thumb is uncommon. In trigger thumb the finger is held in flexed position. The etiology of trigger finger is unknown and can occur isolated without any relation to other syndromes, however there are some evidences that suggest genetic etiology. We reported 2.5 year old twins both having bilateral trigger thumb. Grandfather of the twins had the disease. Although trigger thumb and finger have the same presentation, they can involve different anatomical structures. Bent or straightening of thumb or finger would produce painful popping and clicking and the affected finger or thumb can get stuck in bent and extended position. Based on physical examination and symptoms trigger finger are classified into four stages and each has its own treatment. There are evidences that support congenital hypothesis in pediatric trigger thumb such as bilateral presentation in identical twins, first degree familiar association and etc. Before the 1st year of life, 30% of trigger thumb will get resolved and it is better to postpone the surgery until 2 year of age. A1 pulley release has a good result in pediatric trigger thumb treatment.",

    "abstract": "The purpose is to explore the feature recognition, diagnosis, and forecasting performances of Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (S3VMs) for brain image fusion Digital Twins (DTs). Both unlabeled and labeled data are used regarding many unlabeled data in brain images, and semi supervised support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. Meantime, the AlexNet model is improved, and the brain images in real space are mapped to virtual space by using digital twins. Moreover, a diagnosis and prediction model of brain image fusion digital twins based on semi supervised SVM and improved AlexNet is constructed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from the Brain Tumor Department of a Hospital are collected to test the performance of the constructed model through simulation experiments. Some state-of-art models are included for performance comparison: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), AlexNet, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Results demonstrate that the proposed model can provide a feature recognition and extraction accuracy of 92.52%, at least an improvement of 2.76% compared to other models. Its training lasts for about 100 s, and the test takes about 0.68 s. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the proposed model are 4.91 and 5.59%, respectively. Regarding the assessment indicators of brain image segmentation and fusion, the proposed model can provide a 79.55% Jaccard coefficient, a 90.43% Positive Predictive Value (PPV), a 73.09% Sensitivity, and a 75.58% Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), remarkably better than other models. Acceleration efficiency analysis suggests that the improved AlexNet model is suitable for processing massive brain image data with a higher speedup indicator. To sum up, the constructed model can provide high accuracy, good acceleration efficiency, and excellent segmentation and recognition performances while ensuring low errors, which can provide an experimental basis for brain image feature recognition and digital diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The ability to flexibly adapt thoughts and actions in a goal-directed manner appears to rely on cognitive control mechanisms that are strongly impacted by individual differences. A powerful research strategy for investigating the nature of individual variation is to study monozygotic (identical) twins. Evidence of twin effects have been observed in prior behavioral and neuroimaging studies, yet within the domain of cognitive control, it remains to be demonstrated that the neural underpinnings of such effects are specific and reliable. Here, we utilize a multi-task, within-subjects event-related neuroimaging design with functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate twin effects through multivariate pattern similarity analyses. We focus on fronto-parietal brain regions exhibiting consistently increased activation associated with cognitive control demands across four task domains: selective attention, context processing, multi-tasking, and working memory. Healthy young adult monozygotic twin pairs exhibited increased similarity of within- and cross-task activation patterns in these fronto-parietal regions, relative to unrelated pairs. Twin activation pattern similarity effects were clearest under high control demands, were not present in a set of task-unrelated parcels or due to anatomic similarity, and were primarily observed during the within-trial timepoints in which the control demands peaked. Together, these results indicate that twin similarity in the neural representation of cognitive control may be domain-general but also functionally and temporally specific in relation to the level of control demand. The findings suggest a genetic and/or environmental basis for individual variation in cognitive control function, and highlight the potential of twin-based neuroimaging designs for exploring heritability questions within this domain.",

    "abstract": "Prior research on the causality and directionality between disease and functional limitations is ambiguous. The current study used longitudinal monozygotic twin data to test both directions linking disease burden and functional limitations in middle-aged and older adults, controlling for genetic and familial factors. We also examined potential moderation by psychological well-being.\nThe twin subsample from the first two waves of the longitudinal Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study was used (wave 1, 1995-1996; wave 2, 2004-2006). Only monozygotic twins (n = 713) were included in analyses. In separate multilevel models, we examined disease burden at MIDUS 2 predicted by functional limitations at MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 functional limitations predicted by disease burden at MIDUS 1.\nDisease burden and functional limitations at MIDUS 2 varied substantially within families. There was no within-family association of earlier functional limitations with change in later disease burden (b = 0.40, p = .39), but there was a within-family association such that the twin with higher baseline disease burden had a greater increase in functional limitations than his/her co-twin (b = 0.06, p = .02). Well-being was not a moderator in either model.\nWe found support for a potentially causal association between earlier disease burden and later increases in functional limitations, consistent with the Disablement Process Model. Sensitivity analyses confirm the detected within-family effect. Possible mechanisms linking disease burden and functional limitations are discussed as potential targets for future research.",

    "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a recurrent inflammatory skin disease that, apart from rare causative loss-of-function mutations, has a widely unknown genetic aetiology.\nTo estimate the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors underlying susceptibility to HS.\nVia the Danish Twin Registry and the Danish National Patient Registry we pulled together information on zygosity with that of HS status. Cases of HS were identified by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-8 (705\u00b791) and ICD-10 (L73\u00b72). Heritability was assessed by the classic biometric model and the possibility of gene-gene interaction via the multilocus modelling approach.\nAmong 100 044 registered twins, we found 170 twins (from 163 pairs) diagnosed with HS. The seven concordant pairs were all monozygotic. Monozygotic twins had a case-wise concordance rate of 28% [95% confidence interval (CI) 7-49], corresponding to a familial risk of 73 (95% CI 13-133) times that of the background population. The biometrical modelling suggested a heritability of 0\u00b780 (95% CI 0\u00b767-0\u00b793), and the multilocus index estimate was 230 (95% CI 60-400). This is highly indicative of gene-gene interactions, with the possibility of up to six interacting loci.\nThis twin study was substantially larger and employed a more valid phenotype than previous studies. Genetics account for the majority of HS susceptibility, and HS is most likely caused by gene-gene interactions rather than monogenetic mutations or solely additive genetic factors. New approaches aimed at assessing potential interactions at a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-SNP level should be implemented in future HS genome-wide association studies.",

    "abstract": "A pair of 16-year-old twin brothers presented to our hospital. The younger brother had been losing vision in his left eye for 6 months, and the older brother had been losing vision in both eyes for 6 months. Both patients were 2.05 meters tall and lean with spider-like fingers (toes). They had lens subluxation and a leopard-shaped fundus in both eyes. Their ocular manifestations, including anterior and posterior corneal curvature, total corneal refractive power, anterior and posterior and total corneal astigmatism, corneal thickness, and axial length, were relatively consistent. The twin brothers were both diagnosed with Marfan syndrome and bilateral lens subluxation, which is a relatively rare clinical condition. The younger brother underwent posterior scleral reinforcement for retinal foveoschisis in the left eye, and the retina was basically attached after surgery. The older brother was treated with optometry and frame glasses. \n16\u5c81\u5b6a\u751f\u5144\u5f1f\uff0c\u5f1f\u5f1f\u5de6\u773c\u89c6\u529b\u4e0b\u964d6\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u54e5\u54e5\u53cc\u773c\u89c6\u529b\u4e0b\u964d6\u4e2a\u6708\u30022\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u8eab\u9ad8\u5747\u4e3a2.05 m\uff0c\u7626\u9ad8\u4f53\u578b\uff0c\u8718\u86db\u72b6\u6307\uff08\u8dbe\uff09\uff1b\u5747\u53cc\u773c\u6676\u72b6\u4f53\u8131\u4f4d\uff0c\u53cc\u773c\u8c79\u7eb9\u72b6\u773c\u5e95\uff1b\u53cc\u773c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89d2\u819c\u524d\u540e\u8868\u9762\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u89d2\u819c\u66f2\u7387\u3001\u89d2\u819c\u524d\u540e\u8868\u9762\u6563\u5149\u5ea6\u6570\u548c\u89d2\u819c\u603b\u6563\u5149\u5ea6\u6570\u3001\u89d2\u819c\u539a\u5ea6\u3001\u773c\u8f74\u957f\u5ea6\u7b49\u5747\u8f83\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u5b6a\u751f\u5144\u5f1f\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u5747\u4e3a\u9a6c\u65b9\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u548c\u53cc\u773c\u6676\u72b6\u4f53\u534a\u8131\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f83\u4e3a\u5c11\u89c1\u3002\u5f1f\u5f1f\u56e0\u5de6\u773c\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u5288\u88c2\u884c\u540e\u5de9\u819c\u52a0\u56fa\u672f\uff0c\u672f\u540e\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u57fa\u672c\u590d\u4f4d\u3002\u54e5\u54e5\u4e88\u4ee5\u9a8c\u5149\u914d\u955c\u6cbb\u7597\u3002",

Although DNA-based testing is the gold standard for determining zygosity, collecting biological samples is not feasible in all research settings or all families. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of zygosity estimation based on questionnaire (physical similarity) data in older twins, but the extent to which this is also a reliable approach in infancy is less well established. Here, we report the accuracy of different questionnaire-based zygosity determination approaches (traditional and machine learning) in 5.5 month-old twins. The participant cohort comprised 284 infant twin pairs (128 dizygotic and 156 monozygotic) who participated in the Babytwins Study Sweden (BATSS). Manual scoring based on an established technique validated in older twins accurately predicted 90.49% of the zygosities with a sensitivity of 91.65% and specificity of 89.06%. The machine learning approach improved the prediction accuracy to 93.10%, with a sensitivity of 91.30% and specificity of 94.29%. Additionally, we quantified the systematic impact of zygosity misclassification on estimates of genetic and environmental influences using simulation-based sensitivity analysis on a separate data set to show the implication of our machine learning accuracy gain. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the feasibility of determining zygosity in very young infant twins using a questionnaire with four items and builds a scalable machine learning model with better metrics, thus a viable alternative to DNA tests in large-scale infant twin studies.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies have been shown to be associated with numerous maternal and perinatal complications. Published data shows conflicting reports on whether assisted conception influences these risks. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of mode of conception on maternal and perinatal outcomes of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies.\nThis was a large retrospective study of 497 women with dichorionic diamniotic twins that were conceived spontaneously or with assisted conception in a single centre over a 10-year period.\nThis study showed no significant difference in mode of delivery (OR 1.40 95% CI 0.88 - 2.24), need for admission to neonatal unit (OR 1.56 95% CI 0.88-2.77), or preterm births between dichorionic twin pregnancies conceived following assisted conception when compared to spontaneously conceived dichorionic twin pregnancies. Women who conceived twins by assisted conception that did not have an elective caesarean section were more likely to go into spontaneous labour than have an induction of labour (OR 0.54 95% CI 0.3 - 0.99). They also had a higher chance of having an estimated blood loss of more than 1L than women who conceived naturally (OR 1.70 95% CI 1.06 - 2.73).\nIn the case of dichorionic twins, this study showed that assisted conception does not seem to be associated with adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes when compared with spontaneous conception. These results should be considered reassuring to women undergoing assisted conception, and may assist clinicians when counselling patients for assisted conception treatment. Further research is needed to assess the impact of assisted conception on postpartum blood loss.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms have been associated with genes involved in Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD often co-occurs with other health conditions such as depression, cardiovascular disorder and respiratory illnesses. PTSD and migraine have previously been reported to be symptomatically positively correlated with each other, but little is known about the genes involved. The aim of this study was to understand the comorbidity between PTSD and migraine using a monozygotic twin disease discordant study design in six pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PTSD and 15 pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for migraine. DNA from peripheral blood was run on Illumina EPIC arrays and analyzed. Multiple testing correction was performed using the Bonferroni method and 10% false discovery rate (FDR). We validated 11 candidate genes previously associated with PTSD including ",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies continue to increase worldwide; however, the current clinical prenatal evaluation for the intrauterine growth of twins still relies on the growth standards of singletons. We attempted to establish a set of fetal biometric references for Chinese twin pregnancies, stratified by chorionicity and conception mode as spontaneously conceived monochorionic diamniotic (SC-MCDA), spontaneously conceived dichorionic diamniotic (SC-DCDA), and assisted reproductive technology dichorionic diamniotic (ART-DCDA) twins.\nFrom 2016 to 2019, the ultrasonographic fetal biometric measurements were longitudinally collected in pregnant women, including fetal weight, biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and humerus length. The linear mixed models were used to test the difference of growth patterns between groups, and the growth curve of each biometric parameter was modeled by a generalized additive model for location scale and shape.\nA total of 929 twin pregnant women and 2019 singleton pregnant women, met the inclusion criteria. Among twin pregnancies, 148 were SC-MCDA, 215 were SC-DCDA, and 566 were ART-DCDA twins. Overall, SC-DCDA twins grew faster than SC-MCDA twins, while slower than ART-DCDA twins (all P\u200a<\u200a0.05), and all of the three groups showed significant differences comparing with singletons, especially during the third trimester. Hence, the customized fetal growth charts of each fetal biometric parameter were, respectively, constructed for SC-MCDA, SC-DCDA, and ART-DCDA twins.\nThe fetal biometric trajectories demonstrated characteristic patterns according to chorionicity and conception mode. To fill the gap, we modeled fetal biometric parameters for Chinese SC-MCDA, SC-DCDA, and ART-DCDA twin pregnancies, hoping to provide a reference for the further establishment of fetal growth reference values for Chinese twin fetuses.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twin is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by a fusion of certain anatomical structures. Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is a new emerging infectious respiratory disease affecting worldwide and potentially leads to acute respiratory distress (ARDS) in children. COVID-19 has reconstructed the healthcare system, including surgical care and decision-making.\nHerein we describe a surgical separation of 2.5\u00a0months old omphalopagus conjoined twins, with one of them (Baby A) presenting COVID-19-associated respiratory distress, as well as the challenges faced during the preparation and the execution of the complex surgical procedure.\nBaby A underwent antiviral therapy, oxygen supplementation, and ventilation in the ICU, while baby B remained stable and confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2. The separation surgery was conducted after baby A had become clinically stable. Defect closure and reconstruction were accomplished. At one week follow-up, Baby A died of lung infection, while baby B remained well after one year.\nThe complexity of surgical separation requires careful planning by a multidisciplinary team. Surgical separation of conjoined twins during the pandemic era has not been reported much in the literature, more reports are required to provide further insight.",

    "abstract": "Anticipating the ethical impact of emerging technologies is an essential part of responsible innovation. One such emergent technology is the digital twin which we define here as a living replica of a physical system (human or non-human). A digital twin combines various emerging technologies such as AI, Internet of Things, big data and robotics, each component bringing its own socio-ethical issues to the resulting artefacts. The question thus arises which of these socio-ethical themes surface in the process and how they are perceived by stakeholders in the field. In this report we present the results of a qualitative study into the socio-ethical benefits and socio-ethical risks of using digital twins in healthcare. Employing insights from ethics of technology and the Quadruple Helix theory of innovation, we conducted desk research of white literature and 23 interviews with representatives from the four helixes: industry, research, policy and civil society. The ethical scan revealed several important areas where the digital twin can produce socio-ethical value (e.g., prevention and treatment of disease, cost reduction, patient autonomy and freedom, equal treatment) but also several important areas of socio-ethical risks (e.g., privacy and property of data, disruption of existing societal structures, inequality and injustice). We conclude with a reflection on the employed analytical tool and suggestions for further research.",

    "abstract": "Rhabdomyomas comprise the majority of cardiac tumors in fetuses and are found in association with tuberous sclerosis complex. More than 90% of fetuses and neonates with multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas have signs of tuberous sclerosis complex. However, solitary cardiac rhabdomyoma cases are largely unrelated to tuberous sclerosis complex. Here, we report a case involving multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas not associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in a dizygotic twin.\nA 36-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with a dizygotic twin pregnancy in the first trimester. Consistent with dizygosity, the fetal sex was discordant (male and female). At 27\u00a0weeks of gestation, hydrops and multiple echogenic cardiac masses were noted in the male baby, with the largest mass measuring 34\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030 mm. The female fetus appeared normal. The cardiac masses enlarged gradually with the progression of the hydrops. At 32\u00a0weeks of gestation, intrauterine death of the male fetus was confirmed. The next day, autopsy of the male fetus was performed after cesarean section. Three well-demarcated white-tan-colored nodules were formed in the ventricular walls and interventricular septum, with the largest nodule (40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030 mm) in the left ventricular wall. Histologically, these lesions were diagnosed as rhabdomyomas.\nWe encountered a case involving multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas arising in one of dizygotic twin fetuses. Unlike most reported cases of multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas, this case was not accompanied by tuberous sclerosis complex. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas that developed in only one of dizygotic twins in the English literature.",

    "abstract": "eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 are paralogous proteins whose presence in most normal eukaryotic cells is mutually exclusive and developmentally regulated. Often described in the scientific literature under the collective name eEF1A, which stands for eukaryotic elongation factor 1A, their best known activity (in a monomeric, GTP-bound conformation) is to bind aminoacyl-tRNAs and deliver them to the A-site of the 80S ribosome. However, both eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 are endowed with multitasking abilities (sometimes performed by homo- and heterodimers) and can be located in different subcellular compartments, from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. Given the high sequence identity of these two sister proteins and the large number of post-translational modifications they can undergo, we are often confronted with the dilemma of discerning which is the particular proteoform that is actually responsible for the ascribed biochemical or cellular effects. We argue in this review that acquiring this knowledge is essential to help clarify, in molecular and structural terms, the mechanistic involvement of these two ancestral and abundant G proteins in a variety of fundamental cellular processes other than translation elongation. Of particular importance for this special issue is the fact that several de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the human ",

    "abstract": "Cognitive aging is one of the major problems worldwide, especially as people get older. This study aimed to perform global gene expression profiling of cognitive function to identify associated genes and pathways and a novel transcriptional regulatory network analysis to identify important regulons. We performed single transcript analysis on 400 monozygotic twins using an assumption-free generalized correlation coefficient (GCC), linear mixed-effect model (LME) and kinship model and identified six probes (one significant at the standard FDR < 0.05 while the other results were suggestive with 0.18 \u2264 FDR \u2264 0.28). We combined the GCC and linear model results to cover diverse patterns of relationships, and meaningful and novel genes like ",

    "abstract": "To examine the association between low birth weight (LBW) and cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs, including heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes mellitus) in adulthood, and to explore whether genetic, early-life environmental and healthy lifestyle factors play a role in this association.\nA population-based twin study.\nTwins from the Swedish Twin Registry who were born in 1958 or earlier participated in the Screening Across the Lifespan Twin (SALT) study for a full-scale screening during 1998-2002 and were followed up until 2014.\n19\u2009779 twin individuals in Sweden with birthweight data available (mean age: 55.45 years).\nCMDs were assessed based on self-reported medical records, medication use and records from the National Patient Registry. A lifestyle index encompassing smoking status, alcohol consumption, exercise levels and Body Mass Index was derived from the SALT survey and categorised as unfavourable, intermediate or favourable. Data were analysed using generalised estimating equation (GEE) models and conditional logistic regression models.\nOf all participants, 3998 (20.2%) had LBW and 5335 (27.0%) had incident CMDs (mean age at onset: 63.64\u00b113.26 years). In GEE models, the OR of any CMD was 1.39 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.52) for LBW. In conditional logistic regression models, the LBW-CMD association became non-significant (OR=1.21, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.56). The difference in ORs from the two models was statistically significant (p<0.001). In the joint effect analysis, the multiadjusted OR of CMDs was 3.47 (95% CI 2.72 to 4.43) for participants with LBW plus an unfavourable lifestyle and 1.25 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.62) for those with LBW plus a favourable lifestyle.\nLBW is associated with an increased risk of adult CMDs, and genetic and early-life environmental factors may account for this association. However, a favourable lifestyle profile may modify this risk.",

    "abstract": "Perinatal outcomes for singleton pregnancies are poorer, on average, for Aboriginal people than non-Aboriginal people, but little is known about Aboriginal multifetal pregnancies. Yet multifetal pregnancies and births are often more complicated and have poorer outcomes than singleton pregnancies. We describe the pregnancies, births and perinatal outcomes for Aboriginal twins born in Western Australia (WA) and New South Wales (NSW) with comparisons to Aboriginal singletons in both states and to non-Aboriginal births in NSW.\nWhole-population birth records and birth and death registrations were linked for all births during 2000-2013 (WA) and 2002-2008 (NSW). Hospital records and the WA Register of Developmental Anomalies - Cerebral Palsy were linked for all WA births and hospital records for a subset of NSW births. Descriptive statistics are reported for maternal and child demographics, maternal health, pregnancy complications, births and perinatal outcomes.\nThirty-four thousand one hundred twenty-seven WA Aboriginal, 32,352 NSW Aboriginal and 601,233 NSW non-Aboriginal births were included. Pregnancy complications were more common among mothers of Aboriginal twins than Aboriginal singletons (e.g. 17% of mothers of WA twins had hypertension/pre-eclampsia/eclampsia vs 8% of mothers of singletons) but similar to mothers of NSW non-Aboriginal twins. Most Aboriginal twins were born in a principal referral, women's or large public hospital. The hospitals were often far from the mother's home (e.g. 31% of mothers of WA Aboriginal twins gave birth at hospitals located more than 3\u2009h by road from their home). Outcomes were worse for Aboriginal liveborn twins than Aboriginal singletons and non-Aboriginal twins (e.g. 58% of NSW Aboriginal twins were preterm compared to 9% of Aboriginal singletons and 49% non-Aboriginal twins).\nMothers of Aboriginal twins faced significant challenges during the pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period in hospital and, in addition to accessible specialist medical care, these mothers may need extra practical and psychosocial support throughout their journey.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the influence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) on the perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancies.\nThis was a retrospective single-center study in which, 2160 twin pregnancies delivered between January 2016 and December 2019 were analyzed, 1661 of which were dichorionic (DC) and 499 monochorionic (MC). The perinatal outcomes were compared in 404 twin pregnancies with HDP, including 157 gestational hypertension (GH), 107 mild pre-eclampsia (MPE), 140 severe pre-eclampsia (SPE), and 1756 twins without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (no-HDP). Multiple linear regression was performed to analyze the association between perinatal outcome and HDP. Stratified sampling by twin chorionicity (DC and MC) was also conducted.\nThere were 330 (19.9%) DC cases complicated with HDP and 74 (14.8%) MC with HDP, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (\nThe perinatal outcomes of different chorionic twins with HDP are different. HDP has a greater impact on the perinatal outcomes of DC twins. The risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in DC twin pregnancy will increase accordingly with each increase in the grade of HDP, but HDP has little or no relevance on the perinatal outcomes of MC twins.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis. It involves both genetic and environmental factors, among which DNA methylation, the most studied epigenetic modification, was shown to play a role. Here, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles in 2 pairs of IgAN-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins, in order to characterize methylation changes and their potential influences on gene expression in IgAN.\nGenome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 2 IgAN-discordant MZ twins. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, and an integrated analysis was performed. Finally, functional enrichment analysis was done for DMR-associated genes and DEGs.\nTotally 521 DMRs were detected for 2 IgAN-discordant MZ twins. Among them, 9 DMRs were found to be mapped to genes that differentially expressed in 2 MZ twins, indicating the potential regulatory mechanisms of expression for these 9 genes (\nOur findings indicate that changes in DNA methylation patterns were involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN. Nine target genes detected in our study may provide new ideas for the exploration of molecular mechanisms of IgAN.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a quantitative genetic analysis of human anterior dental morphology in a longitudinal sample of known genealogy. The primary aim of this work is to generate a suite of genetic correlations within and between deciduous and permanent characters to access patterns of integration across the diphyodont dental complex.\nData were recorded from casted tooth crowns representing participants of a long-term Australian twin and family study (deciduous n\u2009=\u2009290, permanent n\u2009=\u2009339). Morphological trait expression was observed and scored following Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System standards. Bivariate genetic correlations were estimated using maximum likelihood variance decomposition models in SOLAR v.8.1.1.\nGenetic correlation estimates indicate high levels of integration between antimeres but low to moderate levels among traits within a tooth row. Only 9% of deciduous model comparisons were significant, while pleiotropy was indicated for one third of permanent trait pairs. Canine characters stood out as strongly integrated, especially in the deciduous dentition. For homologous characters across dentitions (e.g., deciduous i\nPatterns of genetic correlation suggest a morphological canine module that spans the primary and secondary dentition. Results also point to the existence of a genetic mechanism conserving morphology across the diphyodont dental complex, such that paired deciduous and permanent traits are more strongly integrated than characters within individual tooth rows/teeth.",

    "abstract": "Twin birth weight percentiles are less popular in clinical management among twin pregnancies compared with singleton ones in China. This study aimed to compare the incidence and neonatal outcomes of small for gestational age (SGA) twins between the use of singleton and twin birth weight percentiles.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of 3,027 pregnancies with liveborn twin pairs at gestational age of >\u200928 weeks. The newborns were categorized as SGA when a birthweight was less than the 10th percentile based on the singleton and twin references derived from Chinese population. Logistic regression models with generalized estimated equation (GEE) were utilized to evaluate the association between SGA twins and neonatal outcomes including neonatal unit admission, neonatal jaundice, neonatal respiratory distress (NRDS), neonatal asphyxia, ventilator support, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), culture-proven sepsis, neonatal death within 28 days after birth as well as the composite outcome.\nThe incidence of SGA was 33.1\u2009% based on the singleton reference and 7.3\u2009% based on the twin reference. Both of SGA newborns defined by the singleton and twin references were associated with increases in neonatal unit admission, neonatal jaundice and ventilator support. In addition, SGA newborns defined by the twin reference were associated with increased rates of BPD (aOR, 2.61; 95\u2009% CI: 1.18-5.78) as well as the severe composite outcome (aOR, 1.93; 95\u2009% CI: 1.07-3.47).\nThe use of singleton birth weight percentiles may result in misdiagnosed SGA newborns in twin gestations and the twin birth weight percentiles would be more useful to identify those who are at risk of adverse outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Low birth weight might affect adverse health outcomes during a lifetime. Our study analyzes the association between low birth weight and negative health outcomes during adulthood in twin populations.\nSearches were conducted using databases inclusive of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and EBSCO. Observational studies on twins with low birth weight and adverse health outcomes during adulthood were included. Two reviewers independently screened the papers, and a third reviewer resolved the conflicts between the two reviewers. Following abstract and title screening, full-texts were screened to obtain eligibility. Eligible full-text articles were then assessed for quality using a modified Downs and Black checklist. Studies with a score within one standard deviation of the mean were included in the analysis. A fixed-effect model was used for analysis.\n3987 studies were screened describing low birth weight as a risk factor for adverse health outcomes during adulthood for all twelve-body systems (circulatory, digestive, endocrine, lymphatic, muscular, nervous, reproductive, respiratory, skeletal, urinary, and integumentary systems). One hundred fourteen articles made it through full-text screening, and 14 of those articles were assessed for quality. Five papers were selected to perform two meta-analyses for two outcomes: asthma and cerebral palsy. For asthma, the meta-analyses of three studies suggested a higher odds of low birth weight twins developing asthma (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.24-1.44, I\nThe odds of low birth weight were found to be high in both asthma and cerebral palsy. There are not enough studies of similar nature (study types, similar body systems) to ensure a meaningful meta-analysis. We recommend that future research considers following up on twins to obtain data about adverse health outcomes during their adult lives.",

    "abstract": "To examine the outcomes of twins and singletons in the late preterm period.\nThis is a retrospective cohort study of data obtained for 165,894 births in California who delivered between 34\u2009+\u20090 and 36\u2009+\u20096 weeks. The primary outcome was neonatal and infant mortality. The secondary outcomes included the following neonatal morbidities: respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), seizure, and sepsis. Univariate analysis was performed using chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders.\nThere were 143,891 singleton and 22,003 twin gestations included in the study. There was no difference in the primary outcome, neonatal and infant mortality between twins and singletons delivered at 34 and 36 weeks. After controlling for multiple potential confounders, significant differences in secondary outcomes of neonatal morbidity were identified. At 34 weeks, twins had significantly higher rates of IVH (aOR 2.47 (95%CI 1.08-5.64)), NEC (aOR 2.46 (95%CI 1.42-4.29)), RDS (aOR 1.60 (95%CI 1.45-1.77)), and sepsis (aOR 1.19 (95%CI 1.05-1.34)) compared to singletons. By 36 weeks, only an increased risk of RDS persisted among twins.\nWhile there was no difference in mortality among twins and singletons in the late preterm period, twins may have significantly increased neonatal morbidity compared to singletons delivered between 34\u2009+\u20090 and 36\u2009+\u20096 weeks.",

    "abstract": "Thanks to shared circulation in monochorionic twins, single intrauterine fetal death (IUD) may lead to acute feto-fetal transfusion (aFFTR). The objective of the study was to describe our model of aFFTR simulation after IUD in monochorionic (MC) twins.\nProspective study analyzed 99 fresh MC placentas with the physiological course. A specially designed protocol was used for the preparation and analysis of the placentas. A pair of infusion sets fixed together using a mechanical mercury sphygmomanometer cuff was connected to the cannulated umbilical arteries. The tonometer was pressurized up to 30 and 40\u00a0mmHg. A positive finding of aFFTR was determined as the amount exceeding 1\u00a0ml of dye flowed out of the umbilical cord simulating a dead fetus. The number and types of anastomoses, types, and distances between cords insertions, and the size of the placental areas for each fetus were also statistically analyzed. The placental angioarchitecture with and without proven aFFTR was statistically compared, odds ratio (OR) and multivariable logistic analysis were performed.\nA total of 49/99 (49.5%) cases of aFFTR was proven, and the average transfusion time of 1\u00a0ml was 30\u00a0s (19-46\u00a0s). aFFTR was present in 49/78 (62.8%) of placentas with arterio-arterial (AA) anastomosis. The median diameter of AA anastomoses with the present, and absent aFFTRF was 2.0\u00a0mm and 1.0\u00a0mm, respectively. The proven interfetal transfusion was 8%, 31%, and 61% in AA anastomoses with a diameter below 0,5\u00a0mm, 0,5-1,5\u00a0mm, and above 1,5\u00a0mm, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00,001). AA anastomoses diameter >1.5\u00a0mm had OR of 44.2 (95% CI 5.54-352.39). In the case of coexistence of AA anastomosis and umbilical cord distance \u22645th percentile, the aFFTRF occurred in 90.9%.\nThe potential risk of aFFTR in monochorionic twins is mainly due to the presence and nature of AA anastomoses. The diameter and length of the vessels play a crucial role, which is clinically related to the distance of the umbilical cords insertions.",

    "abstract": "We examined the association between early-life participation in collision sports and later-life cognitive health over a 28-year period in a population-based sample drawn from the longitudinal Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (1987-2014). Cognitive measures included the Mini-Mental State Examination and performance across multiple cognitive domains (e.g., global cognition, verbal ability, spatial ability, memory, processing speed). Among a sample of 660 adults (mean age at baseline, 62.8 years (range: 50-88); 58.2% female), who contributed 10,944 person-years of follow-up, there were 450 cases of cognitive impairment (crude rate = 41.1/1,000 person-years). Early-life participation in collision sports was not significantly associated with cognitive impairment at baseline or with its onset over a 28-year period in a time-to-event analysis, which accounted for the semi-competing risk of death. Furthermore, growth curve models revealed no association between early-life participation in collision sports and the level of or change in trajectories of cognition across multiple domains overall or in sex-stratified models. We discuss the long-term implications of adolescent participation in collision sports on cognitive health.",

    "abstract": "Selective termination is the term used for the elimination of an abnormal fetus. In contrast, multifetal pregnancy reduction refers to the termination of one or more members of a twin or higher-order multiple birth set, respectively, to reduce the high risks associated with these pregnancies. The procedure can also be used when a serious physical condition is detected prenatally in a member of a multiple birth set. In a minority of cases, selective termination has reduced two healthy fetuses to one when parents wanted just one additional child in the family. In the present article, the perspectives of a surviving twin whose family wished to terminate both healthy fetuses are examined. Next, past and present twin studies of primordial dwarfism, public service motivation, an analytical model, the global twinning rate and germline differences are summarized. The article concludes with a synopsis of twin-related news that covers twins and Dyngus Day, triplets born in an Austrian displaced persons' camp, the film Superior - about estranged identical twin sisters, a couple adopting their own twins after surrogacy and a new case of twins and primordial dwarfism, a condition introduced in the research reviews.",

    "abstract": "Our study compared the prospective risks of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), neonatal death (NND), perinatal death (PND), and neonatal morbidities in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) and dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancies.\nThis retrospective cohort study included twin pregnancies who had antenatal care and delivery in a public hospital from 2011 to 2018. Exclusion criteria included monoamnionicity, one/both twin miscarriage, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, or lethal congenital abnormalities. All twins were managed in multiple pregnancy clinic with standardized protocols. Gestational age-specific IUFD, NND, PND, and neonatal morbidity rates were compared according to chorionicity.\nThree hundred seventy-eight MCDA and 1282 DCDA twins were included. MCDA twins had higher risks of PND (1.9% vs. 0.7% in DCDA twins, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05), composite neonatal morbidity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), preterm delivery (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and low birth weight (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The prospective risk of IUFD was 0.6% and 0.4% for MCDA and DCDA twins, respectively after 34\u2009weeks' gestation. No NND occurred among deliveries after 30\u2009weeks. The risk of neonatal morbidity of MCDA twins fell from 22.7% at 34\u2009weeks to 2.7% at 37\u2009weeks (p\u2009<\u20090.01).

    "abstract": "Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a common complication after fetal surgeries. The aim of this study was to assess risk factors for and outcomes after PPROM following cord occlusion (CO) in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) pregnancies.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of 188 consecutive MCDA pregnancies treated by bipolar or laser CO, either primarily because of discordant malformation (dMF) or severe selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR), or secondarily when complete bichorionization was not possible in case of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) or sFGR. Intentional septostomy was performed when needed. The procedure-related PPROM was defined as rupture of membranes <32 weeks' gestation (PROM <32 weeks). Selected pre-, intra-, and early postoperative variables were analyzed by univariate and binomial logistic regression to determine they are correlated to PROM <32 weeks after CO.\nBetween 2006 and 2017, 188 cases underwent CO. Diagnosis was TTTS in 28.2% (n = 53), severe sFGR in 49.5% (n = 93), and dMF in 22.3% (n = 42). PROM <32 weeks occurred in 21.3% (n = 40), resulting in worse perinatal outcomes, as preterm birth <32 weeks occurred in 80.7% (vs. 8.3%, p = 0.000), procedure-to-delivery interval was 47.5 days (vs. 125, p = 0.000), gestational age (GA) at birth 30.0 weeks (vs. 37.7 weeks, p = 0.000), and survival 65.0% (vs. 91.1%, p = 0.000). In univariate analysis, indication, anterior placenta, cervical length, GA at surgery, operation time, amniodistention and drainage fluid volumes, chorioamniotic membrane separation, and septostomy were selected as relevant factors to be included in the regression model. In a multivariate analysis, TTTS was the only factor associated to PROM <32 weeks (OR 3.5 CI 95% 1.5-7.9).\nPROM <32 weeks after CO increases the risk of preterm delivery. In this cohort, the membrane rupture was more likely when CO was done in the context of TTTS.",

    "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) and its alternatives, including BPF and BPS, exhibit endocrine disruption activities. However, the effects of bisphenols on fetal growth in twins remain unclear.\nTo explore the associations of prenatal BPA, BPF, and BPS exposure with birth outcome differences in twins.\nWe recruited 289 twin pregnant women who visited the hospital for prenatal examination during the first trimester from 2013 to 2016. Urinary bisphenol levels were determined during the first, second, and third trimesters. The associations of maternal exposure to bisphenols with birth outcome differences in twins were analyzed after stratification by different trimesters. We applied the multiple informant model to estimate trimester-specific associations between urinary bisphenol concentrations and birth outcome differences in twins.\nWe found low reproducibility (ICC<0.40) for maternal urinary BPA and moderate reproducibility (0.40\u00a0<\u00a0ICC<0.75) for BPF and BPS. Urinary BPA concentrations were positively associated with within-pair twin birth weight difference when comparing the third vs. the first tertile in each of the three trimesters (i.e., 133.06\u00a0g, 95% CI: 68.19, 197.94; 144.5\u00a0g, 95%CI: 81.82-207.18\u00a0g; and 135.04\u00a0g, 95%CI: 71.37-198.71\u00a0g for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester, respectively). The effect of urinary BPA concentration on increased birth length difference within-pair twins were also observed across different trimesters (All P for trends\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Urinary BPA levels were positively associated with the within-pair birth weight and birth length differences across pregnancy trimesters (All of Type 3\u00a0P for values\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nMaternal BPA exposure appeared to influence birth wight and birth length differences in twins. Our results warrant further confirmation.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is the most prominent symptom in neurodegenerative disorders affecting quality of life and mortality. However, despite years of research, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of cognitive function and its impairment is poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression and lncRNA-mRNA interaction networks, by analyzing lncRNA expression in whole blood samples of 400 middle and old aged monozygotic twins in association with cognitive function using both linear models and a generalized correlation coefficient (GCC) to capture the diverse patterns of correlation. We detected 13 probes (p\u00a0<\u00a01e-03) displaying nonlinear and 7 probes (p\u00a0<\u00a01e-03) showing linear correlations. After combining the results, we identified 20 lncRNA probes with p\u00a0<\u00a01e-03. The top lncRNA probes were annotated to genes, along with the non-coding MALAT1, that play roles in neurodegenerative diseases. The top lncRNAs were linked to functional clusters including peptidyl-glycine modification, vascular smooth muscle cells, mitotic spindle organization and protein tyrosine phosphatase. In addition, mapping of the top significant lncRNAs to the lncRNA-mRNA interaction network detected significantly enriched biological pathways involving neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, proteasome and chemokines. We show that GCC served as a complementary approach in detecting lncRNAs missed by the conventional linear models. A combination of GCC and linear models identified lncRNAs of diverse patterns of association enriched for GO biological and molecular functions meaningful in cognitive performance and cognitive decline. The novel lncRNA regulatory network further contributed to detect significant pathways implicated in cognition.",

    "abstract": "To assess the duration of the second stage of labor in twin pregnancies in relation to maternal and neonatal outcomes.\nA retrospective study between 2014 and 2020. Eligible cases were twin pregnancies that reached the second stage. The pre-defined groups were based on the total time spent in the second stage of labor; Group 1 (<1\u00a0h), group 2 (1-2\u00a0h), and group 3 (>2\u00a0h), which was considered the prolonged second stage group.\nAmong the 439 planned vaginal births, successful vaginal delivery of both twins was achieved in 63.8%. Prolonged second stage was observed in 25.8% (89/345). Nulliparity (odds ratio [OR] 7.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.5-13.4) and use of epidural analgesia (OR 5.45, 95% CI 1.2-24.7), were the only independent variables significantly associated with prolonged second stage. Prolonged second stage was associated with a greater risk of intrapartum cesarean delivery (32.6%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), combined delivery (10.1%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), chorioamnionitis (8.3%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and a admission to neonatal intensive care unit of at least one of the twins (30.3%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02).\nProlonged second stage of labor affects maternal and fetal outcome in twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "The last decades have witnessed a sudden increase in myopia incidence among youngsters that have been related to modern lifestyle along with the use of emerging technologies\u00a0affecting visual exposure. Increasing exposures to known risk factors for myopia, such as time spent indoors, close-distance work, or low-light conditions are thought to be responsible for this public health issue. In most cases, development of\u00a0myopia is secondary to a vitreous chamber enlargement, although the related mechanisms and the potential interaction between\u00a0central and peripheral retinal area remain unclear. For a better understanding, we performed a classical twin study where objective refractive error along 70\u00b0 of horizontal retinal arc was measured in 100 twin\u00a0pairs of university students, 78% of which showed manifest myopia. We found the variance of shared environmental origin (range 0.34 to 0.67) explained most of the objective refractive error variance within central 42\u00b0 of the retina (22\u00b0 temporal to 19\u00b0 nasal), whereas additive genetic variance (range 0.34 to 0.76) was predominant in the peripheral retinal\u00a0areas measured. In this sample of millennial university students, with a large prevalence of myopia, environmental exposures were mostly responsible for inter-individual variation in the retinal horizontal area surrounding the macula, while their relative weight on phenotypic variance was gradually descending, and replaced by the variance of genetic origin, towards the retinal periphery.",

    "abstract": "Very little research has investigated the effects of ultraendurance exercise on the bioenergetic status of muscle. The primary objective of this case study was to characterize the changes that occur in skeletal muscle mitochondria in response to a 100-km ultramarathon in monozygotic twins. A second objective was to determine whether mitochondrial function is altered by consuming a periodized low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet during training compared with a high-carbohydrate diet.\nOne pair of male monozygotic twins ran 100 km on treadmills after 4 wk of training on either a high-carbohydrate or periodized low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Muscle biopsies were collected 4 wk before the run, as well as 4 and 52 h postrun. Blood draws were also performed immediately before as well as 4 and 52 h after the run.\nFour hours postrun, respiratory capacity, citrate synthase activity, and mitochondrial complex protein content were decreased. Two days later, both twins showed signs of rapid recovery in several of these measures. Furthermore, blood levels of creatine phosphokinase, C-reactive protein, and aspartate transaminase were elevated 4 h after the run but partially recovered 2 d later.\nAlthough there were some differences between the twins, the primary finding is that there is significant mitochondrial impairment induced by running 100 km, which rapidly recovers within 2 d. These results provide ample rationale for future investigations of the effects of ultraendurance activity on mitochondrial function.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal experiences, including maternal stress, depression and anxiety, form crucial building blocks affecting the maturation of the foetal central nervous system. Previous research has examined foetal movements without considering effects of maternal mental health factors critical for healthy foetal development. The aim of this research is to assess the effects of maternal mental health factors on foetal twin compared with singleton movement profiles.\nWe coded foetal touch and head movements in 56 ultrasound scans, from a prospective opportunity sample of 30 mothers with a healthy pregnancy (mean gestational age 27.8\u00a0weeks for singleton and 27.2 for twins). At the ultrasound scan appointment, participants completed questionnaires assessing their stress, depression and anxiety.\nMaternal depression increased foetal self-touch significantly. In foetal twins, maternal stress significantly decreased and maternal depression significantly increased other twin touch. Maternal mental health factors affected the head movements of twins significantly more than singletons, with maternal depression decreasing head movement frequency for twins significantly.\nThese results indicate that maternal mental health might have an impact on types of body schemata formed in utero, in twin compared with singleton pregnancies. Future research needs to examine whether these prenatal effects affect postnatal differences in body awareness.",

    "abstract": "Twin girls born at term were noted to have hypertrophic and erythematous mucosal sulci extending from the posterior vaginal fourchette to the anterior ridge of the anus on their newborn exams. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational hypertension and dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy. No known traumas were sustained during delivery to either twin. Dermatology and obstetrics/gynecology were consulted who confirmed the diagnosis of perineal groove. Primary care follow-up was recommended, with referral to pediatric gynecology if the lesions did not epithelize by 2 years of age. Our case of perineal grooves is unique in that, to our knowledge, it is the first reported case of perineal grooves identified in both twins. Clinicians in the newborn nursery and primary care settings should perform routine genitourinary and anal examinations on all newborns to identify this benign lesion, which may limit misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatments, and invasive workups in the future.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies have long been used to infer heritability. Within the 'omics era, twin cohorts have even greater research potential. This study describes the formation of the UK IBD Twin Registry and analysis of concordance and environmental factors.\nTwin pairs with IBD were recruited by advertising via IBD charities and social media, re-tracing a dormant IBD database and clinician referral. Details of zygosity, concordance, disease history and environmental factors were assessed. Pair concordance was calculated, and environmental factors were analysed with logistic regression models adjusted for zygosity and concordance.\nNinety-one twin pairs were included in the analysis; forty-two with CD and forty-nine with UC. More MZ twin pairs with CD were concordant compared with DZ pairs, thus inferring heritability (Chi-sq. 15.6. P\u2009<\u20090.001). In UC, MZ concordance was also numerically greater. Cigarette smoking was predictive of CD (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.07 P\u2009=\u20090.02); there may be an independent association with cannabis smoking (OR 2.59 95% CI 0.89 to 7.55 P\u2009=\u20090.08). Breastfeeding was protective against UC (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25-0.93, P\u2009=\u20090.03), but not CD. Self-reports of less occurrences of gastroenteritis than peers were protective against future UC onset (OR 0.33 95% CI 0.15 to 0.74, P\u2009=\u20090.01). Method of delivery, parental attitudes towards hygiene and recall of diet did not impact future IBD concordance.\nThis study supports the heritability of IBD. Twin study analysis was able to elucidate environmental factors associated with IBD.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with high heritability, however, understanding the complexity of the underlying genetic basis has proven to be a challenging task. We hypothesized that dissecting the aberrations in alternative splicing (AS) and their effects on expression networks might provide insight. Therefore, we performed AS and co-expression analyses of total RNA isolated from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of two pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins with non-syndromic autism and their parents. We identified 183 differential AS events in 146 genes, seven of them being Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) Category 1-3 genes, three of which had previously been reported to be alternatively spliced in ASD post-mortem brains. Gene co-expression analysis identified 7 modules with 513 genes, 5 of which were SFARI Category 1 or Category 2 genes. Among differentially AS genes within the modules, ZNF322 and NR4A1 could be potentially interesting targets for further investigations.",

The prevalence of a thick artery-artery anastomosis was higher in sFGR III than in sFGR I or II (81.8%, 44.9% and 48.6%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.010). The placental territory discordance ratio was higher in sFGR II and III than in sFGR I (0.60 [0.17-0.88], 0.60 [0.01-0.80] and 0.50 [0.01-0.71], p\u00a0=\u00a00.001).\nCompared with sFGR I, the earlier onset time of sFGR II and III might be due to their higher placental territory discordance. The prevalence of thick artery-artery anastomoses was expected to be higher in sFGR III than in sFGR I or II.",

    "abstract": "Non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCLP) is the most common craniofacial birth defect. The etiology of NSCLP is complex with multiple genes and environmental factors playing causal roles. Although studies have identified numerous genetic markers associated with NSCLP, the role of epigenetic variation remains relatively unexplored. Because of their identical DNA sequences, monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for NSCLP are an ideal model for examining the potential contribution of DNA methylation to non-syndromic orofacial clefting. In this study, we compared the patterns of whole genome DNA methylation in six MZ twin pairs discordant for NSCLP. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) were identified in NSCLP candidate genes, including differential methylation in ",

    "abstract": "We examined interactions among genetic, biological, and ecological variables predicting externalizing behaviors in preschool and middle childhood. Specifically, we examined prediction of externalizing behaviors from birth complications and negative emotionality, each moderated by genetic risk for aggression and ecological risk factors of insensitive parenting and low family income. At ages 4 and 5\u00a0years, 170 twin pairs and 5 triplet sets (N\u2009=\u2009355 children) were tested; 166 of those children were tested again at middle childhood (M\u2009=\u20097.9\u00a0years). Multilevel linear modeling results showed generally that children at high genetic risk for aggression or from low-income families were likely to have high scores on externalizing, but for children not at high risk, those with increased birth complications or more negative emotionality had high scores on externalizing. This study underscores the importance of considering biological variables as moderated by both genetic and ecological variables as they predict externalizing behaviors across early childhood.",

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia has a significant long-term effect on the health of both mothers and babies. Preeclampsia-related pregnancy complications increase the morbidity and mortality of pregnant women and their fetuses by 5-8%. The recent advancement of assisted reproductive technology, combined with a rise in the number of elderly pregnant women, has resulted in pregnancy incidence with twins. Twins pregnant women have a 2-3 times greater risk of developing preeclampsia than singleton pregnant women, and it happens sooner and progresses faster. It is more severe and may appear in an atypical way. End-organ damage, such as renal failure, stroke, cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema, placental abruption, and cesarean section, are related maternal complications. Fetal growth retardation, stillbirth, and premature delivery with obstetric signs are all fetal complications. According to studies, all multiple pregnancies can take low-dose aspirin (60-150 mg) to minimize the risk of preeclampsia. To improve pregnancy outcomes and reduce the inherent risk of pregnancy with twins, twins should be handled as a high-risk pregnancy and treated differently than singletons. The literature on twin pregnancy with preeclampsia is the subject of this review. It will examine the current state of research on preeclampsia in pregnancy with twins, including the occurrence, diagnosis, and pathophysiological process. Moreover, the effect of pregnancy with twins on the perinatal outcome and pregnancy management of pregnancy with twins, including blood pressure management and preeclampsia prevention and treatment, is examined in this literature review. The goal is to figure out what kind of diagnosis and care you may need.",

    "abstract": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an imprinting disorder caused by (epi)genetic alterations. The incidence of monozygotic (MZ) twins in BWS is higher than in the general population. Most MZ twins with BWS are female and have phenotypical discordance: one twin is clinically diagnosed with BWS, while the other shows a mild or normal phenotype. The most frequent (epi)genetic alteration in MZ twins is loss of methylation of imprinting control region 2 (ICR2-LOM) at 11p15.5. Intriguingly, ICR2-LOM is usually found in the peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) of both twins, even if they are clinically discordant. Here, we present a rare pair of MZ dichorionic diamniotic female twins with BWS and concordant phenotypes (a Beckwith-Wiedemann spectrum score of 5 in each twin). Molecular analysis of genomic DNA from PBL revealed ICR2-LOM in one twin but not the other. Our analyses suggest that ICR2-LOM occurred between days 1 and 3 after fertilization, followed by twinning. We speculate that during embryogenesis, ICR2-LOM cells were distributed to the hematopoietic stem cells in different ratios in the two fetuses, and also to commonly affected tissues, such as the tongue, in similar ratios, although we were unable to analyze any tissues other than PBL.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes after initial management with retinal laser photocoagulation (RLP) versus intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection in identical twins with zone \u2160 aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (AP-ROP).\nIdentical female twins were born at a gestational age of 28 2/7 weeks, weighing 970 g and 1020 g. The twins were diagnosed with bilateral AP-ROP, referred to a different hospital due to unavilability of a neonatal intensive care unitand received different initial treatments. At a postmenstrual age of 32 6/7 weeks, the first-born infant underwent bilateral IVB (0.313 mg) injection, whereas the second-born infant received bilateral laser photocoagulation on the same day. To treat recurrence, the first-born infant underwent additional bilateral IVB reinjection at 10 weeks post-treatment, while the second-born infant underwent combined bilateral laser photocoagulation and IVB injection at 2 weeks post-treatment.After 10 years, the first-born infant's best corrected visual acuities (BCVAs) of the right and left eyes were 20/20 and 20/50, respectively. Both eyes showed complete retinal vascularization of the peripheral retina and an anatomically normal foveal contour on swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). However, the second-born infant's BCVAs of the right and left eyes were 20/50 and 1-m finger-counting, respectively. Both eyes of the second-born infant showed panretinal chorioretinal atrophy due to laser scars, a flattened foveal contour with thin epiretinal membrane in the right eye, and loss of foveal curvature in the left eye on SS-OCT images, 10 years after the initial treatment. Moreover, severe myopia and astigmatism were observed in both eyes of the second-born infant, compared with those of the first-born infant during follow-up.\nThese cases involving identical twins indicated that the effect of initial IVB injection for AP-ROP was superior to that of initial RLP in terms of functional and anatomical outcomes during a 10-year follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Twinning by pseudo-merohedry is a common phenomenon in small-mol-ecule crystallography. In cases where twin-component volume fractions are markedly different, structure solution is often no more difficult than for non-twinned structures of similar complexity. When twin-component volume fractions are similar, however, structure solution can be much more of a problem. This paper presents hints and tips for such cases by means of three worked examples. The first example presents the most common (and simplest) case of a two-component pseudo-ortho-rhom-bic twin. The second example describes structure solution of a reticular threefold pseudo-hexa-gonal twin that benefits from use of an unconventional space-group setting. The third example covers structure solution of a reticular fourfold pseudo-tetra-gonal twin. All three structures are ultimately shown to be monoclinic crystals that twin as a consequence of unit-cell metrics that mimic those of higher symmetry crystal systems.",

    "abstract": "An individualized innovative disease management is of great importance for people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) to cope with the complexity of this chronic, multidimensional disease. However, an individual state of the art strategy, with precise adjustment to the patient's characteristics, is still far from being part of the everyday care of pwMS. The development of digital twins could decisively advance the necessary implementation of an individualized innovative management of MS. Through artificial intelligence-based analysis of several disease parameters - including clinical and para-clinical outcomes, multi-omics, biomarkers, patient-related data, information about the patient's life circumstances and plans, and medical procedures - a digital twin paired to the patient's characteristic can be created, enabling healthcare professionals to handle large amounts of patient data. This can contribute to a more personalized and effective care by integrating data from multiple sources in a standardized manner, implementing individualized clinical pathways, supporting physician-patient communication and facilitating a shared decision-making. With a clear display of pre-analyzed patient data on a dashboard, patient participation and individualized clinical decisions as well as the prediction of disease progression and treatment simulation could become possible. In this review, we focus on the advantages, challenges and practical aspects of digital twins in the management of MS. We discuss the use of digital twins for MS as a revolutionary tool to improve diagnosis, monitoring and therapy refining patients' well-being, saving economic costs, and enabling prevention of disease progression. Digital twins will help make precision medicine and patient-centered care a reality in everyday life.",

    "abstract": "Congenital Zika virus syndrome (CZS) is associated with damage to neural progenitor cells by ZIKA virus infection. There are no accurate statistics on the percentage of pregnant mothers who have had babies affected by the syndrome. Few cases of discordant twins have been described in the literature and, therefore, we hypothesize that the genetic background of the progeny and/or mother may play a role in the fate of the syndrome. We performed a complete exome sequencing in a set of dizygotic individuals and their parents. After that, we selected discordant variants on the MTOR gene between the affected and unaffected twin and we observed a mutation (rs2295079), placed in a region restricted to proximal 5'-UTR, as a strong possible causal variant. In addition, in most brain tissues (including fetal brain) evaluated for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), this locus is strongly correlated with post-translational modifications of histones (promoter and enhancer marks) and hypersensitivity to DNAse I (open chromatin mark). Taken together, our data suggest that changes in the MTOR gene may be related to CZS. Additional functional studies should be carried out to prove how and why a MTOR mutation can predispose the fetus to the syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Meningiomas are the most common tumors of the central nervous system. Most meningiomas are benign and occur mainly in middle-aged women. Only a few cases of meningiomas in identical twins have been reported. Cyproterone acetate (Androcur\u00ae Bayer Healthcare SAS) (CPA) is an antiandrogenic progestin used to treat female hirsutism in some countries including France. We report a case of identical twin sisters who developed multiple, atypically located meningiomas in the setting of long-term CPA use. Eighteen-month follow-up showed spontaneous decrease of meningiomas after cessation of CPA. This case illustrates CPA's ability to induce development of atypically located meningiomas that differ even between identical twins, confirms benefit of surgical abstention, and raises questions regarding security of use of CPA.",

    "abstract": "The rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to infection with variable clinical presentations and a wide clinical spectrum. The disease was first reported in Wuhan, China in 2019 and has rapidly spread worldwide. Despite reports of dynamic changes in disease progression, clinical predictors of disease severity have been difficult to identify. The following case describing identical twins with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who had very different disease courses. These patients resided in the same home and shared many of the same comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and morbid obesity. Although twin 1 had higher inflammatory markers, white blood cell (WBC) and an arguably more complicated medical history in comparison to their identical twin, the patient experienced a milder and shorter disease course. This case highlights the need for identifying proper disease markers and predictors early in the clinical course in order to direct future management guidelines and timely treatment.",

    "abstract": "Due to the increased survival rates of patients with congenital heart defects (CHD), associated disorders are an increasing focus of research. Existing studies figured out an association between CHD and its treatment, and neurodevelopmental outcomes including motor competence impairments. All these studies, however, compared their test results with reference values or results of healthy control groups. This comparison is influenced by socioeconomic and genetic aspects, which do have a known impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes.\nThis study protocol describes a setting that aims to find out the role of CHD and its treatments on neurodevelopmental outcomes, excluding socioeconomic and genetic aspects. Only a twin comparison provides the possibility to exclude these confounding factors.\nIn a German-wide prospective cohort study, 129 twin siblings registered in the National Register for Congenital Heart Defects will undergo testing on cognitive function (Wechsler Intelligence Tests age-dependent: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, fourth edition; Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, fifth edition; and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, fourth edition) and motor competence (Movement Assessment Battery for Children, second edition). Additionally, the self-reported health-related quality of life (KINDL-R for children, Short Form 36 for adults) and the parent-reported strength and difficulties of the children (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, German version) will be assessed by standardized questionnaires. CHD data on the specific diagnosis, surgeries, transcatheter procedures, and additional medical information will be received from patient records.\nThe approval of the Medical Ethics Committee Charit\u00e9 Mitte was obtained in June 2018. After getting funded in April 2019, the first enrollment was in August 2019. The study is still ongoing until June 2022. Final results are expected in 2022.\nThis study protocol provides an overview of the study design's technical details, offering an option to exclude confounding factors on neurodevelopmental outcomes in patients with CHD. This will enable a specific analysis focusing on CHD and clinical treatments to differentiate in terms of neurodevelopmental outcomes of patients with CHD compared to twin siblings with healthy hearts. Finally, we aim to clearly define what is important to prevent patients with CHD in terms of neurodevelopmental impairments to be able to develop targeted prevention strategies for patients with CHD.\nGerman Clinical Trials Register DRKS00021087; https://tinyurl.com/2rdw8w67.\nDERR1-10.2196/26404.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twinning is a rare birth defect estimated to occur in about 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 births. The mechanism of conjoined twinning is not proven. Different forms of conjoined twinning are observed with the thoracopagus form being the most common. The rate of conjoined twinning is similar across all major populations. A dramatic malformation of this type would be an extraordinary occurrence leading people to reflect on the spiritual or supernatural nature of such an event. Therefore, it is not surprising that artifacts that seem to depict different forms of conjoined twins are seen across diverse cultures. In this article, we present a survey of these cultural artifacts including anatomic classification based on external anatomy and an exploration of the cultural and spiritual contexts associated with the artifacts. A key finding is that the most common form of conjoined twinning in the artifacts is parapagus (both dicephalus and diprosopus) in contrast to thoracopagus, the most common form in epidemiologic studies. Potential reasons for this difference are discussed. Evidence is presented to support the speculation that these objects represent artistic impressions of actual conjoined twinning events.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac digital twins (Cardiac Digital Twin (CDT)s) of human electrophysiology (Electrophysiology (EP)) are digital replicas of patient hearts derived from clinical data that match like-for-like all available clinical observations. Due to their inherent predictive potential, CDTs show high promise as a complementary modality aiding in clinical decision making and also in the cost-effective, safe and ethical testing of novel EP device therapies. However, current workflows for both the anatomical and functional twinning phases within CDT generation, referring to the inference of model anatomy and parameters from clinical data, are not sufficiently efficient, robust and accurate for advanced clinical and industrial applications. Our study addresses three primary limitations impeding the routine generation of high-fidelity CDTs by introducing; a comprehensive parameter vector encapsulating all factors relating to the ventricular EP; an abstract reference frame within the model allowing the unattended manipulation of model parameter fields; a novel fast-forward electrocardiogram (Electrocardiogram (ECG)) model for efficient and bio-physically-detailed simulation required for parameter inference. A novel workflow for the generation of CDTs is then introduced as an initial proof of concept. Anatomical twinning was performed within a reasonable time compatible with clinical workflows (<4h) for 12 subjects from clinically-attained magnetic resonance images. After assessment of the underlying fast forward ECG model against a gold standard bidomain ECG model, functional twinning of optimal parameters according to a clinically-attained 12 lead ECG was then performed using a forward Saltelli sampling approach for a single subject. The achieved results in terms of efficiency and fidelity demonstrate that our workflow is well-suited and viable for generating biophysically-detailed CDTs at scale.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a modular software design for the construction of computational modeling technology that will help implement precision medicine. In analogy to a common industrial strategy used for preventive maintenance of engineered products, medical digital twins are computational models of disease processes calibrated to individual patients using multiple heterogeneous data streams. They have the potential to help improve diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment for a wide range of medical conditions. Their large-scale development relies on both mechanistic and data-driven techniques and requires the integration and ongoing update of multiple component models developed across many different laboratories. Distributed model building and integration requires an open-source modular software platform for the integration and simulation of models that is scalable and supports a decentralized, community-based model building process. This paper presents such a platform, including a case study in an animal model of a respiratory fungal infection.",

    "abstract": "The non-Mendelian features of phenotypic variations within monozygotic twins are likely complicated by environmental modifiers of genetic effects that have yet to be elucidated. Here, we performed methylome and genome analyses of blood DNA from psychiatric disorder-discordant monozygotic twins to study how allele-specific methylation (ASM) mediates phenotypic variations. We identified that thousands of genetic variants with ASM imbalances exhibit phenotypic variation-associated switching at regulatory loci. These ASMs have plausible causal associations with psychiatric disorders through effects on interactions between transcription factors, DNA methylations, and other epigenomic markers and then contribute to dysregulated gene expression, which eventually increases disease susceptibility. Moreover, we also experimentally validated the model that the rs4854158 alternative C allele at an ASM switching regulatory locus of EIPR1 encoding endosome-associated recycling protein-interacting protein 1, is associated with demethylation and higher RNA expression and shows lower TF binding affinities in unaffected controls. An epigenetic ASM switching induces C allele hypermethylation and then recruits repressive Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), reinforces trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 and inhibits its transcriptional activity, thus leading to downregulation of EIPR1 in schizophrenia. Moreover, disruption of rs4854158 induces gain of EIPR1 function and promotes neural development and vesicle trafficking. Our study provides a powerful framework for identifying regulatory risk variants and contributes to our understanding of the interplay between genetic and epigenetic variants in mediating psychiatric disorder susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have reported an elevated risk of sickness absence (SA) and disability pension (DP) due to adverse psychosocial working conditions, yet the influence of age and familial factors on the associations have not been examined. We aimed to investigate associations between psychosocial working conditions and labour market marginalisation (LMM) in terms of unemployment, SA and DP adjusting for familial confounding and possible differences in these associations with different age groups and different unemployment and sick leave days.\nAll twins living in Sweden in 2001, aged 16-64 years and not on old-age pension or DP were included (n\u2009=\u200956,867). The twins were followed from 2002 to 2016 regarding unemployment, SA and DP. Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed for the whole sample, and for discordant twin pairs, in five age groups.\nEach one-unit increase in job demands and job control was associated with a lower risk of unemployment, SA and DP in all age groups. Moreover, each one-unit increase in social support was associated with an increased risk of 1-30 days unemployment in individuals older than 45 years and SA and DP. Social support decreased the risk of unemployment longer than 365 days in age groups 16-25 and 36-45 years. In the discordant twin pair analyses, the estimates attenuated towards statistical non-significance.\nEven though familial factors seem to influence the associations between psychosocial working conditions and LMM, improving psychosocial working conditions by for example promoting high job control and social support at workplace may reduce the risk of future short- and long-term LMM in all age groups.",

    "abstract": "Is it possible to identify monochorionic twin pregnancies before blastocyst transfer based on maternal or embryo characteristics registered by time lapse?\nA retrospective cohort study including women who received fertility treatment (n\u202f=\u202f6501) between 2010 and 2019 at two fertility clinics in central Denmark. The treatment resulted in 2239 pregnancies after single embryo transfer (SET) and, of those, 43 (1.92%) were monochorionic twins. Baseline characteristics, information on assisted reproductive technology and ultrasonic findings at gestational week 8 were collected on all women. Furthermore, a blinded time lapse annotation analysis was conducted by two independent laboratory technicians on a total of 85 embryos. A total of 22 embryos leading to monochorionic pregnancies were matched with 63 embryos leading to singleton pregnancies.\nA monochorionic twin rate of 1.92% was found. No significant difference was found in maternal age, the use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection compared with IVF, indication for treatment or other maternal characteristics. In the blinded annotation analysis, inner cell mass grade A was associated with an increased risk of twinning (P\u202f=\u202f0.04) in fresh embryos. The s3 division timing was found to be significantly shorter in fresh twin compared with singleton embryos (P\u202f=\u202f0.006). No other time lapse parameters were found to be characteristic of twin embryos.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first blinded annotation study to identify aspects in time lapse resulting in monochorionic twins after SET. Whether inner cell mass grade A and s3 reflect a biological background for monochorionic twinning merits further investigation.",

    "abstract": "A six-fold increase in congenital heart defects (CHD) exists among monochorionic (MC) twins compared to singleton or dichorionic twin pregnancies. Though MC twins share an identical genotype, discordant phenotypes related to CHD and other malformations have been described, with reported rates of concordance for various congenital anomalies at less than 20%. Our objective was to characterize the frequency and spectrum of CHD in a contemporary cohort of MC twins, coupled with genetic and clinical variables to provide insight into risk factors and pathophysiology of discordant CHD in MC twins. Retrospective analysis of all twins receiving prenatal fetal echocardiography at a single institution from January 2010 -March 2020 (N = 163) yielded 23 MC twin pairs (46 neonates) with CHD (n = 5 concordant CHD, n = 18 discordant CHD). The most common lesions were septal defects (60% and 45.5% in concordant and discordant cohorts, respectively) and right heart lesions (40% and 18.2% in concordant and discordant cohorts, respectively). Diagnostic genetic testing was abnormal for 20% of the concordant and 5.6% of the discordant pairs, with no difference in rate of abnormal genetic results between the groups (p = 0.395). No significant association was found between clinical risk factors and development of discordant CHD (p>0.05). This data demonstrates the possibility of environmental and epigenetic influences versus genotypic factors in the development of discordant CHD in monochorionic twins.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes (APS) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by the presence of autoimmune dysfunction of 2 or more endocrine glands and other non-endocrine organs. The components of the syndrome can manifest throughout life: in childhood-APS type 1 (the juvenile type) and in adulthood-APS type 2, 3, and 4 (the adult types). Adult types of APS are more common in clinical practice. It is a polygenic disease associated with abnormalities in genes encoding key regulatory proteins of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The search of for candidate genes responsible for mutations in adult APS is continuing. Genetic predisposition is insufficient for the manifestation of the APS of adults, since the penetrance of the disease, even among monozygotic twins, does not approach 100% (30-70%). The article presents the case of isolated Addison's disease and APS type 2 in monozygotic twins with a revealed compound heterozygosity in the candidate gene VTCN1.",

    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor occurring mainly in children and young adults. OS is usually seen in sporadic cases, and it is an extremely rare phenomenon in blood relatives, particularly among identical twins.\nThe present study reports three cases of OS occurring in only one of identical twins. The first case is a high-grade OS in the left proximal tibia of a 16-year-old girl, treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, en bloc resection, and reconstruction with a modular knee tumor prosthesis. The second one is a high-grade OS of the left proximal tibia of a 6-year-old girl. The patient was treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, en bloc resection, and reconstruction with inactived autograft. The third one is a conventional OS of the right proximal tibia of a 20-year-old woman. She was treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, en bloc resection, and reconstruction with a custom-made prosthesis.\nThe occurrence of OS in one of identical twins is a relatively rare event but may present the best opportunity to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis and progression of this disease in humans. A longer follow-up period and regular imaging evaluation are needed to confirm whether the identical twin of these patients will suffer OS in the future.",

    "abstract": "Chronic intervillositis of unknown etiology (CIUE) is a rare, poorly understood, histopathological diagnosis of the placenta that is frequently accompanied by adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, and intrauterine fetal death. CIUE is thought to have an immunologically driven pathophysiology and may be related to human leukocyte antigen mismatches between the mother and the fetus. Dizygotic twins with one-sided CIUE provide an interesting context to study the influence of immunogenetic differences in such cases. The main immune-cell subsets were investigated using immunohistochemistry. We identified three dizygotic twin pregnancies in which CIUE was present in only one of the two placentas. Two of the pregnancies ended in term delivery and one ended in preterm delivery. Presence of CIUE was correlated with lower placental weight and lower birthweight. Relative number of CD68, CD56, CD20, and CD3 positive cells were comparable between co-twins. The presence of one-sided CIUE in dizygotic twin pregnancy was associated with selective growth restriction in the affected twin. This suggests a unique fetal immunogenetic contribution to the pathogenesis of CIUE. Further study of dizygotic and monozygotic placentas affected by CIUE could identify new insights into its pathophysiology and into the field of reproductive immunology.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to describe preterm birth (PTB) rates, subtypes, and risk factors in twins compared with singletons to better understand reasons for the decline in PTB rate between 2007 and 2011.\nThis was a retrospective population-based analysis using the California linked birth certificates and maternal-infant hospital discharge records from 2007 to 2011. The main outcomes were overall, spontaneous (following spontaneous labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes), and medically indicated PTB at various gestational age categories: <37, <32, and 34 to 36 weeks in twins and singletons.\nAmong the 2,290,973 singletons and 28,937 twin live births pairs included, overall PTB <37 weeks decreased by 8.46% (6.77-6.20%) in singletons and 7.17% (55.31-51.35%) in twins during the study period. In singletons, this was primarily due to a 24.91% decrease in medically indicated PTB with almost no change in spontaneous PTB, whereas in twins indicated PTB declined 7.02% and spontaneous PTB by 7.39%.\nRecent declines in PTB in singletons appear to be largely due to declines in indicated PTB, whereas both spontaneous and indicated PTB declined in twins.\n\u00b7 The declines in PTB noted between 2006 and 2014 occurred in both singleton and twins.. \u00b7 Declines were mostly in medically indicated PTB.. \u00b7 Interventions proposed as causing the declines in singletons would not apply to twins..",

    "abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a serious life-threatening birth defect characterized by abnormal development in the muscular or tendinous portion of the diaphragm during embryogenesis. Despite its high incidence, the etiology of CDH hasn't been fully understood. Genetic factors are important in pathogenesis; however, few single genes have been definitively implicated in human CDH. SLIT1, SLIT2, and SLIT3 (slit guidance ligand) are three human homologs of the drosophila Slit gene. They interact with roundabout (Robo) homolog receptors to affect cell migration, adhesion, cell motility, and angiogenesis and play important roles in cell signaling pathways including the guidance of axons. In this report, we presented dizygous twin babies with CDH related to the SLIT3 gene variant. Previous studies showed that Slit3 null mice had congenital diaphragmatic hernias on or near the ventral midline portion of the central tendon. This is the first report of homozygous SLIT3 variant associated with CDH in humans.",

We discuss two exemplar applications that motivate challenges and opportunities for scaling digital twins, and that underscore potential barriers to wider adoption of this technology.",

    "abstract": "A unifying mathematical formulation is needed to move from one-off digital twins built through custom implementations to robust digital twin implementations at scale. This work proposes a probabilistic graphical model as a formal mathematical representation of a digital twin and its associated physical asset. We create an abstraction of the asset-twin system as a set of coupled dynamical systems, evolving over time through their respective state spaces and interacting via observed data and control inputs. The formal definition of this coupled system as a probabilistic graphical model enables us to draw upon well-established theory and methods from Bayesian statistics, dynamical systems and control theory. The declarative and general nature of the proposed digital twin model make it rigorous yet flexible, enabling its application at scale in a diverse range of application areas. We demonstrate how the model is instantiated to enable a structural digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The digital twin is calibrated using experimental data from a physical UAV asset. Its use in dynamic decision-making is then illustrated in a synthetic example where the UAV undergoes an in-flight damage event and the digital twin is dynamically updated using sensor data. The graphical model foundation ensures that the digital twin calibration and updating process is principled, unified and able to scale to an entire fleet of digital twins.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and big data are consistently called upon to analyze and comprehend many facets of modern daily life. AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms. Our goal in this review is to assess the progress toward the use of digital twin technology in livestock farming, with the goal of revolutionizing animal husbandry in the future.",

    "abstract": "To describe methods of risk assessment in twins with retinoblastoma (RB).\nA case series of four RB probands with a twin sibling. Family status, clinical presentation, and RB1 germline status-based risk assessment were analyzed.\nTwo pairs had a positive family history (unilateral and bilateral RB in one of the parents (#1 and #2, respectively) and two pairs (#3 and #4) were sporadic. One of the familial twins (#1) had a high risk (90%) of manifesting RB in the twin. The other case (#2) with an absent RB1 germline mutation in the twin had a 0% risk of developing RB. Among sporadic cases of twins (#3), genetic testing did not identify a germline mutation (tumor sample unavailable) in the proband which downgraded the risk of germline mutation from 15% to <1%. The twin never developed RB (5 years of age at last follow-up). Pathogenic mosaicism for germline RB1 mutation (c.1723C>T) could be identified (tumor tissue available) in the proband (# 4). Identical germline mutation (and RB tumor) was also noted in the twin. In each case, there was concordance between the assessed risk and manifestation of RB.\nAssessment of risk of RB in a twin presents with a unique challenge. Depending upon the genotype variant, the risk of developing RB can vary from 0% to 90%. In addition to family history, clinical manifestation in the proband, zygosity status, and RB1 germline status are critical in formulating risk-appropriate surveillance guidelines.",

    "abstract": "This secondary qualitative analysis identified metaphorical expressions mothers of twins used to describe their first year caring for their infants. Data from the primary grounded theory study were reanalyzed using metaphor identification procedure and revealed eight metaphors: blur, life on hold, being an orchestrator, being a juggler, being an equalizer, being a quick-change artist, being a milk factory, and open invitation. These metaphors give clinicians an insider's view of the struggle's mothers of twins experience during the first year after birth. Being attentive to the metaphors mothers used can provide a unique approach to helping them. Lactation consultants are key to providing much needed support for mothers who are breastfeeding twins.",

    "abstract": "Twins provide a valuable perspective for exploring the pathological mechanism of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We aim to analyze differences in the topological properties of the white matter (WM) network between monozygotic twins with ASD (MZCo-ASD) and children with typical development (TD). We enrolled 67 subjects aged 2-9\u202fyears. Twenty-three pairs of MZCo-ASD and 21 singleton children with TD completed clinical assessments and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Graph theory was used to compare the topological properties of the WM network between the two groups, and analyzed their correlations with the severity of clinical symptoms. We found that the global efficiency (Eg) of MZCo-ASD is weaker than that of TD children, while the shortest path length (Lp) of MZCo-ASD is longer than that of TD children, and MZCo-ASD have three unique hubs (the bilateral dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus and right insula). Eg and Lp were both correlated with the repetitive behavior scores of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) in the MZCo-ASD group, and the nodal efficiency of the dorsal superior frontal gyrus (SFGdor) was correlated with the ADI-R scores of repetitive behaviors. Left SFGdor nodal efficiency was correlated with Repetitive Behavior and Communication, two core symptoms of autism. The results implicated that MZCo-ASD had atypical brain structural network attributes and node distributions. Using MZCo-ASD, we found that the WM topological properties that correlate with the severity of ASD core symptoms were Eg, Lp, and the nodal efficiency of the SFGdor.",

    "abstract": "Brain injury of the surviving twin from monochorionic pregnancies following intrauterine fetal demise during the second and third trimesters is a rare but severe complication. Monochorionicity and gestational age at the time of stillbirth seem to be decisive factors in terms of long-term neurologic outcome prediction for the survivor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in particular, seem to bring the earliest and most accurate diagnosis. Ultrasound detection of brain damage is possible in later stages of fetal brain injury. It is essential to provide early diagnosis and multidisciplinary counsel to the parents to ensure informed decision making. For couples who choose to terminate pregnancy legislation related to late abortion might lead to further distress. Our paper aims to stress the importance of MRI DWI in the evaluation of surviving twins following single intrauterine fetal demise in monochorionic pregnancies and the delicate context of the medical professionals and parents facing this clinical situation, sometimes complicated by legal constraints.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have evaluated the differences in duration of latency and clinical outcomes between singleton and twin pregnancies after preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM); however, these data are limited to single-institution analyses and based on small sample sizes. The aim of this study was to assess differences in latency and clinical outcomes in singletons versus twin gestations affected by PPROM in a large, diverse cohort of women.\nThis is a secondary analysis of a multicenter trial of magnesium for neuroprotection in women at high risk of preterm birth. Our study included women with PPROM \u2265 24 weeks with singleton and twin gestations. We compared singleton versus twin gestation and our primary outcome was duration of latency after PPROM. Secondary outcomes included selected perinatal and neonatal outcomes including long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. We fit a linear regression model to assess independent risk factors for latency duration.\nOur study included 1,753 women, 1,602 singleton gestations (91%) and 151 twin gestations (9%). The median latency period was significantly shorter in twins (4 [interquartile range, IQR: 1-10] vs. 7 [IQR: 3-16] days, \nTwin gestations affected by PPROM had shorter latency, earlier delivery, and higher rates of short- and long-term morbidity. Despite having longer latency, singleton gestations did not have higher rates of complications associated with expectant management.\n\u00b7 Twins affected by PPROM had shorter latency duration and earlier gestational at delivery.. \u00b7 Twins with PPROM had higher rates of both short- and long-term perinatal morbidity.. \u00b7 Rates of chorioamnionitis and abruption did not differ between twins and singletons with PPROM..",

    "abstract": "The autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are common neuropsychiatric conditions of childhood for which the vast proportion of population risk is attributable to inheritance, and for which there exist few if any replicated biomarkers.\nThis commentary summarizes a set of recent studies involving identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins which, taken together, have significant implications for the search for biomarkers of inherited susceptibility to autism. A first is that variation-in-severity of the condition (above the threshold for clinical diagnosis) appears more strongly influenced by stochastic/non-shared environmental influences than by heredity. Second is that there exist disparate early behavioral predictors of the familial recurrence of autism, which are themselves strongly genetically influenced but largely independent from one another. The nature of these postnatal predictors is that they are trait-like, continuously distributed in the general population, and largely independent from variation in general cognition, thereby reflecting a developmental substructure for familial autism. A corollary of these findings is that autism may arise as a developmental consequence of an allostatic load of earlier-occurring liabilities, indexed by early behavioral endophenotypes, in varying permutations and combinations. The clinical threshold can be viewed as a \"tipping point\" at which stochastic influences and/or other non-shared environmental influences assert much stronger influence on variation-in-severity (a) than do the genetic factors which contributed to the condition in the first place, and (b) than is observed in typical development.\nBiomarkers identified on the basis of association with clinical symptom severity in ASD may reflect effects rather than causes of autism. The search for biomarkers of pathogenesis may benefit from a greater focus on traits that predict autism recurrence, among both clinical and general populations. In case-control studies, salient developmental liabilities should be systematically measured in both\u00a0cases and controls, to avoid the erosion in statistical power (i.e., to detect differences) that can occur if control subjects carry sub-clinical aggregations of the same unmeasured traits\u00a0that exert causal influences on the development of autism.",

    "abstract": "The fish abnormal embryonic development has attracted public attention in the recent few years. In this study, an iTRAQ proteomic analysis of mosquitofish between conjoined twins and normal fishes is applied for the first time by using the genome database of mosquitofish. Three thousand four hundred ninety proteins were identified with 304 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). One hundred six differentially upregulated proteins (DUPs) and 198 differentially downregulated proteins (DDPs) were identified between the conjoined twins and normal mosquitofish groups. Notably, the proteins related to lipid and proteolysis were the important GO terms for the DUPs while response to light stimulus and response to radiation were the most enriched GO terms for the DDPs. The proteins related to lysosome, apoptosis, autophagy, and phagosome were the functional KEGG pathway for the DUPs while most of the pathways were related to cardiovascular for the DDPs. This study expatiated a pivotal protein profile between the conjoined twins and normal mosquitofish which can provide a conference for fish embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "We sought to perform a comprehensive review of reported cases of conjoined thoracopagus twins with cardiovascular conjunction to determine the overall survival after separation and factors that might be associated with survival. We performed a systematic review of cases of thoracopagus twins with conjoined cardiovascular systems reported in the English medical literature using Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. We employed standard statistical methods to analyze differences among groups. We identified 102 unique cases of thoracopagus twins (69% female) with some degree of cardiovascular conjunction who had undergone surgical separation. We identified 6 distinct types of cardiovascular union. Median age was 47\u00a0days (IQR 12, 120). Survival to at least hospital discharge occurred in 51% (105/204). Median age at separation was lower in emergent (9\u00a0days, IQR 1, 25) versus elective cases (93\u00a0days, IQR 49, 180) (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Survival to hospital discharge was higher in those who underwent elective separation (70%, 93/132 total children versus 17%, 12/72) (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Survival was associated with the type of cardiovascular union (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The separation of thoracopagus twins with cardiovascular conjunction is higher than expected. Increased survival is associated with elective separation, older age, and shared pericardium only. These findings suggest survival could be improved with better delineation of degree of union and delayed separation.",

    "abstract": "Molecular switches are chemical compounds exhibiting the possibility of reversible transformations between their different forms accompanied by a modification in their properties. Among these, switching of multi-addressable Benzazolo-OXazolidines (BOXs) from a closed form to an open form results in drastic modifications in their linear and nonlinear optical properties. Here, we target molecules containing two identical BOX units (DiBOX) connected by different \u03c0-conjugated linkers, and we combine synthesis, UV/visible absorption, and hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) measurements, together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Three derivatives have been considered, which differ by the linker: (i) a bithiophene moiety (Bt), (ii) two 3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene (EDOT) units, and (iii) a triad composed of an EDOT-thiophene-EDOT sequence (TtO). As a matter of fact, these systems can adopt three states (CF-CF, POF-POF, and CF-POF) depending on the closed form (CF) or the protonated open form (POF) of each BOX unit. Despite chemical equivalence, stepwise switching of such systems under the addition of a chemical acid or an oxidant has been experimentally evidenced for two of them (DiBOX-Bt and DiBOX-TtO). Then, DFT calculations show that the first BOX opening leads to the formation of a push-pull \u03c0-conjugated segment, exhibiting a huge increase in the first hyperpolarizability (\u03b2) and a bathochromic shift with respect to the fully closed form. On the contrary, the second BOX opening induces not only a slight bathochromic shift but also a reduction in their \u03b2 values conferring the great and uncommon abilities to modulate their linear and nonlinear properties over three discrete levels. Among these results, those on DiBOX-Bt agree with the experimental data obtained by HRS measurements and further shed light on their structure-property relationship.",

    "abstract": "DYT-TOR1A is caused by a GAG deletion in the TOR1A gene. While it usually manifests as early-onset dystonia, its phenotype is extremely diverse, even within one family. Recent reports have revealed that some DYT-TOR1A cases have novel mutations in the TOR1A gene while others have mutations in both TOR1A and another DYT gene (THAP1 or SGCE). Our understanding of the correlation between genotype and phenotype is becoming increasingly complicated.\nHere, we report on monozygotic twins who developed dystonia in childhood. The two children had different presentations in terms of onset age and dominant disturbances, but both exhibited marked diurnal fluctuation and jerking movements of the limbs as well as levodopa/levodopa-carbidopa responsiveness. These features are commonly associated with DYT/PARK-GCH1 and DYT-SGCE, yet these twins had no mutations in the GCH1 or SGCE genes. Whole exome sequencing eventually revealed a single GAG deletion in the TOR1A gene.\nMonozygotic twins whose only mutation was a GAG deletion in TOR1A exhibited DYT/PARK-GCH1-asssociated features and jerking movements reminiscent of myoclonus. This finding may expand the spectrum of phenotypes associated with DYT-TOR1A, and suggests that levodopa has potential as a treatment for DYT-TOR1A with DYT/PARK-GCH1-associated features.",

    "abstract": "Pentalogy of Cantrell (POC) is an extremely rare syndrome with an estimated incidence of 1:65,000 to 200,000 live births. Its complete form includes a midline epigastric abdominal wall defect, defects affecting the lower sternum, anterior diaphragm, diaphragmatic pericardium, and various intracardiac defects.\nWe report a case of complete POC affecting only the first-born of a set of premature dizygotic twins.\nA giant omphalocele with an eviscerated liver and bowel on prenatal, obstetric ultrasonography at 24 gestational weeks was observed. At birth, physical examination confirmed a massive (10\u200a\u00d7\u200a8\u200acm) epigastric omphalocele in which a significant part of the liver was seen. A postnatal echocardiogram revealed the presence of an ostium secundum atrial septal defect, perimembranous ventricular septal defect, and moderate pulmonary stenosis. X-ray showed an abnormal intrathoracic positioned stomach, which was confirmed with a plain x-ray of the upper intestinal tract with hydrosoluble contrast. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the sternum's absence and a close connection between the pericardial sac and the stomach wall.\nThe patient underwent surgical intervention at 18\u200adays of age.\nDespite adequate and appropriate postoperative treatment, the baby rapidly deteriorated and died 72\u200ahours after surgery.\nPOC is a complex, high-mortality syndrome whose management requires a multidisciplinary approach and meticulous planning. Despite all efforts, POC carries a poor prognosis, particularly in patients affected by its complete form.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins of adult Korean females were created as a tool to evaluate and compare the sagittal relationship between the maxillary central incisors and the forehead before and after orthodontic treatment.\nDigital twins were reconstructed for a total of 50 adult female patients using facial scans and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. The anteroposterior position of the maxillary central incisor and the forehead inclination were measured.\nThe control group presented a mean of 6.7 mm for the sagittal position and 17.5\u00b0 for forehead inclination. The study group showed a mean of 9.3 mm for the sagittal position and 13.6\u00b0 for forehead inclination. Most Korean females seeking orthodontic treatment had their maxillary central incisor anterior to the glabella. In contrast, fewer Korean females who completed their orthodontic treatments had their maxillary central incisor anterior to the glabella. Furthermore, patients who had completed the orthodontic treatment were more likely to have the maxillary central incisor between the forehead facial axis and glabella.\nThe use of digital twins for three-dimensional (3D) analysis of the profile implies a high clinical significance. In addition, as the facial profile of Koreans is different from that of Caucasians, careful consideration should be made when setting treatment goals for the anteroposterior position of the maxillary central incisors.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the current study was to identify the optimal cutoff that should define discordance in dichorionic twin gestations through correlation with abnormal placental pathology as a specific measure of fetal growth restriction of the smaller twin.\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study of all women with dichorionic twin pregnancies who gave birth in a single center between 2002 and 2015. We investigated the association between the level of growth discordance and maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) pathology in the placenta of the smaller twin, with and without adjustment for whether the smaller twin is small for gestational age (SGA).\nA total of 1,198 women with dichorionic twin gestation met the study criteria. The rate of MVM pathology in the placenta of the smaller twin increased with the level of discordance and was most obvious for discordance \u226525% (rate of MVM 12.0% compared with 2.8% in cases with discordance <10%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] 3.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.97-6.99). When the analysis was adjusted for SGA of the smaller twin, discordance was independently associated with MVM pathology only when growth discordance was \u226525% (aRR 2.18, 95%-CI 1.01-4.93), while SGA was strongly associated with MVM pathology irrespective of the level of discordance.\nOur findings suggest that discordant growth in dichorionic twins should raise the concern of fetal growth restriction of the smaller twin, irrespective of whether the smaller twin is SGA, only when the discordance s \u226525%. The association of lower levels of discordance with abnormal placental pathology is mainly driven by the confounding effect of SGA of the smaller twin.",

    "abstract": "Differences in drawing development are conditioned by genetics, environment and individuality of children. Therefore, it is exciting to observe the drawing development in children, who are raised in the same environment and have a similar genetic basis, that is in twins, triplets, and so forth. In the study, we were interested in the similarities and differences in the drawing development of the triplets, two of which were identical twins (B1 and B2) and one was non-identical (A), and whether the characteristics of the drawing appear more congruently between B1 and B2 than with A. We proposed two hypotheses: H1: There are more similarities in drawings between identical twins (B1 vs B2) than between identical and non-identical one (A vs B1 and A vs B2); H2: The differences between non-identical and identical triplets are less pronounced at the beginning of the drawing development (in doodle phase) and become more distinctive in later development, in drawing of figure and space. We analysed 123 drawings that the triplets (41 drawings of each triplet) drew from 1 to 12 years of age at the same time and on the same topic. The results of our research have shown that both hypotheses can be confirmed. On the general level, there are more similarities in drawing between identical twins compared to non-identical ones; and the differences and similarities become more distinctive throughout the development, especially in figure drawing and in the depiction of space.",

    "abstract": "Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare chronic B-cell lymphoma. Familial clustering of WM has been observed over the years. However, little is known about the contribution of inherited genetic variants to familial WM cases.\nThe authors performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of germline DNA samples from twins, one diagnosed with WM and the other diagnosed with immunoglobulin M monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and their healthy siblings. Bioinformatics analysis of public biological databases was used to identify the most relevant familial WM candidate from WES. Transcript expression and protein levels of the familial WM candidate were evaluated in the WM patient and 2 unaffected members of the kindred.\nAmong the 10 shared candidate mutations in the twins, the authors identified a novel heterozygous germline mutation in four and a half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2; c.G226A, p.V76M) as a familial WM-associated mutation. FHL2 appeared to be connected with reported signaling pathways and disease-driving genes such as IL6 and HCK in WM. In addition, the authors found reduced FHL2 messenger RNA and protein expression in peripheral blood samples from the patient with WM in comparison with the healthy siblings.\nTaken together, these findings indicate that an FHL2\nFamilial clustering in Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia (WM) has been observed over the years.

Also, messenger RNA and protein expression of FHL2 was significantly lower in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the WM patient in comparison with the healthy siblings, and this suggested that the function of FHL2 was impaired when mutated.",

    "abstract": "Selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) in monochorionic twin pregnancies is associated with greater morbidity and mortality for both fetuses when compared to singleton and dichorionic pregnancies. This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the perinatal outcomes of monochorionic twin pregnancies affected by this disorder and conducted expectantly, by analyzing the results according to the end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery Doppler of the smaller twin (type I: persistently forward/type II: persistently absent or reversed/type III: intermittently absent or reversed). Seventy-five monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies with sIUGR were included in this study. sIUGR was defined by estimated fetal weight below the 3rd centile for gestational age, or below the 10th centile, when associated with at least one of the following three criteria: abdominal circumference below the 10th percentile, umbilical artery pulsatility index of the smaller twin above the 95th percentile, or estimated fetal weight discordance of 25% or more. Perinatal outcomes were analyzed from the prenatal period to hospital discharge and included perinatal death, neurological injury, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and sepsis. The mortality rate was 1.33% in this cohort. The overall morbidity rate was lower in type I twin pregnancies. In conclusion, this study shows that sIUGR type I has lower morbidity than types II and III in expectant management.",

    "abstract": "Describe the pre-operative and post-operative stages of physical therapy examination, rehabilitation interventions and outcomes in craniopagus conjoined twins (CCT).\n27-months old total vertical types III CCT were admitted for surgical treatment. A structured rehabilitation program (functional mobility, balance training, sensory stimulation, communication, orthotic management, and caregiver education) was delivered post-operatively at different stages of surgery. The total duration of post-separation rehabilitation was 15\u2009months for Twin A and 23\u2009months for Twin B.\nPre-operative WeeFIM was 67/126 for both the twins. Post-separation, Twin A improved to a state of complete independence in walking, step climbing, and hand function with a discharge WeeFIM score of 84/126. However, Twin B was completely dependent in bed mobility and transfer activities during discharge (WeeFIM-18/126). Minimal change in functional status was noted in Twin B (discharge FSS score-19/30). Both the twins were transferred to a regional hospital for long-term care. At 67\u2009months of age, Twin B lost his life due to chest infection.\nVestibular based therapies, balance, and postural control may be prioritized in the rehabilitation process of CCT. Greater communication and coordination among physical, occupational therapists and other rehabilitation professionals are recommended for successful outcome in these unique cases.",

    "abstract": "China's One-Child Policy (1979-2015) limited rural families to two children and urban families to one child. This practice, which led to the abandonment of hundreds of thousands of female infants, is indirectly responsible for the separate placement of infant twins. The availability of this sample launched the first prospective study of these pairs. Participants include families and twins comprising 15 monozygotic (MZA) pairs and 7 dizygotic (DZA) pairs from countries throughout the world. The research program is described, and the initial wave of IQ scores for MZA and DZA twin pairs is examined in the first comprehensive report from this study. The twins' mean age at participation was 9.41\u00a0years (SD\u00a0=\u00a06.36), and their ages ranged from 3.19 to 24.98\u00a0years. Informative contrasts with adopted-together Chinese twins and virtual twins (same-age unrelated individuals reared together) highlight shared genetic and environmental effects on intellectual development. Applied directions based on findings from these novel samples are described.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies of physical exercise for Asian twins are sparse. This study aimed to examine genetic and environmental influences on frequency of vigorous exercise (FVE) in South Korean twins, with a special emphasis on sex effects. Telephone interviews on FVE were administered to 1757 twins (mean age = 19.05 years, SD = 3.01 years). Tetrachoric correlations were significantly different between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins in males (.40 vs. .12), but they were similar in females (.44 vs. .45), suggesting the importance of genetic factors in FVE in males and that of common environmental factors in females. A scalar sex-limitation model incorporating age as a modifier was applied to data. The results revealed that genetic, common and individual environmental influences did not vary significantly with age, but differed across two sexes, confirming twin correlational analyses. In the best-fitting model, additive genetic and individual environmental influences on FVE were, respectively, .35 (95% CI [.26, .39]) and .65 (95% CI [.61, .74]) in males, and common and individual environmental influences were, respectively, .45 (95% CI [.35, .53]) and .55 (95% CI [.47, .65]) in females. These results contrasted starkly with recent findings from a large sample of Chinese adult twins (age >18 years), in which most variance (\u226595%) of vigorous physical activity was attributable to common environmental influences in both sexes. Replications in other Asian samples are clearly needed.",

An emerging development is the possibility of using simulations to obtain a more or less representative reproduction of organs or even entire persons. Such simulations are framed and discussed using the term 'digital twin'. This paper unpacks and scrutinises the current use of such digital twins in medicine and the ideas embedded in this practice. First, the paper maps the different types of digital twins. A special focus is put on the concrete challenges inherent in the interactions between persons and their digital twin. Second, the paper addresses the questions of how far a digital twin can represent a person and what the consequences of this may be. Against the background of these two analytical steps, the paper defines first conditions for digital twins to take on an ethically justifiable form of representation.",

    "abstract": "Males have a lower prevalence of depression than females and testosterone may be a contributing factor. A comparison of opposite-sex and same-sex twins can be used indirectly to establish the role of prenatal testosterone exposure and the risk of depression. We therefore aimed to explore differences in depression risk using opposite-sex and same-sex twins.\nWe included 126 087 opposite-sex and same-sex twins from the Danish Twin Registry followed in nationwide Danish registers. We compared sex-specific incidences of depression diagnosis and prescriptions of antidepressants between opposite-sex and same-sex twins using Cox proportional hazard regression.\nDuring follow-up, 2664 (2.1%) twins were diagnosed with depression and 19 514 (15.5%) twins had purchased at least one prescription of antidepressants. First, in male twins, we found that the opposite-sex male twins had the same risk of depression compared to the same-sex male twins {hazard ratio (HR) = 1.01 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-1.17)]}. Revealing the risk of use of antidepressants, the opposite-sex male twins had a slightly higher risk of 4% (HR = 1.04 (95% CI 1.00-1.11)) compared with the same-sex male twins. Second, in the female opposite-sex twins, we revealed a slightly higher, however, not statistically significant risk of depression (HR = 1.08 (95% CI 0.97-1.29)) or purchase of antidepressants (HR = 1.01 (95% CI 0.96-1.05)) when compared to the same-sex female twins.\nWe found limited support for the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to testosterone was associated with the risk of depression later in life.",

    "abstract": "Locked twins is a rare and hazardous obstetric complication, which occurs in approximately 1:100 twin pregnancies. One of the known etiologic factors for locked twins is size of the twins. We report a case of chin-to-chin locked twins that occurred at gestational age of 30\u00a0weeks pus 6\u00a0days. A 27 years-old primigravida Oromo mother presented with a history of pushing down pain and passage of liquor of 6 hours duration at gestational age of 30\u00a0weeks plus 6\u00a0days. With a diagnosis of twin pregnancy (first twin non-vertex), abdominal delivery was decided in latent first stage of labor but mother refused caesarian delivery and she was allowed to labor with the hope of achieving a vaginal delivery. In second stage, interlocking twin was encountered and a low vertical cesarean section was done to effect delivery of twins without the need to decapitate the first twin.\nLocked twin is a rare obstetric complication. Whenever it is encountered, successful delivery can be achieved without the need to have decapitation of the first twin during caesarian section.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the length of the second stage of labor in twin deliveries and to compare the length of the second stage in twin and singleton gestations.\nThis is a retrospective cohort study from three large hospitals in Israel. Clinical data were collected from the electronic medical record. The primary outcome was the length of the second stage (the time from documented 10-cm dilation until spontaneous vaginal delivery of the first twin). Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the association of clinical factors with the length of the second stage. The length of the second stage in twin and singleton pregnancies was compared.\nFrom 2011 to June, 2020, there were 2,009 twin deliveries and 135,217 singleton deliveries. Of the twin deliveries, 655 (32.6%) of the patients were nulliparous (95th percentile length of the second stage 3 hours and 51 minutes), 1,235 (61.5%) were parous (95th percentile 1 hour 56 minutes), and 119 (5.9%) were grand multiparous (five or more prior deliveries) (95th percentile 1 hour 24 minutes). In women delivering twins, epidural use was associated with a statistically significant increase in the length of the second stage of 40 minutes in nulliparous patients and 15 minutes in parous patients. In all groups, the length of the second stage was longer in patients delivering twins compared with singletons. Second-stage length longer than the 95th percentile in twins was associated with admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and need for phototherapy.\nSecond-stage labor is longer in twins than singletons and is associated with obstetric history. Normal ranges for the second stage may be useful in guiding clinical practice.",

Of the twin deliveries, 655 (32.6%) of the patients were nulliparous (95th percentile length of the second stage 3 hours and 51 minutes), 1,235 (61.5%) were parous (95th percentile 1 hour 56 minutes), and 119 (5.9%) were grand multiparous (five or more prior deliveries) (95th percentile 1 hour 24 minutes). In women delivering twins, epidural use was associated with a statistically significant increase in the length of the second stage of 40 minutes in nulliparous patients and 15 minutes in parous patients. In all groups, the length of the second stage was longer in patients delivering twins compared with singletons. Second-stage length longer than the 95th percentile in twins was associated with admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and need for phototherapy.",

    "abstract": "Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a multifactorial disease, where the relative burden of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors in clinical course and damage accrual is not yet definitively clarified. In clinical practice, there is a real need for useful candidate biomarkers in PsA diagnosis and disease progression, by exploring its underlying transcriptomic and epigenomic mechanisms. This work aims to profile the transcriptome in monozygotic (MZ) twins with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) highly concordant for clinical presentation, but discordant for the radiographic outcomes' severity.\nWe describe i) the clinical case of two MZ twins; ii) their comparative gene expression profiling (HTA 2.0 Affymetrix) and iii) signal pathways and pathophysiological processes in which differentially expressed genes are involved (in silico analysis by the IPA software, QIAGEN).\nOne hundred sixty-three transcripts and 36 coding genes (28 up and 8 down) were differentially expressed between twins, and in the brother with the most erosive form, the transcriptomic profiling highlights the overexpression of genes known to be involved in immunomodulatory processes and on a broad spectrum of PsA manifestations.\nTwins' clinical cases are still a gold mine in medical research: twin brothers are ideal experimental models in estimating the relative importance of genetic versus nongenetic components as determinants of complex phenotypes, non-Mendelian and multifactorial diseases as PsA.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus pandemic has placed renewed focus on expanded access (EA) programs to provide compassionate use exceptions to the waves of patients seeking medical care in treating the novel disease. While commendable, justifiable, and compassionate, EA programs are not designed to collect the necessary vital clinical data that can be later used in the New Drug Application process before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In particular, they lack the necessary rigor of properly crafted and controlled randomized controlled trials (RCT) which ensure that each patient closely monitored for side effects and other potential dangers associated with the drug, that the data is documented, stable and are traceable and that the patient population is well defined with the defined target condition. Overall, while RCTs is deemed to be of the most reliable methodologies within evidence-based medicine, morally, however, they are problematic in EA programs. Nevertheless, actionable data ought to be collected from EA patients. To this end, we look to the growing incorporation of real-world data real-world evidence as increasingly useful substitutes for data collected via RCTs, including the ethical, legal and social implications thereof. Finally, we suggest the use of digital twins as an additional method to derive causal inferences from real-world trials involving expanded access patients.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to explore the raters' agreement and the effect of raters' and targets' gender on self- and parental intelligence assessments in the sample of Croatian twins. Twins were asked to assess their own and their parents' overall intelligence, as well as specific abilities from the Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. Data was analysed to explore: i) twins' agreement in parental assessments and behavioural genetic analysis of the overall intelligence estimates; ii) gender differences in self- assessments; and iii) raters' and targets' gender effects on parental assessments. The twins' mean correlation in their assessments of overall parental intelligence was .60. The differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twin correlations were nonsignificant for all of the estimated abilities, and model fitting analysis indicates that hypothesis about genetic effect on parental assessment of intelligence should be rejected. The hypotheses about males' higher self-assessments for overall intelligence and for the masculine types of abilities - logical-mathematical, body-kinesthetic and spatial abilities - were confirmed. For the feminine types of abilities - verbal/linguistic, inter- and intra- personal intelligences - there were no significant gender effects. Both target and rater effect were found for the parental estimates of intelligence. Fathers were estimated higher on overall intelligence, logical-mathematical, body-kinesthetic and spatial abilities, while mothers were estimated higher on interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence. The effect of the raters' gender was found for overall intelligence as well as for inter- and intra- personal intelligences, where males gave higher estimates of parental intelligences than females.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare mesenchymal cancers that affect the gastrointestinal tract and are most often located in the stomach and proximal small intestine. The most common molecular genetic abnormalities underlying GIST carcinogenesis are mutations in the tyrosine kinase gene (KIT) and in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene. To the best of our knowledge, no cases have been reported so far of synchronous diagnosis of GIST in 2 monozygotic twins presenting with clinical and morphological features of sporadic disease. CASE REPORT This report presents the cases of 2 monozygotic twin sisters who were diagnosed with GIST at the same age and who had different KIT exon 11 tumor mutational statuses. In the current report, the screening examination that led to early detection of GIST in one of the sisters was not motivated by any symptom, but by a GIST diagnosis in her twin a few days before. The literature was reviewed for pathological and molecular features associated with prognosis and treatment response. Furthermore, we identified identical genotypes of KIT and PDGFRA polymorphisms in the DNA of both tumors that might be present in the germline DNA. The present case supports the implementation of specific cancer screening in the context of monozygotic twins, regardless of identification of the genetic components involved. CONCLUSIONS Our report suggests that monozygotic twins with GIST can have different mutational statuses for KIT and PDGFRA. Referral for special screening should be considered for individuals who have a monozygotic twin diagnosed with cancer.",

    "abstract": "This is a case report of monozygotic twins discordant for hypospadias, where the afflicted twin, a 33-year-old male, needed extensive redo urethral reconstruction. A two-stage reconstruction was planned by using the twin brother's prepuce. The scarred urethra was replaced by the isograft, and one year later the second stage was completed. At five-year follow-up, there was good cosmesis, and the index patient reported excellent voiding and no fistulae or stenosis. Despite its rarity, foreskin transplantation between discordant monozygotic twins is possible and offers a unique and durable management opportunity.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease of heart muscle, which affects \u223c1 in 500 individuals and is characterized by increased left ventricular wall thickness. While HCM is caused by pathogenic variants in any one of eight sarcomere protein genes, clinical expression varies considerably, even among patients with the same pathogenic variant. To determine whether background genetic variation or environmental factors drive these differences, we studied disease progression in 11 pairs of monozygotic HCM twins. The twin pairs were followed for 5 to 14 y, and left ventricular wall thickness, left atrial diameter, and left ventricular ejection fraction were collected from echocardiograms at various time points. All nine twin pairs with sarcomere protein gene variants and two with unknown disease etiologies had discordant morphologic features of the heart, demonstrating the influence of nonhereditable factors on clinical expression of HCM. Whole genome sequencing analysis of the six monozygotic twins with discordant HCM phenotypes did not reveal notable somatic genetic variants that might explain their clinical differences. Discordant cardiac morphology of identical twins highlights a significant role for epigenetics and environment in HCM disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Considering genetic influence on brain structure and function, including motor control, we report a case of right-handed monozygotic twins with atypical organization of fine motor movement control that might imply genetic influence. Structural and functional organization of the twins' motor function was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), fMRI with a motor-task paradigm, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. TMS revealed that both twins presented the same unexpected activation and inhibition of both motor cortices during volitional unilateral fine hand movement. The right ipsilateral corticospinal tract was weaker than the left contralateral one. The motor-task fMRI identified activation in the left primary motor cortex and bilateral secondary motor areas during right-hand (dominant) movement and activation in the bilateral primary motor cortex and secondary motor areas during left-hand movement. Based on DTI tractography, both twins showed a significantly lower streamline count (number of fibers) in the right corticospinal tract compared with a control group, which was not the case for the left corticospinal tract. Neither twin reported any difficulty in conducting fine motor movements during their activities of daily living. The combination of TMS and advanced neuroimaging techniques identified an atypical motor control organization that might be influenced by genetic factors. This combination emphasizes that activation of the unilateral uncrossed pyramidal tract represents an alternative scheme to a \"failure\" of building a standard pattern but may not necessarily lead to disability.",

    "abstract": "EEG microstate analysis investigates the collection of distinct temporal blocks that characterize the electrical activity of the brain. Brain activity within each microstate is stable, but activity switches rapidly between different microstates in a nonrandom way. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric model that concurrently estimates the number of microstates and their underlying behaviour. We use a Markov switching vector autoregressive (VAR) framework, where a hidden Markov model (HMM) controls the nonrandom state switching dynamics of the EEG activity and a VAR model defines the behaviour of all time points within a given state. We analyze the resting-state EEG data from twin pairs collected through the Minnesota Twin Family Study, consisting of 70 epochs per participant, where each epoch corresponds to 2 s of EEG data. We fit our model at the twin pair level, sharing information within epochs from the same participant and within epochs from the same twin pair. We capture within twin-pair similarity, using an Indian buffet process, to consider an infinite library of microstates, allowing each participant to select a finite number of states from this library. The state spaces of highly similar twins may completely overlap while dissimilar twins could select distinct state spaces. In this way, our Bayesian nonparametric model defines a sparse set of states that describe the EEG data. All epochs from a single participant use the same set of states and are assumed to adhere to the same state switching dynamics in the HMM model, enforcing within-participant similarity.\nL\u2019analyse des micro-\u00e9tats d\u2019un \u00e9lectroenc\u00e9phalogramme (EEG) porte sur une collection de diff\u00e9rents blocs temporels caract\u00e9risant l\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00e9lectrique du cerveau. L\u2019activit\u00e9 c\u00e9r\u00e9brale est stable \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de chaque bloc, mais elle varie rapidement entre les diff\u00e9rents micro-\u00e9tats de fa\u00e7on non al\u00e9atoire. Les auteurs proposent un mod\u00e8le bay\u00e9sien non param\u00e9trique qui estime simultan\u00e9ment le nombre de micro-\u00e9tats et leur comportement sous-jacent. Ils utilisent le cadre de vecteurs autor\u00e9gressifs (VAR) markoviens commutants o\u00f9 un mod\u00e8le de Markov cach\u00e9 (MMC) contr\u00f4le les dynamiques de commutations non al\u00e9atoires de l\u2019activit\u00e9 de l\u2019EEG et le mod\u00e8le de VAR d\u00e9finit le comportement \u00e0 travers le temps pour un \u00e9tat donn\u00e9. Ils analysent des donn\u00e9es d\u2019EEG au repos de paires de jumeaux collect\u00e9es dans l\u2019\u00e9tude des jumeaux du Minnesota comportant 70 \u00e9poques de deux secondes d\u2019EEG chacune pour chaque participant. Les auteurs ajustent leur mod\u00e8le au niveau des paires de jumeaux, partageant les informations d\u2019un participant et de son jumeau pour une m\u00eame \u00e9poque. Ils capturent les similarit\u00e9s dans la paire de jumeaux avec un processus du buffet indien afin de constituer une biblioth\u00e8que infinie de micro-\u00e9tats et de permettre \u00e0 chaque participant de choisir un ensemble fini d\u2019\u00e9tats provenant de celle-ci. L\u2019espace d\u2019\u00e9tats de jumeaux tr\u00e8s semblables peut se chevaucher enti\u00e8rement alors que des jumeaux diff\u00e9rents pourraient avoir des espaces distincts. Le mod\u00e8le bay\u00e9sien non param\u00e9trique des auteurs d\u00e9finit ainsi un ensemble creux d\u2019\u00e9tats qui d\u00e9crivent les donn\u00e9es d\u2019EEG. Toutes les \u00e9poques d\u2019un m\u00eame participant utilisent le m\u00eame ensemble d\u2019\u00e9tats, et elles doivent adh\u00e9rer au m\u00eame r\u00e9gime de changement d\u2019\u00e9tat pour leur dynamique de commutation selon le MMC, for\u00e7ant ainsi une similarit\u00e9 intra-participant.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins represent a rare congenital malformation. Pygopagus twins are fused at the sacrum and perineum, with union of the spine. The authors report a successful separation of a unique case of pygopagus twins sharing a U-shaped spinal cord, which the authors identified through aberrant nerves by intraoperative physiological spinal root examination.\nThe 6-month-old male pygopagus conjoined twins, who were diagnosed in the prenatal period, underwent separation. They had a single dural sac containing a U-shaped continuous spinal cord; their filum terminale appeared completely fused and the anatomical border of the spinal cord was not distinguishable. A triggered electromyogram (tEMG) was used on each nerve root to determine which belonged to one twin versus the other, to detect nerve cross, and to identify functional midline cleavage. Finally, the twins were separated after spinal division. Both twins recovered uneventfully with no lower limb neurological deficits or walking impairment for 16 months.\nPygopagus twins with a conjoined spinal cord are very rare, but a good long-term functional prognosis can be expected with successful separation. Intraoperative tEMG is useful in spinal separation surgery for twins with a conjoined spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "Tibial hemimelia is a relatively rare congenital tibial longitudinal deficiency (approximately 1 per 1 million live births), unilateral or bilateral, with a relatively intact fibula. Hemimelia results from a disruption of the lower limb developmental field during embryogenesis due to slow or even abort of chondrification process, which results in leg length discrepancy. Affected leg commonly appears short and deformed with knee, ankle, and foot involvement. It may present with a variety of associated anomalies. Surgical treatment varies according to the type and degree of deformity, and reconstructive interventions are still limited. Reported cases of tibial hemimelia are very infrequent, especially tibial hemimelia in twins. Usually, the cases were in single embryo or less frequently in one of the monozygotic twins, but no reported cases regarding tibial hemimelia in one of the dizygotic twins as this article reports.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and physical inactivity are major global public health concerns, both of which increase the risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Regulation of glucose homeostasis involves cross-talk between the central nervous system, peripheral tissues, and gut microbiota, and is affected by genetics. Systemic cross-talk between brain, gut, and peripheral tissues in glucose homeostasis: effects of exercise training (CROSSYS) aims to gain new systems-level understanding of the central metabolism in human body, and how exercise training affects this cross-talk.\nCROSSYS is an exercise training intervention, in which participants are monozygotic twins from pairs discordant for body mass index (BMI) and within a pair at least the other is overweight. Twins are recruited from three population-based longitudinal Finnish twin studies, including twins born in 1983-1987, 1975-1979, and 1945-1958. The participants undergo 6-month-long exercise intervention period, exercising four times a week (including endurance, strength, and high-intensity training). Before and after the exercise intervention, comprehensive measurements are performed in Turku PET Centre, Turku, Finland. The measurements include: two positron emission tomography studies (insulin-stimulated whole-body and tissue-specific glucose uptake and neuroinflammation), magnetic resonance imaging (brain morphology and function, quantification of body fat masses and organ volumes), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (quantification of fat within heart, pancreas, liver and tibialis anterior muscle), echocardiography, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue biopsies, a neuropsychological test battery as well as biosamples from blood, urine and stool. The participants also perform a maximal exercise capacity test and tests of muscular strength.\nThis study addresses the major public health problems related to modern lifestyle, obesity, and physical inactivity. An eminent strength of this project is the possibility to study monozygotic twin pairs that share the genome at the sequence level but are discordant for BMI that is a risk factor for metabolic impairments such as insulin resistance. Thus, this exercise training intervention elucidates the effects of obesity on metabolism and whether regular exercise training is able to reverse obesity-related impairments in metabolism in the absence of the confounding effects of genetic factors.\nClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03730610 .

    "abstract": "We investigated how the COVID-19 crisis and the extraordinary experience of lockdown affected young adults in England and Wales psychologically. One month after lockdown commenced (T2), we assessed 30 psychological and behavioural traits in more than 4000 twins in their mid-twenties and compared their responses to the same traits assessed in 2018 (T1). Mean changes from T1 to T2 were modest and inconsistent. Contrary to the hypothesis that major environmental changes related to COVID-19 would result in increased variance in psychological and behavioural traits, we found that the magnitude of individual differences did not change from T1 to T2. Twin analyses revealed that while genetic factors accounted for about half of the reliable variance at T1 and T2, they only accounted for\u2009~\u200915% of individual differences in change from T1 to T2, and that nonshared environmental factors played a major role in psychological and behavioural changes. Shared environmental influences had negligible impact on T1, T2 or T2 change. Genetic factors correlated on average .86 between T1 and T2 and accounted for over half of the phenotypic stability, as would be expected for a 2-year interval even without the major disruption of lockdown. We conclude that the first month of lockdown has not resulted in major psychological or attitudinal shifts in young adults, nor in major changes in the genetic and environmental origins of these traits. Genetic influences on the modest psychological and behavioural changes are likely to be the result of gene-environment correlation not interaction.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to characterize plasma concentrations of pregnancy-associated glycoprotein (PAG) and progesterone (P4) as predictors of twins and pregnancy loss in Holstein cows with high-risk pregnancies. High-risk pregnancy was characterized using transrectal ultrasonography 37 d after artificial insemination (AI) based on the following criteria: small embryo size <15 mm, n = 10), slow heartbeat (<60 beats per minute, n = 11), and extra-amniotic membrane (additional amniotic membrane, n = 3). A cohort of twins (n = 41) diagnosed at d 37 post-AI was also enrolled. Each high-risk and twin pregnancy cow was paired with a cow of the same parity carrying a normal singleton at d 37 post-AI (control, n = 65). Blood samples were collected to measure PAG and P4 at d 37, 44, and 51 post-AI. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA, logistic regression, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve with JMP software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Pregnancy loss at d 51 post-AI was greater in high-risk pregnancies than in controls and twins (control = 1.5%; high-risk = 87.5%; twins = 12.2%). Concentration of PAG at d 37 post-AI did not differ among groups (control = 5.3 \u00b1 0.7; high-risk = 4.8 \u00b1 1.2; twins = 4.0 \u00b1 0.9 ng/mL). Concentration of P4 at d 37 post-AI was greater in twins than in high-risk pregnancies and control, and lesser in high-risk pregnancies than in controls (control = 7.0 \u00b1 0.3; high-risk = 5.9 \u00b1 0.4; twins = 8.4 \u00b1 0.3 ng/mL). Regression and ROC analysis for PAG at d 37 post-AI did not find a threshold to predict pregnancy loss or twins. Regression and ROC analysis for P4 at d 37 post-AI found that a threshold of 6.5 ng/mL predicted pregnancy loss with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.64, and a threshold of 7.2 ng/mL predicted twins with AUC of 0.71. In summary, pregnancy loss and twins were predicted with only moderate accuracy by P4 concentration at d 37 post-AI, and the variability in PAG concentrations at d 37 post-AI was not sufficient to generate a threshold to predict pregnancy loss and twins in Holstein lactating cows.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent internalizing problems such as anxiety and depression have been associated with subsequent educational underachievement. However, it has not been investigated if the association is accounted for by neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs, i.e., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, developmental coordination disorder, tic disorder, learning disorder). This study is the first to describe the relationship between internalizing problems at age 15 and educational outcomes in later adolescence while controlling for a wide range of NDDs in childhood, and applying a genetically sensitive design. We used the nation-wide population-based Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden, comprising 4997 fifteen-year-old Swedish twins born between 1994 and 1998. Internalizing problems and NDDs were measured with parental report. Educational outcomes were merit rating and upper secondary education eligibility, retrieved from the National School Register. Internalizing problems at age 15 were found to be negatively associated with educational outcomes in later adolescence. Additive genetics accounted for 89% of the covariation between internalizing problems and merit rating, out of which roughly half were unique genetic effects of internalizing problems and the remaining half due to NDDs. In conclusion, internalizing problems form an important risk factor for subsequent educational underachievement, going beyond the risk conferred by childhood NDDs.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins, also known as monovular twins, share an identical genetic heritage because they are two individuals who derive from the same zygote. For this reason, they have been considered indistinguishable. They represent a limit for the application of markers and analytical methods that are routinely used in forensic science because analyses of DNA fragments (short tandem repeats analysed by capillary electrophoresis) are unable to distinguish monozygotic twins. The recent introduction of ultra-deep next generation sequencing in forensic genetics, also known as massively parallel sequencing, has made it possible to identify a number of genetic variations through genome sequencing (such as copy number variations, single nucleotide polymorphisms and DNA methylation) that make it possible to distinguish monozygotic twins. Here, we present a case of ascertaining biological paternity, in which the alleged father had a monozygotic twin brother. This case led to the examination of international law in similar cases in which the only available biological evidence derives from classical forensic genetic analysis, performed with short tandem repeat (autosomal and/or gonosomal) capillary electrophoresis and the probative value, if recognised, of the next generation sequencing technology in the courtroom.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused due to impaired peroxisome assembly affecting the formation of functional peroxisomes. PBDs are caused by a mutation in PEX gene family resulting in disease manifestation with extreme variability ranging from the onset of profound neurologic symptoms in newborns to progressive degenerative disease in adults. Disease causing variations in PEX7 is known to cause severe rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 and PBD 9B, an allelic disorder resulting in a milder phenotype, often indistinguishable from that of classic Refsum disease. This case report highlights the variability of PEX7 related phenotypes and suggests that other than RCDP1 and late onset phenotype similar to Refsum disease, some cases present with cataract and neurodevelopmetal abnormalities during childhood without chondrodysplasia or rhizomelia. This report also underlines the importance of considering PBD 9B in children presenting with neurodevelopmental abnormalities especially if they have congenital cataract.",

    "abstract": "The present work was undertaken to study the genetic contribution to the start of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with amyloid and tau biomarkers in cognitively intact older identical twins.\nWe studied in 96 monozygotic twin-pairs relationships between amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) aggregation as measured by the A\u03b21-42/1-40 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 126) and positron emission tomography (PET, n = 194), and CSF markers for A\u03b2 production (beta-secretase 1, A\u03b21-40, and A\u03b21-38) and CSF tau. Associations among markers were tested with generalized estimating equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age, gender, and apolipoprotein E \u03b54 genotype. We used twin analyses to determine relative contributions of genetic and/or environmental factors to AD pathophysiological processes.\nTwenty-seven individuals (14%) had an abnormal amyloid PET, and 14 twin-pairs (15%) showed discordant amyloid PET scans. Within twin-pairs, A\u03b2 production markers and total-tau (t-tau) levels strongly correlated (r range = 0.73-0.86, all p\u2009<\u20090.0001), and A\u03b2 aggregation markers and 181-phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) levels correlated moderately strongly (r range = 0.50-0.64, all p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Cross-twin cross-trait analysis showed that A\u03b21-38 in one twin correlated with A\u03b21-42/1-40 ratios, and t-tau and p-tau levels in their cotwins (r range = -0.28 to 0.58, all p\u2009<\u2009.007). Within-pair differences in A\u03b2 production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range = 0.49-0.61, all p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that A\u03b2 production and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early AD.\nOur results suggest a substantial genetic/shared environmental background contributes to both A\u03b2 and tau increases, suggesting that modulation of environmental risk factors may aid in delaying the onset of AD pathophysiological processes.

    "abstract": "Newborns are at high risk for identification errors due to their inability to speak and indistinguishable features. To reduce this risk, The Joint Commission requires hospitals to use a distinct identification method for newborns. Most hospitals create medical records for newborns at birth using temporary naming conventions, resulting in patients with similar identifiers. Typically, multiple-birth infants are distinguished from their siblings by a single character (1, 2, or A, B), placing them at higher risk for identification errors, which can delay care and compromise patient safety.\nWe present 2 unrelated cases involving naming errors in sets of infant twins receiving care in a healthcare system using Joint Commission compliant distinct temporary naming convention.\nIn the 2 cases, system failures contributed to naming errors in 2 sets of infant twins, which resulted in delayed care. In the first case, twins were inadvertently assigned the same temporary name. In the second case, an infant's blood specimen label did not include a single character, which distinguishes a multiple-birth infant from their sibling. Further safeguards are needed to reduce this risk. These cases illustrated the potential for misidentification related to newborn naming conventions during the registration process, especially between siblings of multiple-birth infants.\nFurther research is needed to determine strategies to prevent newborn identification errors. Potential strategies to reduce this risk and protect newborns include improving the design of newborn identifiers, systems-level interventions such as verification alerts, and improved registration processes.",

In the first case, twins were inadvertently assigned the same temporary name. In the second case, an infant's blood specimen label did not include a single character, which distinguishes a multiple-birth infant from their sibling. Further safeguards are needed to reduce this risk. These cases illustrated the potential for misidentification related to newborn naming conventions during the registration process, especially between siblings of multiple-birth infants.",

    "abstract": "Craniopagus conjoined twins are extraordinarily rare and present unique challenges to the multidisciplinary team. There is a paucity of literature on optimizing neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation in craniopagus twins. Herein, we present our enhanced neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation and management in 17-month-old male craniopagus twins, uniquely using handheld optical coherence tomography (OCT) plus portable slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy and modified forced-choice preferential looking assessment. Staged surgical separation was supported by enhanced neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation, detailed radiology, three-dimensional printing and virtual reality simulation. This represents the fourth separation of craniopagus twins by our unit.",

    "abstract": "Adverse prenatal conditions can exert a long-lasting impact in later life.\nThirty-eight post-pubertal monozygotic twin pairs (16 female pairs) with divergent birthweight (bw) due to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome were examined at a median of 15.1 years. Auxological and endocrine parameters were measured. To evaluate effects of intra-twin bw and hormone differences on mental health, adolescents and their parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), identifying psychological problems. Twins answered the questionnaire on health-related quality of life (HrQoL, KIDSCREEN-52).\nParents attributed a higher number of psychological challenges to the formerly smaller twins, for example, total difficulties (8.8 vs. 6.5, p = 0.009). Differences in bw were associated with differences in parental evaluation of problems, for example, peer relationship problems (r = -0.57 and p = 0.0001). In contrast, bw differences did not affect subjects' self-assessment of psychological factors but on physical well-being (r = 0.42, p = 0.017). The formerly smaller discordant twins showed significantly lower HrQoL regarding psychological well-being (24.9 vs. 26.6, T1,15 = -2.2, and p = 0.043) and moods and emotions (29.8 vs. 32.0, T1,15 = -2.3, p = 0.039). Higher concentrations of androstenedione were linked to greater psychological well-being (r = 0.39 and p = 0.036) in all twin pairs.\nOur results show that the prenatal environment leading to bw differences exerts a long-lasting impact on diverging parental evaluation of mental health. Formerly smaller discordant twins showed significantly lower HrQoL regarding psychological well-being and moods and emotions. Higher androstenedione concentrations were linked to greater psychological well-being.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins (DTs) technology has recently gained attention within the research community due to its potential to help build sustainable smart cities. However, there is a gap in the literature: currently no unified model for city services has been proposed that can guarantee interoperability across cities, capture each city's unique characteristics, and act as a base for modeling digital twins. This research aims to fill that gap. In this work, we propose the DT-DNA model in which we design a city services digital twin, with the goal of reflecting the real state of development of a city's services towards enhancing its citizens' quality of life (QoL). As it was designed using ISO 37120, one of the leading international standards for city services, the model guarantees interoperability and allows for easy comparison of services within and across cities. In order to test our model, we built DT-DNA sequences of services in both Quebec City and Boston and then used a DNA alignment tool to determine the matching percentage between them. Results show that the DT-DNA sequences of services in both cities are 46.5% identical. Ground truth comparisons show a similar result, which provides a preliminary proof-of-concept for the applicability of the proposed model and framework. These results also imply that one city performs better than the other. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to compare cities based on the proposed DT-DNA and, using Boston and Quebec City as a case study, demonstrate that Boston has better services towards enhancing QoL for its citizens.",

    "abstract": "The effects of assisted reproductive technology on the outcomes of twin pregnancies are controversial. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the maternal and perinatal outcomes of twin pregnancies conceived spontaneously and those conceived by assisted reproductive technology.\nThis was a cross-sectional study performed at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). Data on twin pregnancies (conceived spontaneously and by in vitro fertilization [IVF]/intracytoplasmic sperm injection [ICSI]) were obtained from the National Birth Registry of China for the period between 1 October 2016, and 30 September 2017. The primary obstetric outcomes were compared between twin pregnancies conceived by different methods. Logistic regression analysis with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was used for the multivariate analysis.\nA total of 3270 twin pregnancies (2003 and 1209 conceived spontaneously and by IVF/ICSI, respectively) were identified. The proportion of twin pregnancies among all pregnancies was 3.4% (3332/97\u00a0278). Multiple regression analysis indicated that the incidences of gestational diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u00a0=\u00a01.42, 95% CI 1.10-1.83, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), preterm premature rupture of membranes (AOR\u00a0=\u00a01.65, 95% CI 1.21-2.25, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), placenta accreta spectrum (AOR\u00a0=\u00a02.12, 95% CI 1.42-3.17, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and postpartum hemorrhage (AOR\u00a0=\u00a01.38, 95% CI 1.02-1.86, p\u00a0=\u00a00.037) were significantly higher in the IVF/ICSI group than in the natural pregnancy group. Multivariate analysis also revealed that conception mode was not an independent risk factor for neonate outcomes.\nIn twin pregnancies, IVF/ICSI is independently associated with multiple maternal complications, including gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm premature rupture of membranes and placenta accreta spectrum compared with spontaneous conception, although potential residual confounders due to indications for assisted reproductive technology exist.",

    "abstract": "Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is thought to negatively affect lung development resulting in increased respiratory morbidity. However, research performed in singletons is often limited by a certain level of bias caused by individual differences in genetic constitution, obstetrical and maternal factors.\nRespiratory morbidity was compared between the smaller and the larger twin in monochorionic twins with selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR), defined as a birth weight discordance \u2265 20%, born in our center between 2010 and 2019 in this retrospective study. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) was diagnosed based on the clinical picture of a neonate with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and/or surfactant, confirmed by a chest X-ray. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was diagnosed when the neonate required treatment with >21% oxygen for at least 28 days.\nMedian gestational age at birth for the 94 included pregnancies was 32.4 (IQR 30.4-34.3) weeks. Within-pair analyses showed that the prevalence of RDS was lower in the smaller twin compared to the larger twin, 19.1% (18/94) vs 34.0% (32/94), respectively (\nDespite being genetically identical, sFGR twins have different respiratory outcomes.

    "abstract": "Recently, new loci related to body mass index (BMI) or blood pressure (BP) have been identified respectively in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, limited studies focused on jointly associated genetic variance between systolic pressure (SBP), diastolic pressure (DBP) and BMI. Therefore, a bivariate twin study was performed to explore the genetic variants associated with BMI-SBP, BMI-DBP and SBP-DBP. A total of 380 twin pairs (137 dizygotic pairs and 243 monozygotic pairs) recruited from Qingdao Twin Registry system were used to access the genetic correlations (0.2108 for BMI-SBP, 0.2345 for BMI-DBP, and 0.6942 for SBP-DBP, respectively) by bivariate Cholesky decomposition model. Bivariate GWAS in 137 dizygotic pairs nominated 27 single identified 27 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) for BMI and SBP, 27 QTNs for BMI and DBP, and 25 QTNs for SBP and DBP with the suggestive P-value threshold of 1\u00d710-5. After imputation, we found eight SNPs, one for both BMI-SBP and SBP-DBP, and eight for SBP-DBP, exceed significant statistic level. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis identified rs4794029 as new significant eQTL in tissues related to BMI and SBP. Also, we found 6 new significant eQTLs (rs4400367, rs10113750, rs11776003, rs3739327, rs55978930, and rs4794029) in tissues were related to SBP and DBP. Gene-based analysis identified nominally associated genes (P < 0.05) with BMI-SBP, BMI-DBP, and SBP-DBP, respectively, such as PHOSPHO1, GNGT2, KEAP1, and S1PR5. In the pathway analysis, we found some pathways associated with BMI-SBP, BMI-DBP and SBP-DBP, such as prion diseases, IL5 pathway, cyclin E associated events during G1/S transition, TGF beta signaling pathway, G \u03b2\u03b3 signaling through PI3K\u03b3, prolactin receptor signaling etc. These findings may enrich the results of genetic variants related to BMI and BP traits, and provide some evidences to future study the pathogenesis of hypertension and obesity in the northern Chinese population.",

    "abstract": "Shared anomalies, always located close to the area of coalescence and observable in virtually every type of conjoined twinning, are currently seen as separate anomalies caused by mostly unknown and seemingly unrelated pathways rather than being connected to the twinning mechanism itself. Therefore, most (case) reports about conjoined twins are mere descriptions of (external) dysmorphologies lacking reflections on the possible origin of their concomitant anomalies. As we will demonstrate in this article, shared anomalies are influenced, and in some cases solely and sequentially explained, by interaction aplasia and neo-axial orientation; two embryological mechanisms to which each set of conjoined twins is subjected and are responsible for their ultimate phenotypical fate. In this review, we consider how the ventral, lateral and caudal conjunction types and their intermediates determine the phenotypic presentation of the twins, including patterns of shared malformations and anomalies, which in themselves can be indistinguishable from those encountered in singleton cases. Hence, it can be hypothesized that certain anomalies in singletons originate in a fashion similar to that in conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "To describe the birth prevalence, temporal trends, and clinical outcomes of twins, triplets, or quadruplets with cerebral palsy (CP).\nThis was a cross-sectional study using data for twins, triplets, and quadruplets with prenatally or perinatally acquired CP and pooled from the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe network (born 1992-2009) and Australian Cerebral Palsy Register (born 1993-2009). Children were at least 4 years old at time of registration. Children born in regions with population ascertainment and available denominator data were included in prevalence calculations (n=1033 twins, 81 triplets, and 11 quadruplets). Clinical data from children registered in all participating registers were described, including 2163 twins (56% male), 187 triplets (59% male), and 20 quadruplets (45% male).\nThe birth prevalence of CP was higher with increasing plurality (twins 6.5 per 1000 live births [95% confidence interval {CI} 6.1-6.9], triplets 17.1 [95% CI 13.6-21.2], quadruplets 50.7 [95% CI 25.6-88.9]); however, prevalence by gestational age was similar across all pluralities. Between 1992-1994 and 2007-2009, prevalence of CP among twins declined (p=0.001) but prevalence of CP among triplets did not change significantly over time (p=0.55). The distributions of Gross Motor Function Classification System, epilepsy, and impairments of intellect, vision, and hearing were similar regardless of plurality.\nThe data combined from two CP register networks indicated that triplets and quadruplets had increased risk of CP compared to twins. The higher prevalence of CP in triplets and quadruplets is due to their higher risk of preterm birth. Prevalence of CP among twins significantly declined in Europe and Australia. Clinical outcomes were similar for all multiple births.",

    "abstract": "Infantile nystagmus (IN) may result from aetiologies including albinism and FRMD7 mutations. IN has low prevalence, and twins with IN are rare. Whilst discordant presentation has been previously reported for IN, we present for the first time the comprehensive assessment of diagnostically discordant monozygotic twins. From a cohort of over 2000 patients, we identified twins and triplets discordant for nystagmus. Using next-generation sequencing, high-resolution infra-red pupil tracking and optical coherence tomography, we characterised differences in genotype and phenotype. Monozygotic twins (n\u2009=\u20091), dizygotic twins (n\u2009=\u20093) and triplets (n\u2009=\u20091) were included. The monozygotic twins had concordant TYR variants. No causative variants were identified in the triplets. Dizygotic twins had discordant variants in TYR, OCA2 and FRMD7. One unaffected co-twin demonstrated sub-clinical nystagmus. Foveal hypoplasia (FH) was noted in four of five probands. Both co-twins of the monozygotic pair and triplets displayed FH. In three families, at least one parent had FH without nystagmus. FH alone may be insufficient to develop nystagmus. Whilst arrested optokinetic reflex pathway development is implicated in IN, discordant twins raise questions regarding where differences in development have arisen. In unaffected monozygotes therefore, genetic variants may predispose to oculomotor instability, with variable expressivity possibly responsible for the discordance observed.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare complication of monochorionic pregnancies and an extremely rare condition in spontaneous triplet pregnancies. We report a case of conjoined twins in a spontaneous monochorionic triplet pregnancy. The conjoined twins might have suffered from twin anemia-polycythemia sequence, which was reported to be extremely rare.\nA 26-year-old woman conceived spontaneously with an obstetric history of invasive mole 4\u200ayears ago.\nWe initially misdiagnosed her as having monochorionic triamniotic triplets at 10\u200aweeks of gestation. However, we confirmed conjoint twins with the monochorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy at 12\u200aweeks of gestation and classified them as omphalopagus.\nAs the woman decided to continue the pregnancy, regular and careful antenatal care was conducted.\nUnexpectedly, she had a stillbirth 3\u200aweeks later and had to terminate the pregnancy at 15\u200aweeks of gestation. After abortion, the diagnosis of omphalopagus was confirmed in the induced fetuses. Moreover, the skin colors of the conjoined twins were different: one was plethoric, and the other was pale. Additionally, the parents agreed to examine the chromosome of the fetuses, and the results were normal.\nDichorionic triplet and monochorionic triplet pregnancies have a poorer prognosis than trichorionic triplet pregnancies. Surgery is the main therapy for conjoined twins; however, most conjoined twins in triplet pregnancies cannot survive, including omphalopagus twins. The conjoined twins may have suffered from twin anemia-polycythemia sequence, which could probably not be diagnosed intrauterine. Transvaginal probe and 3-dimensional ultrasound may be helpful for clarifying the diagnosis in early pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Privileged by rapid increase in available epigenomic data, epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) are to make a profound contribution to understand the molecular mechanism of DNA methylation in cognitive aging. Current statistical methods used in EWAS are dominated by models based on multiple assumptions, for example, linear relationship between molecular profiles and phenotype, normal distribution for the methylation data and phenotype. In this study, we applied an assumption-free method, the generalized correlation coefficient (GCC), and compare it to linear models, namely the linear mixed model and kinship model. We use DNA methylation associated with a cognitive score in 400 and 206 twins as discovery and replication samples respectively. DNA methylation associated with cognitive function using GCC, linear mixed model, and kinship model, identified 65 CpGs (p\u00a0<\u00a01e-04) from discovery sample displaying both nonlinear and linear correlations. Replication analysis successfully replicated 9 of these top CpGs. When combining results of GCC and linear models to cover diverse patterns of relationships, we identified genes like KLHDC4, PAPSS2, and MRPS18B as well as pathways including focal adhesion, axon guidance, and some neurological signaling. Genomic region-based analysis found 15 methylated regions harboring 11 genes, with three verified in gene expression analysis, also the 11 genes were related to top functional clusters including neurohypophyseal hormone and maternal aggressive behaviors. The GCC approach detects valuable methylation sites missed by traditional linear models. A combination of methylation markers from GCC and linear models enriched biological pathways sensible in neurological function that could implicate cognitive performance and cognitive aging.",

Lateral cephalograms taken at 15 and 18 years of age were traced to analyze the sella-nasion-nasal line angle (SN-NL), nasal line-mandibular line angle (ML-NL), sella-nasion-mandibular line angle (SN-ML), sella-nasion-sella-gnathion angle (Y-axis), posterior face height/anterior face height (PFH/AFH), and lower anterior face height/anterior face height (LAFH/AFH). The genetic and environmental components of variance were analyzed with structural equation modeling for multilevel mixed effects.\nAt 15 years of age, strong dominant genetic control was seen for NL-ML (81%), LAFH/AFH (73%), and Y-axis (57%), whereas strong additive genetic components were found for PFH/AFH (78%), SN-NL (58%), and SN-ML (57%). Unique environmental factors accounted for 18-42% of observed variance, with SN-NL being affected the most (42%). At 18 years of age, only LAFH/AFH (86%) was under strong dominant genetic control, whereas the remainder were under additive genetic influence. The sole exception was SN-NL, which changed from additive to unique environmental influence.\nEither additive or dominant genetic components were found at 15 or 18 years of age for most vertical variables. Environmental factors accounted for about 10-40%, with SN-NL being mostly affected.",

    "abstract": "The '16Up' study conducted at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute from January 2014 to December 2018 aimed to examine the physical and mental health of young Australian twins aged 16-18 years (N = 876; 371 twin pairs and 18 triplet sets). Measurements included online questionnaires covering physical and mental health as well as information and communication technology (ICT) use, actigraphy, sleep diaries and hair samples to determine cortisol concentrations. Study participants generally rated themselves as being in good physical (79%) and mental (73%) health and reported lower rates of psychological distress and exposure to alcohol, tobacco products or other substances than previously reported for this age group in the Australian population. Daily or near-daily online activity was almost universal among study participants, with no differences noted between males and females in terms of frequency or duration of internet access. Patterns of ICT use in this sample indicated that the respondents were more likely to use online information sources for researching physical health issues than for mental health or substance use issues, and that they generally reported partial levels of satisfaction with the mental health information they found online. This suggests that internet-based mental health resources can be readily accessed by adolescent Australians, and their computer literacy augurs well for future access to online health resources. In combination with other data collected as part of the ongoing Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study, the 16Up project provides a valuable resource for the longitudinal investigation of genetic and environmental contributions to phenotypic variation in a variety of human traits.",

    "abstract": "Intertwin size discordance is an independent risk factor for adverse neonatal outcomes in twin pregnancies. However, size discordance at a given point in gestation fails to take into consideration information, such as the timing of onset and the rate of progression of discordance, that may be of prognostic value.\nIn this study, we aimed to identify distinct patterns of discordant fetal growth in twin pregnancies and to determine whether these patterns are predictive of adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of women with twin pregnancies in a single tertiary referral center between January 2011 and April 2020, who had at least 3 ultrasound examinations during pregnancy that included assessment of fetal biometry. Size discordance was calculated at each ultrasound examination, and pregnancies were classified into 1 of 4 predetermined patterns based on the timing of onset and the progression of discordance: pattern 1, no significant discordance group (referent); pattern 2, early (<24 weeks' gestation) progressive discordance group; pattern 3, early discordance with plateau group; or pattern 4, late (\u226524 weeks' gestation) discordance group. The associations of discordance pattern (using pattern 1 as referent) with preterm birth, preeclampsia, size discordance at birth, and birthweight<10th percentile were expressed as adjusted relative risk with 95% confidence intervals and were compared with those observed for a single measurement of size discordance at 32 weeks' gestation.\nOf 2075 women with a twin gestation who were identified during the study period, 1059 met the study criteria. Of the 1059 women, 599 (57%) were classified as no significant discordance (pattern 1), 23 (2%) as early progressive discordance (pattern 2), 160 (15%) as early discordance with plateau (pattern 3), and 277 (26%) as late discordance (pattern 4). The associations of discordance pattern with preterm birth at <34 weeks' gestation and preeclampsia were strongest for pattern 2 (rates of 43% [adjusted relative risk, 3.43; 95% confidence interval, 2.10-5.62] and 17% [adjusted relative risk, 5.81; 95% confidence interval, 2.31-14.60], respectively), intermediate for pattern 3 (rates of 23% [adjusted relative risk, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.59] and 6% [adjusted relative risk, 2.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.43], respectively), and weakest for pattern 4 (rates of 12% [adjusted relative risk, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.42] and 4% [adjusted relative risk, 1.41; 0.68-2.92], respectively). In contrast, a single measurement of size discordance at 32 weeks' gestation showed no association with preeclampsia and only a weak association with preterm birth at <34 weeks' gestation.\nWe identified 4 distinct discordance growth patterns among twins that demonstrated a dose-response relationship with adverse outcomes and seemed to be more informative than a single measurement of size discordance.",

    "abstract": "It is currently unclear whether reported changes in the gut microbiome are cause or consequence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, we studied the gut microbiome of IBD-discordant and -concordant twin pairs, which offers the unique opportunity to assess individuals at increased risk of developing IBD, namely healthy cotwins from IBD-discordant twin pairs.\nFecal samples were obtained from 99 twins (belonging to 51 twin pairs), 495 healthy age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched controls, and 99 unrelated patients with IBD. Whole-genome metagenomic shotgun sequencing was performed. Taxonomic and functional (pathways) composition was compared among healthy cotwins, IBD-twins, unrelated patients with IBD, and healthy controls with multivariable (ie, adjusted for potential confounding) generalized linear models.\nNo significant differences were observed in the relative abundance of species and pathways between healthy cotwins and their IBD-twins (false discovery rate <0.10). Compared with healthy controls, 13, 19, and 18 species, and 78, 105, and 153 pathways were found to be differentially abundant in healthy cotwins, IBD-twins, and unrelated patients with IBD, respectively (false discovery rate <0.10). Of these, 8 (42.1%) of 19 and 1 (5.6%) of 18 species, and 37 (35.2%) of 105 and 30 (19.6%) of 153 pathways overlapped between healthy cotwins and IBD-twins, and healthy cotwins and unrelated patients with IBD, respectively. Many of the shared species and pathways have previously been associated with IBD. The shared pathways include potentially inflammation-related pathways, for example, an increase in propionate degradation and L-arginine degradation pathways.\nThe gut microbiome of healthy cotwins from IBD-discordant twin pairs displays IBD-like signatures. These IBD-like microbiome signatures might precede the onset of IBD. However, longitudinal follow-up studies are needed to infer a causal relationship.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThere has been a striking generational increase in the prevalence of food allergies. We have proposed that this increase can be explained, in part, by alterations in the commensal microbiome.METHODSTo identify bacterial signatures and metabolic pathways that may influence the expression of this disease, we collected fecal samples from a unique, well-controlled cohort of twins concordant or discordant for food allergy. Samples were analyzed by integrating 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolite profiling.RESULTSA bacterial signature of 64 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) distinguished healthy from allergic twins; the OTUs enriched in the healthy twins were largely taxa from the Clostridia class. We detected significant enrichment in distinct metabolite pathways in each group. The enrichment of diacylglycerol in healthy twins is of particular interest for its potential as a readily measurable fecal biomarker of health. In addition, an integrated microbial-metabolomic analysis identified a significant association between healthy twins and Phascolarctobacterium faecium and Ruminococcus bromii, suggesting new possibilities for the development of live microbiome-modulating biotherapeutics.CONCLUSIONTwin pairs exhibited significant differences in their fecal microbiomes and metabolomes through adulthood, suggesting that the gut microbiota may play a protective role in patients with food allergies beyond the infant stage.TRIAL REGISTRATIONParticipants in this study were recruited as part of an observational study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01613885) at multiple sites from 2014 to 2018.FUNDINGThis work was supported by the Sunshine Charitable Foundation; the Moss Family Foundation; the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (R56AI134923 and R01AI 140134); the Sean N.

    "abstract": "Broadly, much of variance in immune system phenotype has been linked to the influence of non-heritable factors rather than genetics. In particular, two non-heritable factors: aging and human cytolomegavirus (CMV) infection, have been known to account for significant inter-individual immune variance. However, many specific relationships between them and immune composition remain unclear, especially between individuals over narrower age ranges. Further exploration of these relationships may be useful for informing personalized intervention development.\nTo address this need, we evaluated 41 different cell type frequencies by mass cytometry and identified their relationships with aging and CMV seropositivity. Analyses were done using 60 healthy individuals, including 23 monozygotic twin pairs, categorized into young (12-31\u2009years) and middle-aged (42-59\u2009years). Aging and CMV discordance were associated with increased immune diversity between monozygotic twins overall, and particularly strongly in various T cell populations. Notably, we identified 17 and 11 cell subset frequencies as relatively influenced and uninfluenced by non-heritable factors, respectively, with results that largely matched those from studies on older-aged cohorts. Next, CD4+ T cell frequency was shown to diverge with age in twins, but with lower slope than in demographically similar non-twins, suggesting that much inter-individual variance in this cell type can be attributed to interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Several cell frequencies previously associated with memory inflation, such as CD27- CD8+ T cells and CD161+ CD4+ T cells, were positively correlated with CMV seropositivity, supporting findings that CMV infection may incur rapid aging of the immune system.\nOur study confirms previous findings that aging, even within a relatively small age range and by mid-adulthood, and CMV seropositivity, both contribute significantly to inter-individual immune diversity. Notably, we identify several key immune cell subsets that vary considerably with aging, as well as others associated with memory inflation which correlate with CMV seropositivity.",

    "abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic lung disease that develops in low-birth-weight infants as a result of mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity in the early neonatal period. In these patients, mechanical ventilation and oxygen support are needed for a long time. We already use antenatal steroid, ventilation techniques with minimal baro/volutrauma, postnatal steroid, and vitamin A to prevent the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Mesenchymal stem cell treatment is another way to reduce or stop the pathophysiologic pathways in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Herein, we present mesenchymal stem cell treatment and its outcomes in twins who were born with a gestational age of 26 weeks and diagnosed as having bronchopulmonary dysplasia (the female twin was born with a birth weight of 750 g and the male twin was born with a birth weight of 930 g). These patients were followed up with clinical findings, chest radiography, and lung ultrasonography.\nBronkopulmoner displazi d\u00fc\u015f\u00fck do\u011fum a\u011f\u0131rl\u0131kl\u0131 bebeklerde erken yenido\u011fan d\u00f6neminde mekanik ventilasyonun etkisi ve oksijen toksititesi gibi nedenlerle ortaya \u00e7\u0131kan kronik bir akci\u011fer hastal\u0131\u011f\u0131d\u0131r.

    "abstract": "Despite the important role that monozygotic twins have played in genetics research, little is known about their genomic differences. Here we show that monozygotic twins differ on average by 5.2 early developmental mutations and that approximately 15% of monozygotic twins have a substantial number of these early developmental mutations specific to one of them. Using the parents and offspring of twins, we identified pre-twinning mutations. We observed instances where a twin was formed from a single cell lineage in the pre-twinning cell mass and instances where a twin was formed from several cell lineages. CpG>TpG mutations increased in frequency with embryonic development, coinciding with an increase in DNA methylation. Our results indicate that allocations of cells during development shapes genomic differences between monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are an extremely rare congenital occurrence, and anesthetic management for surgical separation presents unique challenges for anesthesiologists.\nFive-month-old male pygopagus conjoined twins underwent separation surgery. We performed anesthesia induction in the supine position and surgery in the prone position. This presented a challenge because the transition from supine to prone position reversed the positional relationship between the two babies, resulting in crossing of the respiratory circuits and monitors. To solve the problem, we used anesthesia machines and monitors on the opposite side of each baby during anesthesia induction. The positional relationship between the twins and anesthesia machines and monitors normalized after the change to the prone position. Following the separation surgery, the twins were discharged without any complications.\nOur method of using opposite side anesthetic machines and monitors for anesthesia induction was useful for the safe anesthetic management of pygopagus conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "Although the genomes of monozygotic twins are practically identical, their methylomes may evolve divergently throughout their lifetime as a consequence of factors such as the environment or aging. Particularly for young and healthy monozygotic twins, DNA methylation divergence, if any, may be restricted to stochastic processes occurring post-twinning during embryonic development and early life. However, to what extent such stochastic mechanisms can systematically provide a stable source of inter-individual epigenetic variation remains uncertain until now.\nWe enriched for inter-individual stochastic variation by using an equivalence testing-based statistical approach on whole blood methylation microarray data from healthy adolescent monozygotic twins. As a result, we identified 333 CpGs displaying similarly large methylation variation between monozygotic co-twins and unrelated individuals. Although their methylation variation surpasses measurement error and is stable in a short timescale, susceptibility to aging is apparent in the long term. Additionally, 46% of these CpGs were replicated in adipose tissue. The identified sites are significantly enriched at the clustered protocadherin loci, known for stochastic methylation in developing neurons. We also confirmed an enrichment in monozygotic twin DNA methylation discordance at these loci in whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from blood and adipose tissue.\nWe have isolated a component of stochastic methylation variation, distinct from genetic influence, measurement error, and epigenetic drift. Biomarkers enriched in this component may serve in the future as the basis for universal epigenetic fingerprinting, relevant for instance in the discrimination of monozygotic twin individuals in forensic applications, currently impossible with standard DNA profiling.",

As a result, we identified 333 CpGs displaying similarly large methylation variation between monozygotic co-twins and unrelated individuals. Although their methylation variation surpasses measurement error and is stable in a short timescale, susceptibility to aging is apparent in the long term. Additionally, 46% of these CpGs were replicated in adipose tissue. The identified sites are significantly enriched at the clustered protocadherin loci, known for stochastic methylation in developing neurons. We also confirmed an enrichment in monozygotic twin DNA methylation discordance at these loci in whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from blood and adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "Millions of people have been impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide. High infection rates and death tolls, combined with social distancing measures, may have unintended psychological consequences on individuals. The goal of this study was to examine the interrelations between COVID-19 exposure, fear of COVID-19, and depression among a community-based sample of adult twins. We further explored whether fear of COVID-19 mediated the association between COVID-19 exposure and depression. 732 same-sex adult twin pairs (78.1% MZ, 21.9% DZ) completed an online survey examining their feelings in May 2020. About one-fifth of the participants reported having any COVID-19 exposure. Most participants (>80%) were somewhat concerned about themselves or their household members being infected by COVID-19. The average depression level was relatively low (M\u00a0=\u00a00.9 out of 6). We found that COVID-19 exposure was related to increased fears of COVID-19 and depression, and that depressive feelings increased with fear of COVID-19. The correlation between COVID-19 exposure and depression was partially mediated by fear of COVID-19. However, these associations were confounded by familial influences. As society navigates through the pandemic, it is essential to implement public health strategies to help individuals cope with the concerns and fears about COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Heteropaternal superfecundation (HP) occurs when two or more ova are fertilized by sperm from separate males. The resulting siblings are genetically equivalent to half-siblings and share, on average, 25% of their inherited genetic material. In the absence of genetic testing HP siblings could be treated as dizygotic (DZ) twins in behavioral genetic analyses and bias heritability estimates in phenotypic decomposition models. However, the extent to which such misclassification could affect calculated estimates of heritability is currently unknown. Employing simulation analyses, the current study assessed the potential biasing impact across a variety of conditions varying by proportions of DZ twins, sample sizes, and low, moderate, and high levels of genetic and environmental contribution to phenotypic variance. Overall, the results indicated that misclassified HP siblings had minimal impact on estimates of heritability. Nonetheless, greater attention should be paid to the identification of HP siblings within existing and future twin datasets.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that twin pregnancies confer a high degree of adverse perinatal outcomes. Fetal growth restriction, preterm labor/delivery, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are among the causal etiologies associated. Hematologic parameters, specifically, the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the platelet:lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and some of the routine complete blood cell count components denote a peculiar inflammatory and immunologic profile and have been used as clinical markers for specific obstetric syndromes. To our knowledge, no study has ever evaluated NLR/PLR in twins as a distinct population from singletons. Our primary objective was to analyze NLR/PLR in twins compared with singletons. Our secondary objective was to compare white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets between twins and singletons.\nWe conducted a retrospective case-control study comparing NLR/PLR markers in twin gestations (dichorionic/diamniotic and monochorionic/dichorionic) versus singleton pregnancies, from January 2019 to April 2020. We excluded pregnancies with potential confounding factors such as human immunodeficiency virus, chronic hypertension, smoking, pregestational diabetes mellitus, or cases with miscarriage/intrauterine fetal demise. We included twin pregnancies (two fetuses) as cases and singletons as controls.\nWe recruited 29 twins and 29 singletons, matched for age, body mass index, and parity. NLR was statistically significantly higher in the first trimester in twins compared with singletons (3.3 vs 2.7, \nWe speculate that a decrease in NLR from the first to the second trimester and a decrease in platelet in the second trimester reflect both the physiologic inflammatory/immune reaction of early pregnancy and denote a vital response for the development of normal placentation in twin gestations.",

    "abstract": "3D-inkjet-printing is just beginning to take off in the optical field. Advantages of this technique include its fast and cost-efficient fabrication without tooling costs. However, there are still obstacles preventing 3D inkjet-printing from a broad usage in optics, e.g., insufficient form fidelity. In this article, we present the formulation of a digital twin by the enhancement of an optical model by integrating geometrical measurement data. This approach strengthens the high-precision 3D printing process to fulfil optical precision requirements. A process flow between the design of freeform components, fabrication by inkjet printing, the geometrical measurement of the fabricated optical surface, and the feedback of the measurement data into the simulation model was developed, and its interfaces were defined. The evaluation of the measurements allowed for the adaptation of the printing process to compensate for process errors and tolerances. Furthermore, the performance of the manufactured component was simulated and compared with the nominal performance, and the enhanced model could be used for sensitivity analysis. The method was applied to a highly complex helical surface that allowed for the adjustment of the optical power by rotation. We show that sensitivity analysis could be used to define acceptable tolerance budgets of the process.",

    "abstract": "Lichen planus (LP) is a mucocutaneous immune-mediated disease of unknown etiology. It is more prevalent in women and usually occurs between the third and sixth decades of life. Oral lesions may or may not be associated with skin and genital lesions. Although the role of genetic factors is still undetermined, reports of LP in more than one family member are not uncommon. However, the occurrence of LP in monozygotic twins is rare. We report a rare case of 42-year-old female monozygotic twins presenting oral LP. This report is even rarer because one of the patients had cutaneous lesions of an unusual variant of LP (LP pigmentosus) and the other had an uncommon association with lichen sclerosus. The etiology and pathogenesis of LP are still uncertain. However, despite being rare, its occurrence in family members and monozygotic twins suggests that genetic factors are involved in its development.",

    "abstract": "Few studies are available on birth asphyxia risks in twin neonates. This retrospective multi-center cross-sectional study determined the birthweight percentiles of 5337twins and birth asphyxia incidence of the twin population.\nWe retrieved sociodemographic and obstetric data from the electronic records systems of participating centers. Neonate birthweight was measured within 24 h of birth. Perinatal asphyxia was diagnosed if 5-minute Apgar score was \u22645, or resuscitation was required 10 min after birth. The primary outcome was the incidence of birth asphyxia.\nTotally 5337 neonates were eligible. The mean neonatal birthweight was 2227.1 \u00b1 608.99 g and the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of birthweight were 970, 2400, and 3080 g, respectively. The mean Apgar score was 9.06 \u00b1 1.73 at 1 min and 8.99 \u00b1 1.74 at 5 min. Totally 13.5 % (705/5222) twins had asphyxia and 9.35 % and 4.16 % twins had moderate and severe asphyxia, respectively. Twins with a birthweight< 1500 g had the highest asphyxia rate (64.8 %) and twins with a birthweight between 2500 and 3000 g had the lowest asphyxia rate (3.6 %). Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that higher birthweight was associated with a significantly reduced risk of asphyxia [OR 0.772 (95 %CI 0.755, 0.789), P < 0.001]. The AUROC for mean twin birthweight was 0.86\u00b10.01 (95 %CI 0.84, 0.88) using a cutoff of 1950 g, with a sensitivity of 0.84 and a specificity of 0.78.\nTwins have lower birthweight versus singletons and a significant proportion of twins, especially twins with lower birthweight, are at risk of birth asphyxia. Birthweight is an independent predictor of asphyxia and should be further explored as a predictive marker for stratifying asphyxia risks in twin neonates.",

    "abstract": "Unilateral condylar hyperplasia (UCH) is an abnormal growth process that results in the development of mandibular asymmetry. The aetiopathogenesis of this entity is still unclear. Various factors including hormonal influences, intrauterine factors, trauma, infection, and genetics have been speculated to lead to the development of UCH. In genetic epidemiology, twins have been a valuable resource for investigating the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases. We present a case of mirror-image UCH in a pair of monozygotic twins, providing evidence of a possible genetic link for this mandibular growth disorder. The concordance in the monozygotic twins appears to be reflected by the precise mirror-image presentation of the congenital dentofacial anomalies. Further twin studies would be useful in clarifying the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to the presence and development of UCH.",

    "abstract": "In survival analysis, the effect of a covariate on the outcome is reported in a hazard rate. However, hazards rates are hard to interpret. Here we consider differences in survival probabilities instead. Using data on twins is interesting due to the fact that many observed and unobserved factors are controlled or matched. To model the correlation between twins, some authors have proposed survival models with frailties or random effects. However, there is a potential danger of bias in the estimation if the frailty distribution is misspecified. Frailties are often assumed to follow a gamma distribution. To safeguard us from the impact of the misspecification of this distribution, we consider a flexible non-parametric baseline hazard in addition to a parametric one. We will apply this methodology to the TwinsUK cohort to predict the probability of experiencing a fracture in the next five or ten years, given their bone mineral densities (BMD) and their frailty index. The models with parametric and non-parametric baseline hazards yield very close results in estimating survival probabilities and thus a choice of parametric baseline hazard is generally preferred. We find that bone mineral density is a significant predictor in the model whereas frailty index is not. Low BMD leads to a larger probability of fracture; e.g, in 10 years, the probability of fracture is 21% for low BMD group, 16% for medium BMD group and 8% for high BMD group.",

    "abstract": "This is the first case describing vaginal papillomatosis with a fibroepithelial polyp of the vulva in a prepubertal girl and vaginal papillomatosis in her twin sister. Parents contacted pediatric urologist regarding their eight-year-old daughter (twin A), who had a growth next to the external urethral meatus. The girl was referred to a pediatric surgeon. The exophytic 3 cm long structure with necrosis on top was found. After obtaining informed consent from girl parents, pediatric surgeon removed the exophytic structure and perform cystoscopy and vaginoscopy for possible changes in the bladder and vagina. Cystoscopy findings were normal. On vaginoscopy, numerous macroscopic papillomatous structures were identified on the cervix and vaginal walls. Vaginal biopsies were performed on the areas affected by papillomatosis. Histopathologic examination showed a fibroepithelial polyp with a central fibrovascular core covered by squamous epithelium and vaginal squamous papillomatosis. The decision was made to perform vaginoscopy on her twin sister (twin B), too. On vaginoscopy, solitary small vaginal papillomas were also found. In this case manifestation of vaginal papillomatosis in twins might have been influenced by inheritance and the same bacterial and viral environment.",

    "abstract": "Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and Graves' disease (GD) are known to coaggregate in families, but the magnitude and nature of a shared etiology is unknown.\nTo estimate the shared genetic influence on overt HT and GD and to examine if the heritability differs between men and women.\nWe used national health registries to identify cases of HT and GD in a cohort of 110 814 Swedish twins. By comparing intra-class and cross-twin cross-trait correlations in dizygotic and monozygotic twins, we calculated heritability and the proportions thereof shared between the diseases. Univariate estimates of heritability were calculated by sex.\nThe heritability for HT and GD was 65% (95% CI, 61-70) and 63% (95% CI, 55-72), respectively. The genetic correlation was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.50) and shared genetic effects accounted for 8% of the variance for both HT and GD. Univariate heritability was significantly higher in men than in women for HT (90% vs 60%, P\u2005<\u20050.001) but not for GD (79% vs 63%, P\u2005=\u20050.085).\nFrom a genetic perspective, HT and GD appear to be only modestly related diseases. Hence, the term \"autoimmune thyroid disease,\" used to cluster these disorders, may have limited validity in a genetic context. Moreover, the mechanisms contributing to HT are partly different for the sexes, with genetic components more important in men.",

    "abstract": "Combined immunodeficiencies (CIDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by various gene mutations. The mutations in the STK4 (Serine Threonine Kinase 4) gene, which has a role in the regulation of apoptosis and proliferation, can be a cause of immunodeficiency. In the current paper, we reported a case of identical twin brothers with a novel STK4 mutation, one of whom showed clinical manifestations associated with this mutation with a delay of two years. The mutation in the STK4 gene was identified employing Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), and we described the probable reasons for this delay. We found that the STK4 genetic defect caused almost the same clinical symptoms of immunodeficiency in the twin brothers. Meanwhile, the severity of the disease was higher in one of them, which may be due to extra genetic defect in LRBA, and likely differences in the percentage of B lymphocyte population and CD4+/ CD8+ state.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are used to summarize hospital morbidity and mortality. Each DRG has a weight which is important in calculating the case mix index (CMI), a numeric summary of disease complexity in a population of patients. We utilized DRG weight and resultant CMI to compare postnatal outcomes among singletons versus monochorionic and monoamniotic, monochorionic diamniotic, and dichorionic diamniotic twins.\nThis single-center and retrospective cohort study evaluated DRGs assigned by the investigators, birth weight, gestational age, length of stay (LOS), NICU admission rate, and mortality in twin births between 2014 and 2016. Twins were analyzed depending on chorionicity and amnionicity. Overall, 3 months of singleton births served as the control. The CMI derived from DRG weights were compared across groups.\nTwins (\nDRG weight and CMI values summarize in-hospital complexity and can be a useful tool to evaluate differences in care complexity among groups of patients.\n\u00b7 Using diagnosis-related group and case mix index to assess morbidities.. \u00b7 Morbidities of twins are monochorionic-monoamniotic versus monochorionic-diamniotic versus dichorionic-diamniotic twins.. \u00b7 Only seven diagnosis-related group in neonatology make it a valuable tool for clinicians..",

    "abstract": "While previous research has investigated neuroradiological findings in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the entire range of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) has not yet been well-studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Considering the overlap among NDDs and simultaneous development of the brain and face, guided by molecular signaling, we examined the relationship of actionable and incidental (non-actionable) MRI findings and NDD diagnoses together with facial morphological variants and genetic copy number variants (CNVs). A cross-sectional study was conducted with a twin cohort 8-36\u00a0years of age (57% monozygotic, 40% dizygotic), including 372 subjects (46% with NDDs; 47% female) imaged by MRI, 280 with data for facial morphological variants, and 183 for CNVs. Fifty-one percent of participants had MRI findings. Males had a statistically significantly higher percentage of MRI findings (57.7%) compared with females (43.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Twin zygosity was not statistically significantly correlated with incidence or severity of specific MRI findings. No statistically significant association was found between MRI findings and any NDD diagnosis or facial morphological variants; however, MRI findings were statistically significantly associated with the number of CNVs (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.00-1.44, p\u2009=\u20090.05, adjusted OR for sex 1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.50, p\u2009=\u20090.02). When combining the presence of MRI findings, facial morphological variants, and CNVs, statistically significant relationships were found with ASD and ADHD diagnoses (p\u2009=\u20090.0006 and p\u2009=\u20090.002, respectively). The results of this study demonstrate that the ability to identify NDDs from combined radiology, morphology, and CNV assessments may be possible. Additionally, twins do not appear to be at increased risk for neuroradiological variants.",

Early detection of the disease is, therefore, very important. Despite the fact that leukemia in twins occurs rarely, more attention has been paid to it in genetic studies. In the present study, through cytogenetic testing, a special case of concordant ALL in monozygotic twins was presented with different outcomes. In spite of an acceptable initial consequence to medical treatment in twins, in another brother (Twin B), early relapse was observed. In the cytogenetic study, both twins expressed ",

    "abstract": "A female buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) of the Bulgarian Murrah breed aged 1,090\u00a0days was observed to give birth to a second newborn (normally developed male) after she had calved (normal female) 49\u00a0days earlier. This phenomenon is highly associated with her melatonin treatment within a trial for induction of puberty, the last ear implants being placed approximately 50\u00a0days before the assumed date of first mating, to which point the level of progesterone had increased dramatically. Despite none of the matings of the dam was visually witnessed to prove ovulation over an existing gestation, we take the liberty to qualify this phenomenon as superfetation, ruling out the other possible phenomena, namely embryonic diapause as it is highly unlikely to occur in any livestock species, and differentiated development of twin foetuses as it is associated with foetal malformation, which was not observed in this case.",

    "abstract": "The bio-manufacturing industry, along with other process industries, now has the opportunity to be engaged in the latest industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. To successfully accomplish this, a physical-to-digital-to-physical information loop should be carefully developed. One way to achieve this is, for example, through the implementation of digital twins (DTs), which are virtual copies of the processes. Therefore, in this paper, the focus is on understanding the needs and challenges faced by the bio-manufacturing industry when dealing with this digitalized paradigm. To do so, two major building blocks of a DT, data and models, are highlighted and discussed. Hence, firstly, data and their characteristics and collection strategies are examined as well as new methods and tools for data processing. Secondly, modelling approaches and their potential of being used in DTs are reviewed. Finally, we share our vision with regard to the use of DTs in the bio-manufacturing industry aiming at bringing the DT a step closer to its full potential and realization.",

    "abstract": "The landmark National Aeronautics and Space Administration Twins Study represented an integrated effort to launch human space life science research into the modern age of molecular- and \"omics\"-based studies. As part of the first One-Year Mission aboard the International Space Station, identical twin astronauts Scott and Mark Kelly were the subjects of this \"out of this world\" research opportunity. Telomeres, the natural ends of chromosomes that shorten with cell division and a host of lifestyle factors and stresses, are key molecular determinants of aging and aging trajectories.\nWe proposed that telomere length dynamics (changes over time) represent a particularly relevant and integrative biomarker for astronauts, as they reflect the combined experiences and environmental exposures encountered during spaceflight. Telomere length (quantitative polymerase chain reaction and telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization) and telomerase activity (quantitative polymerase chain reaction -telomere repeat amplification protocol) were longitudinally assessed in the space- and earth-bound twins. Chromosome aberrations (directional genomic hybridization), signatures of radiation exposure, were also evaluated.\nThe twins had relatively similar telomere lengths before spaceflight, and the earth-bound twins' telomeres remained relatively stable over the course of the study. Surprisingly, the space twins' telomeres were longer during spaceflight, and upon return to Earth shortened rapidly, resulting in many more short telomeres after spaceflight than before. Chromosomal signatures of space radiation exposure were also elevated during spaceflight, and increased inversion frequencies persisted after spaceflight, suggestive of ongoing genome instability.\nAlthough the definitive mechanisms underlying such dramatic spaceflight-associated shifts in telomere length remain unclear, improved maintenance of telomere length has important implications for aging science and improving healthspan for those on Earth, as well.",

    "abstract": "In recent years process modelling has become an established method which generates digital twins of manufacturing plant operation with the aid of numerically solved process models. This article discusses the benefits of establishing process modelling, in-house or by cooperation, in order to support the workflow from process development, piloting and engineering up to manufacturing. The examples are chosen from the variety of botanicals and biologics manufacturing thus proving the broad applicability from variable feedstock of natural plant extracts of secondary metabolites to fermentation of complex molecules like mAbs, fragments, proteins and peptides.Consistent models and methods to simulate whole processes are available. To determine the physical properties used as model parameters, efficient laboratory-scale experiments are implemented. These parameters are case specific since there is no database for complex molecules of biologics and botanicals in pharmaceutical industry, yet.Moreover, Quality-by-Design approaches, demanded by regulatory authorities, are integrated within those predictive modelling procedures. The models could be proven to be valid and predictive under regulatory aspects. Process modelling does earn its money from the first day of application. Process modelling is a key-enabling tool towards cost-efficient digitalization in chemical-pharmaceutical industries.",

    "abstract": "Digital methods for process design, monitoring, and control can convert classical trial-and-error bioprocess development to a quantitative engineering approach. By interconnecting hardware, software, data, and humans currently untapped process optimization potential can be accessed. The key component within such a framework is a digital twin interacting with its physical process counterpart. In this chapter, we show how digital twin guided process development can be applied on an exemplary microbial cultivation process. The usage of digital twins is described along a typical process development cycle, ranging from early strain characterization to real-time control applications. Along an illustrative case study on microbial upstream bioprocessing, we emphasize that digital twins can integrate entire process development cycles if the digital twin itself and the underlying models are continuously adapted to newly available data. Therefore, the digital twin can be regarded as a powerful knowledge management tool and a decision support system for efficient process development. Its full potential can be deployed in a real-time environment where targeted control actions can further improve process performance.",

    "abstract": "Although the use of 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate is one of the most commonly used strategies to reduce the risk of preterm birth since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, there has been controversy recently that there may be no benefit associated with its use in singleton pregnancies in women with a prior history of spontaneous preterm birth. However, very few of these investigations evaluated the use of intramuscular progesterone in twin pregnancies. A few studies that used 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in twin pregnancies had mainly included unselected twin pregnancies. Although a twin pregnancy is independently associated with an increased likelihood of preterm birth, the primary indication for the use of supplemental progesterone in pregnancy is prior history of spontaneous preterm birth. Therefore, our investigation of weekly intramuscular progesterone in twin pregnancies with this birth history best addresses this question using a selected cohort.\nTo assess whether weekly 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate prevents recurrent preterm birth in women with a current twin pregnancy and a prior singleton spontaneous preterm birth.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of women with twin pregnancy and a prior singleton spontaneous preterm birth in 2 institutions between January 2005 and December 2016. One group (intervention group) consisted of women who received weekly 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, whereas the other (control group) did not. The primary outcome was twin spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks compared with odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio, adjusting for potential confounders. Secondary outcomes included composite neonatal morbidity such as respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, admission to the neonatal intensive care nursery, and fetal or neonatal death before hospital discharge.\nA total of 79 patients were included; 27 women received weekly 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate and 52 did not. There were no statistically significant differences in maternal demographics except for age. Spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks occurred in 16 patients (59%) in the intervention group vs 24 (46%) in the control group (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-4.54). Composite neonatal morbidity occurred in 20 pregnancies (74%) in the intervention group and 41 pregnancies (79%) in the control group (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-2.12). There remained no differences in outcomes after adjusting for potential confounders.\nIn our study, weekly 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate did not prevent spontaneous preterm birth or neonatal morbidity in women with twins and a prior singleton spontaneous preterm birth; however, further research with larger numbers and prospective design is needed.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins (PDMZTs) offer a unique opportunity to study post-zygotic genetic variation and provide insights into the linkage between genotype and phenotype. We report a comprehensive analysis of a pair of PDMZTs.\nDysmorphic features and delayed neuro-motor development were observed in the proband, whereas her twin sister was phenotypically normal. Four tissues (blood, skin, hair follicles, and buccal mucosa) from both twins were studied using four complementary methods, including whole-exome sequencing, karyotyping, array CGH, and SNP array.\nIn the proband, tetrasomy 18p affecting all studied tissues except for blood was identified. Karyotyping of fibroblasts revealed isochromosome 18p [i(18p)] in all metaphases. The corresponding analysis of the phenotypically normal sister surprisingly revealed low-level mosaicism (5.4%) for i(18p) in fibroblasts.\nWe emphasize that when mosaicism is suspected, multiple tissues should be studied and we highlight the usefulness of non-invasive sampling of hair follicles and buccal mucosa as a convenient source of non-mesoderm-derived DNA, which complements the analysis of mesoderm using blood. Moreover, low-level mosaic tetrasomy 18p is well tolerated and such low-level mosaicism, readily detected by karyotyping, can be missed by other methods. Finally, mosaicism for low-level tetrasomy 18p might be more common in the general population than it is currently recognized, due to detection limitations.",

    "conclusions": "We emphasize that when mosaicism is suspected, multiple tissues should be studied and we highlight the usefulness of non-invasive sampling of hair follicles and buccal mucosa as a convenient source of non-mesoderm-derived DNA, which complements the analysis of mesoderm using blood. Moreover, low-level mosaic tetrasomy 18p is well tolerated and such low-level mosaicism, readily detected by karyotyping, can be missed by other methods. Finally, mosaicism for low-level tetrasomy 18p might be more common in the general population than it is currently recognized, due to detection limitations.",

    "abstract": "May-Hegglin anomaly is an autosomal dominant inherited condition, characterized by thrombocytopenia, giant platelets and Dohle-like bodies. Incidence is unknown and affected individuals can show from mild to moderate-severe haemorrhagic symptoms. The cyst of cavum veli interpositi (a virtual space filled with fluid within the third ventricle) is rarely reported in the foetal period. Furthermore, it is unclear whether isolated cavum veli interpositi cysts are a normal variant or developmental malformations. The simultaneous presence of these two anomalies was never described.\nWe describe a very rare case of a twin monochorionic pregnancy in a woman with the May-Hegglin anomaly, whose foetuses carried cavum veli interpositi cysts. Since childhood, our patient had shown macro-thrombocytopenia, deafness and bleeding (epistaxis and menorrhagia), but she was misdiagnosed until the age of 30\u2009years when our Centre identified a de novo allelic variant in the gene MYH9 coding for the non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIa. Our patient bled neither during the pregnancy, nor in the peripartum period. Children are now eight-months-old and have never bled, although both inherited the MYH9 variant and have thrombocytopenia with giant platelets. Furthermore, none of them developed psychomotor disorders.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the sixth case of twin pregnancy in a woman carrying May-Hegglin anomaly and the first one with cavum veli interpositi cysts in the neonates. We speculate that MYH9 could have, at least in part, played a role in the development of both conditions, as this gene has a pleiotropic effect.",

    "abstract": "One of the controversies in the management of twin gestations relates to mode of delivery, especially when the second twin is in a nonvertex presentation (Vertex/nonVertex pairs) and birth is imminent at extremely low gestation.\nWe hypothesized that, for Vertex/nonVertex twins born before 28 weeks' gestation, cesarean delivery would be associated with a lower risk of adverse neonatal outcomes than trial of vaginal delivery. Our aim was to test this hypothesis by comparing the neonatal outcomes of Vertex/nonVertex twins born before 28 weeks' gestation by mode of delivery using a large national cohort.\nThis work is a retrospective cohort study of all twin infants born at 24\nA total of 1082 twin infants (541 twin pairs) met the inclusion criteria: 220 Vertex/nonVertex pairs, of which 112 had a trial of vaginal delivery (study group) and 108 had cesarean delivery for both twins (control group 1); 170 pairs with the first twin in nonvertex presentation, all of which were born by cesarean delivery (control group 2); and 151 pairs with both twins in vertex presentation (vertex or nonvertex). In the study group, the rate of urgent cesarean delivery for the second twin was 30%. The rate of the primary outcome in the study group was 42%, which was not significantly different compared with control group 1 (37%; adjusted relative risk, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.22) or control group 2 (34%; adjusted relative risk, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.58). The findings remained similar when outcomes were analyzed separately for the first and second twins.\nFor preterm Vertex/nonVertex twins born at <28 weeks' gestation, we found no difference in the risk of adverse neonatal outcome between a trial of vaginal delivery and primary cesarean delivery. However, a trial of vaginal delivery was associated with a high rate of urgent cesarean delivery for the second twin.",

    "abstract": "To delineate the blood group for a pair of twins with inconclusive ABO blood typing result.\nSerological test for blood group was carried out by using ABO and Rh Blood Grouping Cards (Microcolumn Gel Immunoassay). Sequence specific primer-PCR (PCR-SSP), direct sequencing and TA clone sequencing were used to analyze the ABO gene. Genetic status was analyzed by using 16 short tandem repeat (STR) markers.\nRed blood cells of the twins displayed 2+ mixed agglutination phenomenon with anti-A, anti-A1 and anti-E. PCR-SSP and DNA sequencing of exons 6 to 7 revealed that they have an ABO*O.01.01/ABO*O.01.02 genotype. DNA sequencing of microsatellite enhancer region revealed presence of A gene. STR analysis revealed more than two haplotypes for 9 loci between the twins. After clustered by anti-A, the red blood cells were divided into two groups: A, CcDEe and O, CcDee, respectively.\nSerological and molecular techniques have characterized the twins as blood group chimeras.",

    "abstract": "In this study, to address the problems of multiple dimensions, large scales, complex tension resource scheduling, and strict quality control requirements in the tensioning process of cables in prestressed steel structures, the technical characteristics of digital twins (DTs) and artificial intelligence (AI) are analyzed. An intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables method driven by the integration of DTs and AI is proposed. Based on the current research status of cable tensioning and DTs, combined with the goal of intelligent tensioning, a fusion mechanism for DTs and AI is established and their integration to drive intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables technology is analyzed. In addition, the key issues involved in the construction of an intelligent control center driven by the integration of DTs and AI are discussed. By considering the construction elements of space and time dimensions, the tensioning process is controlled at multiple levels, thereby realizing the intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables. Driven by intelligent tensioning methods, the safety performance evaluation of the intelligent tensioning process is analyzed. Combined with sensing equipment and intelligent algorithms, a high-fidelity twin model and three-dimensional integrated data model are constructed to realize closed-loop control of the intelligent tensioning safety evaluation. Through the study of digital twins and artificial intelligence fusion to drive the intelligent tensioning method for prestressed cables, this study focuses on the analysis of the intelligent evaluation of safety performance. This study provides a reference for fusion applications with DTs and AI in intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables.",

    "abstract": "Few factor analyses and no network analyses have examined the structure of DSM phobic fears or tested the specificity of the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobic fears.\nHistories of 21 lifetime phobic fears, coded as four-level ordinal variables (no fear to fear with major interference) were assessed at personal interview in 7514 adults from the Virginia Twin Registry. We estimated Gaussian Graphical Models on individual phobic fears; compared network structures of women and men using the Network Comparison Test; used community detection to determine the number and nature of groups in which phobic fears hang together; and validated the anticipated specific relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia.\nAll networks were densely and positively inter-connected; networks of women and men were structurally similar. Our most frequent and stable solution identified four phobic clusters: (i) blood-injection, (ii) social-agoraphobia, (iii) situational, and (iv) animal-disease. Fear of public restrooms and of diseases clustered with animal and not, respectively, social and blood-injury phobias. When added to the network, the three strongest connections with lifetime panic disorder were all agoraphobic fears: being in crowds, going out of the house alone, and being in open spaces.\nUsing network analyses applied to a large epidemiologic twin sample, we broadly validated the DSM-IV typography but did not entirely support the distinction of agoraphobic and social phobic fears or the DSM placements for fears of public restrooms and diseases. We found strong support for the specificity of the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobic fears.",

Conjoined twins are classified according to their symmetry, place of fusion, and grade of duplication.\nWe report here an extremely rare presentation of parasitic twins not described before. We describe macro and micro anatomic alterations and discuss the aspects of this peculiar presentation and the importance of prenatal diagnosis.\nThe case of a twenty-three-year-old patient, with monochorionic, monoamniotic asymmetrically-conjoined twin pregnancy, discovered at 29 weeks of gestational age. We believe that this report calls attention to this presentation and the importance of prenatal care and management. The twins were delivered vaginally without life. The twins' combined weight was 1.300 gr. They were bonded in the left cervical region.\nThis report may help to find strategies for clinical decisions in future cases. Antepartum diagnosis is important to the management, preoperative planning, and outcomes. Prenatal imaging exams like echocardiography, CT, MRI, and ultrasonography are feasible and can provide relevant information about malformation severity and prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Data on differences in brain features between monozygotic (MZ) twins with and without schizophrenia are scarce.\nWe compared brain features of female MZ twins with and without first-episode schizophrenia and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a020 each). Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics were used to analyze differences in brain structure. Whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) and functional connectivity (FC) networks were constructed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data.\nFemale twins with schizophrenia exhibited abnormal gray matter volume (GMV) in the basal ganglia and prefrontal and parietal cortices, impairments in the arcuate fasciculus, and significant disruptions (primarily decreases) in nine EC networks. They exhibited rs-EC alterations involving the limbic areas and subcortex. Combined rs-EC and rs-FC data distinguished twins with first-episode schizophrenia with high accuracy. Combined consideration of structural and functional features enabled the distinction of female MZ twins with schizophrenia from those without schizophrenia and healthy controls with 100% accuracy.\nFemale MZ twins with schizophrenia exhibited increased GMV, white matter impairment, and disruptions in EC and FC networks. The combination of rs-EC\u00a0+\u00a0rs-FC data could distinguish female twins with schizophrenia from twins without schizophrenia and healthy controls with 97.4% accuracy, and the addition of structural brain features yielded a 100% accuracy rate. These findings may provide pivotal insight for further study of the mechanisms underlying schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Placental passage of drugs in twins is poorly understood, and is unknown regarding antiretrovirals (ARVs). In the event of large differences in the exposure of 2 twins to the same maternal therapy, this could have a clinical impact in terms of prevention of perinatal HIV transmission or adverse effects.\nTo describe the frequency of differential transplacental passage of antiretrovirals between twins.\nThe study was performed retrospectively, on data from women included in a multicenter perinatal HIV cohort study. All twin pairs for which the mother received antiretroviral therapy and for which drug concentrations in both of the umbilical cords after cord clamping at delivery were studied. We considered that a difference in concentrations of more than 50 % between twins was a substantial difference (ratios below 0.67 or above 1.50).\nWe analyzed 29 twin pairs, 27 dichorionic and 2 monochorionic diamniotic. Cord blood concentrations differed between the 2 twins by more than 50 % for at least one ARV in 9 twin pairs, 8 dichorionic and 1 monochorionic. Discordant concentrations were observed in one or more cases for several nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, zidovudine) and protease inhibitors (atazanavir, lopinavir, saquinavir et ritonavir); within individual twin pairs placental transfer was discordant for one or more ARVs, but identical for others.\nConcentrations differed in nearly one third of twin pairs. This may be due to interindividual genetic variability of placental transporters between dizygotic twins as well as physiological differences between twins.",

    "abstract": "The surgical separation of two Conjoined Twins is a particularly complex operation. Surgical times are particularly long and post-operative complications are very frequent in this type of procedure. We report a clinical case of surgical separation of two thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twins in which, thanks to the use of (3D) three dimensional technologies, we were able to significantly reduce operative times and improve clinical outcomes.\nWe performed a 3D reconstruction of the anatomical parts involved in congenital fusion using Computer Tomography (CT) images.We obtained virtual anatomical models of the patients which allowed us to estimate essential details as the residual post-operative thoracic volume as well as the exact position of resection planes for both the general separation and for the hepatic splitting procedure. Subsequently, we printed 3D anatomical models of the thoracic cage and sternum and of the liver with the plane of resection. Finally, we printed an additional 3D anatomical model of the two patients representing different organs with multiple colors and materials.\nThe use of 3D printing reduced the duration of surgery by 30% with a favorable patient outcome. Two years after the operation, the patients do not present any type of deficit and have a normal life without any significant complication.\nVirtual anatomical 3D models and 3D printing represent a valid technological tool to support complex surgical operations, especially in pre-surgical planning. 3D models are important tools to better understand complex anatomy and to discuss clinical cases among members of the surgical team.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common birth defect in human with an incidence of almost 1% of all live births. Most cases have a multifactorial origin with both genetics and the environment playing a role in its development and progression. Adding an epigenetic component to this aspect is exemplified by monozygotic twins which share the same genetic background but have a different disease status. As a result, the interplay between the genetic, epigenetic and the environmental conditions might contribute to the etiology and phenotype. To date, the underlying causes of the majority of CHDs remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed genome-wide high-throughput sequencing to examine the genetic, structural genomic and epigenetic differences of two identical twin pairs discordant for Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), representing the most common cyanotic form of CHDs. Our results show the almost identical genetic and structural genomic identity of the twins. In contrast, several epigenetic alterations could be observed given by DNA methylation changes in regulatory regions of known cardiac-relevant genes. Overall, this study provides first insights into the impact of genetic and especially epigenetic factors underlying monozygotic twins discordant for CHD like TOF.",

    "abstract": "Heteropaternal superfecundation is an extremely rare phenomenon that occurs when a second ova released during the same menstrual cycle is additionally fertilized by the sperm cells of a different man in separate sexual intercourse. In August, 2018, the Grupo de Gen\u00e9tica de Poblaciones e Identificaci\u00f3n at Universidad Nacional de Colombia received a request to establish the paternity of a pair of male twins with genetic markers. The following analyses were performed: amelogenin gene, autosomal short tandem repeat (STR), and Y-STR analyses by means of human identification commercial kits, paternity index, and the probability of paternity calculation and interpretation. A paternity index of 2.5134E+7 and a probability of paternity of 99.9999% for twin 2 were obtained while 14 out of 17 Y-chromosome markers and 14 out of 21 autosomal short tandem repeats were excluded for twin 1. The results indicated that the twins have different biological fathers. Although heteropaternal superfecundation is rarely observed among humans given its low frequency, in paternity disputes for dizygotic twins it is mandatory to demand the presence of the two twins in the testing to avoid wrong conclusions.\nLa superfecundaci\u00f3n heteropaternal es un fen\u00f3meno extremadamente raro que se produce cuando un segundo \u00f3vulo, liberado durante el mismo ciclo menstrual, es fertilizado por un espermatozoide de un hombre diferente en relaciones sexuales separadas.

    "abstract": "The article represents clinical and pathoanatomical analysis of a case of full-term pregnancy with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) in one of the twins, which occurred using in vitro fertilization (IVF). The dead macerated fetus with malformations after selective feticide at the 20th week of pregnancy and dichorial diamniotic placenta were studied. In connection with the expressive autolytic changes in the internal organs of the fetus, which do not allow to confirm the diagnosis of left ventricular hypoplasia at autopsy and establish its type of structure, additional measurements of the heart structures of the fetus with HLHS on archived video materials of ultrasound diagnostics were performed. After calculating the diagnostic indices: the index of myocardial layer thickness (ratio of the thicknesses of the trabecular and compact myocardium), the index of cavity shape of the heart in frontal axis (ratio of width to cavity length), cavity-myocardial index (ratio of wall thickness to cavity width), the cylindrical LV structure was retrospectively determined, which is prognostically unfavorable any kind of surgical correction, which justified selective feticide. The article presents the values of diagnostic indices for identifying the types of structure of hypoplastic LV. Prenatal determination of LV type determines treatment tactics: terminate pregnancy in case of adverse LV types, recommend Norwood procedure in the neonatal period with type I or perform fetal aortic valvuloplasty with type II of LV. The maturation disorders (distal villous hypoplasia) that we found in the placenta of a living fetus confirms that, despite the relatively satisfactory condition of the newborn, pregnancies that occur with the use of IVF are high risk group of developmental disability both the fetus and placenta.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare occurrence, and the majority of these malformations are detected during second trimester screening.\nHerein we report a case of conjoined twins, which was diagnosed by ultrasound at 8 wk gestation and was normal at 7 wk gestation. The two fetuses shared one heart and were diagnosed as thoracopagus twins. This is the first report of conjoined twins diagnosed at 8 wk gestation. The pregnancy was terminated electively at 9 wk gestation. Because some congenital malformations can be diagnosed earlier, a prenatal ultrasound examination at an early gestational stage cannot be dismissed.\nThis case demonstrates that a 7-8 wk gestation might be the earliest period when conjoined twins can be diagnosed by ultrasound.",

    "abstract": "Despite folate supplementation, neural tube defects (NTDs) still occur in 0.5-1.0/1,000 pregnancies, with 30-50% not preventable with folate. Twinning has increased due to artificial fertilization and in itself predisposes to NTDs at a rate of 1.6/1,000. The contributions of genetic and environmental factors to myelomeningocele development remain poorly understood. Expression patterns of congenital pathologies in twins can sometimes provide etiological insight. Concordance of NTDs in twins is 0.03/1,000, with dual myelomeningocele reported in only 23 pairs, only one of which survived. We present the 24th pair, the 1st to maintain lower extremity motor function. We review all prior cases and discuss implications of twin concordance on the interplay of genetic and environmental influences. Case Report and Review: A new case of female monozygotic twins born to a well-nourished 24-year-old female is reported with details of perioperative care. Prenatal ultrasound showed L3-S4 and L5-S4 myelomeningoceles, Chiari II malformations, and ventriculomegaly. Copy number microarray was unrevealing. Each underwent uncomplicated repair on day of life 1, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement on days of life 10 and 16. Both had movement in the legs upon 6-week follow-up. All prior reported cases of concordant twin myelomeningoceles were abstracted and analyzed, revealing persistence of occurrence despite folate supplementation and a majority occurring in dizygotic pairs. The literature is also reviewed to summarize current knowledge of myelomeningocele pathophysiology as it relates to genetic and environmental influences.\nMeticulous surgical and perioperative care allowed for early positive outcomes in each twin. However, etiopathogenesis remains elusive. In general, only of a minority of cases have underlying genetic lesions or clear environmental triggers. Concordance in monozygotic twins argues for a strong genetic influence; yet, literature review reveals a higher rate of concordant dizygotic twins. This, along with the observation of differing resultant phenotypes in monozygotic twins as seen in this case, prompts further investigation into nonfolate environmental influences. While efforts in genetic investigation should continue, the role of teratogens and exposures should not be minimized in research efforts, public health, and family counseling. Clinical genetic testing remains of limited utility in the majority of patients until more is known.",

    "abstract": "Kenny-Caffey syndrome (KCS) type 2 (OMIM 127000) is a rare syndromic cause of hypoparathyroidism which is characterized by proportionate short stature, long bone abnormalities, delayed closure of anterior fontanelle, eye abnormalities, and normal intelligence. It is caused by variants in FAM111A (NM_001942519.1). In this review, we reported the first Chinese patients, a pair of monozygotic twins, with genetically confirmed KCS type 2 with over 20\u2009years follow-up. We summarized the clinical features of 14 previously reported and genetically confirmed KCS type 2 patients; our twin patients exhibited a unique spinal manifestation which could be an important age-dependent feature of KCS type 2. In this review, over 60% KCS type 2 patients had dental problem and over 80% suffered from refractive errors or structural eye abnormalities. Therefore, early dental, ophthalmological, and orthopedic assessments are warranted for KCS type 2 patients. Micro-orchidism, previously reported in KCS type 2 patients, was also detected in our patients. The possibility of subfertility should be considered in male KCS type 2 patients. A multidisciplinary management approach for this rare syndrome is recommended.",

    "abstract": "In vitro fertilization (IVF) is associated with a higher incidence of monozygotic twin pregnancies, which are known to be burdened by a higher risk of main obstetric complications. The reasons behind this association are still unclear. In the present study, we therefore investigate the risk factors for monozygotic twinning in pregnancies achieved by IVF. We conducted a multicenter retrospective case-control study. All IVF cycles performed between 2014 and 2019 at the infertility units of two Italian academic institutes were retrospectively reviewed. Only pregnancies obtained with single embryo transfer were eligible. A total of 50 monozygotic twin pregnancies (cases) were identified and matched in a 1:5 ratio to 250 singleton pregnancies (controls) by study center and study period. Monozygotic twin pregnancies were diagnosed by ultrasound. Women experiencing miscarriage could be included provided that the pregnancy loss occurred after a definitive diagnosis of monozygotic twin pregnancy. Demographic, clinical, and embryological characteristics were retrieved from patients' charts. Overall, the incidence of monozygotic twin pregnancies was 1.2% (50 out of 4016 single embryo transfers). At univariate analyses, statistically significant differences emerged for BMI, peripheral levels of estradiol and progesterone at the time of hCG administration, total number of retrieved suitable oocytes, freezing-thawing cycles, and assisted hatching. After performing a multivariate logistic analysis, only assisted hatching remained significantly associated with monozygotic twinning (adjusted odds ratio 2.32, 95%CI 1.03-5.25). Blastomere separation during the passage through this artificial hole or interference with the signaling pathway within the embryo could be the mechanisms involved.",

    "abstract": "Large birthweight discrepancy has been identified as a risk factor for perinatal morbidity and mortality in twin pregnancies. However, it remains unclear whether such discordance can be predicted by various biological indices with specific cut-off values, and how these depend on the gestational age. We aimed to determine the most effective way to predict large birthweight discordance at various gestational ages.\nA retrospective cohort study of dichorionic twins, live-born between 2008 and 2018, was conducted. Discordances in biparietal diameter, head circumference, humerus and femur length, abdominal circumference, and estimated fetal weight were calculated-([larger twin\u00a0-\u00a0smaller twin]\u00a0/\u00a0larger twin)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100%-and compared between those with and without a large birthweight discordance (\u226520%). Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to analyze the predictive characteristics of each parameter.\nOf 598 dichorionic twin pregnancies included, 83 (13.9%) had a birthweight discordance \u226520%. Group differences in biparietal diameter and head circumference discordance were the earliest to emerge (before 20\u00a0weeks of gestation), but became insignificant after 36\u00a0weeks, followed by humerus and femur length, estimated fetal weight discordance (after 20\u00a0weeks), and abdominal circumference discordance (after 28\u00a0weeks). The best predictors (with cut-off values) were discordance in biparietal diameter \u22657.8% at <20\u00a0weeks, head circumference \u22654.5% at 20-23\nDifferent predictors and cut-off values may be useful for predicting large inter-twin birthweight discordance in dichorionic twins at different gestational ages. It is more accurate to use biparietal diameter and head circumference discordance in the early second trimester, humerus length discordance in the late second trimester, and estimated fetal weight discordance in the third trimester.",

Given that gestational age (GA) is closely associated with both BWD and adverse neonatal outcomes, the aim of our study is to develop a measure that takes both BWD and GA into account to define BWD and explore the potentially optimal delivery time in dichorionic twins, with the balance against the risk of intrauterine demise and adverse neonatal outcomes.\nAbout 99,000 mixed gender twin pairs from the US matched multiple birth file from 1995 to 2000 were enrolled in our study. We set up a two-dimensional matrix model to select the BWD cutoff point related to outcomes. The optimal delivery time was identified based on the risks of adverse neonatal outcomes and fetal death by GA.\nThe combination of BWD and GA had a higher predictive performance for adverse neonatal outcomes than BWD alone (area under ROC curve (AUC): 0.816 vs. 0.523, \nThe combination of BWD and GA was a better predictor for adverse neonatal outcomes than BWD alone. In dichorionic twins with BWD >40%, pregnancy may be continued till 33-34 gestation weeks if there is no indication for immediate delivery.",

    "abstract": "While cervical length (CL) provides an effective screening tool for spontaneous preterm birth in singletons, the performance in twins is still controversial. Our aim was twofold. First, to compare the performance of a single CL measurement at mid-gestation (\u223c20\u2009weeks) versus serial measurements as a predictor of spontaneous preterm birth < 34\u2009weeks in uncomplicated twin pregnancies. Second, to describe the performance of a single CL at \u223c24, \u223c28 and \u223c32\u2009weeks.\ncohort study of twins followed at Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires from 2013 to 2017. Inclusion criteria were dichorionic or monochorionic diamniotic twins with CL measurement between 18 and 33\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks with available data of the delivery. Exclusion criteria included any of the following complications: iatrogenic preterm delivery <34\u2009weeks, cerclage, fetal growth restriction, fetal death, structural anomalies, polyhydramnios, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, selective fetal growth restriction, twin anemia-polycythemia sequence, and twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence. Spontaneous preterm birth was defined as spontaneous delivery < 34\u2009weeks. Two different cutoffs were used to classify CL as short (positive screening) or normal (negative screening): (a) a fixed cutoff of 25\u2009mm at any gestational age (GA). The screening was considered positive if any CL measurement was <25\u2009mm; and (b) a GA adjusted cutoff to a 10% false positive rate (FPR). The 10% FPR for each GA was calculated and the screening was considered positive if any of the CL measurements were below this 10% FPR cutoff. We report sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, positive and negative likelihood ratio and area under the ROC curve.\nAmong 777 twins followed in our Unit, 381 met exclusion criteria and 18 were excluded due to incomplete follow-up. We included 378 patients, 284 (75%) dichorionic and 94 (25%) monochorionic. The performance of one CL at 20\u2009weeks showed a sensitivity \u2264 20% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.45-0.70), while the performance of serial measurements showed a sensitivity of 58.8% (95% CI, 40.7-75.4) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.61-0.79) (\nSerial measurements showed a better performance than a single one in mid-gestation. Moreover, among single measurements the CL in mid-gestation showed the poorest performance, while the 28\u2009weeks assessment detected half of the preterm deliveries. However, all the strategies showed modest performances.",

We hypothesize that this is partially due to mis-specified modeling concerning phenotype distribution as well as the relationship between SNP dosage and the level of the phenotype. To overcome these issues, we introduced an assumption-free method based on generalized correlation coefficient (GCC) in a GWAS of cognitive function in Danish and Chinese twins to compare its performance with traditional linear models. The GCC-based GWAS identified two significant SNPs in Danish samples (rs71419535, p ",

    "abstract": "We present prenatal diagnosis and management of monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for severe fetal abnormalities.\nA 36-year-old woman underwent amniocentesis at 18 weeks of gestation because of advanced maternal age, and hydrops fetalis, a giant cystic hygroma of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0cm and left hydronephrosis in a co-twin. The other co-twin was structurally normal. Amniocentesis revealed a karyotype of 46,XY in both co-twins. Simultaneous polymorphic DNA marker analysis using the DNAs extracted from maternal blood and uncultured amniocytes confirmed MZ twinning. The woman underwent a successful selective fetal reduction by radiofrequency ablation at 22 weeks of gestation. At 28 weeks of gestation, premature rupture of membranes occurred, and a 1280-g normal male baby and a 275-g dead malformed co-twin were delivered. The normal co-twin was phenotypically normal and was doing well at age seven weeks.\nPrenatal diagnosis of MZ twins discordant for structural abnormalities should include a differential diagnosis of MZ twinning, and a zygosity test is necessary under such a circumstance.",

    "abstract": "New innovative Digital Twins can represent complex bioprocesses, including the biological, physico-chemical, and chemical reaction kinetics, as well as the mechanical and physical characteristics of the reactors and the involved peripherals. Digital Twins are an ideal tool for the rapid and cost-effective development, realisation and optimisation of control and automation strategies. They may be utilised for the development and implementation of conventional controllers (e.g. temperature, dissolved oxygen, etc.), as well as for advanced control strategies (e.g. control of substrate or metabolite concentrations, multivariable controls), and the development of complete bioprocess control. This chapter describes the requirements Digital Twins must fulfil to be used for bioprocess control strategy development, and implementation and gives an overview of research projects where Digital Twins or \"early-stage\" Digital Twins were used in this context. Furthermore, applications of Digital Twins for the academic education of future control and bioprocess engineers as well as for the training of future bioreactor operators will be described. Finally, a case study is presented, in which an \"early-stage\" Digital Twin was applied for the development of control strategies of the fed-batch cultivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Development, realisation and optimisation of control strategies utilising Digital Twins.",

    "abstract": "Twins have an increased risk for congenital malformations and disruptions, including defects in brain morphogenesis. We analyzed data on brain imaging, zygosity, sex, and fetal demise in 56 proband twins and 7 less affected co-twins with abnormal brain imaging and compared them to population-based data and to a literature series. We separated our series into malformations of cortical development (MCD, N\u00a0=\u200939), cerebellar malformations without MCD (N\u00a0=\u200913), and brain disruptions (N\u00a0=\u200911). The MCD group included 37/39 (95%) with polymicrogyria (PMG), 8/39 (21%) with pia-ependymal clefts (schizencephaly), and 15/39 (38%) with periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) including 2 with PNH but not PMG. Cerebellar malformations were found in 19 individuals including 13 with a cerebellar malformation only and another 6 with cerebellar malformation and MCD. The pattern varied from diffuse cerebellar hypoplasia to classic Dandy-Walker malformation. Brain disruptions were seen in 11 individuals with hydranencephaly, porencephaly, or white matter loss without cysts. Our series included an expected statistically significant excess of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (22/41 MZ, 54%) compared to population data (482/1448 MZ, 33.3%; p\u00a0=\u2009.0110), and an unexpected statistically significant excess of dizygotic (DZ) twins (19/41, 46%) compared to the literature cohort (1/46 DZ, 2%; p\u00a0<\u2009.0001. Recurrent association with twin-twin transfusion syndrome, intrauterine growth retardation, and other prenatal factors support disruption of vascular perfusion as the most likely unifying cause.",

    "abstract": "A future-oriented approach is the application of Digital Twins for process development, optimization and finally during manufacturing. Digital Twins are detailed virtual representations of bioprocesses with predictive capabilities. In biotechnology, Digital Twins can be used to monitor processes and to provide data for process control and optimization. Central and crucial components of Digital Twins are mathematical process models, which are capable to describe and predict cultivations with high fidelity. Detailed mechanistic models in particular are suitable for both use in Digital Twins and for the development of process control strategies.In this chapter the requirements that process models must fulfil in order to be used for process optimization and finally in Digital Twins will be described. Different types of models, including mechanistic as well as compartmentalized models, are outlined and their application in Digital Twins and for process optimization is explained. Finally, a structured, compartmentalized process model, which was specifically designed for process optimization and has already been used in Digital Twins, is highlighted.",

This review is followed by a look into the lives of a pair of monozygotic male twins who have lived in different continents for many years, but who stay closely connected. The reasons behind their decision and its impact on their behavioral resemblance and social relationship quality are examined. The next section summarizes recent studies that address the management of monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies, paternity testing in multiple pregnancies, trisomies in twin pregnancies and the roots of resilience. The final portion of this article presents human-interest stories involving reunited Brazilian twins, a new resource for twins with disabled co-twins, twins separated in the Secret of the Nile television series, a new book about Dr Josef Mengele and his horrific twin experiments conducted at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, and a pair of twins dedicated to helping others.",

A prospective observational study was conducted including 100 uncomplicated MCDA twins matched by gestational age to 200 low-risk singletons. Echocardiography was performed at 26-30 weeks gestation and cord blood B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was measured at delivery. In both groups, z-scores for echocardiographic parameters were within normal ranges; however the monochorionic group had larger atrial areas (mean (standard deviation) right atria-to-heart ratio: 17.0 (2) vs. 15.9 (1); ",

We aimed to decipher the mechanisms behind successful GC treatment in twins carrying a BRICHOS c.566G > A (p.Cys189Tyr) mutation in the SP-C gene (SFTPC). METHODS: The twins underwent bronchoscopy before and after GC treatment and immunoblotting analysis of SP-C proprotein (proSP-C) and SP-C mature in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF). Total RNA was extracted and analysed using quantitative real-time PCR assays. In A549 cells, the processing of mutated protein C189Y was studied by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting after heterologous expression of eukaryotic vectors containing wild type or C189Y mutant cDNA. RESULTS: Before treatment, BALF analysis identified an alteration of the proSP-C maturation process. Functional study of C189Y mutation in alveolar A549 cells showed that pro-SP-C",

    "abstract": "Lip print patterns are referred to as unique to each individual, but controversy exists surrounding twins. In this study, the lip prints of 19 pairs of monozygotic and 47 pairs of dizygotic twins were studied. The left lower lip was photographed and the furrows were classified using Renaud's classification. Results showed the same lip pattern was found only in one monozygotic pair (5.3%) and in 4 dizygotic pairs (8.5%), and no significant statistical differences were found between groups (p > 0.05). In monozygotic twins only type C furrows presence displayed statistical significant differences (p=0.034). As for dizygotic twins, there were statistical significant differences in the frequency of type A (p=0.005) and type G furrows (p=0.018). As for the most common types, both groups displayed a higher prevalence of vertical furrows (type B: 97.4% and 96.8%, type A: 86.8% and 87.2%, in monozygotic and dizygotic, respectively). The least frequent furrow type was type I and type E in monozygotic (2.6% and 5.3%, respectively) and types E, F and I, in dizygotic (6.4%, 7.4%. and 7.4%, respectively). Our results seem to point out that lip print patterns should be useful carefully in twins' identification.",

    "abstract": "Blood biomarkers of multiple sclerosis (MS) can provide a better understanding of pathophysiology and enable disease monitoring. Here, we performed quantitative shotgun lipidomics on the plasma of a unique cohort of 73 monozygotic twins discordant for MS. We analyzed 243 lipid species, evaluated lipid features such as fatty acyl chain length and number of acyl chain double bonds, and detected phospholipids that were significantly altered in the plasma of co-twins with MS compared to their non-affected siblings. Strikingly, changes were most prominent in ether phosphatidylethanolamines and ether phosphatidylcholines, suggesting a role for altered lipid signaling in the disease.",

    "abstract": "The Upper Palaeolithic double burial of newborns and the single burial of a ca. 3-month-old infant uncovered at the Gravettian site of Krems-Wachtberg, Austria, are of paramount importance given the rarity of immature human remains from this time. Genome-wide ancient DNA shows that the male infants of the double grave are the earliest reported case of monozygotic twins, while the single grave\u00b4s individual was their 3rd-degree male relative. We assessed the individuals\u00b4 age at death by applying histological and \u00b5CT inspection of the maxillary second incisors (i2) in conjunction with C- and N-isotope ratios and Barium (Ba) intake as biomarker for breastfeeding. The results show that the twins were full-term newborns, and that while individual 2 died at birth, individual 1 survived for about 50 days. The findings show that Gravettian mortuary behaviour also included re-opening of a grave and manipulation of its layout and content.",

    "abstract": "In 2012, a thought experiment in this journal suggested that paternity cases involving monozygotic (MZ) twins as putative fathers could be solved by means of whole genome sequencing (WGS). Although arising from a single fertilization event, MZ twins nevertheless continue to acquire somatic mutations during their development, including those that occur in the germline. Provided that paternity had been narrowed down to the twin pair beforehand by classical DNA analysis, one post-zygotic mutation would suffice to assign the paternal compartment of an offspring genome unambiguously to either twin if that mutation is found in the offspring and one twin, but not in the other twin. Since the publication of a proof-of-principle report in 2014, we have worked up five additional cases of MZ twin germline discrimination in real life, four paternity disputes and one criminal case requiring the identification of a sperm trace donor among a pair of MZ twin brothers. In this opinion paper, we report on the experiences made in the course of our work and take a look at possibilities for further development of the approach.",

    "abstract": "To explore and apply multimodel inference to test the relative contributions of latent genetic, environmental and direct causal factors to the covariation between two variables with data from the classical twin design by estimating model-averaged parameters.\nBehavior genetics is concerned with understanding the causes of variation in phenotypes and the causes of covariation between two or more phenotypes. Two variables may correlate as a result of genetic, shared environmental or unique environmental factors contributing to variation in both variables. Two variables may also correlate because one or both directly cause variation in the other. Furthermore, covariation may result from any combination of these sources, leading to 25 different identified structural equation models. OpenMx was used to fit all these models to account for covariation between two variables collected in twins. Multimodel inference and model averaging were used to summarize the key sources of covariation, and estimate the magnitude of these causes of covariance. Extensions of these models to test heterogeneity by sex are discussed.\nWe illustrate the application of multimodel inference by fitting a comprehensive set of bivariate models to twin data from the Virginia Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders. Analyses of body mass index and tobacco consumption data show sufficient power to reject distinct models, and to estimate the contribution of each of the five potential sources of covariation, irrespective of selecting the best fitting model. Discrimination between models on sample size, type of variable (continuous versus binary or ordinal measures) and the effect size of sources of variance and covariance.\nWe introduce multimodel inference and model averaging approaches to the behavior genetics community, in the context of testing models for the causes of covariation between traits in term of genetic, environmental and causal explanations.",

    "abstract": "In next-generation Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, every object such as a wearable device, a smartphone, a vehicle, and even a sensor or an actuator will be provided with a digital counterpart (twin) with the aim of augmenting the physical object's capabilities and acting on its behalf when interacting with third parties. Moreover, such objects can be able to interact and autonomously establish social relationships according to the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm. In such a context, the goal of this work is to provide an optimal solution for the social-aware placement of IoT digital twins (DTs) at the network edge, with the twofold aim of reducing the latency (i) between physical devices and corresponding DTs for efficient data exchange, and (ii) among DTs of friend devices to speed-up the service discovery and chaining procedures across the SIoT network. To this aim, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model taking into account limited computing resources in the edge cloud and social relationships among IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "Multiple ovulations and so multiple pregnancies have increased recently in dairy cattle. The incidence of the double ovulation impact in high producers at insemination may be over 20%. Twin pregnancies are undesirable as they seriously compromise the welfare and productive lifespan of the cow and herd economy. Clinical problems extend from the time of pregnancy diagnosis to pregnancy loss, abortion or parturition. Early pregnancy loss or abortion of multiple pregnancies lead in most cases to culling. In cows reaching their term, mean productive lifespan is up to about 300 days shorter for cows delivering twins than for cows delivering singletons. While there is an urgent need to address multiple pregnancy prevention procedures in the foreseeable future, the incidence of twin pregnancies continues to rise in parallel with increased milk production. Herein, we review two contrasting measures proposed for the time of twin pregnancy diagnosis: (1) gonadotropin-releasing hormone treatment for pregnancy maintenance, or (2) embryo reduction. These options are discussed in terms of their implications for individual animal health and herd economy. Our main conclusions find that manual twin reduction has proven to be the best management option, whereas the use of prostaglandin F",

Even in large pediatric centers, radiologists are unlikely to encounter more than one such event in their medical careers. This rarity makes it daunting to select a CT and MRI protocol for these infants. Using the experience of two tertiary pediatric hospitals with six sets of craniopagus twins, this multidisciplinary and multimodal integrated imaging approach highlights the key questions that need addressing in the decision-making process for possible surgical intervention.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive ability plays an important role in mental and physical well-beings in the increasingly ageing populations. Here, based on a sample of 30 cognitive function-discordant monozygotic twin pairs, we aimed to detect specific epigenetic variants potentially related to cognitive function by conducting an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). Association between methylation level of single CpG site with cognitive function score was tested by linear mixed effect model. Functions of cis-regulatory regions and ontology enrichments were predicted by Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected by comb-p python library. A list of 28 CpG sites were identified to reach the level of P\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with an increasing risk of decline in cognitive abilities. The decline is, however, not a homogeneous process. There are substantial differences across individuals although previous investigations have identified individuals with distinct cognitive trajectories. Evidence is accumulating that lifestyle contributes significantly to the classification of individuals into various clusters. How and whether genetically related individuals, like twins, change in a more similar manner is yet not fully understood.\nIn this study, we fitted growth mixture models to Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores from participants of the Swedish OCTO twin study of oldest-old monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twins with the purpose of investigating whether twin pairs can be assigned to the same class of cognitive change.\nWe identified four distinct groups (latent classes) whose MMSE trajectories followed different patterns of change over time: two classes of high performing individuals who remained stable and declined slowly, respectively, a group of mildly impaired individuals with a fast decline and a small group of impaired individuals who declined more rapidly. Notably, our analyses show no association between zygosity and class assignment.\nOur study provides evidence for a more substantial impact of environmental, rather than genetic, influences on cognitive change trajectories in later life.",

    "abstract": "The increasing number of frail elderly people in our aging society is becoming problematic: about 11% of community-dwelling older persons are frail and another 42% are pre-frail. Consequently, a major challenge in the coming years will be to test people over the age of 60\u00a0years to detect pre-frailty at the earliest stage and to return them to robustness using the targeted interventions that are becoming increasingly available. This challenge requires individual longitudinal monitoring (ILM) or follow-up of community-dwelling older persons using quantitative approaches. This paper briefly describes an effort to tackle this challenge. Extending the detection of the pre-frail stages to other population groups is also suggested. Appropriate algorithms have been used to begin the tracing of faint physiological signals in order to detect transitions from robustness to pre-frailty states and from pre-frailty to frailty states. It is hoped that these studies will allow older adults to receive preventive treatment at the correct institutions and by the appropriate professionals as early as possible, which will prevent loss of autonomy. Altogether, ILM is conceived as an emerging property of databases (\"digital twins\") and not the reverse. Furthermore, ILM should facilitate a coordinated set of actions by the caregivers, which is a complex challenge in itself. This approach should be gradually extended to all ages, because frailty has no age, as is testified by overwork, burnout, and post-traumatic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Even though genetic predisposition has proven to be an important element in Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology, monozygotic (MZ) twins with PD displayed a concordance rate of only about 20% despite their shared identical genetic background.\nWe recruited 5 pairs of MZ twins discordant for idiopathic PD and established skin fibroblast cultures to investigate mitochondrial phenotypes in these cellular models against the background of a presumably identical genome. To test for genetic differences, we performed whole genome sequencing, deep mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing, and tested for mitochondrial deletions by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the fibroblast cultures. Further, the fibroblast cultures were tested for mitochondrial integrity by immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR to quantify gene expression.\nGenome sequencing did not identify any genetic difference. We found decreased mitochondrial functionality with reduced cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, altered mitochondrial morphology, elevated protein levels of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and increased levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-\u03b1 (PPARGC1A) messenger RNA (mRNA) in skin fibroblast cultures from the affected compared to the unaffected twins. Further, there was a tendency for a higher number of somatic mtDNA variants among the affected twins.\nWe demonstrate disease-related differences in mitochondrial integrity in the genetically identical twins. Of note, the clinical expression matches functional alterations of the mitochondria. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:158-164.",

    "abstract": "The population structure of the Indian subcontinent is a tapestry of extraordinary diversity characterized by the amalgamation of autochthonous and immigrant ancestries and rigid enforcement of sociocultural stratification. Here we investigated the genetic origin and population history of the Kumhars, a group of people who inhabit large parts of northern India. We compared 27 previously published Kumhar SNP genotype data sampled from Uttar Pradesh in north India to various modern day and ancient populations.\nVarious approaches such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Admixture, TreeMix concurred that Kumhars have high ASI ancestry, minimal Steppe component and high genomic proximity to the Kurchas, a small and relatively little-known population found ~\u20092500\u2009km away in Kerala, south India. Given the same, biogeographical mapping using Geographic Population Structure (GPS) assigned most Kumhar samples in areas neighboring to those where Kurchas are found in south India.\nWe hypothesize that the significant genomic similarity between two apparently distinct modern-day Indian populations that inhabit well separated geographical areas with no known overlapping history or links, likely alludes to their common origin during or post the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization (estimated by ALDER). Thereafter, while they dispersed towards opposite ends of the Indian subcontinent, their genomic integrity and likeness remained preserved due to endogamous social practices. Our findings illuminate the genomic history of two Indian populations, allowing a glimpse into one or few of numerous of human migrations that likely occurred across the Indian subcontinent and contributed to shape its varied and vibrant evolutionary past.",

    "abstract": "The anatomy of the articular surfaces has historically identified as major responsible for acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis (ACJO). On the other side, the almost 100% prevalence of ACJO in subjects over 50\u00a0years old seems to suggest a multifactorial etiology. We compared ACJO between asymptomatic elderly monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins to investigate the influence of genetics and environmental factors.\nThirty pairs of twins [15MZ-15DZ; mean age (SD): 63.70 (3.31); range: 53-72] were retrospectively enrolled. ACJO was evaluated on MRI through a 4-grade severity scale and ACJ configuration was assessed. Information regarding work activity were obtained. Heritability index was calculated.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value of 0.868 (95% CI; 0.798 to 0.917). An ICC values of 0.889 (95% CI; 0.798 to 0.944) and 0.843 (95% CI, 0.712 to 0.920) were found in the MZ and DZ groups, respectively. The polychoric correlation was 0.857 in the MZ twins and 0.757 in the DZ twins. The calculated heritability index was 0.20 (20%), and the contribution of the shared environment (c2) and unique environment (e2) was 0.66 (66%) and 0.14 (14%), respectively. No relationship between job types and ACJO in both the total cohort (r\u00a0=\u00a00.089; p\u00a0=\u00a00.499) and in the monozygotic (r\u00a0=\u00a00.247; p\u00a0=\u00a00.187) and the dizygotic twin groups (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.084; p\u00a0=\u00a00.658) was found.\nThe role of genetics on ACJO accounts for only 20%; a specific anatomical configuration of the articular surfaces only partially acts on the development of joint osteoarthritis. Environmental factors have the greatest impact.\nIV.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare congenital anomaly. If separation of the conjoined organs is feasible, reconstruction of the skin and tissue defects is a challenge for the plastic surgeon. This article describes the use of opposing triangle flaps in the separation of three different kinds of conjoined twins.\nPlastic surgeons measured each conjoined area and designated the vertical length as a and the width as b. The length of the base of the opposing triangle flap was calculated to match a, and the height of the triangle to match b.\nAfter detailed calculations and careful surgery, the area of the opposing triangle flaps nearly covered the areas exposed after separation, and the three conjoined twins achieved primary closure of their wounds. The pygopagus and ischiopagus twins recovered uneventfully. The omphalopagus twins developed a wound infection, but after daily wound care, the twins recovered within a week.\nWith precise calculations, the opposing triangle flap is a feasible and effective method for defect closure after separation of conjoined twins in certain cases. Clinicians may prefer this technique because it avoids the complications and second surgery necessitated by tissue expanders.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This review article summarizes a program of longitudinal investigation of twins' language acquisition with a focus on causal pathways for specific language impairment (SLI) and nonspecific language impairment in children at 4 and 6 years with known history at 2 years. Method The context of the overview is established by legacy scientific papers in genetics, language, and SLI. Five recent studies of twins are summarized, from 2 to 16 years of age, with a longitudinal perspective of heritability over multiple speech, language, and cognitive phenotypes. Results Replicated moderate-to-high heritability is reported across ages, phenotypes, full population estimates, and estimates for clinical groups. Key outcomes are documentation of a twinning effect of risk for late language acquisition in twins that persists through 6 years of age, greater for monozygotic than dizygotic twins (although zygosity effects disappear at 6 years); heritability is greater for grammar and morphosyntax than other linguistic dimensions, from age 2 years through age 16 years, replicated within twin samples at subsequent age levels and across twin samples at age 16 years. Conclusion There is consistent support for legacy models of genetic influences on language acquisition, updated with a more precise growth signaling disruption model supported by twin data, as well as singleton data of children with SLI and nonspecific language impairment.

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe disorder, for which genetic evidence suggests psychiatric as well as metabolic origins. AN has high somatic and psychiatric comorbidities, broad impact on quality of life, and elevated mortality. Risk factor studies of AN have focused on differences between acutely ill and recovered individuals. Such comparisons often yield ambiguous conclusions, as alterations could reflect different effects depending on the comparison. Whereas differences found in acutely ill patients could reflect state effects that are due to acute starvation or acute disease-specific factors, they could also reflect underlying traits. Observations in recovered individuals could reflect either an underlying trait or a \"scar\" due to lasting effects of sustained undernutrition and illness. The co-twin control design (i.e., monozygotic [MZ] twins who are discordant for AN and MZ concordant control twin pairs) affords at least partial disambiguation of these effects.\nComprehensive Risk Evaluation for Anorexia nervosa in Twins (CREAT) will be the largest and most comprehensive investigation of twins who are discordant for AN to date. CREAT utilizes a co-twin control design that includes endocrinological, neurocognitive, neuroimaging, genomic, and multi-omic approaches coupled with an experimental component that explores the impact of an overnight fast on most measured parameters.\nThe multimodal longitudinal twin assessment of the CREAT study will help to disambiguate state, trait, and \"scar\" effects, and thereby enable a deeper understanding of the contribution of genetics, epigenetics, cognitive functions, brain structure and function, metabolism, endocrinology, microbiology, and immunology to the etiology and maintenance of AN.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput gene sequencing has identified various genetic variants as the culprits for some common hereditary cancers. However, the heritability of a substantial proportion of cancers remains unexplained, which may result from rare deleterious mutations hidden in a myriad of nonsense genetic variations. This poses a great challenge to the understanding of the pathology and thus the rational design of effective treatments for affected patients. Here, whole genome sequencing is employed in a representative case in which one monozygotic twin is\u00a0discordant for lung inflammatory myofibroblastoma to disclose rare tumor-related mutations.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the first-trimester crown-rump length (CRL) and nuchal translucency (NT) discordance in monochorionic diamniotic twins (MCDA) for the prediction of complications-twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) or intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD).\nIntertwin discordance in the CRL and NT was calculated as a percentage of the larger CRL and NT, respectively. The performance of inter twin discordance (CRL\u2009\u2265\u200910% and NT\u2265\u200920%) for predicting complications was analysed using standard statistical screening test methods.\nFifty-eight MCDA twin pregnancies were studied. Out of them, 19 (32%) pregnancies resulted in one of the complications studied (4 TTTS, 10 sFGR, 5 IUFD). CRL and NT discordance showed an increased probability of developing complications positive likelihood ratio (LR+) {95% confidence interval}: 2.05 {0.46-9.23} and 1.88 {1.03-3.45}, respectively. NT discordance showed a sensitivity of 57%.\nAlthough discordant first-trimester CRL and NT in monochorionic twins are poor screening tools for early prediction, if positive, they increase the risk of developing complications.",

    "abstract": "Pleuropulmonary blastomas (PPB) are rare aggressive paediatric lung malignancies and are among the most common DICER1-related disorders: it is estimated that 75-80% of children with a PPB have the DICER1 mutation. DICER1 mutations are responsible for familial tumour susceptibility syndrome with an increased risk of tumours. In approximately 35% of families with children manifesting PPB, further malignancies may be observed. Symptoms of DICER1 syndrome may vary, even within monozygotic twins. Preventive screening of carriers with DICER1 mutations is important and follow-up is undertaken as recommended by the 2016 International PPB Register.\nWe present two pairs of monozygotic twins. In one pair of 4-year, 2-month old girls, both with DICER1 mutation, one developed PPB(II) and her identical sibling had acute transient hepatitis. In the other pair of 19-month-old female babies, one had a history of bronchopulmonary hypoplasia and developed PPB(III) without DICER1 mutation, and her identical sibling had allergic asthma. Both patients with PPB were treated with R0 resection and received 12\u2009cycles of postoperative chemotherapy. At the most recent review, the twins had been followed up for six and eight years, respectively, and they all remained healthy. However, the height and weight of the patients with PPB were lower than those of their respective identical sister.\nPPB is rare, especially in monozygotic twins. We emphasise the importance of genetic testing and follow-up in monozygotic twins with PPB. During the follow-up, children surviving PPB should be monitored closely for growth and development disorders which caused by chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS, OMIM#606232), or 22q13 deletion syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder caused by deletion of the distal long arm of chromosome 22 with a variety of clinical features that display considerably heterogeneous degrees of severity. The SHANK3 gene is understood to be the critical gene for the neurological features of this syndrome.\nWe describe one pair of boy-girl twins with a 22q13 deletion not involving the SHANK3 gene. Interestingly, the clinical and molecular findings of the two patients were identical, likely resulting from germline mosaicism in a parent. The boy-girl twins showed intellectual disability, speech absence, facial dysmorphism, cyanosis, large fleshy hands and feet, dysplastic fingernails and abnormal behaviors, and third-generation sequencing showed an identical de novo interstitial deletion of 6.0\u2009Mb in the 22q13.31-q13.33 region.\nOur case suggests that prenatal diagnosis is essential for normal parents with affected children due to the theoretical possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Our results also indicated that other genes located in the 22q13 region may have a role in explaining symptoms in individuals with PMS. In particular, we propose that four candidate genes, CELSR1, ATXN10, FBLN1 and WNT7B, may also be involved in the etiology of the clinical features of PMS. However, more studies of smaller interstitial deletions with 22q13 are needed to corroborate our hypothesis and better define the genotype-phenotype correlation. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of PMS.",

    "abstract": "Familial and genetic factors seem to contribute to the development of depression but whether this varies with age at diagnosis remains unclear. We examined the influence of familial factors on the risk of depression by age at first diagnosis.\nWe included 23\u00a0498 monozygotic and 39\u00a0540 same-sex dizygotic twins from the population-based Danish Twin Registry, followed from 1977 through 2011 in nationwide registers. We used time-to-event analyses accounting for censoring and competing risk of death to estimate cumulative incidence, casewise concordance, relative recurrence risk, and heritability of first depression by age using monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twin pairs.\nDuring follow-up, a total of 1545 twins were diagnosed with depression. For twins at age 35 or younger at first depression, heritability was estimated to be 24.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6-43.1%), whereas at age 90 it was 14.7% (95% CI, 3.1-26.3%). The relative recurrence risk was higher at younger ages: At age 35, the risk was 27.7-fold (95% CI, 20.0-35.5) and 6.9-fold (95% CI, 3.9-9.8) higher than the population risk for monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twins, respectively, while the corresponding numbers were 3.0 (95% CI, 2.3-3.6) and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3-2.2) at age 90. Heritability seemed similar for male and female twins.\nFamilial risk of depression, caused either by genes or shared environment, seemed to slightly decrease with age at diagnosis and an elevated concordance risk for monozygotic over same-sex dizygotic pairs suggested a genetic contribution to the development of depression.",

    "abstract": "DNA base identification is a proper and high specificity method. However, identification could be challenged in a situation where there is no database or the DNA sequence is almost identical, as in the case of monozygotic (MZ) twins. The aim of this study was to introduce a novel forensic method for distinguishing between almost identical MZ twins by means of an intraoral scanner using the 3D digital pattern of the human palate.\nThe palatal area of 64 MZ twins and 33 same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twins (DZSS) and seven opposite-sex dizygotic twins (DZOS) were scanned three times with an intraoral scanner. From the scanned data, an STL file was created and exported into the GOM Inspect\u00ae inspection software. All scans within a twin pair were superimposed on each other. The average deviation between scans of the same subject (intra-subject deviation, ISD) and between scans of the two siblings within a twin pair (intra-twin deviation, ITD) was measured. One-sided tolerance interval covering 99% of the population with 99% confidence was calculated for the ISD (upper limit) and the ITD (lower limit).\nThe mean ISD of the palatal scan was 35.3\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00b1\u20090.78\u2009\u03bcm. The calculated upper tolerance limit was 95\u2009\u03bcm. The mean ITD of MZ twins (406\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009\u03bcm) was significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) higher than the ISD, and it was significantly lower than the ITD of DZSS twins (594\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00b1\u200953\u2009\u03bcm, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and the ITD of DZOS twins (853\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00b1\u2009202\u2009\u03bcm, p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nThe reproducibility of palatal intraoral scans proved to be excellent. The morphology of the palate shows differences between members of MZ twins despite their almost identical DNA, indicating that this method could be useful in forensic odontology.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate whether the alterations of time intervals and velocity-time integrals (VTIs) of ductus venosus (DV) Doppler flow could predict evolving twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twin pregnancies in the second trimester. DV Doppler waveforms of MD twin pregnancies were retrospectively analyzed. Time intervals and VTIs of the accelerating phase of S-wave (S1 and VTI-1), decelerating phase of S-wave (S2 and VTI-2) and phase of D-wave (D and VTI-diast) were measured in the recipient twins of TTTS and the larger twins of uncomplicated MD twins. Each parameter was normalized to total time intervals and VTIs. DV parameters of prerecipient twins in pre-TTTS conditions were analyzed. The pre-TTTS condition was defined as the condition within 2 weeks before when TTTS cases fulfilled the criteria. Both recipient twins in TTTS cases and prerecipient twins in pre-TTTS condition showed significantly shorter S1, longer S2, shorter D, smaller VTI-1, larger VTI-2 and smaller VTI-diast than did the larger twins in uncomplicated MD twins (p < .05). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that VTI-2 had better performance, and VTI-2 >45.5% had 87.0% sensitivity, 90.9% specificity, 81.0% positive predictive value and 93.0% negative predictive value for detecting prerecipient twins. Recipient twins complicated with TTTS have characteristic alterations in time intervals and VTIs of DV Doppler flow, which is present even before fulfilling the TTTS criteria. Furthermore, VTI-2 >45.5% is a possible predictive parameter for TTTS in the second trimester.",

    "abstract": "Yes-associated protein (YAP) and TAZ (WW domain containing transcription regulator 1, or WWTR1) are paralog transcriptional regulators, able to integrate mechanical, metabolic, and signaling inputs to regulate cell growth and differentiation during development and neoplastic progression. YAP and TAZ hold common and distinctive structural features, reflecting only partially overlapping regulatory mechanisms. The two paralogs interact with both shared and specific transcriptional partners and control nonidentical transcriptional programs. Although most of the available literature considers YAP and TAZ as functionally redundant, they play distinctive or even contrasting roles in different contexts. The issue of their divergent roles is currently underexplored but holds fundamental implications for mechanistic and translational studies. Here, we aim to review the available literature on the biological functions of YAP and TAZ, highlighting differential roles that distinguish these two paralogues.",

    "abstract": "Son preference has been linked to excess female under-5 mortality in India, and considerable literature has explored whether parents invest more resources in sons relative to daughters-which we refer to as explicit discrimination-leading to girls' poorer health status and, consequently, higher mortality. However, this literature has not adequately controlled for the implicit discrimination processes that sort girls into different types of families (e.g., larger) and at earlier parities. To better address the endogeneity associated with implicit discrimination processes, we explore the association between child sex and postneonatal under-5 mortality using a sample of mixed-sex twins from four waves of the Indian National Family Health Survey. Mixed-sex twins provide a natural experiment that exogenously assigns a boy and a girl to families at the same time, thus controlling for selectivity into having an unwanted female child. We document a sizable impact of explicit discrimination on girls' excess mortality in India, particularly compared with a placebo analysis in sub-Saharan Africa, where girls have a survival advantage. We also show that explicit discrimination weakened for birth cohorts after the mid-1990s, especially in northern India, but further weakening has stalled since the mid-2000s, thus contributing to understandings of how the micro-processes underlying the female mortality disadvantage have changed over time.",

    "abstract": "We explored the genetic architecture of metabolic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and their clustering in Chinese boys and girls. Seven metabolic traits (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC], systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], total cholesterol [TC], triglyceride [TG], and uric acid [UA]) were measured in a sample of 1016 twins between 8 and 17 years of age, recruited from the Qingdao Twin Registry. Cholesky, independent pathway, and common pathway models were used to identify the latent genetic structure behind the clustering of these metabolic traits. Genetic architecture of these metabolic traits was largely similar in boys and girls. The highest heritability was found for BMI (a2 = 0.63) in boys and TC (a2 = .69) in girls. Three heritable factors, adiposity (BMI and WC), blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and metabolite factors (TC, TG, and UA), which formed one higher-order latent phenotype, were identified. Latent genetic, common environmental, and unique environmental factors indirectly impacted the three factors through one single latent factor. Our results suggest that there is one latent factor influencing several metabolic traits, which are known risk factors of CVDs in young Chinese twins. Latent genetic, common environmental, and unique environmental factors indirectly imposed on them. These results inform strategies for gene pleiotropic discovery and intervening of CVD risk factors during childhood and adolescence.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, surface treatment techniques such as room temperature machining (RTM) and low temperature burnishing (LTB) processing have been used to improve the microstructure of GH738 superalloy. Nano-grains and nano-twins are obtained on the top surface of RTM and LTB specimens. It is found that although the grain size of RTM and LTB specimens is almost the same, different types of nano-twins have been produced. Moreover, the effect of RTM and LTB processing on high temperature oxidation behavior of nickel-based superalloy GH738 at 700 \u00b0C is investigated. The result shows that LTB specimen has the best high temperature oxidation resistance owing to the formation of nano-grains and higher twins density, which induce to form a continuous protective Al",

Death of the co-twin was common (10/70, 14%). Preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation) was the commonest adverse outcome (77%): half were spontaneous and half iatrogenic. Only 46/75 (61%) cases had antenatal CNS imaging, of which 33 cases had known results of which 7/33 (21%) had radiological findings suggestive of neurological damage. Postnatal CNS imaging revealed an additional 7 babies with CNS abnormalities, all born at <36 weeks, including all 4 babies exhibiting abnormal CNS signs. Major maternal morbidity was relatively common, with 6% requiring ITU admission, all related to infection.\nMonochorionic twin pregnancies with single IUD are complex and require specialist care. Further research is required regarding optimal gestation at delivery of the surviving co-twin, preterm birth prevention, and classifying the cause of death in twin pregnancies. Awareness of the importance of CNS imaging, and follow-up, needs improvement.",

    "abstract": "The increase in the development of digital twins brings several advantages to inspection and maintenance, but also new challenges. Digital models capable of representing real equipment for full remote inspection demand the synchronization, integration, and fusion of several sensors and methodologies such as stereo vision, monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), laser and RGB-D camera readings, texture analysis, filters, thermal, and multi-spectral images. This multidimensional information makes it possible to have a full understanding of given equipment, enabling remote diagnosis. To solve this problem, the present work uses an edge-fog-cloud architecture running over a publisher-subscriber communication framework to optimize the computational costs and throughput. In this approach, each process is embedded in an edge node responsible for prepossessing a given amount of data that optimizes the trade-off of processing capabilities and throughput delays. All information is integrated with different levels of fog nodes and a cloud server to maximize performance. To demonstrate this proposal, a real-time 3D reconstruction problem using moving cameras is shown. In this scenario, a stereo and RDB-D cameras run over edge nodes, filtering, and prepossessing the initial data. Furthermore, the point cloud and image registration, odometry, and filtering run over fog clusters. A cloud server is responsible for texturing and processing the final results. This approach enables us to optimize the time lag between data acquisition and operator visualization, and it is easily scalable if new sensors and algorithms must be added. The experimental results will demonstrate precision by comparing the results with ground-truth data, scalability by adding further readings and performance.",

    "abstract": "One of the largest twin studies to date suggested that subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is mainly of nongenetic origin, but the causal effect of environmental factors on SAH is yet unknown. We hypothesized that if only one of the twins experience fatal SAH, they do not share the most important environmental risk factor for SAH, namely smoking. If true, such finding would suggest that smoking causes SAH.\nThrough the nationwide cause-of-death register, we followed 16 282 same-sex twin pairs of Finnish origin from the older Finnish Twin Cohort between 1976 and 2018 and identified all participants who died from SAH. For the baseline, we collected risk factor information about smoking, hypertension, physical activity, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and education. We classified the pairs as monozygotic, dizygotic, or of unknown zygosity. We examined the within-pair risk factor differences in the pairs discordant for SAH, that is, where one twin died from SAH and the other did not. We computed both individual (whole cohort) and pairwise (discordant pair) hazard ratios and 95% CIs.\nDuring the 869 469 person-years of follow-up, we identified 116 discordant and 2 concordant (both died from SAH) twin pairs for fatal SAH. Overall, 25 of the discordant twin pairs were monozygotic. For the whole cohort, smoking (occasional/current) was associated with increased risk of SAH death (hazard ratio, 3.33 [CI, 2.24-4.95]) as compared with nonsmokers (never/former). In the pairwise analyses for discordant twin pairs, we found that the twin who smoked had an increased risk of fatal SAH (hazard ratio, 6.33 [CI, 1.87-21.4]) as compared with the nonsmoking twin. The association remained consistent regardless of the twin pairs' zygosity or sex.\nOur results provide strong evidence for a causal, rather than associative, role of smoking in SAH.",

    "abstract": "Delayed-Interval-Delivery (DID) of multiple gestations has been attempted with variable degrees of success in normal, as well as, in anomalous uteri. We describe a delayed interval delivery procedure in a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy after removal of both, placenta and fetus from one horn by cesarean delivery at 25\u2009weeks followed by spontaneous delivery of the remaining twin at 35\u2009weeks. This was followed by a review of similar cases reported to the literature. The importance of this case resides in the success of DID in spite of chorioamnionitis. Furthermore, this was the second DID attempt where delivery of the first twin was accomplished by cesarean while that of the second one was done by vaginal route.",

    "abstract": "Having twins is associated with more depressive symptoms than having singletons. However, the association between having twins and psychiatric morbidity requiring emergency department visit or inpatient hospitalization is less well known.\nThis study aimed to determine whether women have higher risk of having a psychiatric diagnosis at an emergency department visit or inpatient admission in the year after having twins vs singletons.\nThis retrospective cohort study used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis and procedure codes within the Florida State Inpatient Database and State Emergency Department Database, which have an encrypted identifier allowing nearly all inpatient and emergency department encounters statewide to be linked to the medical record. The first delivery of Florida residents at the age of 13 to 55 years from 2005 to 2014 was included, regardless of parity; women with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification coding for psychiatric illness or substance misuse during pregnancy or for stillbirth or higher-order gestations were excluded. The exposure was an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code during delivery hospitalization of live-born twins. The primary outcome was an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code during an emergency department encounter or inpatient admission within 1 year of delivery for a psychiatric morbidity composite (suicide attempt, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, psychosis, acute stress reaction, or adjustment disorder). The secondary outcome was drug or alcohol use or dependence within 1 year of delivery. We compared outcomes after delivery of live-born twins with singletons using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographic and medical factors. We tested for interactions between independent variables in the primary model and conducted sensitivity analyses stratifying women by insurance type and presence of severe intrapartum morbidity or medical comorbidities.\nA total of 17,365 women who had live-born twins and 1,058,880 who had singletons were included. Within 1 year of birth, 1.6% of women delivering twins (n=270) and 1.6% of women delivering singletons (n=17,236) had an emergency department encounter or inpatient admission coded for psychiatric morbidity (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.14). Coding for drug or alcohol use or dependence in an emergency department encounter or inpatient admission in the year after twin vs singleton delivery was also similar (n=96 [0.6%] vs n=6222 [0.6%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.36). However, women with public health insurance were more likely to be coded for drug or alcohol use or dependence after twin than singleton delivery (n=75 [1.2%] vs n=4858 [1.0%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.60). Women with \u22651 medical comorbidity, severe maternal morbidity, or low income also had an increased risk of psychiatric morbidity after twin delivery (comorbidities, n=7438 [42.8%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.34; severe maternal morbidity, n=940 [5.4%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-1.81; lowest income quartile, n=4409 [26.8%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-1.40; second-lowest income quartile, n=4770 [29.0%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.43).\nOverall, diagnostic codes for psychiatric illness or substance misuse in emergency department visits or hospital admissions in the year after twin vs singleton delivery are similar. However, women with who are low income or have public health insurance, comorbidities, or severe maternal morbidity are at an increased risk of postpartum psychiatric morbidity after twin vs singleton delivery.",

    "results": "A total of 17,365 women who had live-born twins and 1,058,880 who had singletons were included. Within 1 year of birth, 1.6% of women delivering twins (n=270) and 1.6% of women delivering singletons (n=17,236) had an emergency department encounter or inpatient admission coded for psychiatric morbidity (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.14). Coding for drug or alcohol use or dependence in an emergency department encounter or inpatient admission in the year after twin vs singleton delivery was also similar (n=96 [0.6%] vs n=6222 [0.6%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.36). However, women with public health insurance were more likely to be coded for drug or alcohol use or dependence after twin than singleton delivery (n=75 [1.2%] vs n=4858 [1.0%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.60). Women with \u22651 medical comorbidity, severe maternal morbidity, or low income also had an increased risk of psychiatric morbidity after twin delivery (comorbidities, n=7438 [42.8%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.34; severe maternal morbidity, n=940 [5.4%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-1.81; lowest income quartile, n=4409 [26.8%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-1.40; second-lowest income quartile, n=4770 [29.0%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.43).",

    "abstract": "A digital twin is a digital replica of a physical entity to which it is remotely connected. A digital twin can provide a rich representation of the corresponding physical entity and enables sophisticated control for various purposes. Although the concept of the digital twin is largely known, designing digital twins based systems has not yet been fully explored. In practice, digital twins can be applied in different ways leading to different architectural designs. To guide the architecture design process, we provide a pattern-oriented approach for architecting digital twin-based Internet of Things (IoT) systems. To this end, we propose a catalog of digital twin architecture design patterns that can be reused in the broad context of systems engineering. The patterns are described using the well-known documentation template and support the various phases in the systems engineering life cycle process. For illustrating the application of digital twin patterns, we adopt a case study in the agriculture and food domain.",

    "abstract": "In this review, we discuss how samples comprising monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs can be used for the purpose of strengthening causal inference by controlling for shared influences on exposure and outcome. We begin by briefly introducing how twin data can be used to inform the biometric decomposition of population variance into genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental influences. We then discuss how extensions to this model can be used to explore whether associations between exposure and outcome survive correction for shared etiology (common causes). We review several analytical approaches that can be applied to twin data for this purpose. These include multivariate structural equation models, cotwin control methods, direction of causation models (cross-sectional and longitudinal), and extended family designs used to assess intergenerational associations. We conclude by highlighting some of the limitations and considerations that researchers should be aware of when using twin data for the purposes of interrogating causal hypotheses.",

No significant difference in infant mortality was observed between the ACS and no-ACS groups (P = 0.321). The ACS group had decreased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and mild RDS compared with the no-ACS group (both P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis and severe RDS between the two groups (all P > 0.05). The subgroup analysis showed that the incidence of RDS was lower in the ACS group than in the no-ACS group (P = 0.036) at 28\u223c34\nIn twin preterm infants, ACS administration is associated with a reduced risk of RDS.

Information on adverse long term outcomes (a composite of mortality and neurodevelopmental disorders) were retrieved from their electronic medical record, and the risk factors were determined.\nThe median follow-up duration was 8 years (range 4-13 years). Adverse composite long term outcomes were observed in 6.6% (15/227). Gestation at delivery < 32 week (p = 0.001) and inter-twin delivery interval of > 30 min (P = 0.000) were significantly associated with adverse long term outcomes of the second twin on multivariate analysis. Second twins in the combined vaginal- caesarean birth group had no significant increase in adverse outcomes compared to those in the vaginal-vaginal birth group.\nAdverse long term outcomes were uncommon among second twins born to mothers who attempted vaginal delivery. Adverse outcomes were associated with prematurity and inter-twin delivery interval of more than 30 min, but not with actual mode of delivery.",

    "abstract": "Colloid cysts are rare developmental lesions, accounting for approximately 1% of intracranial tumors. Often, these benign lesions are asymptomatic, but they are associated with significant mortality as a result of acute hydrocephalus. This mortality in patients with vague or no symptoms dictates a need for better understanding of the etiology of colloid cysts to expedite diagnosis and management. We present a case of monozygotic twins with colloid cysts to propose a genetic etiology for colloid cyst.\nPreviously healthy male monozygotic twins presented 4 years apart with headache secondary to hydrocephalus as a result of colloid cysts. Both patients underwent multiple surgeries and were doing well at last follow-up.\nThe present case adds to a body of literature of familial colloid cysts, suggesting higher concordance in monozygotic compared with dizygotic twins. This may be due to high genetic load, shared intrauterine environment, epigenetic changes, or genetic mutation. This literature review suggests that given high morbidity and mortality of colloid cysts, screening may be beneficial. Even in the absence of a single, definitive genetic etiology, we recommend consideration of genetic screening or, at a minimum, screening with neuroimaging for monozygotic twins in cases where 1 twin is diagnosed with colloid cyst.",

    "abstract": "There is acknowledged variability in the Circle of Willis (CoW) in the general population, yet the structure and function relationship of the cerebrovasculature is poorly understood. We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of combining high-resolution imaging techniques and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to describe cerebrovascular structure and function in vivo. We tested our methodology by examining the null hypothesis that monozygotic twins (18-30 yr) would exhibit similar CoW structure and function. Six twin pairs underwent 3T magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck and B-mode Doppler ultrasound for velocity and diameter recordings in the vertebral and internal carotid arteries under three conditions (rest, hypercapnia, and exercise). Artery diameter, length, tortuosity, and bifurcation angle were assessed in regions of interest of the CoW. We simulated hemodynamics to determine the cardiac-cycle time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and relative residence time (RRT). We observed low and insignificant intraclass correlations (ICC) between twins in all regions for diameter (ICC range 0.000-0.657, ",

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown that the prenatal environment, commonly indexed by birth weight (BW), is a predictor of morphological brain development. We previously showed in monozygotic (MZ) twins associations between BW and brain morphology that were independent of genetics. In the present study, we employed a longitudinal MZ twin design to investigate whether variations in prenatal environment (as indexed by discordance in BW) are associated with resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and with structural connectivity. We focused on the limbic and default mode networks (DMNs), which are key regions for emotion regulation and internally generated thoughts, respectively. One hundred and six healthy adolescent MZ twins (53 pairs; 42% male pairs) followed longitudinally from birth underwent a magnetic resonance imaging session at age 15. Graph theoretical analysis was applied to rs-FC measures. TrackVis was used to determine track count as an indicator of structural connectivity strength. Lower BW twins had less efficient limbic network connectivity as compared to their higher BW co-twin, driven by differences in the efficiency of the right hippocampus and right amygdala. Lower BW male twins had fewer tracks connecting the right hippocampus and right amygdala as compared to their higher BW male co-twin. There were no associations between BW and the DMN. These findings highlight the possible role of unique prenatal environmental influences in the later development of efficient spontaneous limbic network connections within healthy individuals, irrespective of DNA sequence or shared environment.",

    "abstract": "The only causal therapy is fetoscopic laser surgery (FLS). The aims of this study were to analyze the long-term outcome of monochorionic twins treated by FLS, including their school career, need for therapy and special aid equipment, and free-time activities, and compare their outcome to matched dichorionic twins.\nAmong the 57 women treated at a single fetal treatment center between 2008 and 2017 with FLS because of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, 25 women with 42 children were included in the FLS group. The control group consisted of 16 dichorionic twin pairs matched for birth year, gestational age (GA), birth weight, and sex. The long-term outcome was assessed by a parental questionnaire and a standardized neurodevelopmental examination for children born before 32 gestational weeks or with a birth weight lower than 1500 g. They were also registered into the Swiss Neonatal Network database. The primary outcome was event-free survival, defined as normal neurology, behavior, vision, and hearing. The secondary outcomes were school career, need for therapy and special aid equipment, and free-time activities.\nAn event-free survival was found in 32 children (76%) in the laser and in 24 children (75%) in the control group (p = 0.91). Neurological anomalies were found in 5 children (12%) in the laser group and 3 children (9%) in the control group (p = 1.00). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that GA at delivery was the only predictive factor for event-free survival. There were no significant differences regarding school career, therapies, or special aid equipment between the 2 groups. We found that children without FLS were involved in more free-time activities and needed fewer breaks during physical activity than children with FLS during pregnancy.\nThe outcome of monochorionic twins treated with FLS is comparable to the outcome of dichorionic twins. Long-term neurodevelopment in the cohort was mainly dependent on GA at birth.",

    "results": "An event-free survival was found in 32 children (76%) in the laser and in 24 children (75%) in the control group (p = 0.91). Neurological anomalies were found in 5 children (12%) in the laser group and 3 children (9%) in the control group (p = 1.00). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that GA at delivery was the only predictive factor for event-free survival. There were no significant differences regarding school career, therapies, or special aid equipment between the 2 groups. We found that children without FLS were involved in more free-time activities and needed fewer breaks during physical activity than children with FLS during pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Keratoconus (KC) is a common, degenerative disorder of the cornea, and genetic factors play a key role in its development. However, the genetic etiology of KC is still unclear. This study used the family of twins as material, using, for the first time, multi-omics analysis, to systematically display the changes in KC candidate factors in patients at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. These can evaluate candidate pathogenic factors in depth and lock onto pathogenic targets.\nThe twins in this study presented classic phenotypes, clear diagnoses, complete case data, and clinical samples, which are excellent materials for genetically studying KC. Whole-exome sequencing was conducted on both the twins and their parents. Transcriptome sequencing was conducted on proband's and health individual's primary human corneal fibroblast cells. Quantitative Real-time PCR and western blot were used to validate the differential gene expressions between the proband and controls. By integrating genomics, transcriptome, and protein level data, multiple consecutive events of KC were systematically analyzed to help better understand the molecular mechanism and genetic basis of KC. The results showed that the accumulation of rare, micro-effect risk variants was the pathogenic factor in this Chinese KC family. Consistent changes in extracellular matrices (ECMs) at the DNA and RNA levels suggested that ECM related changes play a key role in KC pathogenesis. The major gene variants (WNT16, CD248, COL6A2, COL4A3 and ADAMTS3) may affect the expression of related collagens or ECM proteins, thus reducing the amount of ECM in corneas and resulting in KC.\nThis study, the first to explore the genetic etiology of KC via multi-omics analysis under the polygenetic model, has provided new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying KC and an effective strategy for studying KC pathogenesis in the future.",

    "abstract": "Adolescents experience profound neuroendocrine changes, including hormone \"coupling\" between cortisol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone. Emerging research has only begun to elucidate the role of hormone coupling, its genetic and environmental etiology, and the extent to which coupling is impacted by gender, puberty, and family context. We included measures on parent and child mental health, parenting stress, and family conflict of 444 twin pairs and their parents across two timepoints, when youth were on average 8 and 13\u00a0years old, respectively. Structural equation models examined the impact of family context effects on coupling during adolescence. Biometric twin models were then used to probe additive genetic, shared, and non-shared environmental effects on hormone coupling. Hormones were more tightly coupled for females than males, and coupling was sensitive to parental depression and co-twin psychopathology symptoms and stress exposure in females. The association between family context and coupling varied across specific neuroendocrine measures and was largely distinct from pubertal maturation. Biometric models revealed robust shared and non-shared environmental influences on coupling. We found that family antecedents modify the strength of coupling. Environmental influences account for much of the variation on coupling during puberty. Gender differences were found in genetic influences on coupling.",

    "abstract": "A case of cervical spinal cord injury in 12-year-old angular craniopagus twins is presented, with a description of the planning and execution of surgical treatment along with subsequent clinical outcome. The injury occurred following a fall from a standing position, resulting in quadriparesis in one of the twins. Imaging revealed severe craniocervical stenosis resulting from a C1-2 dislocation, and T2-weighted hyperintensity of the cervical spinal cord. After custom halo fixation was obtained, a posterior approach was utilized to decompress and instrument the occiput, cervical, and upper thoracic spine with intraoperative reduction of the dislocation. Early neurological improvement was noted during the acute postoperative phase, and 27 months of follow-up demonstrated intact instrumentation with continued neurological improvement to near baseline. The complexity of managing such an injury, inclusive of the surgical, anesthetic, biomechanical, and ethical considerations, is described in detail.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer with high mortality rate and generally diagnosed in advanced stages. The 5-year disease-free survival is below 40%. MicroRNAs, subset of the non-coding RNA molecules, regulate the translation in post transcriptional level by binding to specific mRNAs to promote or degrade the target oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Abnormal expression of miRNAs were found in numerous human cancer, including ovarian cancer. Investigating the miRNAs derived from the peripheral blood samples can be used as a marker in the diagnose, treatment and prognosis of ovarian cancer. We aimed to find biological markers for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer by investigating BRCA1 gene mutation carrier monozygotic discordant twins and their high risk healthy family individual's miRNAs.\nThe study was conducted on monozygotic twins discordant for ovarian cancer, and the liquid biopsy exploration of miRNAs was performed on mononuclear cells that were isolated from the peripheral blood samples. The miRNA expression profile changes in the study were found by using microarray analysis. miRNA isolation procedure performed from the lymphocyte in accordance with the kit protocol. The presence and quality of the isolated miRNAs screened by electrophoresis. Raw data logarithmic analysis was studied by identifying the threshold, normalization, correlation, mean and median values. Target proteins were detected for each miRNA by using different algorithms.\nAfter the comparison of monozygotic discordant twins for epithelial ovarian carcinoma upregulation of the 4 miRNAs, miR-6131, miR-1305, miR-197-3p, miR-3651 and downregulation of 4 miRNAs, miR-3135b, miR-4430, miR-664b-5p, miR-766-3p were found statically significant.\nThe detected 99 miRNAs out of 2549 miRNAs might be used in the clinic as new biological indicators in the diagnosis and follow up of epithelial ovarian cancer with complementary studies. The miRNA expression profiles were identified to be statistically significant in the evaluation of ovarian cancer etiology, BRCA1 mutation status, and ovarian cancer risk in accordance with the obtained data. There is a need for validation of the miRNAs which were particularly detected between monozygotic twins and its association with ovarian cancer was emphasized in our study in wider cohorts including ovarian cancer patients, and healthy individuals.",

    "abstract": "Chronic widespread pain (CWP) and common mental disorders (CMDs) are common public health problems, but little is known about the role of CWP and CMDs on future adverse outcomes among work disabled individuals. The aims of the study were to investigate the associations between CWP and CMDs with subsequent disability pension (DP), long-term unemployment (>\u200990\u2009days) and all-cause mortality in individuals with sickness absence (SA) and whether the associations were explained by familial factors.\nIn this prospective cohort study, 7884 Swedish twins born between 1933 and 1985 were included and baseline data were gathered from a questionnaire in 1998 to 2006. Register data were used for obtaining information regarding demographics, SA, DP, unemployment and mortality. Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to calculate Hazard Ratios (HR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) for the associations between CWP and/or CMDs with DP, unemployment and mortality, while conditional Cox models for twin pairs provided control for familial confounding.\nHaving either CWP or CMDs among those with a history of SA was associated with a higher risk of DP and all-cause mortality than individuals without CWP and CMDs after controlling for socio-demographic and health factors. Moreover, sick-listed individuals with both CWP and CMDs had a higher risk of DP while those who only had CMDs had a higher risk of long-term unemployment compared to those without CWP and CMDs. The association between CMDs with DP and long-term unemployment was no longer significant when controlling for familial factors.\nCMDs was a risk factor for DP, unemployment and mortality among individuals with SA, while CWP seems to be important in relation to future DP and mortality. Familial factors played a role in the associations between CMDs and DP and CMDs and unemployment.",

    "abstract": "Congenital toxoplasmosis in twin pregnancies is infrequent. We present the case of a monozygotic and monocorial twin pregnancy with maternal toxoplasmosis infection diagnosed at 33 weeks gestation by detecting reactive IgM and IgG and low avidity test for IgG. The detection of the parasite in amniotic fluid could not be performed because the amniocentesis was not done. The term newborns presented cerebral calcifications and bilateral active chorioretinitis without other associated clinical manifestations. They had IgG and IgM reactive for toxoplasmosis. The detection of Toxoplasma gondii was not performed by placental PCR or cord blood. They received treatment during the first year of life with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine and folinic acid. They had no adverse events associated with the therapy. The diagnostic assessment and treatment does not differ from pregnancies with a single fetus. One or both newborns may be compromised. Multidisciplinary monitoring is essential for the early detection of reactivations or progression of lesions.",

    "abstract": "Major depression (MD) is a debilitating mental health condition with peak prevalence occurring early in life. Genome-wide examination of DNA methylation (DNAm) offers an attractive complement to studies of allelic risk given it can reflect the combined influence of genes and environment. The current study used monozygotic twins to identify differentially and variably methylated regions of the genome that distinguish twins with and without a lifetime history of early-onset MD. The sample included 150 Caucasian monozygotic twins between the ages of 15 and 20 (73% female; Mage\u2009=\u200917.52\u2009SD\u2009=\u20091.28) who were assessed during a developmental stage characterized by relatively distinct neurophysiological changes. All twins were generally healthy and currently free of medications with psychotropic effects. DNAm was measured in peripheral blood cells using the Infinium Human BeadChip 450\u2009K Array. MD associations with early-onset MD were detected at 760 differentially and variably methylated probes/regions that mapped to 428 genes. Genes and genomic regions involved neural circuitry formation, projection, functioning, and plasticity. Gene enrichment analyses implicated genes related to neuron structures and neurodevelopmental processes including cell-cell adhesion genes (e.g., PCDHA genes). Genes previously implicated in mood and psychiatric disorders as well as chronic stress (e.g., NRG3) also were identified. DNAm regions associated with early-onset MD were found to overlap genetic loci identified in the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium meta-analysis of depression. Understanding the time course of epigenetic influences during emerging adulthood may clarify developmental phases where changes in the DNA methylome may modulate individual differences in MD risk.",

    "abstract": "Objectives Transcobalamin II (TC) is an essential plasma protein for the absorption, transportation, and cellular uptake of cobalamin. TC deficiency presents in the first year of life with failure to thrive, hypotonia, lethargy, diarrhea, pallor, mucosal ulceration, anemia, pancytopenia, and agammaglobulinemia. Herein, we present TC deficiency diagnosed in two cases (twin siblings) with a novel variant in the TCN2 gene. Case presentation 4-month-old twins were admitted with fever, respiratory distress, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Physical examination findings revealed developmental delay and hypotonia with no head control, and laboratory findings were severe anemia, neutropenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Despite normal vitamin B12 and folate levels, homocysteine and urine methylmalonic acid levels were elevated in both patients. Bone marrow examinations revealed hypocellular bone marrow in both cases. The patients had novel pathogenic homozygous c.241C>T (p.Gln81Ter) variant in the TCN2 gene. In both cases, with intramuscular hydroxycobalamin therapy, laboratory parameters improved, and a successful clinical response was achieved. Conclusions In infants with pancytopenia, growth retardation, gastrointestinal manifestations, and immunodeficiency, the inborn error of cobalamin metabolism should be kept in mind. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for better clinical outcomes. What is new? In literature, to date, less than 50 cases with TC deficiency were identified. In this report, we presented twins with TCN2 gene mutation. Both patients emphasized that early and aggressive treatment is crucial for achieving optimal outcomes. In this report, we identified a novel variation in TCN2 gene.",

    "abstract": "Twinning is a critically important deformation mode in hexagonal close-packed metals. Twins are three-dimensional (3D) domains, whose growth is mediated by the motion of facets bounding the 3D twin domains and influences work hardening in metals. An understanding of twin transformations therefore necessitates that the atomic-scale structure and intrinsic mobilities of facets be known and characterized. The present work addresses the former point by systematically characterizing the boundary structures of 3D ",

    "abstract": "The study presents two monozygotic twins (MZ) with multiple impacted teeth, affecting the upper canines and lower second molars, as well as congenital aniridia. The clinical aspect of the upper canines is peculiar because of the different positions-palatal in one and buccal in the other twin. Studies reporting different scenarios of impaction in monozygotic twins can contribute more data to the debate on tooth eruption aetiology and more so in this case because of the association with a genetic panocular disease.

    "abstract": "Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare life-threatening condition affecting the autonomic nervous system that usually presents shortly after birth as hypoventilation or central apnea during sleep. In the majority of cases, heterozygous polyalanine expansion mutations within the third exon of the paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) gene underlie CCHS. Here, we report the generation of two induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from two identical twins with a heterozygous PHOX2B expansion mutation (+5 alanine residues). Both generated lines highly express pluripotency markers, can differentiate into the three germ layers, retain the disease-causing mutation and display normal karyotypes.",

    "abstract": "The tremendous heterogeneity of the human population presents a major obstacle in understanding how autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) contribute to variations in human peripheral immune signatures. To minimize heterogeneity, we made use of a unique cohort of 43 monozygotic twin pairs clinically discordant for MS and searched for disease-related peripheral immune signatures in a systems biology approach covering a broad range of adaptive and innate immune populations on the protein level. Despite disease discordance, the immune signatures of MS-affected and unaffected cotwins were remarkably similar. Twinship alone contributed 56% of the immune variation, whereas MS explained 1 to 2% of the immune variance. Notably, distinct traits in CD4",

    "abstract": "To examine the role of eosinophils in the pre-diagnostic phase of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we studied the influence of genetic and shared environmental risk factors in a twin cohort of IBD.\nWe analysed eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in faecal samples from twin pairs with Crohn's disease (\nTwins with Crohn' disease displayed higher levels of EDN (Ratio = 2.98, 1.65-5.37) and ECP (Ratio 1.83, 1.24-2.70) than their healthy siblings. Levels did not differ between healthy twin-siblings and external controls (EDN, Ratio = 1.52, 0.79-2.94 and ECP, Ratio = 0.93, 0.56-1.54). Higher levels of EDN (Ratio = 2.43, 1.13-5.24) and ECP (Ratio = 1.53, 0.92-2.53) were observed among twins with ulcerative colitis vs their healthy siblings. Levels did not differ between healthy twin-siblings and external controls (EDN, Ratio = 1.08, 0.51-2.25 and ECP, Ratio = 1.29, 0.74-2.26). Using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), we found no agreement in levels of EDN or ECP in discordant pairs, except for ECP in monozygotic Crohn's disease pairs (ICC = 0.63). In contrast, agreement was observed in monozygotic pairs concordant for Crohn's disease (EDN, ICC = 0.67 and ECP, ICC = 0.66). The number of eosinophils in rectum was increased in twins with ulcerative colitis vs their healthy sibling (Ratio = 2.22, 1.50-3.27).\nActivation of eosinophils in IBD seems to be a consequence of inflammation rather than an effect of genetic and shared environmental risk factors alone.",
