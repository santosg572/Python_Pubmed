    "abstract": "Motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by a severe loss of pigmented dopamine-producing nigro-striatal neurons. Symptomatic therapies provide benefit for motor features by restoring dopamine receptor stimulation. Studies have demonstrated that delaying the introduction of dopaminergic medical therapy is associated with a rapid decline in quality of life. Nonmotor symptoms, such as depression, are common in early PD and also affect quality of life. Therefore, dopaminergic therapy should typically be initiated at, or shortly following, diagnosis. Monamine oxidase-B inhibitors provide mild symptomatic benefit, have excellent side effect profiles, and may improve long-term outcomes, making them an important first-line treatment option. Dopamine agonists (DAs) provide moderate symptomatic benefit but are associated with more side effects than levodopa. However, they delay the development of motor complications by delaying the need for levodopa. Levodopa (LD) is the most efficacious medication, but its chronic use is associated with the development of motor complications that can be difficult to resolve. Younger patients are more likely to develop levodopa-induced motor complications and they are therefore often treated with a DA before levodopa is added. For older patients, levodopa provides good motor benefit with a relatively low-risk of motor complications. Using levodopa with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor lessens adverse effects, and further adding a catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor can improve symptom control.",

    "abstract": "During the last 15 years deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been established as a highly-effective therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Patient selection, stereotactic implantation, postoperative stimulator programming and patient care requires a multi-disciplinary team including movement disorders specialists in neurology and functional neurosurgery. To treat medically refractory levodopa-induced motor complications or resistant tremor the preferred target for high-frequency DBS is the subthalamic nucleus (STN). STN-DBS results in significant reduction of dyskinesias and dopaminergic medication, improvement of all cardinal motor symptoms with sustained long-term benefits, and significant improvement of quality of life when compared with best medical treatment. These benefits have to be weighed against potential surgery-related adverse events, device-related complications, and stimulus-induced side effects. The mean disease duration before initiating DBS in PD is currently about 13 years. It is presently investigated whether the optimal timing for implantation may be at an earlier disease-stage to prevent psychosocial decline and to maintain quality of life for a longer period of time.",

    "abstract": "The studies on the association between serum cholesterol level and the risks of neurodegenerative diseases risk are debated. Some prospective studies have found that high serum cholesterol may increase the risks of dementia/Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke. However, other studies have found no association or a decreased risk of hemorrhagic stroke with increasing levels of serum total cholesterol. Little is known about the association between serum total cholesterol or a history of hypercholesterolemia and Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. Only a few case-control studies and four prospective epidemiological studies have examined this association, but the results are inconsistent. An inverse association between serum total cholesterol and the risk of PD has been found in one prospective study; however, no significant association is reported in the case-control studies and other two prospective studies. Recently, one large prospective study from Finland suggests that high total cholesterol at baseline is associated with an increased risk of PD. Further studies, especially large clinical trials, are needed.",

    "abstract": "Background. Common but seldom published are Parkinson's disease (PD) medication errors involving late, extra, or missed doses. These errors can reduce medication effectiveness and the quality of life of people with PD and their caregivers. Objective. To explore lay perspectives of factors contributing to medication timing errors for PD in hospital and community settings. Design and Methods. This qualitative research purposively sampled individuals with PD, or a proxy of their choice, throughout New Zealand during 2008-2009. Data collection involved 20 semistructured, personal interviews by telephone. A general inductive analysis of the data identified core insights consistent with the study objective. Results. Five themes help to account for possible timing adherence errors by people with PD, their caregivers or professionals. The themes are the abrupt withdrawal of PD medication; wrong, vague or misread instructions; devaluation of the lay role in managing PD medications; deficits in professional knowledge and in caring behavior around PD in formal health care settings; and lay forgetfulness. Conclusions. The results add to the limited published research on medication errors in PD and help to confirm anecdotal experience internationally. They indicate opportunities for professionals and lay people to work together to reduce errors in the timing of medication for PD in hospital and community settings.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological illness which impairs motor skills, speech, and other functions such as mood, behavior, thinking, and sensation. It causes vocal impairment for approximately 90% of the patients. As the symptoms of PD occur gradually and mostly targeting the elderly people for whom physical visits to the clinic are inconvenient and costly, telemonitoring of the disease using measurements of dysphonia (vocal features) has a vital role in its early diagnosis. Such dysphonia features extracted from the voice come in variety and most of them are interrelated. The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to select a minimal subset of features with maximal joint relevance to the PD-score, a binary score indicating whether or not the sample belongs to a person with PD; and (2) to build a predictive model with minimal bias (i.e. to maximize the generalization of the predictions so as to perform well with unseen test examples). For these tasks, we apply the mutual information measure with the permutation test for assessing the relevance and the statistical significance of the relations between the features and the PD-score, rank the features according to the maximum-relevance-minimum-redundancy (mRMR) criterion, use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for building a classification model and test it with a more suitable cross-validation scheme that we called leave-one-individual-out that fits with the dataset in hand better than the conventional bootstrapping or leave-one-out validation methods.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) remains enigmatic. Mitochondrial complex-I defects are known to occur in the substantia nigra (SN) of PD patients and are also debated in some extracerebral tissues. Early sequencing efforts of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) did not reveal specific mutations, but a long lasting discussion was devoted to the issue of randomly distributed low level point mutations, caused by oxidative stress. However, a potential functional impact remained a matter of speculation, since heteroplasmy (mutational load) at any base position analyzed, remained far below the relevant functional threshold. A clearly age-dependent increase of the 'common mtDNA deletion' had been demonstrated in most brain regions by several authors since 1992. However, heteroplasmy did hardly exceed 1% of total mtDNA. It became necessary to exploit PCR techniques, which were able to detect any deletion in a few microdissected dopaminergic neurons of the SN. In 2006, two groups published biochemically relevant loads of somatic mtDNA deletions in these neurons. They seem to accumulate to relevant levels in the SN dopaminergic neurons of aged individuals in general, but faster in those developing PD. It is reasonable to assume that this accumulation causes mitochondrial dysfunction of the SN, although it cannot be taken as a final proof for an early pathogenetic role of this dysfunction. Recent studies demonstrate a distribution of deletion breakpoints, which does not differ between PD, aging and classical mitochondrial disorders, suggesting a common, but yet unknown mechanism.",

    "abstract": "To assess the influence of somatic symptoms of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) on the clinimetric performance of these scales in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA total of 224 patients underwent a protocolized mental status examination, consisting of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV depressive disorder (SCID-D), as well as the HAMD and MADRS. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for a range of cut-off scores were calculated for both rating scales and for modified versions of these scales in which all somatic items were eliminated. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained for both the modified and unmodified scales.\nElimination of the somatic items of depression from the HAMD and MADRS resulted in a reduced specificity of both the HAMD and the MADRS, and an increased sensitivity of the MADRS.\nThe authors recommend the full version of the HAMD and MADRS if used for diagnostic purposes; for screening purposes, the abbreviated version without somatic items can be used. Additional advantages of using full rating scales, with somatic items included, are that these provide more information on the severity of depression and allow for easier comparison across studies.",

Two-dimensional mapping of P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, Se and Br was done with the spatial resolution of 15 and 5 microm. The masses per unit area of elements in neuromelanin reach nerve cells of SN were determined. The elemental data were processed using two multivariate techniques, namely cluster and discriminant analysis. The statistical methods were used for data reduction, both unsupervised and supervised classification as well as for the creation of a model that would simplify case identification based on the elemental analysis of SN tissue. The results of cluster analysis confirmed the statistical significance of the differences in elemental composition of PD and control SN nerve cells. Based on the results of discriminant analysis, the elements (P, Cl, Fe, Cu and Zn) that played the greatest role in the process of differentiation between neurons from examined groups were determined.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease, degeneration of specific neurons in the midbrain can cause severe motor deficits, including tremors and the inability to initiate movement. The standard treatment is administration of pharmacological agents that transiently increase concentrations of brain dopamine and thereby discontinuously modulate neuronal activity in the striatum, the primary target of dopaminergic neurons. The resulting intermittent dopamine alleviates parkinsonian symptoms but is also thought to cause abnormal involuntary movements, called dyskinesias. To investigate gene therapy for Parkinson's disease, we simulated the disease in macaque monkeys by treating them with the complex I mitochondrial inhibitor 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, which induces selective degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons. In this model, we demonstrated that injection of a tricistronic lentiviral vector encoding the critical genes for dopamine synthesis (tyrosine hydroxylase, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, and guanosine 5'-triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1) into the striatum safely restored extracellular concentrations of dopamine and corrected the motor deficits for 12 months without associated dyskinesias. Gene therapy-mediated dopamine replacement may be able to correct Parkinsonism in patients without the complications of dyskinesias.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of L-dopa (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) therapy 40 years ago was a revolution in the treatment of patients with Parkinson s disease (PD). With time, however, the shortcomings of oral L-dopa medication became apparent, in particular the appearance of troublesome side effects, expressed as involuntary movements (dyskinesias) that developed over time in many patients. A gene therapy approach, aimed at restoring dopamine synthesis in the affected brain by viral vector delivery of genes that encode the dopamine-synthesizing enzymes, may offer a solution to this problem. Now, a team of French and UK researchers reports promising results in a nonhuman primate model of PD, paving the way for clinical trials of this enzyme-replacement approach.",

    "abstract": "This study explored whether reflexology could improve or sustain the wellbeing of people with Parkinosn's Disease [PD] using the PDQ39 wellbeing tool designed specifically for use with people with PD. The treatmnt protocal involved giving 8 therapy sessions to 16 people with varying derees of PD in a cross-over design to enable a longitudinal survey of impact. Whilst the results reflected the progressive nature of PD deterioration over time there was an improvement in wellbeing over the active therapy phase. These results suggest that continuous two- three weekly reflexology may limit further deteroration or maintain improvement of wellbeing. A further study is indicated to study this hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "The neurological control of speech is a complex process that involves phonation organs, respiratory and auditory systems. In the instance of a steady-as-possible sustained phonation, the vocal fundamental frequency (F0) is rhythmic and oscillating in varied degree. The present study examines the changes in the rhythm of F0 in subjects with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) as well as in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) after being orally administered with dopamine. The sustained steady vocalizations of vowel [a:] from 19 subjects with SNHL and from 13 subjects with normal hearing were collected and statistically compared. In addition, the phonations of 14 subjects with PD before and after oral medication with oral dopamine were collected and statistically compared. The F0 of a phonation was retrieved by digital signal processing of voice signals, and were then analyzed using Fourier transformation to acquire the amplitude of oscillation at different frequency components. Our study showed that subjects with SNHL had significantly larger fluctuation in the low frequency (< 3 Hz) than the subjects with normal hearing. In addition, dopamine medication significantly reduced the fluctuation in the mid-frequency (3-8 Hz) in subjects with PD. Our study indicates that power spectral analysis of F0 may potentially be very useful in the evaluation or detection of SNHL and PD. The rhythms of F0 are produced from neurological controls of phonation and may be used to access clinical diseases by a sustained phonation.",

We used the specific tool PDQ-39 Bb (a validated Bulgarian version of PDQ-39 Eng). The QoL was assessed in all patients and analyzed by gender and residence (urban-rural). SPSS v11.5 software was used for the statistical analyses. We used descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U test for the comparisons between groups.\nHighest average scores in relative points (corresponding to poor QoL) were obtained for the dimensions \"mobility\" (57.08), \"bodily discomfort\" (55.68), \"activities of daily living\" (54.25) and \"emotional well-being\" (53.70).

The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a fast irregular rhythm with wide polymorphic QRS tachycardia without the QRS twisting around the isoelectric baseline, diagnostic of AF and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The patient did not respond to intravenous amiodarone. Elective cardioversion restored sinus rhythm, and the ECG showed a wide QRS complex, short PR interval, and delta wave, indicating the presence of an accessory pathway and pre-excitation. AF was easily induced during the electrophysiologic study, requiring electrical cardioversion for severe hypotension. Successful radiofrequency ablation of the accessory pathway completely prevented further inducible AF. The patient no longer had any evidence of pre-excitation on ECG and remained symptom-free with no medications for 11 months.",

    "abstract": "The present study reports an application of the common sense model (CSM) of illness representations to the prediction of psychological distress in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). The study sought to (i) examine cross-sectional and prospective associations between illness representations, coping and psychological distress, and (ii) test the hypothesis that coping would mediate any relationships between illness representations and psychological distress. Patients with PD (n = 58) completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised, the Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Patients (n = 57) were followed-up at 6 months. Illness representations explained large amounts of variance in time 1 anxiety (R(2) = 0.42) and depression (R(2) = 0.44) as well as additional variance in time 2 anxiety (DeltaR(2) = 0.12) and depression (DeltaR(2) = 0.09) after controlling for baseline scores. In addition, avoidance mediated the effect of emotional representations on time 1 anxiety, and acceptance-resignation mediated the effects of both consequences and emotional representations on time 1 depression. The present study therefore provides partial support for the mediational model outlined in the CSM, as significant mediation effects were found only in the cross-sectional analyses.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of motor disturbances, derived from the striatal dopamine depletion. Previously, we reported that CuSO4 pretreatment blocked an oxidative stress marker (lipid peroxidation) and prevented the striatal dopamine depletion induced by the administration of the 1-methyl-4-phenylpiridinium (MPP+), the toxic metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a model of PD.\n. To determine if tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting synthetic enzyme of dopamine, is implicated in the neuroprotective effect of CuSO4 pretreatment, and if this neuroprotective effect is able to prevent the hypokinetic state (measured as spontaneous locomotor activity, SLA) induced by the experimental model of PD.\nC57 Black/6J mice received a single dose of CuSO4 (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) either 16 or 24 h before the administration of MPP+ (18 microg/3 microl, i.c.v.). Twenty four hours later, mice SLA was registered and animals sacrificed. Striatal L-DOPA accumulation derived from the administration of a central dopamine descarboxilase inhibitor was evaluated, a strategy considered as a reliable indirect analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase activity (THA).\nAdministration of, MPP+ decreased SLA (-52%; p = 0.003) as compared to control group values, whereas those mice pretreated with CuSO4 16 h before MPP+, increased SLA by 47% as compared with control group (p = 0.015). Mice pretreated with CuSO4 24 h before MPP+, also showed a statistically significant increase in SLA (71%; p = 0.02), when compared with control group. As a consequence of MPP+ administration, THA was also reduced as compared to control group values (32%; p < 0.05). Reduction of THA was blocked when mice were pretreated with CuSO4 16 h before MPP+. Moreover, mice receiving the CuSO4 24 h before MPP+ showed a significant increase (38%; p < 0.05) in THA when compared with control group.\nResults suggest that preservation of THA participates in the neuroprotective effects derived from the copper supplementation, a phenomenon that avoid the hypokinetic state induced by the MPP+ experimental model of PD.",

    "abstract": "This study examined whether two tower tasks-the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery \"Stockings of Cambridge\" (CANTAB-TOL) and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS-TOH), are interchangeable for detecting cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Forty PD patients who met the criteria for this study were assessed with both tasks. The relative contribution of working memory and inhibition was also examined. Relative to controls, PD patients were impaired on the CANTAB-TOL but not the D-KEFS-TOH. Regression analysis which showed that whereas performance on the CANTAB-TOL task was dependent on inhibition and spatial working memory, performance on the D-KEFS-TOH was dependent on spatial working memory only. Only 7% to 24% of the variance between the two tasks was shared. These findings suggest that these tower tasks from two well-established neuropsychological test batteries are not interchangeable.",

    "abstract": "Although Parkinson's disease was first diagnosed nearly 200 years ago, its effective treatment still remains elusive for most of those diagnosed. The gold standard of treatment for most patients is 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine. This drug works for most individuals early in the disease; however, resistant symptoms start to emerge after several years of treatment. There has been increased interest in finding novel therapies to help Parkinson's disease patients. Such strategies may have the benefit of not only treating the symptomatic issues of the disorder, but might also offer promise in protecting dopaminergic neurons from further degeneration. One such target that is now receiving much attention from the scientific community is the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR4. In this article, we briefly review Parkinson's disease and then recent work in the mGluR area, with a focus on the efforts being made toward finding and optimizing novel mGluR4 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). Preclinically in rodent models, mGluR4 activation has offered much promise as a novel treatment of Parkinson's disease. Additionally, the specific use of PAMs, rather than direct-acting agonists at the orthosteric glutamate site, continues to be validated as a viable treatment option for this target. It is anticipated that continued progress in this area will further our understanding of the potential of mGluR4 modulation as a novel symptomatic and potentially disease-modifying treatment for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW syndrome) affects roughly 1% of the population. It usually occurs in subjects with normal heart function but may combine with congenital cardiac failure and cardiomyopathy. Paroxysmal tachycardia is recorded in 40-80% of he WPW patients, largely in the form of reciprocal tachycardia related to circulation of excitation in the atrioventricular junction and Kent's bundle. Development and improvement of surgical methods for the management of supraventricular tachycardia became possible with the advent of transcatheter registration of electrical activity in different heart regions and programmed heart stimulation techniques. Catheter-assisted methods for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders including arrhythmia have been extensively used in recent decades. Transvenous fulguration is one of them replaced at present by radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The discovery of WPW syndrome made possible a new approach to the the problem of sudden death in young age. Treatment of this syndrome by RFA of additional atrioventricular junction in the last 20 years permitted not only to manage the syndrome itself but also to ensure practically complete recovery of the patients.",

    "abstract": "One of the prominent disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD) is bradykinesia. We studied performance of hand-to-mouth reach reaction time (RT) in right-handed PD patients and nine age and sex matched healthy control subjects. Participants practiced hand-to-mouth reach skill in response to a visual stimulus, 120 times a day for a period of one week. Using Kinemetrix 3D Motion Analysis system, the effects of motor skill practice and learning retention were investigated. Pretest performance was compared with performances on the second and seventh day of the study, and also performance on fourteenth day with no further practice for one week. There was a significant reduction in the mean RT in the control group after one week of practice. In PD patients the reduction in the mean RT was significant between pretest and first test sessions (P < 0.01). However, the difference was not significant between the first and second session (P = 0.06) and also between the second and third test sessions (P = 1.0). Short-term practice can improve bradykinesia in patients with PD but it is not long-lasting.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease for which stem cell research has created hope in the last few years. Seven PD patients aged 22 to 62 years with a mean duration of disease 14.7+/-7.56 years were enrolled to participate in the prospective, uncontrolled, pilot study of single-dose, unilateral transplantation of autologous bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). The BM-MSCs were transplanted into the sublateral ventricular zone by stereotaxic surgery. Patients were followed up for a period that ranged from 10 to 36 months. The mean baseline \"off\" score was 65+/-22.06, and the mean baseline \"on\" score was 50.6+/-15.85. Three of 7 patients have shown a steady improvement in their \"off\"/\"on\" Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The mean \"off\" score at their last follow-up was 43.3 with an improvement of 22.9% from the baseline. The mean \"on\" score at their last follow-up was 31.7, with an improvement of 38%. Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) and Schwab and England (S&E) scores showed similar improvements from 2.7 and 2.5 in H&Y and 14% improvement in S&E scores, respectively. A subjective improvement was found in symptoms like facial expression, gait, and freezing episodes; 2 patients have significantly reduced the dosages of PD medicine. These results indicate that our protocol seems to be safe, and no serious adverse events occurred after stem-cell transplantation in PD patients. The number of patients recruited and the uncontrolled nature of the trial did not permit demonstration of effectiveness of the treatment involved. However, the results encourage future trials with more patients to demonstrate efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the preventive effect of 4 weeks soy meal (+/- isoflavone) on post-menopausal cognitive deficiency and body weight alteration in ovariectomized (OVX)-6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA)-induced animal model of Parkinson's Disease (PD) which mimics status in menopause women. Female Wistar rats (250-300 g, 5-6 months old) were divided into 2 main groups. (1) Control; (2) OVX; included 5 subgroups that were pre-treated with 10 or 20 g soy with isoflavone in 30 g daily diet (10 and 20 groups, respectively), 10 or 20 g soy without isoflavone in 30 g daily diet (-10 and -20 groups, respectively) and 0 g soy (sham treated group) during 4 weeks after OVX. To induce animal model ofPD in main second group (OVX rats) the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) was lesioned by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (8 microg kg(-1) 4 microL(-1) normal saline contains 0.1% ascorbate). All animals were trained in Morris water maze for evaluating the spatial learning and memory. The results indicated that pre-treatment of Parkinsonian rats with different doses of dietary soy meal (+/- isoflavone) improved the spatial learning and memory and prevents increasing the body weight after menopause significantly. Our data show that, long-duration dietary soy meal may have the potential neuroprotective effect against post-menopausal cognitive deficiency induced by degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and constant body weight during post-menopausal life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Motor fluctuations and dyskinesia are common in advanced Parkinson's disease and can be poorly managed by current oral medications. Risk factors include the amount of L-dopa administered, gender and patient age. Continuous duodenal L-dopa or subcutaneous apomorphine infusions are helpful strategies because they can control motor complications by providing continuous dopaminergic drug delivery. Apomorphine subcutaneous infusion provides a motor benefit similar to that of dopamine and is relatively easy to use in advanced PD. However, it commonly requires concomitant administration of oral L-dopa and its long-term use is limited by compliance. Continuous administration of L-dopa/carbidopa by infusion in the duodenum/jejunum is a more complex procedure requiring a gastrostomy for the placement of the infusion tube, but it allows replacement of all oral medications and the achievement of a satisfactory therapeutic response paralleled by a reduction of motor complication severity. It should be noted that although these procedures are effective, most evidence relates to small case series and, particularly in the case of apomorphine, despite its long-term availability, there is a complete lack of randomized blinded studies. In addition, unlike deep brain stimulation, it is unclear which patients are the best candidates for these procedures, making any indirect comparison very complex, given the clinical heterogeneity of reported patients. This has consequences in resource allocation and in estimating cost-benefit ratios for these complex therapies in advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is associated with a more rapid progression of physical symptoms, greater decline in cognitive skills, and a poorer quality of life. Despite the high prevalence of depression and antidepressant use in PD, validated guidelines for the treatment of PD-associated depression (dPD) are lacking. Several methodological limitations have been recognized in the available studies examining the treatment of dPD. Some studies support a relevant role of the catecholaminergic systems in the pathogenesis of dPD. In open-label studies, the dopamine receptor agonists pramipexole and pergolide have shown antidepressant effects in PD patients. A placebo-controlled study of pramipexole in dPD is ongoing. The combined results of data from animal models and evidence in human studies support the strategy of dopaminergic stimulation as a treatment of depression. Treatment strategies for depressive symptoms in PD should include optimization of dopaminergic treatment prior to the addition of classic antidepressant drugs, thus reducing the risk of side-effects associated with multi-drug therapies.",

    "abstract": "For mostly arbitrary reasons, the term \"juvenile parkinsonism\" is restricted to patients aged 20 years or younger, and \"young-onset PD\" (YOPD) is onset between ages 21 and 40 years. Previous studies suggest that YOPD has a slower disease progression and a greater incidence and earlier appearance of L-dopa-induced dyskinesias and motor fluctuations. Therefore, our therapeutic strategies have to respect the fact that YOPD patients face many years of gradual progression of disease and disability, a greater probability for developing various adverse effects of treatment, and worsening of quality of life. As an individually tailored treatment should be our primary goal, we must bear in mind that the needs and expectations of YOPD patients are different from those of their older counterparts. The therapeutic strategy for YOPD patients should include a relatively low threshold for initiation of treatment, and initiating treatment with a dopamine receptor agonist while maintaining an individually adjusted, moderately high threshold for switching to or adding L-dopa in cases where treatment response is suboptimal or if problematic adverse effects develop. It has been shown that some dopamine receptor agonists may also have antidepressive efficacy, thus potentially managing an additional problem associated with PD.",

    "abstract": "The symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) can become increasingly difficult to control as the disease advances. L-dopa is the most efficacious therapy; however, with long-term therapy, motor and non-motor complications develop. There is now accumulating evidence that the progressive pathology of PD, the change in drug pharmaco-dynamics, and the pulsatile manner in which short-acting dopaminergic agents stimulate striatal dopamine receptors combine as key contributing factors to the priming of the basal ganglia for induction of motor complications. Dopamine receptor agonists have been extensively used as add-on therapy to L-dopa to treat motor complications. In this article we review the role of dopamine receptor agonists in the treatment of advanced parkinsonian patients.",

    "abstract": "In the last two decades, the usefulness of dopamine receptor agonists in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson' disease (PD) has been demonstrated in many randomized controlled clinical trials. The initial role of such compounds as an adjunctive therapy to L-dopa to improve motor fluctuations has now expanded to the treatment of early PD as initial monotherapy. The rationale for the use of dopamine receptor agonists in early disease is to delay or reduce the incidence of motor complications resulting from long-term L-dopa therapy, probably by virtue of less pulsatile stimulation of postsynaptic dopamine receptors. Indeed, controlled trials with both ergot and non-ergot dopamine receptor agonists, such as cabergoline, pergolide, pramipexole and ropinirole, have shown lower risk of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias than with L-dopa, when used as monotherapy in early PD patients. The benefit of agonists in preventing motor complications is, however, balanced by a smaller effect on motor symptoms compared with L-dopa. Moreover, a greater incidence of side-effects, particularly somnolence, hallucinations and leg oedema, occurs with dopamine receptor agonists. Because of the risk of fibrotic reactions, ergot derivatives (bromocriptine, cabergoline, and pergolide) are not recommended as first-line antiparkinsonian medication. In younger patients, who are usually more prone to developing L-dopa-induced motor complications, the initial treatment with dopamine receptor agonists can be recommended. Further pharmacological refinement of PD management with these drugs may result from new formulations of old drugs, such as once-daily prolonged-release ropinirole, or new agonists, such as the rotigotine patch, that can allow more continuous dopaminergic stimulation and improve patient compliance with the drug treatment. Theoretically, another advantage of dopamine receptor agonists is the potential for a neuroprotective effect, through many different mechanisms of actions. Preliminary controlled trials with pramipexole and ropinirole, although encouraging, did not provide conclusive proof of the disease-modifying effect of dopamine receptor agonists; large controlled clinical trials are now underway and results are expected soon.",

    "abstract": "A major focus in Parkinson's disease (PD) research is to produce drugs or other interventions that can slow or stop clinical progression. This should include an effect on both motor and non-motor symptoms and so target dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic pathways. It is logical to assume that the best chance of developing such therapies will be based on forming a better understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of PD and to identify critical molecular targets. There have been great advances in finding different genetic causes and risk factors for PD, but less so in the discovery of environmental contributions. The separate genetic causes still share common pathways to cell dysfunction and death, and these interconnect at several levels. Despite the major advances in genetics and PD pathogenesis, we still do not have good models of PD that can be used with confidence to accurately predict the effect of drugs on disease progression. Clinical trial design and study population selection are also areas that represent significant challenges to testing any putative neuro-protective agent. Several drugs have attracted attention as potential neuroprotective agents in PD. There are numerous studies demonstrating beneficial effects in the laboratory, but clinical efficacy for neuroprotection remains unproven.",

So far, disease-modification trials have focused on indices of progression of cardinal motor features such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor as captured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and the emerging need for effective symptomatic dopaminergic therapy. Progression of global disability in PD, however, is driven by additional factors beyond progressive nigrostriatal denervation, leading to increasing severity of cardinal motor features. Progressive pathology in extranigral sites inevitably leads to poorly L-dopa-responsive motor symptoms such as postural instability, freezing and falls, or non-motor symptoms. Furthermore, treatment-induced motor complications also contribute to PD disability. Progression of PD is multidimensional with superimposed age-related co-morbidities. Hence there is no consensus on how to best implement more clinically meaningful end-points for disease progression trials that would reflect these complex interactions impacting on the evolution of global disability in PD. There is an urgent need for biomarkers identifying preclinical stages of illness and describing disease progression--thus faithfully reflecting early and advancing neurodegeneration--that could be used in short-term clinical trials testing putative disease-modifying agents.",

    "abstract": "The MPTP-treated primate has proved to be a highly predictive model of the effects of dopaminergic drugs in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) and for the avoidance of motor complications. Using MPTP-treated primates, new dopaminergic therapies have been devised alongside novel treatment strategies and novel routes of administration while providing knowledge on how to use dopaminergic drugs in a manner that avoids the onset of motor complications. The use of MPTP-treated primates led to the concept of continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS) and the early introduction of dopamine receptor agonists as monotherapy for PD for the prevention of dyskinesia. However, CDS does not explain the differences in dyskinesia induction that exist between L-dopa and dopamine receptor agonists, and a more rationale approach to therapy involves continuous drug delivery (CDD). CDD has been explored in the MPTP-treated primate and this review focuses on some of the evidence showing that the delivery of dopaminergic drugs in PD is key to the avoidance of dyskinesia while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. Other types of motor complication, such as \"wearing off\" and \"on-off\" remain to be explored in MPTP-treated primates and the model has yet to be used to examine non-motor components of PD. Despite having been employed for almost 25 years, the MPTP-treated primate has many potential uses in the future that will further improve the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Treatment-induced motor complications represent a major clinical problem in Parkinson's disease (PD). Pharmacological dopamine (DA) replacement with l-dopa causes motor fluctuations and abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesia) in the vast majority of the patients. Intrastriatal grafts of embryonic dopaminergic neurons can cause dyskinesia too, as shown by clinical trials of neural transplantation in PD. Animals models of these complications can be produced in rats and mice in which the nigrostriatal DA pathway has been severely damaged. Rodent models allow investigators to explore mechanistic hypotheses at the cellular and molecular level. Moreover, the rat model of L-dopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements shows both face validity and predictive validity relative to the corresponding disorder in primates, and provides a cost effective tool to evaluate novel antidyskinetic interventions. This article reviews the strategies that have been used to reproduce different motor complications of PD treatment in rodents, and comments on their range of applicability.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing awareness that impulse control disorders (ICDs), including pathological gambling, hyper-sexuality, compulsive eating and buying, can occur as a complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, other impulsive or compulsive disorders have been reported to occur, including dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) and punding. Case reports and prospective studies have reported an association between ICDs and the use of dopamine receptor agonists at higher doses, and DDS has been associated with L-dopa at higher doses or short-acting dopamine receptor agonists. Risk factors for ICDs include male sex, younger age or younger age at PD onset, a pre-PD history of ICD symptoms, history of substance use or bipolar disorder, and a personality profile characterized by impulsiveness. The management of clinically significant ICD symptoms should consist of modifications to dopamine replacement therapy, particularly dopamine receptor agonists, which is usually associated with an improvement of ICDs. There is no empirical evidence supporting the use of psychiatric drugs for ICDs in PD. Functional neuroimaging studies such as functional MRI and PET can investigate in vivo the neurobiological basis of these pathological behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is considered mainly a movement disorder, robust information accumulated during the last 30 years has shown that about 30% of PD patients may also suffer from psychosis, which deeply affects their quality of life and eventually brings them to permanent hospitalization in nursing homes. PD psychosis (PDPsy) mainly occurs after 10 or more years of treatment. The main features of PDPsy include recurrent and continuous hallucinations and delusions for at least 1 month. In addition, a recent consensus of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and National Institute of Mental Health Working Group also included illusions and a false sense of presence as \"minor symptoms\" supporting the diagnosis. In addition, accumulated clinical data have shown that \"minor symptoms\" and benign hallucinations also imply a bad prognosis with time. In the diagnostic criteria for PDPsy, it is considered that patients suffer from PD for at least more than 1 year before psychosis develops. If this is not the case, there is an unsolved problem of an overlapping diagnosis with Dementia with Lewy Bodies. Most clinicians consider that the main cause of psychosis is chronic exposure to dopaminergic medication. However, from an operational point of view there remain difficulties in defining a specific time of exposure and dose of treatment and the occurrence of PDPsy. Specific rating scales have been developed for the evaluation of PDPsy, such as the Parkinson Psychosis Rating Scale. The Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms usually applied in schizophrenic patients has also proved useful for scoring psychotic symptomatology in PD. Clozapine in low doses has been proven to be the most effective antipsychotic medication for PDPsy. However, its use may cause neutropenia. Therefore, new atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist properties have been developed. Recently, pimavanserin--a 5-HT2A inverse agonist--has been studied. We hope that soon we will have the possibility to include new agents for the management of PDPsy.",

RBD is violent, enacted dreams that expose the patient or their sleeping partner to night-time injuries. Excessive daytime sleepiness, sometimes with a narcolepsy-like phenotype, is a common occurrence in PD, owing to lesions in the arousal systems of the brain.

    "abstract": "Continuous dopaminergic stimulation is a therapeutic concept for the management of Parkinson's disease (PD) that proposes that continuous, as opposed to discontinuous or pulsatile, stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors will delay or prevent the onset of levodopa-related motor complications. This hypothesis has arisen from studies of the normal basal ganglia demonstrating that nigral dopaminergic neurons normally fire continuously and striatal dopamine levels are relatively constant. In MPTP monkeys, pulsatile stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors with short-acting agents is associated with the induction of molecular and physiologic changes in basal ganglia neurons and the development of motor complications. These are avoided when dopaminergic therapies are delivered in a more continuous manner. Studies in animal models support this hypothesis, demonstrating that long-acting dopamine agonists are associated with a decreased risk of motor complications in comparison to short-acting formulations of levodopa. Similarly, continuous infusion of dopamine agonists ropinirole and rodigotine reduces dyskinesia associated with intermittent doses of oral formulations of the same drug. The current challenge is to develop a long-acting formulation of levodopa that simulates the pharmacokinetic pattern seen with infusions of levodopa in attempt to provide comparable benefits with an oral levodopa treatment strategy.",

    "abstract": "Clinical symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) comprise both motor and non-motor symptoms. In this disease, synucleinopathic-induced, nigral dopamine deficiency-related dysfunction of the basal ganglia is held responsible for the characteristic levodopa-responsive motor signs and symptoms (bradykinesia, hypokinesia, rigidity), known as parkinsonism and essential for clinical diagnosis in PD, as well as subtle motivational and cognitive dysfunctions. Some motor symptoms, such as tremor and postural instability, and most non-motor symptoms, however, are not fully levodopa-responsive, and suggested to manifest extranigral pathology. These symptoms include autonomic, sleep, sensory and neuropsychiatric symptoms, which in some cases may precede the first signs of motor parkinsonism, closely correlating with the progression of Lewy body pathology in PD. The recognition and treatment of these mostly under-recognized and under-treated symptoms is important, as these symptoms might have more impact on the quality of life in PD patients as compared to motor parkinsonism. On top of this, recognition of these manifestations in the prodromal phase of motor PD is critical to early diagnosis and treatment, as disease-modifying drugs, once identified, should be initiated as soon as possible, preferably in this premotor phase of the disease. On top of this, (non)motor extranigral symptoms in PD might also be of iatrogenic origin, whether directly as indirectly. During conventional, oral, dopaminomimetic treatment, the progressive loss of striatal dopaminergic nerve endings with the loss of cerebral dopamine storage capacity, renders the cerebral dopamine level fully dependent of the plasma levodopa levels, thus changing dopaminergic receptor stimulation from continuous to a more pulsatile pattern. Supposedly due to this process, neuroplastic changes in (sub)cortical dopaminergic pathways might cause therapeutic response fluctuations: motor and nonmotor fluctuations with anxiety- and panic-attacks and/or mood swings, dyskinesias and punding. Finally, dopaminomimetic pharmacotherapy may also induce extranigral non-motor drug-related direct adverse effects, such as impulse control disorders. In this article, non-motor signs and symptoms of extranigral PD-related pathology will be discussed, as well as the (suggested) criteria for diagnosis and treatment. Of course, also the recognition of the signs and symptoms of the prodromal (premotor) phase, suggestive for the presence of the PD, will be discussed. Iatrogenic non-motor symptoms, though, will not be further discussed.",

    "abstract": "The striatum is very much involved in learning motor sequences particularly in the consolidation phase, predicting that motor learning is affected in Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted a literature review on this question and showed that behavioural studies indicate a relatively preserved acquisition as well as retention of motor learning in PD. Persons with PD did demonstrate slower learning-rates than controls. Brain imaging studies highlighted that much more brain activity is needed and different neural networks are recruited in PD, suggesting a reduced efficiency of learning. Using additional sensory information may optimize motor learning in PD. There is abundant evidence that cueing helps to achieve better movement performance and that these effects are retained immediately after withdrawal, possibly indicating the first signs of consolidation. Also, automatization of cued learning was demonstrated, as cues not only enhanced dual-task performance but these increments were retained after cue withdrawal. However, the effect of longer periods of cued training on retention of cued and uncued performance is not well established and some studies suggest that learning effects may be cue-dependent. The results of this review support the notion that adopting motor learning principles could benefit rehabilitation in PD. Even so, the limitations of reduced flexibility, efficiency and increased context-specificity of motor learning in PD need to be taken into account.",

    "abstract": "Compromised balance and loss of mobility are among the major consequences of Parkinson's disease (PD). The literature documents numerous effective interventions for improving balance and mobility. The purpose of this study was to verify the effectiveness of two exercise programs on balance and mobility in people with idiopathic PD. Thirty-four participants, with idiopathic PD that ranged from Stage I to Stage III on the Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) scale, were assigned to two groups. Group 1 (n = 21; 67+/-9 years old) was engaged in an intensive exercise program (aerobic capacity, flexibility, strength, motor coordination and balance) for 6 months: 72 sessions, 3 times a week, 60 minutes per session; while Group 2 (n = 13; 69+/-8 years old) participated in an adaptive program (flexibility, strength, motor coordination and balance) for 6 months: 24 sessions, once a week, 60 minutes per session. Balance and basic functional mobility were assessed in pre- and post-tests by means of the Berg Balance Scale and the Timed Up and Go Test. Before and after the interventions, groups were similar in clinical conditions (H&Y, UPDRS, and Mini-Mental). A MANOVA 2 (programs) by 2 (moments) revealed that both groups were affected by the exercise intervention. Univariate analyses showed that participants improved their mobility and balance from pre- to post-test. There were no differences between groups in either mobility or balance results. Both the intensive and adaptive exercise programs improved balance and mobility in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Hallucinations and psychotic behaviors are a frequent non-motor aspect of Parkinson's disease and its treatment. These behaviors usually do not occur in the presence of the physician and are therefore difficult to rate. Further, because of their bizarre nature, hallucinations are frequently underreported by patients, and caregivers are often unaware of them until they become problematic. A number of scales have been developed for rating these behaviors, most of them borrowed or adapted from assessment tools used in other psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. In the latter disorders, however, hallucinations and psychosis are phenomenologically different than the typical hallucinations of Parkinson's disease. The Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Parkinson's Disease Rating Scales has completed a systematic critique of scales used in clinical trials focusing on hallucinations and psychosis. In this critique, the following scales met the criteria to be classified as Recommended: Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and Schedule for Assessment of Positive Symptoms. However, the Task Force felt that each of these scales has significant weaknesses and is insufficient to be considered a definitive rating tool. The Task Force officially recommended the development of a new scale to assess hallucinations and psychosis in Parkinson's disease. This effort is now ongoing with official endorsement by the Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Extranigral neuropathological changes may precede the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones in Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, non-motor disturbances are an interesting target for the development of tests aimed at identifying individuals with premotor PD. An impaired sense of smell occurs with high prevalence in the clinical motor stages of PD patients and has also been reported in first-degree relatives of PD patients. In a prospective study in 361 asymptomatic first-degree relatives of PD patients, we studied the value of a two-step approach, combining olfactory testing and dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT imaging, in detecting patients in the premotor phase of PD. Unexplained hyposmia alone was associated with a 12.5% risk of developing PD within a five year period. Cox regression analysis revealed that odour discrimination performance was most strongly correlated with the risk of future PD. Furthermore, all relatives that later developed PD had both hyposmia and abnormally reduced striatal DAT binding at baseline. The results of our studies provide the proof-of-principle that a two-step approach of olfactory testing and DAT SPECT imaging may serve to diagnose PD in its premotor phase. Yet, the low positive predictive value of hyposmia indicates that a wider application of this approach for screening purposes would require too many DAT SPECT scans in healthy individuals. Therefore, future studies in larger populations are necessary to further characterize premotor PD and identify additional genetic and/or clinical susceptibility markers to be used in conjunction with olfactory testing as additional screening steps toward diagnosing PD in its earliest stages.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder of unknown cause. For decades, a deficit in mitochondrial respiration was thought to be a key factor in PD neurodegeneration. However, excluding a few exceptions where a clinical picture of parkinsonism is associated with a mitochondrial DNA mutation, preclinical and clinical studies have failed to identify any genetic mutations in the genes encoding for the electron transport chain complexes in PD patients. More recently, it has been discovered that mutations in the genes encoding for Parkin, PINK1 and DJ1 are associated with familial forms of PD and with mitochondrial alterations, including morphological abnormalities. These results have led many researchers to revisit the question of mitochondrial biology as a primary mechanism in PD pathogenesis, this time from an angle of perturbation in mitochondrial dynamics and not from the angle of a deficit in respiration.",

Best results are currently achieved with invasive strategies via subcutaneous (s.c.) or intraduodenal delivery of apomorphine or levodopa, or deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. This presentation will develop the current treatment principles for PD: (1) L-dopa does not accelerate disease progression, (2) no treatment modality exerts neuroprotective effects, (3) L-dopa is more effective than dopamine agonists in alleviating motor symptoms and improving the activities of daily living (ADL) score, in parkinsonian patients, (4) Treatment with dopamine agonist is associated with fewer motor complications than L-dopa.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a complex phenotype, featuring a wide variety of both motor and non-motor symptoms. Current medical management is usually monodisciplinary, with an emphasis on drug treatment, sometimes supplemented with deep brain surgery. Despite optimal medical management, most patients become progressively disabled. Allied health care may provide complementary benefits to PD patients, even for symptoms that are resistant to pharmacotherapy or surgery. This notion is increasingly supported by scientific evidence. In addition, the role of allied health care is now documented in recent clinical practice guidelines that are available for physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech-language therapy. Unfortunately, adequate delivery of allied health care is threatened by the insufficient expertise among most therapists, and the generally low patient volumes for each individual therapist. Moreover, most allied health interventions are used in isolation, with insufficient collaboration and communication with other disciplines involved in the care for PD patients. Clinical experience suggests that optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach, with multifactorial health plans tailored to the needs of each individual patient. Although the merits of specific allied health care interventions have been scientifically proven for other chronic disorders, only few studies have tried to provide a scientific basis for a multidisciplinary care approach in PD. The few studies published so far were not yet convincing. We conclude by providing recommendations for current multidisciplinary care in PD, while highlighting the need for future clinical trials to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a multidisciplinary team approach.",

    "abstract": "Iron is considered to be a possible trigger of oxidative stress leading to neurodegeneration. This mechanism of neuronal death is proposed as a cause of Parkinson disease. Although most of researchers agree with this, controversies remain regarding the amounts of iron needed for this process. According to non destructive methods of assessment of the concentration of the total iron in substantia nigra, there is no difference between PD and control. However there is no need for an increase of the total iron in parkinsonian SN to trigger the oxidative stress but only of the non-ferritin bound labile iron. Our recent studies suggest an increase of this iron in PD SN. This finding corresponds well to a decrease of L-ferritin concentration in parkinsonian SN and also to a difference of the size of iron core of ferritin between PD and control SN. The significance of these finding will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic cell death in the substantia nigra (SN) is central to Parkinson's disease (PD) but the neurodegenerative mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. Iron accumulation in dopaminergic neurons and glial cells in the SN of PD patients may contribute to the generation of oxidative stress, protein aggregation and neuronal death. However, the mechanisms involved in iron accumulation remain unclear. In previous studies we excluded a role of transferrin and its receptor in iron accumulation while we showed that lactoferrin receptors were overexpressed in blood vessels and dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. We recently also described an increase in the expression of the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1/Nramp2/Slc11a2) in the SN of PD patients. Using the PD animal model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxication in mice, we showed that DMT1 expression increased in the ventral mesencephalon of intoxicated animals, concomitant with iron accumulation, oxidative stress and dopaminergic cell loss. A mutation in DMT1 that impairs iron transport protected rodents against parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxins MPTP and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). This study supports a critical role for DMT1 in iron-mediated neurodegeneration in PD.",

    "abstract": "Evidence shows that neuronal injury accompanies neuroinflammatory reactions in the brain, and well as in Parkinson's disease (PD) animal models, in which the loss of dopamine neurons is associated with the activation of microglia in the substantia nigra. Activated microglia can be illustrated in vivo using Positron emission tomography and [(11)C](R)-PK11195. However, this tracer cannot distinguish between the two aspects of microglial function (protective and inflammatory). To solve this problem, we can use a dopamine transporter marker, [(11)C]CFT, which binds to the dopamine transporter. The binding of the tracer reflects the viability of the presynaptic dopaminergic neurons, as reported in a multicenter trial using single photon emission tomography (SPECT) with [(123I)]beta-CIT, a SPECT version of [(11)C]CFT. In early drug-na\u00efve PD patients, these two tracers showed a unique pattern of binding, [(11)C](R)-PK11195 binding potential in the midbrain was correlated inversely with [(11)C]CFT binding in the putamen, and midbrain [(11)C](R)-PK11195 binding was found to be positively correlated with the motor severity of parkinsonism. These results indicate that early introduction of a neuroprotective drug to suppress microglial activation is favorable in PD and that [(11)C](R)-PK11195 can be used to monitor the progression of the disease. As the disease progressed, the [(11)C]CFT binding was further decreased, and the microglial activation spread over the entire brain. This paper briefly summarizes the neuroinflammation induced by microglia in PD and describes an in vivo aspect of the neuroinflammation in the PD brain by focusing on the covarying changes in microglial activation and neuronal damage.",

    "abstract": "A large body of evidence from postmortem brain tissue and genetic analysis in humans, as well as biochemical and pathological studies in animal models of neurodegeneration suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is a key pathological mechanism in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to oxidative stress, damage to mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial DNA deletions, altered mitochondrial morphology, alterations in mitochondrial fission and fusion and ultimately neuronal demise. Therapeutic approaches targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage, therefore, hold great promise in PD. A number of agents, which target energy metabolism, are presently in therapeutic trials in PD. Both creatine and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) are being tested in phase III clinical trials. In addition, preclinical studies in animal models have shown efficacy of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants and the SS peptides. A promising approach for increasing antioxidant defenses is to transcriptionally increase the activity of the Nrf2/ARE pathway, which activates transcription of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant genes. A number of agents including sulforaphane, curcumin and triterpenoids have been shown to activate this pathway and to produce neuroprotective effects. Lastly, newly identified therapeutic targets include peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor gamma-coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and sirtuins. These pathways provide promise for future therapeutic developments in the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective and progressive degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. While most cases are sporadic a few rare familial forms of PD have been described. Several lines of evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction may be involved in the etiology of the disease. Genes found to cause familial Parkinsonism have been linked to mitochondrial function and toxins that inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain have been found to cause dopamine cell death. Furthermore, higher numbers of respiratory chain deficient dopamine neurons are found in patients with PD than in age-matched controls. The MitoPark mouse model of PD was designed to directly test the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction in dopamine neurons can cause a progressive parkinsonian phenotype. By cell type-specific inactivation of mitochondrial transcription factor A, a protein essential for mitochondrial DNA expression and maintenance, dopamine neurons were rendered respiratory chain deficient. MitoPark mice recapitulate several features of PD in humans such as adult-onset degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine circuitry; motor deficits that are ameliorated by L-DOPA administration; progressive course of phenotypic manifestations and neurodegeneration; and altered response to L-DOPA treatment dependent on disease stage. In this review we compare the MitoPark mouse to other genetic or toxin-based rodent models of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The core loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease (PD) coupled to the therapeutic benefits of dopaminergic therapies in patients, simplifies the treatment strategy for this disease. In the context of neurotrophic factors, this distils down to the simple question as to whether a factor exists for these cells that can promote their survival in the face of the degenerative disease process. If such a factor exists, and GDNF seems a strong candidate, then one could anticipate that this treatment would be as effective as L-dopa therapy. However it would not be better than this, nor curative, given the extensive pathology in PD. To date a number of clinical trials have been undertaken in which GDNF has been directly delivered to the PD brain. In addition there have been studies in which neurturin (part of the GDNF family) has also been delivered to the CNS using a viral vector delivery system. These trials have produced mixed results. Importantly though, some patients have shown a sustained clinical response to this treatment which correlates with evidence of increased dopaminergic activity in the brain at the site of delivery using F-dopa PET as well as in a single post-mortem study. The challenge therefore is not whether this approach works, because it self-evidently does in some patients, but rather how we can do this more consistently.",

    "abstract": "The best approach to medical management of early Parkinson's disease remains controversial. Recent studies suggest that early use of MAO-B inhibitors may improve long-term outcome. Long-term follow-up to a delayed-start rasagiline study indicated that patients who were treated with rasagiline from the start did better through 5.5-6 years of treatment (with all PD medications) than patients who began rasagiline after a delay of 6 months. In a long-term selegiline study, patients randomized to treatment with selegiline did better over 7 years than patients randomized to treatment with placebo. Dopamine agonists provide moderate symptomatic benefit, delay the need for levodopa, and delay the emergence of motor complications, especially dyskinesia. Long-term studies have not demonstrated a clear overall benefit to introducing a dopamine agonist prior to levodopa in general PD populations, but treatment regimens tend to become increasingly similar over time, most studies have had high drop-out rates, and there may be subsets of patients who experience greater benefit with this strategy. Levodopa remains the most efficacious oral medication for the treatment of motor signs of PD but is associated with the development of motor complications. Long-acting levodopa formulations are now under development and it will be important to determine whether they cause fewer motor complications than standard levodopa. The current approach to treatment of early PD depends in part on individual patient factors including age, severity of motor signs, presence of cognitive dysfunction, and other co-morbidities.",

    "abstract": "The thalamic centre median-parafascicular complex (CM/Pf), a main input and output station of the basal ganglia, is attracting increasing interest in the field of movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). CM/Pf undergoes partial neurodegeneration in PD patients and some rodent models. Cellular evidence has been provided in experimental animals that thalamic degeneration may not aggravate but rather counteract the effects of dopamine lesion. But functional changes in the circuits involving the spared neurons could play a detrimental role. This view fits with converging anecdotic and recent direct experience in patients that stress the potential of CM/PF deep brain stimulation (DBS) to alleviate motor disorders, notably tremor and dyskinesias. As a preclinical contribution to the characterization of this target, we investigated the functional impact of CM/Pf-DBS in the 6-hydroxydopamine hemiparkinsonian rat model of PD. When testing different frequencies (25, 60, 130 Hz), only high frequency stimulation (HFS) had significant antiakinetic action as evidenced by alleviation of limb use asymmetry in the cylinder test. Although less efficient than HFS of the subthalamic nucleus in the latter task, CM/PF-HFS completely corrected lateralized neglect in the corridor task. Unlike subthalamic nucleus, CM/Pf-HFS did not induce per se dyskinesias. Finally, the benefits provided by CM/Pf-HFS were associated with widespread impact on the changes in neuronal metabolic activity induced by the dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia. These data point to own particular outcome of CM/Pf-DBS that may be of interest in currently developing multi-target strategies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a dramatic loss of dopamine that underlies complex structural and functional changes in striatal projection neurons. A key alteration that has been reported in various rodent models and PD patients is a significant reduction in striatal dendritic spine density. Our recent findings indicate that striatal spine loss is also a prominent feature of parkinsonism in MPTP-treated monkeys. In these animals, striatal spine plasticity is tightly linked with the degree of striatal dopamine denervation. It affects predominantly the sensorimotor striatal territory (i.e. the post-commissural putamen) and targets both direct and indirect striatofugal neurons. However, electron microscopic 3D reconstruction studies demonstrate that the remaining spines in the dopamine-denervated striatum of parkinsonian monkeys undergo major morphological and ultrastructural changes characteristic of increased synaptic efficacy. Although both corticostriatal and thalamostriatal glutamatergic afferents display such plastic changes, the ultrastructural features of pre- and post-synaptic elements at these synapses are consistent with a higher strength of corticostriatal synapses over thalamic inputs in both normal and pathological conditions. Thus, striatal projection neurons and their glutamatergic afferents are endowed with a high degree of structural and functional plasticity. In parkinsonism, the striatal dopamine denervation induces major spine loss on medium spiny neurons and generates a significant remodeling of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal glutamatergic synapses, consistent with increased synaptic transmission. Future studies are needed to further characterize the mechanisms underlying striatal spine plasticity, and determine if it represents a pathological feature or compensatory process of PD.",

Because dopamine replacement therapies largely alleviate these motor circuit abnormalities, it has been assumed that pathology in the basal ganglia is entirely responsible for the aberrant thalamic activity which then permeates the motor circuits. However, there is considerable evidence that pathology in the thalamus itself contributes to the abnormal neural activity characteristic of Parkinson's disease. In a series of studies examining the degree of degeneration in the thalamus, we have observed selective degeneration in the intralaminar thalamic nuclei in patients with levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease. The nuclei involved are the caudal intralaminar nuclei (the centre-median/parafascicular complex), the parataenial, cucullar and central lateral nuclei. The centre-median/parafascicular complex provides important glutaminergic feedback from the thalamus to the putamen and is a pathway that is greatly enlarged in primates. There is 30-40% loss in this region of the thalamus in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, with non-parvalbumin-containing neurons degenerating the most (70% average loss). Our recent work suggests that the preservation of this pathway may contribute to dystonia in Parkinson's disease. The central lateral and cucullar thalamic nuclei degenerate 30-50%, while the parataenial nucleus sustains a 55% loss of neurons in association with significant alpha-synuclein deposition which correlates with disease duration. Damage to these regions appears to impact on cognition, awareness and perception. These studies suggest that direct thalamic pathology contributes to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale transcriptomics analysis of gene expression profile of sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) substantia nigra (SN) has identified a number of differentially expressed genes participating in the neurotoxic cascade of DA neurons death, in particular those related to handling of proteins, dopaminergic transmission and iron metabolism. One of them, SKP1A (p19, S-phase kinase-associated protein 1A), an essential component of the ubiquitin-E3 ligase Skp1, Cullin 1, F-box protein (SCF) complex, has been found to be significantly decreased in the SN pars compacta of post-mortem parkinsonian brains. Recently, a new genetic cell model of sporadic PD was developed by knocking-down SKP1A in SN-derived cell-line infected with short hairpin RNA lentiviruses. SKP1A deficiency resulted in increased susceptibility to cell death and a decline in the expression of dopaminergic phenotypic markers. SKP1A-silenced cells were unable to arrest at G(0)/G(1,) when induced to differentiate, entering into an aberrant cell cycle and progressive death. During this process the cells developed rounded aggregates with characteristics of LB-like inclusions (aggresomes) including immunoreactivity for gamma-tubulin, alpha-synuclein, ubiquitin, tyrosine hydroxylase, Hsc-70 and proteasome subunit. In conclusion, future studies should focus on a careful consideration of crucial dopaminergic interacting genes, as emerged from human sporadic PD, which will serve as a basis for the development of a slowly progressive genetic animal model of sporadic PD, with the potential of evaluating drugs with \"disease modifying activity\".",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) aggregation is central to neuropathological changes in Parkinson's disease. The aggregates spread within the central nervous system according to a very predictable pattern. A prion-like transmission of alpha-syn aggregates has been recently proposed to explain this propagation pattern. First, we review the growing evidence for such a mechanism. This process is likely to occur in three consecutive steps: (i) exit of alpha-syn template from the donor cell, (ii) entry to the recipient cell and (iii) initiation of the nucleation. In a second part, we discuss the possible underlying mechanisms for each of these steps, based on our current knowledge about how cells handle alpha-syn but also other proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases with a prion-like propagation. Finally, we discuss which molecular species of alpha-syn (monomer, oligomer, fibril) could be the seeding-competent species and whether this seeding process could be a common mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography has been widely exploited to study the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the associated motor impairment. It is however now increasingly appreciated that much of the disability of PD arises from non-motor complications, including cognitive and behavioural problems, sleep disturbances, pain and autonomic dysfunction. Recent studies in which these problems were investigated are reviewed in this paper. Although interesting findings are emerging, much work remains to be done. This will depend upon the ability to investigate non dopaminergic mechanisms as well as extra-striatal release of dopamine and the capacity to assess the impact of behaviourally relevant stimuli on neurotransmitter release and on networks of brain activation. Functional imaging studies, including PET, SPECT and functional MRI may provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), where structural changes are limited. Until recently, the major focus of such studies has been either on patterns of cerebral blood flow or glucose metabolism at rest or following a variety of activation paradigms, or on studies of the dopamine (DA) system. This article will review non-motor aspects of PD. While there is an enormous volume of imaging literature on the motor aspects of PD or motoric complications, that will not be addressed here.",

Being told that one can no longer drive is itself associated with loss of independence, depression, low self-esteem and reduced activities [1,2]. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), therefore, understandably wish to continue to be able to maintain their ability to drive automobiles, motorcycles, airplanes, and boats, etc. The ability to determine if and when a PD patient is no longer fit to drive a motor vehicle is important for maintaining safety for the PD patient and the public. There are numerous requirements for being able to drive a motor vehicle safely. When any of these capacities deteriorate, the ability to drive safely may be lost.

    "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness that impulse control disorders (ICDs), including compulsive gambling, buying, sexual behavior and eating, can occur as a complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, other impulsive or compulsive disorders including dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) and punding are reported. Case reporting and prospective studies documented an association between ICDs and the use of dopamine agonists (DAs), and to a lesser extent levodopa use, while DDS occurs with higher dosages of levodopa or short-acting DAs. Data suggest that risk factors for an ICD may include male sex, younger age or younger age at PD onset, a pre-PD history of ICD symptoms, personal or family history of substance abuse or bipolar disorder, and a personality style characterized by impulsiveness. It is important that PD patients be aware that DA use may lead to the development of one or more ICDs, and clinicians monitor patients as part of routine clinical care.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder with a presymptomatic interval; that is, there is a period during which the pathologic process has begun, but motor signs required for the clinical diagnosis are absent. There is considerable interest in discovering markers to diagnose this preclinical stage. Current predictive marker development stems mainly from two principles; first, that pathologic processes occur in lower brainstem regions before substantia nigra involvement and second, that redundancy and compensatory responses cause symptoms to emerge only after advanced degeneration. Decreased olfaction has recently been demonstrated to predict PD in prospective pathologic studies, although the lead time may be relatively short and the positive predictive value and specificity are low. Screening patients for depression and personality changes, autonomic symptoms, subtle motor dysfunction on quantitative testing, sleepiness and insomnia are other potential simple markers. More invasive measures such as detailed autonomic testing, cardiac MIBG-scintigraphy, transcranial ultrasound, and dopaminergic functional imaging may be especially useful in those at high risk or for further defining risk in those identified through primary screening. Despite intriguing leads, direct testing of preclinical markers has been limited, mainly because there is no reliable way to identify preclinical disease. Idiopathic RBD is characterized by loss of normal atonia with REM sleep. Approximately 50% of affected individuals will develop PD or dementia within 10 years. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to test potential predictive markers before clinical disease onset. The results of marker testing in idiopathic RBD with its implications for disease prediction will be detailed.",

    "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness is a disabling and vital problem in patients with PD. It affects around 33% patients and culminates in sleep attacks (without prodroma) in 1 to 4% of the patients. When monitored, short, narcolepsy-like naps with abnormal intrusion of REM sleep during daytime (and hypnagogic hallucinations as wakeful dreams) are observed in 33-41% patients, while other patients display naps with non REM sleep. Although insomnia, sleep apnea and periodic leg movements are common in these patients, there is no clear link between the night events and the level of sleepiness. Patients treated with dopamine agonists are two to three fold more exposed to sleep attacks than those on levodopa, with large variability between patients. Sleepiness may exist, to a lesser degree, before the onset of parkinsonism and before the use of dopamine agents, suggesting that other, disease-dependant factors contribute to the sleepiness. Most arousal systems are indeed damaged in PD brains, including the locus coeruleus (noradrenalin), the pedunculo-pontine nucleus and the basal forebrain (acetylcholine), the median raphe (serotonin), and the lateral hypothalamus (orexin), while histamine dopamine arousal system are normal. Treating patients with stimulants such as modafinil is only partially efficacious, while trials of anti-H3 drugs and sodium oxybate seem more active. Eventually, the recent stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus has stimulant or sedative effects in patients, depending on the frequency of stimulation. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of arousal in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. It has a high prevalence, which significantly increases with age. This disease significantly deteriorates the quality of life and, despite treatment, may lead to disability. For these reasons, PD is not only a medical problem, but also a social one. The neuropathological basis of Parkinson's disease is selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain's substantia nigra, which results in an imbalance between neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, mainly between dopamine and acetylcholine. The basic symptoms of PD are tremor at rest, extrapyramidal rigidity, bradykinesia, and disturbances of postural reflexes. PD is described as a hypertonic- hypokinetic syndrome. It is also characterized by coexisting vegetative and psychopathological disturbances. In spite of considerable advances in knowledge about the mechanisms of dopaminergic neuron injury, the etiology and pathogenesis of PD are not yet well established. In this paper the authors briefly review agents which influence neurodegenerative processes of the extrapyramidal system based on available literature concerning clinical trials in Parkinson's disease. Since it is known that female sex hormones also influence dopaminergic transmission, special attention is paid to the potential role of estrogens as agents modulating the risk of PD occurrence and their neuroprotective action.",

    "abstract": "Although a loss-of-function mutation has been identified in familial Parkinson's disease PARK7, the wild-type of DJ-1 is known to act as an oxidative stress sensor in neuronal cells. Recently, we identified UCP0045037 as a compound that bound to the reduced form of DJ-1 by in silico virtual screening. In this study, we determined the neuroprotective effects of UCP0045037 against focal cerebral ischemia-induced neurodegeneration in rats. Hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death was significantly inhibited by UCP0045037 in both rat mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons and human normal SH-SY5Y cells. In contrast, DJ-1-knockdown SH-SY5Y cells lost the protective activity of UCP0045037. These results suggest that UCP0045037 interacts with endogenous DJ-1 and produces a neuroprotective response.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder. Although PD is diagnosed and recognized by the associated motor symptoms, historically the associated non-motor symptoms have been clinically under-appreciated. One of the most distressing of the non-motor symptoms is a sleep-wake pattern disturbance, estimated to affect more than 60% of people living with PD. A review of the literature utilizing the Human Response to Illness Model as an organizing framework will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the far-reaching impact of sleep disturbances in PD. The four concepts of the model, including the physiological, pathophysiological, experiential, and behavioural perspectives, provide a foundation for holistic insight into this issue. In turn, this will facilitate a greater understanding of the neuroscience nursing educational, interventional and research opportunities that can optimize an individual's adaptation to this response.",

    "abstract": "Studies have implicated methamphetamine exposure as a contributor to the development of Parkinson's disease. There is a significant degree of striatal dopamine depletion produced by methamphetamine, which makes the toxin useful in the creation of an animal model of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with selective degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The immediate need is to understand the substances that increase the risk for this debilitating disorder as well as these substances'neurodegenerative mechanisms. Currently, various approaches are being taken to develop a novel and cost-effective anti-Parkinson's drug with minimal adverse effects and the added benefit of a neuroprotective effect to facilitate and improve the care of patients with Parkinson's disease. Amethamphetamine-treated animal model for Parkinson's disease can help to further the understanding of the neurodegenerative processes that target the nigrostriatal system. Studies on widely used drugs of abuse, which are also dopaminergic toxicants, may aid in understanding the etiology, pathophysiology and progression of the disease process and increase awareness of the risks involved in such drug abuse. In addition, this review evaluates the possible neuroprotective mechanisms of certain drugs against methamphetamine-induced toxicity.",

This study aimed to assess the position of active contacts in relation to the subthalamic nucleus.\nWe reviewed the location of 40 electrodes in 34 patients who underwent STN-DBS. The position of electrode was evaluated by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The position of active contacts was compared with the subthalamic nucleus (STN) determined by intraoperative electrophysiological mapping and postoperative MRI.\nThe average position of the 40 active contacts was (11.7 + or - 1.2) mm lateral, (0.6 + or - 1.3) mm anterior, and (0.7 + or - 1.4) mm vertical to the midcommissural point. The dorsal margin of the STN was (11.6 + or - 1.1) mm lateral, (0.2 + or - 1.1) mm anterior, and (1.3 + or - 1.1) mm vertical to the midcommissural point. When compared with the dorsal margin of the STN, the active contacts were located more dorsally (P = 0.033) and anteriorly (P = 0.012), no significant difference was found in the lateral direction (P = 0.107). When compared with the position of the STN, 26 (65%) of active contacts were located in the region dorsal to the STN, only 13 (32.5%) were located in the upper two-thirds portion of STN.\nThe site for permanent stimulation appears to be in the subthalamic region dorsal to the STN, close to the dorsal margin of the STN. Besides the dorsal portion of the STN, other structures such as fields of Forel H and zona incerta may also be involved in the therapeutic benefit of deep brain stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in alpha-synuclein and Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are linked to autosomal dominant forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, little is known about any potential pathophysiological interplay between these two PD-related genes. Here we show in transgenic mice that although overexpression of LRRK2 alone did not cause neurodegeneration, the presence of excess LRRK2 greatly accelerated the progression of neuropathological abnormalities developed in PD-related A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice. Moreover, we found that LRRK2 promoted the abnormal aggregation and somatic accumulation of alpha-synuclein in A53T mice, which likely resulted from the impairment of microtubule dynamics, Golgi organization, and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Conversely, genetic ablation of LRRK2 preserved the Golgi structure and suppressed the aggregation and somatic accumulation of alpha-synuclein, and thereby delayed the progression of neuropathology in A53T mice. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of LRRK2 enhances alpha-synuclein-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest inhibition of LRRK2 expression as a potential therapeutic option for ameliorating alpha-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. The neuropathologic hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the presence of Lewy bodies composed mostly of alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin. It is believed that the occurrence of Parkinson's disease is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but the exact mechanism of Parkinson's disease development is not fully elucidated. The most characteristic motor symptoms for Parkinson's disease include bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and postural instability, while many patients also have non-motor signs and symptoms. The key therapeutic agent in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is L-dopa, and the others are dopaminergic agents, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, amantadine and anticholinergic agents.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, clinically characterized by impaired motor function. Since the etiology of PD is diverse and complex, many researchers have created PD-related research resources. However, resources for brain and PD studies are still lacking. Therefore, we have constructed a database of PD-related gene and genetic variations using the substantia nigra (SN) in PD and normal tissues. In addition, we integrated PD-related information from several resources.\nWe collected the 6,130 SN expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) from brain SN normal tissues and PD patients SN tissues using full-cDNA library and normalized cDNA library construction methods from our previous study. The SN ESTs were clustered in 2,951 unigene clusters and assigned in 2,678 genes. We then found up-regulated 57 genes and down-regulated 48 genes by comparing normal and PD SN ESTs frequencies with over 0.9 cut-off probability of differential expression based on the Audic and Claverie method. In addition, we integrated disease-related information from public resources. To examine the characteristics of these PD-related genes, we analyzed alternative splicing events, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers located in the gene regions, repeat elements, gene regulation elements, and pathways and protein-protein interaction networks.\nWe constructed the PDbase database to capture the PD-related gene, genetic variation, and functional elements. This database contains 2,698 PD-related genes through ESTs discovered from human normal and PD patients SN tissues, and through integrating several public resources. PDbase provides the mitochondrion proteins, microRNA gene regulation elements, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers within PD-related gene structures, repeat elements, and pathways and networks with protein-protein interaction information. The PDbase information can aid in understanding the causation of PD. It is available at http://bioportal.kobic.re.kr/PDbase/.

    "abstract": "L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease is associated with large increases in brain dopamine (DA) levels following drug dosing, but the precise significance of this phenomenon is not understood. Here we compare DA efflux and metabolism in the striatum and the substantia nigra in dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic animals following a standard dose of L-DOPA. Rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions were treated chronically with L-DOPA, monitored on the abnormal involuntary movements scale, and then subjected to intracerebral microdialysis under freely-moving conditions. Following s.c. L-DOPA injection, peak extracellular DA levels in both striatum and substantia nigra were about twice as large in dyskinetic animals compared to non-dyskinetic rats. This effect was not attributable to differences in DOPA levels or DA metabolism. The larger DA efflux in dyskinetic animals was blunted by 5-HT1A/5-HT1B receptor agonists and tetrodotoxin infusion, reflecting release from serotonin neurons. Striatal levels of serotonin and its main metabolite, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid were indeed elevated in dyskinetic animals compared to non-dyskinetic rats, indicating a larger serotonergic innervation density in the former group. High DA release was, however, not sufficient to explain dyskinesia. The 'abnormal involuntary movements output' per unit concentration of striatal extracellular DA was indeed much larger in dyskinetic animals compared to non-dyskinetic cases at most time points examined. The present results indicate that both a high DA release post-L-DOPA administration and an increased responsiveness to DA must coexist for a full expression of dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "In idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), two different clinical phenotypes are usually distinguished: a tremor dominant variant (TD) and an akinetic-rigid type (ART). TD patients are characterized by a slower disease progression and a minor cognitive impairment. Striatal density of DAT, as quantified by FP-CIT SPECT, has been reported to correlate with rigidity and akinesia but not with tremor.\nTo evaluate FP-CIT uptake in TD and ART phenotypes.\nWe retrospectively evaluated from our database the pre-synaptic nigro-striatal function of 24 patients with TD-PD and 38 patients with ART-PD who underwent a FP-CIT SPECT within 1 year from disease onset.\nDisease duration, age at the time of SPECT scan and disease severity as measured with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating scale part III (UPDRS III) were not statistically different between the two groups. Putamen contralateral to the most clinically affected side showed a lower FP-CIT uptake in ART patients compared to TD patients. No statistically significant differences emerged when considering bilateral caudate and ipsilateral putaminal uptake, as well as asymmetry indices and caudate/putamen ratios. FP-CIT contralateral putaminal uptake correlated with the severity of rigidity and hypokinesia but not with tremor.\nThese data suggest that other neurotransmitter systems apart from the nigro-striatal dopaminergic system are involved in the generation of Parkinsonian tremor, and they are consistent with previous evidence of a lack of correlation between tremor severity and FP-CIT uptake. Putaminal relative sparing in TD patients could partially explain the slower disease progression reported in this PD phenotype.",

Pantomime tasks, including oral/facial, trunk, and upper extremity movement, were used to evaluate ideomotor apraxia (IMA). Sequential tasks, including Luria test for ideational apraxia (IDA) and use of actual objects, were also tested.

Mean total praxis score was significantly lower for patients with PD (92.4 +/- 4) and MSA (75.9 +/- 18) than for controls (97.4 +/- 2) (P = 0.000). Transitive performances of upper extremities and sequential tasks were significantly impaired in patients with PD compared to control subjects (P < 0.05). There was no correlation between total praxis scores and sum scores of tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity of both of the upper limbs of patients with PD.

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and chronically treated with L-DOPA exhibit, in a percentage of 10-30%, supra-physiological levels of plasma total homocysteinemia (tHcy). In this study, we have investigated, in a group of hyper-homocysteinemic PD patients, the time of hyper-tHcy recurrence after discontinuation of 1-month folate supplementation given to normalize plasma tHcy levels.\nPlasma tHcy, cobalamin and folate were assayed before and after 1-month folate supplementation (5 mg/day), and after 2 and 4 months after folate discontinuation in 29 PD patients (16M/13F, mean age 69.4 +/- 6.9 years) stabilized on a mean L-DOPA dose of 509.4 +/- 312.1 mg/day.\nAfter folate supplementation, plasma tHcy levels fell within the normal range in all patients. At the 2-month control after folate discontinuation, plasma tHcy remained within physiological values in 25 out of 29 patients. Conversely, 4 months after folate discontinuation, all patients exhibited hyper-tHcy.\nOne-month intake of 5 mg/day folate normalizes plasma tHcy levels in all hyper-homocysteinemic PD patients. Following folate discontinuation, hyper-tHcy recurs in all patients within 4 months. Knowledge of this time interval is useful to optimize pulses of folate therapy in hyper-homocysteinemic patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is most frequently associated with characteristic motor symptoms that are known to arise with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. However, patients with this disease also experience a multitude of non-motor symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, apathy, anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, dementia, olfactory dysfunction, pain, sweating and constipation, some of which can be at least as debilitating as the movement disorders and have a major impact on patients' quality of life. Many of these non-motor symptoms may be evident prior to the onset of motor dysfunction. The neuropathology of PD has shown that complex, interconnected neuronal systems, regulated by a number of different neurotransmitters in addition to dopamine, are involved in the aetiology of motor and non-motor symptoms. This review focuses on the non-dopaminergic neurotransmission systems associated with PD with particular reference to the effect that their modulation and interaction with dopamine has on the non-motor symptoms of the disease. PD treatments that focus on the dopaminergic system alone are unable to alleviate both motor and non-motor symptoms, particularly those that develop at early stages of the disease. The development of agents that interact with several of the affected neurotransmission systems could prove invaluable for the treatment of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Mutations of the mitochondrial PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue)-induced kinase1 (PINK1) are important causes of recessive Parkinson disease (PD). Studies on loss of function and overexpression implicate PINK1 in apoptosis, abnormal mitochondrial morphology, impaired dopamine release and motor deficits. However, the fundamental mechanism underlying these various phenotypes remains to be clarified. Using fruit fly and mouse models we show that PINK1 deficiency or clinical mutations impact on the function of Complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, resulting in mitochondrial depolarization and increased sensitivity to apoptotic stress in mammalian cells and tissues. In Drosophila neurons, PINK1 deficiency affects synaptic function, as the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles is not mobilized during rapid stimulation. The fundamental importance of PINK1 for energy maintenance under increased demand is further corroborated as this deficit can be rescued by adding ATP to the synapse. The clinical relevance of our observations is demonstrated by the fact that human wild type PINK1, but not PINK1 containing clinical mutations, can rescue Complex 1 deficiency. Our work suggests that Complex I deficiency underlies, at least partially, the pathogenesis of this hereditary form of PD. As Complex I dysfunction is also implicated in sporadic PD, a convergence of genetic and environmental causes of PD on a similar mitochondrial molecular mechanism appears to emerge.",

    "abstract": "Investigators have hypothesized that consuming pesticide-contaminated well water plays a role in Parkinson's disease (PD), and several previous epidemiologic studies support this hypothesis.\nWe investigated whether consuming water from private wells located in areas with documented historical pesticide use was associated with an increased risk of PD.\nWe employed a geographic information system (GIS)-based model to estimate potential well-water contamination from agricultural pesticides among 368 cases and 341 population controls enrolled in the Parkinson's Environment and Genes Study (PEG). We separately examined 6 pesticides (diazinon, chlorpyrifos, propargite, paraquat, dimethoate, and methomyl) from among 26 chemicals selected for their potential to pollute groundwater or for their interest in PD, and because at least 10% of our population was exposed to them.\nCases were more likely to have consumed private well water and to have consumed it on average 4.3 years longer than controls (p = 0.02). High levels of possible well-water contamination with methomyl [odds ratio (OR) = 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-2.78]), chlorpyrifos (OR = 1.87; 95% CI, 1.05-3.31), and propargite (OR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.15-3.20) resulted in approximately 70-90% increases in relative risk of PD. Adjusting for ambient pesticide exposures only slightly attenuated these increases. Exposure to a higher number of water-soluble pesticides and organophosphate pesticides also increased the relative risk of PD.\nOur study, the first to use agricultural pesticide application records, adds evidence that consuming well water presumably contaminated with pesticides may play a role in the etiology of PD.",

The insertion and deletion variants in Exon 25 (Ins Q 1212, Ins QQ 1217, Del Q 1210, Del Q 1216 and Del PPQ1217_1219) are not related to the onset of familial PD. Our data indicate the GIGYF2 variants are not associated with PD in the mainland Chinese Population.",

    "abstract": "Objectives.\u2002The clinical efficacy of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) for major motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is well established, but its effects on visually guided vs. internally generated eye movements in the medication off state need to be studied further. Since the basal ganglia are thought to be involved in the generation of voluntary movements under internal control, we hypothesized that voluntary saccades would show improvements with STN DBS. Materials and Methods.\u2002Seven PD patients with STN DBS performed visually guided and internally generated (anti- and memory-guided) saccades with STN DBS on and off following 12 hours of levodopa withdrawal. The change in saccade reaction time, first saccade gain, and final saccade gain with STN DBS were measured. Results.\u2002STN DBS improved the reaction time of visually guided saccades but not of anti- or memory-guided saccades. STN DBS also improved the first saccade gain of the anti- and memory-guided saccades, but not of the visually guided saccades. Conclusions.\u2002These results demonstrate that STN DBS has differential effects on the parameters of visually guided and internally generated saccades. These effects may be mediated by the influence of STN DBS on cortical ocular motor areas, the basal ganglia, ocular motor loop, or downstream structures such as the brainstem saccade generating circuits.",

    "abstract": "Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is a rare intraepithelial neoplasm occurring less frequently in men and even more rarely in the axilla. A 59-year-old man with severe Parkinson's disease presented with axillary EMPD. The neurological comorbidity made treatment of the EMPD problematical and prompted us to propose locoregional intra-arterial chemotherapy in single short sessions. Two innovative chemotherapeutic macrocomplexes were used: doxorubicin incorporated in large liposomes and the taxane paclitaxel incorporated in albumin nanoparticles. A therapeutic response was seen right from the first treatment and was macroscopically close to complete after four cycles. Five months after the end of treatment the patient had minimal visible disease and had enjoyed a distinct improvement in quality of life, with no noteworthy complications related to the intra-arterial chemotherapy with percutaneous transfemoral catheterization.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the age- and gender-specific risk of depression in demented and non-demented participants, its symptom structure, and associated clinical factors in a nationwide random sample of n = 1449 outpatients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nDepression ratings were based on a cross-sectional clinical assessment including the clinical Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS > or = 14). Parkinson disease severity was rated according to Hoehn and Yahr (HY) and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Diagnosis of dementia was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition; DSM-IV) criteria.\n25.2% (CI: 22.8-27.5) of all patients met study criteria for depression. Additionally, 8.4% of patients did not exceed the MADRS cut-off but were currently being treated with antidepressants, possibly suggesting a corrected (upper limit) total prevalence of 33.6%. Females were more likely depressive than males (29.3% vs 22.4%). In both genders, depression risk was elevated 2- to 4-fold depending on HY stage. Overall, highest rates in non-demented patients were found in females at stages IV to V (53.7%, CI: 37.7-69.6). Demented patients were more likely to meet depression criteria than non-demented (up to 76.2%, 95% CI: 60.5-87.9). Depression symptom profiles for demented PD patients (as compared to non-demented) revealed no structural differences but consistently higher symptom scores. Neither age at onset of PD nor duration of disease were significantly linked with depression.\nDepression rates are already substantially elevated at early PD stages, emphasizing the need for a thorough examination of mood disorders in all patients with PD. Depression is associated with PD severity and dementia but not with age, age at onset of PD, or disease duration. The differential associations with dementia and the statistical independence of dementia and depression also suggest that depression could not be regarded as a mere demoralisation syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). The present study was designed to examine the therapeutic effect of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S, a novel biological gas) on PD. The endogenous H(2)S level was markedly reduced in the SN in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rat model. Systemic administration of NaHS (an H(2)S donor) dramatically reversed the progression of movement dysfunction, loss of tyrosine-hydroxylase positive neurons in the SN and the elevated malondialdehyde level in injured striatum in the 6-OHDA-induced PD model. H(2)S specifically inhibited 6-OHDA evoked NADPH oxidase activation and oxygen consumption. Similarly, administration of NaHS also prevented the development of PD induced by rotenone. NaHS treatment inhibited microglial activation in the SN and accumulation of pro-inflammatory factors (e.g. TNF-alpha and nitric oxide) in the striatum via NF-kappaB pathway. Moreover, significantly less neurotoxicity was found in neurons treated with the conditioned medium from microglia incubated with both NaHS and rotenone compared to that with rotenone only, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of NaHS was, at least partially, secondary to its suppression of microglial activation. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that H(2)S may serve as a neuroprotectant to treat and prevent neurotoxin-induced neurodegeneration via multiple mechanisms including anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammation and metabolic inhibition and therefore has potential therapeutic value for treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a central factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an antioxidant protein expressed in response to oxidative challenge, and its expression levels are inversely correlated with glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) activity. Underexpression of HO-1 in concert with an upregulation of GSK3beta would result in a less effective antioxidant response and might increase the risk of PD.\nWe examined two functional polymorphism in the promoter regions of HO-1 (-413, rs2071746) and GSK3beta (-157, rs6438552) in a group of 251 Spanish patients with PD and 234 controls.\nSubjects carrying both the HO-1 (-413, rs2071746) TT genotype and the GSK3beta (-157, rs6438552) TT genotype had a four times higher risk of developing PD than subjects without these genotypes (adjusted by age and sex OR = 4.12; 95% CI = 1.45-11.71; Bonferroni corrected P = 0.024).\nConsidering synergistic effects between polymorphisms in oxidative stress-related genes may help in determining the risk profile for PD.",

    "abstract": "The characteristics of levodopa dosing are not well described in the literature. The aims were to investigate the use of levodopa in a nationwide Swedish survey and to study the characteristics of low-dose and high-dose patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in a university hospital.\nPatients with >or= 1 and >or= 2 purchases of levodopa during 2007 were selected from the prescribed drug register. Daily levodopa doses were estimated. Records of 504 patients with PD who visited the neurology clinic at Uppsala University Hospital during 2006-2007 were examined to select a low-dose group (< or = 400 mg levodopa daily, n = 21) and a high-dose group (>or= 1200 mg daily, n = 26) with at least 5 years of PD duration.\nIn total, 33 534 levodopa users with > or = 1 levodopa purchase were found. Daily levodopa dose range was large; median daily dose was 465 mg for men and 395 mg for women (P < 0.0001). Almost half (46%) of the patients used < 400 mg levodopa daily. Significantly, more men were treated with doses >or= 1200 mg daily. Dose and age correlated negatively (P < 0.0001). Patients with high dose at 5 years PD duration continuously increased their dosage the following years, whereas low-dose patients did not. The occurrence of dyskinesias was about the same in both groups despite the large difference in levodopa dose.\nWe conclude that the levodopa requirement in PD ranges considerably, and that men use higher levodopa dose than women. Levodopa requirement is constant during the progression of the disease in low-dose patients but increases in high-dose patients.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) are encountered frequently and have progressively severe neurologic changes. The central nervous system changes involve dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra. Although usually sporadic, rare forms of PD are familial and the responsible genes have been identified. These genes affect mitochondrial function and can be studied in animals. Brains of affected animals reveal consequences of reactive oxygen species (ROS)--quinones, dopamine oxidation products, tyrosine nitration, lipid peroxidation and amino-aldehyde adducts. The three genes are important for maintaining physical and functional mitochondrial integrity. The cumulative effects of mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly those mediated by ROS, ultimately lead to at least some of the clinical and pathologic changes of PD.",

    "abstract": "alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn) is a small lipid-binding protein involved in vesicle trafficking whose function is poorly characterized. It is of great interest to human biology and medicine because alpha-syn dysfunction is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). We previously created a yeast model of alpha-syn pathobiology, which established vesicle trafficking as a process that is particularly sensitive to alpha-syn expression. We also uncovered a core group of proteins with diverse activities related to alpha-syn toxicity that is conserved from yeast to mammalian neurons. Here, we report that a yeast strain expressing a somewhat higher level of alpha-syn also exhibits strong defects in mitochondrial function. Unlike our previous strain, genetic suppression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi trafficking alone does not suppress alpha-syn toxicity in this strain. In an effort to identify individual compounds that could simultaneously rescue these apparently disparate pathological effects of alpha-syn, we screened a library of 115,000 compounds. We identified a class of small molecules that reduced alpha-syn toxicity at micromolar concentrations in this higher toxicity strain. These compounds reduced the formation of alpha-syn foci, re-established ER-to-Golgi trafficking and ameliorated alpha-syn-mediated damage to mitochondria. They also corrected the toxicity of alpha-syn in nematode neurons and in primary rat neuronal midbrain cultures. Remarkably, the compounds also protected neurons against rotenone-induced toxicity, which has been used to model the mitochondrial defects associated with PD in humans. That single compounds are capable of rescuing the diverse toxicities of alpha-syn in yeast and neurons suggests that they are acting on deeply rooted biological processes that connect these toxicities and have been conserved for a billion years of eukaryotic evolution. Thus, it seems possible to develop novel therapeutic strategies to simultaneously target the multiple pathological features of PD.",

    "abstract": "This review presents two intriguing multidisciplinary strategies that might make the difference in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The first proposed strategy is based on the controlled delivery of recombinant proteins known to play a key role in these neurodegenerative disorders that are released in situ by optimized polymer-based systems. The second strategy is the use of engineered cells, encapsulated and delivered in situ by suitable polymer-based systems, that act as drug reservoirs and allow the delivery of selected molecules to be used in the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In both these scenarios, the design and development of optimized polymer-based drug delivery and cell housing systems for central nervous system applications represent a key requirement. Materials science provides suitable hydrogel-based tools to be optimized together with suitably designed recombinant proteins or drug delivering-cells that, once in situ, can provide an effective treatment for these neurodegenerative disorders. In this scenario, only interdisciplinary research that fully integrates biology, biochemistry, medicine and materials science can provide a springboard for the development of suitable therapeutic tools, not only for the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases but also, prospectively, for a wide range of severe neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "The study was aimed to examine the prevalence of depression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and identify its features. A total of 131 out-patients, diagnosed as having idiopathic PD in accordance with the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria, were interviewed with questionnaire and evaluated by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hohen &Yahr staging (H&Y staging) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Patients were divided into three groups in terms of HRSD score: depression group, sub-threshold depression group and non-depression group. The clinical variables and symptom profiles were obtained and compared among the three groups. The results showed that 27 patients (20.6%) fell into the depression group, 71 (54.2%) into the sub-threshold depression group, and 33 (25.2%) into the non-depression group. There were no differences in age, gender or tremor score among the groups (P>0.05). Significant differences were found in duration of PD, UPDRS score, rigidity score and H&Y stage between the sub-threshold depression group (or the depression group) and the non-depression group (P<0.05). Moreover, the clinical variables in the subthreshold depression group had the trend of increasing with the severity of PD and their values were similar to those in the depression group. Anhedonia, feeling of incapability, sleep disturbance, gastrointestinal symptoms and depressive moods were most common in the depression group. And these symptoms also were more common in the other two groups. It is concluded that depression and sub-threshold depression are common in PD and share similar clinical features. Furthermore, subthreshold depression might be the prodrome of depression and may develop into depression as the condition progresses.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that vibration therapy may have a positive influence on motor symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, quantitative evidence of these benefits is scarce, and the concept of \"whole-body\" vibration in these studies is vague. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate the influence of vibration on motor symptoms and functional measures in PD by delivering sound waves to the entire body. We delivered whole body sound wave vibration to 40 individuals with PD using a Physioacoustic Chair, a piece of equipment with speakers spaced throughout the chair permitting a series of programmed low frequency sound waves through the body. Using a parallel cross-over design we utilized the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), quantitative gait assessments, and a grooved pegboard for upper limb control. Improvements were seen in all symptom, motor control and functional outcome measures at the time of assessment. Specifically, a significant decrease in rigidity, and tremor were shown, as well as a significant increase in step length and improved speed on the grooved pegboard task. Results of this initial investigation provide support for vibration therapy as a non-pharmacological treatment alternative. Long-term benefits of vibration therapy will require further research.",

    "abstract": "It has been theorized that sensorimotor processing deficits underlie Parkinson's disease (PD) motor impairments including movement under proprioceptive control. However, it is possible that these sensorimotor processing deficits exclude tactile/proprioception sensorimotor integration: prior studies show improved movement accuracy in PD with endpoint tactile feedback, and good control in tactile-driven precision-grip tasks. To determine whether tactile/proprioceptive integration in particular is affected by PD, nine subjects with PD (off-medication, UPDRS motor=19-42) performed an arm-matching task without visual feedback. In some trials one arm touched a static tactile cue that conflicted with dynamic proprioceptive feedback from biceps brachii muscle vibration. This sensory conflict paradigm has characterized tactile/proprioceptive integration in healthy subjects as specific to the context of tactile cue mobility assumptions and the intention to move the arm. We found that the individuals with PD had poorer arm-matching accuracy than age-matched control subjects. However, PD-group accuracy improved with tactile feedback. Furthermore, sensory conflict conditions were resolved in the same context-dependent fashion by both subject groups. We conclude that the somatosensory integration mechanism for prioritizing tactile and proprioception feedback in this task are not disrupted by PD, and are not related to the observed proprioceptive deficits.",

    "abstract": "The effect of disease severity and dopaminergic medication on the assessment of familiarity and the recollection of episodic details during recognition in nondementing idiopathic Parkinson's is uncertain. Some studies have reported familiarity as deficient in mild Parkinson's yet others have found it intact even in moderate Parkinson's. Recollection has been found to be both preserved and deficient in mild and moderate Parkinson's. The extent to which these conflicting findings are explained by disease severity or dopaminergic medication or a combination of the two is uncertain, as all studies assessed patients in a medicated state, and disease severity has not always been consistently reported. Twelve patients with mild Parkinson's and 11 with moderate Parkinson's (medicated Hoehn and Yahr mean: 2.1 and 3.2, respectively), completed matched versions of a yes/no recognition memory test in a medicated and unmedicated condition (termed ON and OFF, respectively). Twenty-one matched healthy volunteers also completed both memory tasks in 2 separate sessions (termed Blue and Green, respectively). In the ON/Green condition, the moderate Parkinson's recollection performance was significantly poorer than the healthy volunteers and mild Parkinson's. By contrast, recognition memory and familiarity measures in both Parkinson's group were relatively spared. In the OFF/Blue condition, the moderate Parkinson's recollection was impaired, but only in relation to the healthy volunteer set. There were no significant differences in recollection performance between the mild and moderate Parkinson's groups. Again, recognition memory and familiarity measures in both Parkinson's group were relatively spared. Further analyses showed the moderate patients' recollection rates to be significantly poorer ON-medication compared to OFF. These findings are discussed in relation to the staging of disease progression on medial temporal areas which separately support recollection and familiarity, and the putative effects the different classes of dopaminergic drugs may have on these areas.",

    "abstract": "Several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD) are associated with protein misfolding and the formation of distinct aggregates, resulting in a putative pathological protein load on the nervous system. A variety of factors cause proteins to aggregate, including aggregation-prone sequences, specific mutations, protein modifications and also dysregulation of the protein degradation machinery. Molecular chaperones are responsible for maintaining normal protein homeostasis within the cell by assisting protein folding and modulating protein-degrading pathways. Here, we review the fundamental mechanisms of neurodegeneration occurring in PD involving alpha-synuclein fibrillisation and aggregation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, ubiquitin proteasome systems, autophagy and lysosomal degradation. Molecular chaperones serve a neuroprotective role in many of these pathways, and we discuss recent evidence indicating that these proteins might provide the basis for new therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "High-profile studies have provided conflicting results regarding the involvement of the Omi/HtrA2 gene in Parkinson's disease (PD) susceptibility. Therefore, we performed a large-scale analysis of the association of common Omi/HtrA2 variants in the Genetic Epidemiology of Parkinson's disease (GEO-PD) consortium. GEO-PD sites provided clinical and genetic data including affection status, gender, ethnicity, age at study, age at examination (all subjects); age at onset and family history of PD (patients). Genotyping was performed for the five most informative SNPs spanning the Omi/HtrA2 gene in approximately 2-3 kb intervals (rs10779958, rs2231250, rs72470544, rs1183739, rs2241028). Fixed as well as random effect models were used to provide summary risk estimates of Omi/HtrA2 variants. The 20 GEO-PD sites provided data for 6378 cases and 8880 controls. No overall significant associations for the five Omi/HtrA2 SNPs and PD were observed using either fixed effect or random effect models. The summary odds ratios ranged between 0.98 and 1.08 and the estimates of between-study heterogeneity were not large (non-significant Q statistics for all 5 SNPs; I(2) estimates 0-28%). Trends for association were seen for participants of Scandinavian descent for rs2241028 (OR 1.41, p=0.04) and for rs1183739 for age at examination (cut-off 65 years; OR 1.17, p=0.02), but these would not be significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons and their Bayes factors were only modest. This largest association study performed to define the role of any gene in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease revealed no overall strong association of Omi/HtrA2 variants with PD in populations worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Local field potentials (LFPs) recorded through electrodes implanted in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) for deep brain stimulation (DBS) provided physiological information about the human basal ganglia. However, LFPs were always recorded 2-7 days after electrode implantation (\"acute\" condition). Because changes in the tissue surrounding the electrode occur after DBS surgery and could be relevant for LFPs, in this work we assessed whether impedance and LFP pattern are a function of the time interval between the electrode implant and the recordings. LFPs and impedances were recorded from 11 patients with PD immediately after (T-0h), 2 h after (T-2h), 2 days after (T-48h), and 1 month after (T-30d, \"chronic\" condition) surgery. Impedances at T-0h were significantly higher than at all the other time intervals (T-2h, p=0.0005; T-48h, p=0.0002; T-30d, p=0.003). Correlated with this change (p=0.005), the low-frequency band (2-7 Hz) decreased at all time intervals (p=0.0005). Conversely, the low- (8-20 Hz) and the high-beta (21-35 Hz) bands increased in time (low-beta, p=0.003; high beta, p=0.022), but did not change between T-48h and T-30d. Our results suggest that DBS electrode impedance and LFP pattern are a function of the time interval between electrode implant and LFP recordings. Impedance decrease could be related to changes in the electrode/tissue interface and in the low-frequency band. Conversely, beta band modulations could raise from the adaptation of the neural circuit. These findings confirm that results from LFP analysis in the acute condition can be extended to the chronic condition and that LFPs can be used in novel closed-loop DBS systems.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder marked by nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration and development of cytoplasmic aggregates known as Lewy bodies. The impact of this disease is indicated by the fact that mortality is two to five times as high among affected persons as among age-matched controls. However, the cause of PD is still unknown and no cure is available at present. Several biochemical abnormalities have been described in the brains of patients with PD, including oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent identification of specific gene mutations that cause PD has further reinforced the relevance of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the familial and sporadic forms of the disease. The proteins that are reported to be related to familial PD-PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), DJ-1, alpha- synuclein, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), and, possibly, parkin-are either mitochondrial proteins or are associated with mitochondria, and all are involved in pathways that elicit oxidative stress or free radical damage. Mitochondria are continually exposed to reactive oxygen species and accumulate oxidative damage more rapidly than the rest of the cell. Therefore, Parkinson's disease has been suggested to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Since mitochondria are the major intracellular organelles that regulate both cell survival and death, clarifying the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and biogenesis during the process of PD could provide treatment strategies that might successfully intervene in the pathogenesis and slow the progression of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of Parkinson disease (PD) is complex and multifactorial, with hereditary and environmental factors contributing. Monogenic forms have provided molecular clues to disease mechanisms but genetic modifiers of idiopathic PD are still to be determined.\nWe carried out whole-genome expression profiling of isolated human substantia nigra (SN) neurons from patients with PD vs. controls followed by association analysis of tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in differentially regulated genes. Association was investigated in a German PD sample and confirmed in Italian and British cohorts.\nWe identified four differentially expressed genes located in PD candidate pathways, ie, MTND2 (mitochondrial, p = 7.14 x 10(-7)), PDXK (vitamin B6/dopamine metabolism, p = 3.27 x 10(-6)), SRGAP3 (axon guidance, p = 5.65 x 10(-6)), and TRAPPC4 (vesicle transport, p = 5.81 x 10(-6)). We identified a DNA variant (rs2010795) in PDXK associated with an increased risk of PD in the German cohort (p = 0.00032). This association was confirmed in the British (p = 0.028) and Italian (p = 0.0025) cohorts individually and reached a combined value of p = 1.2 x 10(-7) (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.44).\nWe provide an example of how microgenomic genome-wide expression studies in combination with association analysis can aid to identify genetic modifiers in neurodegenerative disorders. The detection of a genetic variant in PDXK, together with evidence accumulating from clinical studies, emphasize the impact of vitamin B6 status and metabolism on disease risk and therapy in PD.",

    "abstract": "Calpain is a ubiquitous calcium-sensitive protease that is essential for normal physiologic neuronal function. However, mitochondrial-mediated-calcium homeostasis alterations may lead to its pathologic activation that jeopardizes neuronal structure and function. Here, we provide evidence to support a role for the involvement of calpain 1 in mitochondrial-induced neurodegeneration in a Parkinson's disease (PD) cellular model. We show that dysfunctional mitochondria increases cytosolic calcium, thereby, inducing calpain activation. Interestingly, its inhibition significantly attenuated the accumulation of alpha-synuclein oligomers and contributed to an increase of insoluble alpha-synuclein aggregates, known to be cytoprotective. Moreover, our data corroborate that calpain-1 overactivation in our mitochondrial-deficient cells promote caspase-3 activation. Overall, our findings further clarify the crucial role of dysfunctional mitochondria in the control of molecular mechanisms occurring in PD brain cells, providing a potentially novel correlation between the degradation of calpain substrates suggesting a putative role of calpain and calpain inhibition as a therapeutic tool in PD.",

    "abstract": "Both the basal ganglia and cerebellum are known to influence cortical motor and motor-associated areas via the thalamus. Whereas striato-thalamo-cortical (STC) motor circuit dysfunction has been implicated clearly in Parkinson's disease (PD), the role of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) motor circuit has not been well defined. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a convenient tool for studying the role of the CTC in vivo in PD patients, but large inter-individual differences in fMRI activation patterns require very large numbers of subjects in order to interpret data from cross-sectional, case control studies. To understand the role of the CTC during PD progression, we obtained longitudinal fMRI 2 years apart from 5 PD (57+/-8 yr) and five Controls (57+/-9 yr) performing either externally- (EG) or internally-guided (IG) sequential finger movements. All PD subjects had unilateral motor symptoms at baseline, but developed bilateral symptoms at follow-up. Within-group analyses were performed by comparing fMRI activation patterns between baseline and follow-up scans. Between-group comparisons were made by contrasting fMRI activation patterns generated by the more-affected and less-affected hands of PD subjects with the mean of the dominant and non-dominant hands of Controls. Compared to baseline, Controls showed changes in CTC circuits, but PD subjects had increased recruitment of both cortical motor-associated and cerebellar areas. Compared to Controls, PD subjects demonstrated augmented recruitment of CTC circuits over time that was statistically significant when the IG task was performed by the hand that transitioned from non-symptomatic to symptomatic. This longitudinal fMRI study demonstrates increased recruitment of the CTC motor circuit concomitant with PD progression, suggesting a role of the CTC circuit in accommodation to, or pathophysiology of, PD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether a period of 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over M1 preconditioned by tDCS improves bradykinesia of the upper limb in Parkinson's disease (PD). Fifteen patients with PD performed index finger, hand tapping and horizontal pointing movements as well as reach-to-grasp movements with either hand before (baseline conditions) and after a period of 1 Hz rTMS preconditioned by (1) sham, (2) anodal or (3) cathodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex contralateral to the more affected body side. Movement kinematics was analysed using an ultrasound-based motion analyser at baseline, immediately after and 30 min after each stimulation session. Dopaminergic medication was continued. Compared to baseline, 1 Hz rTMS significantly increased the frequency of index finger and hand tapping as well as horizontal pointing movements performed with the contralateral hand. Movement frequency increased up to 40% over 30 min after cessation of the stimulation. Preconditioning with cathodal tDCS, but not with anodal tDCS, reduced the effectiveness of 1 Hz rTMS to improve tapping and pointing movements. There was no significant increase of movement frequencies of the ipsilateral hand induced by 1 Hz rTMS preconditioned by either tDCS session. Movement kinematics of reach-to-grasp movements were not significantly influenced by either stimulation session. In PD the beneficial effects of 1 Hz rTMS over the primary motor cortex on bradykinesia of simple finger, hand and pointing movements is reduced by preconditioning with cathodal tDCS, but not with anodal tDCS. Preconditioning with tDCS is a powerful tool to modulate the behavioural effect of 1 Hz rTMS over the primary motor cortex in PD.",

    "abstract": "An open 10-day study of treatment effect of cereton in comparison to piracetam has been conducted. Cereton was used in 40 patients (main group) in dosage 1000 mg, piracetam - in 20 patients (control group) in dosage 2000 mg. Both drugs were used intravenous in drops in 200 ml of physiologic saline along with antiparkinsonian medications. Patient's state was assessed with a battery of psychometric scales and neuropsychological tests as well as with instruments for measuring intensity of parkinsonian symptoms, side-effects and quality of life. Marked and moderate improvement of cognitive functions was found in patients of the main group compared to the control one (40% and 25%, respectively, p<0,05). Deterioration of cognitive functions was seen less often in the main group than in the control group (5% and 15%, respectively, p<0,05). Cereton was well-tolerated by patients. Side effects (brief and short-term) were found only in 6 (15%) patients.",

To examine test-retest reliability, a cohort of patients was asked to complete the PSI-PD twice. Afterwards, validity was evaluated using a telephone interview.\nThe PSI-PD was completed twice by 81 patients. Test-retest agreement for the selection of activity limitations was 73% to 94%. Items ranked by patients were categorized into domains, of which gait, transfers and dexterity were rated most frequently (41%-70%). Test-retest agreement for ranked domains ranged from 74% to 82%. Interviews confirmed that the PSI-PD reliably identified problem areas.\nThe PSI-PD is a relevant, reliable and valid instrument to identify limitations in everyday activities that are important for both PD patients and physiotherapists.",

    "abstract": "Advances in the field of stem cell research have raised hopes of creating novel cell replacement therapies for Parkinson disease (PD), although double-blinded clinical trials have met with controversial success in patients implanted with fetal midbrain tissue and autopsy results have shown that some of the grafted fetal neurons displayed pathological changes typical of PD. Dopaminergic neurons have been efficiently derived from stem cells using various methods, and beneficial effects after transplantation have been demonstrated in animal models of PD. Some obstacles remain to be overcome before stem cell therapy can be routinely and safely used to treat PD in humans. A widely used prodrug/suicide gene therapy would be applied to stem cells to reduce risk of tumor formation. Since grafts were transplanted ectopically into the striatum instead of the substantia nigra in most current protocols, surviving dopaminergic neurons would not have to be the same subtype as the nigral cells. If the main mechanism underlying any functional recovery achieved by cell therapies is restoration of dopaminergic neurotransmission, then viral vector-mediated gene delivery of dopamine-synthesizing enzymes represents a more straightforward approach. Future targets for cell therapy should include some types of Parkinsonism with degeneration of striatal neurons.",

    "abstract": "It is proposed that alpha-synucleinopathy initially affects the medulla oblongata and then progresses to more rostral brain areas (\"Braak hypothesis\"). According to this hypothesis, substantia nigra is affected in the later stages of PD. Another region affected in the earlier stages was reported to be olfactory bulb, although the following processes were not described in detail. On the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest that non-motor symptoms including constipation, depression, REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and hyposmia may be prodromal symptoms in PD. The pathological staging postulated by the Braak hypothesis is in good agreement with the fact that these non-motor symptoms precede motor symptoms in PD, because affected brain areas in the early stages, such as dorsal vagal nucleus, locus ceruleus and olfactory bulb, are related to these non-motor features. Recently, it was reported that although half of brains corresponded to the Braak hypothesis, there were a high proportion of cases which did not fit the Braak's staging system and majority of the latter demonstrated amygdale-predominant alpha-synucleinopathy. It was also demonstrated that the Lewy pathology in olfactory bulb was closely related to the presence of alpha-synuclein pathology in amygdala. The amygdala is one of the main systems in odor perception and in PD, cortical neurons in corticomedial complex of amygdale, which have major olfactory connections, are selectively affected even in the early stages of the disease. We recently obtained the data suggesting that metabolic changes in the amygdala were associated with low scores in odor identification test. These data suggest that not only the olfactory bulb, but also the amygdala is also responsible for hyposmia in PD and that there may be another pathological process, which starts from the olfactory bulb and involves the amygdala.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying PD is largely unknowm, it is widely believed that multiple genetic as well as environmental factors play critical roles in the development of PD. Alpha synuclein (a-SYN) and the disturbance of a-SYN metabolism seems to play the most important role in PD pathogenesis. a-SYN, the gene causative in PARK1, is the major component of Lewy bodies. Gene duplication or triplication of a-SYN leads to autosomal dominant form of familial PD, suggesting that disturbance of a-SYN may represent the etiology of sporadic PD. GBA and LRRK, the genes responsible for Gaucher disease and PARK8, respetively, are also likely to affect the development of PD. Studies of PD brains suggest that mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress may contribute to the pathogenesis of sporadic PD. Mitochondrial complex I inhibitors, such as MPTP and rotenone, induce selective dopaminergic neuronal death, suggesting that chemicals may constitute risk factors of sporadic PD. Not only continuous infusion, but oral intake of rotenone is effective to establish animal models of PD. Further studies will reveal genetic or environmental risk factors, that are the good targets for prevention and therapy of PD.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin B12 is indispensable for proper brain functioning and cytosolic synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine. Whether its deficiency produces effects on viability and apoptosis of neurons remains unknown. There is a particular interest in investigating these effects in Parkinson disease where Levodopa treatment is known to increase the consumption of S-adenosylmethionine. To cause deprivation of vitamin B12, we have recently developed a cell model that produces decreased synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine by anchoring transcobalamin (TCII) to the reticulum through its fusion with Oleosin (OLEO).\nGene constructs including transcobalamin-oleosin (TCII-OLEO) and control constructs, green fluorescent protein-transcobalamin-oleosin (GFP-TCII-OLEO), oleosin-transcobalamin (OLEO-TCII), TCII and OLEO were used for expression in N1E-115 cells (mouse neuroblastoma) and in substantia nigra of adult rats, using a targeted transfection with a Neurotensin polyplex system. We studied the viability and the apoptosis in the transfected cells and targeted tissue. The turning behavior was evaluated in the rats transfected with the different plasmids.\nThe transfection of N1E-115 cells by the TCII-OLEO-expressing plasmid significantly affected cell viability and increased immunoreactivity of cleaved Caspase-3. No change in propidium iodide uptake (used as a necrosis marker) was observed. The transfected rats lost neurons immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase. The expression of TCII-OLEO was observed in cells immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase of the substantia nigra, with a superimposed expression of cleaved Caspase-3. These cellular and tissular effects were not observed with the control plasmids. Rats transfected with TCII-OLEO expressing plasmid presented with a significantly higher number of turns, compared with those transfected with the other plasmids.\nIn conclusion, the TCII-OLEO transfection was responsible for apoptosis in N1E-115 cells and rat substantia nigra and for Parkinson-like phenotype. This suggests evaluating whether vitamin B12 deficit could aggravate the PD in patients under Levodopa therapy by impairing S-adenosylmethionine synthesis in substantia nigra.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the performance of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia for incidental recognition memory and the effect of encoding strategies on contextual memory.\nThe authors studied 21 patients with PD (ages 60-85, 12 women; Hoehn and Yahr I-III, Activities of Daily Living 70%-100%) and 22 healthy controls (ages 60-84, 18 women). Participants completed the vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). To assess the incidental recognition memory for item (object) and context (location of the object), participants of each group were assigned to 1 of 2 encoding conditions: ( a) an incidental associative instruction to bind the object to its location or (b) a nonassociative, nonspecific instruction.\nPD patients showed performance comparable to the control group's on the vocabulary subtest and WCST. In contrast to controls, PD patients were unable to take advantage of the associative encoding instruction, which also had a deleterious effect on item recognition.\nThis sample of participants with PD showed diminished item and context recognition memory and an impaired ability to use incidental memory encoding strategy, suggesting a compromised cognitive reserve. The fact that these alterations occurred in early stages of PD, and prior to more general cognitive alterations such as executive dysfunction, should be considered in the management of patients by using specific cognitive rehabilitation interventions.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that trace amines such as tyramine and octopamine, alternative products of tyrosine metabolism (an aminoacid parent of dopamine and noradrenaline), play a role in the homeostasis of the extrapyramidal system. However, the relevance of these trace amines in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is still largely unknown. Here, we assessed the plasma levels of octopamine and noradrenaline in three sub-groups of PD patients, namely de novo, non-fluctuating and fluctuating patients, versus age-matched control subjects. We show that octopamine is detectable in plasma of all subjects, the mean levels of which are significantly lower in PD patients, including de novo patients, when compared to controls (p<0.001). Unlike this, no changes in plasmatic noradrenaline levels were found in the de novo patients, but only in plasma of fluctuating and non-fluctuating PD patients. These findings raise the possibility that Parkinson's disease is firstly characterized by abnormalities of tyrosine decarboxylase, rather than tyrosine hydroxylase, enzyme activity. Given the role of this enzyme in the production of trace amines, circulating octopamine levels may hold promise as a biomarker of early Parkinson's disease.",

Abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein was found in the chest skin of two (10%) of 20 patients, but not in the leg. Although skin biopsy combined with a conventional immunohistochemistry for alpha-synuclein is not sufficient as a diagnostic tool, we could firstly demonstrate Lewy pathology in premortem tissue.

    "abstract": "Type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptors are expressed in high concentrations in the central nervous system, including the basal ganglia, and could have direct or indirect effects on motor behavior through modulation of dopaminergic, glutamatergic and GABA-ergic neurotransmission. Using the CB1 receptor radioligand [(18)F]MK-9470 and small-animal PET, we investigated for the first time in vivo cerebral changes in [(18)F]MK-9470 binding in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD), parallel to dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining, and behavioral measurements. In the 6-OHDA model, relative [(18)F]MK-9470 PET binding decreased in the contralateral cerebellum (-9%, p<0.0004) and caudate-putamen bilaterally (ipsilateral -8%, contralateral -7%; p=0.001 and p<0.0003, respectively). The number of TH(+) neurons in the substantia nigra was inversely correlated to CB1 receptor binding in the ipsilateral cerebellum (p=1.10(-6)). The behavioral outcome was positively related to regional CB1 receptor binding in the contralateral somatosensory cortex (p=4.10(-6)). In vivo [(18)F]MK-9470 PET imaging points to changes in endocannabinoid transmission, specifically for CB1 receptors in the 6-OHDA model of PD, with mainly involvement of the caudate-putamen, but also distant regions of the motor circuitry, including the cerebellum and somatosensory cortex.",

In Japan, it can be prescribed as first-line monotherapy drug - independent of age. ZNS may also be effective in idiopathic generalized epilepsy and some difficult-to-treat epilepsies including West, Lennox-Gastaut, or Dravet syndromes. The most frequent side effects of ZNS are related to central nervous system occurring in 19%. Kidney stones and oligohidrosis are ZNS-specific side effects. Loss of appetite and weight are usually \"beneficial\" effects. ZNS is not recommended in pregnancy ZNS can be taken once daily, which may be beneficial in non-compliance. The pathomechanism of ZNS is different from other antiepileptic drugs. ZNS has an effect on the voltage-gated Na+ - and T-type Ca2+ channels as well as on the dopaminerg, glutamaterg, cholinerg, and GABAerg systems. The multiple way of action may be the reason why ZNS seems to be a broad-spectrum drug and beneficial in various neurological disorders. ZNS reduces production of free radicals according to in vitro and in vivo studies. Animal experiments suggest that ZNS may be a neuroprotective agent. Based on an adequate randomized controlled trial, ZNS is effective in adjuctive treatment of Parkinson disorder. A peculiar benefit of the ZNS is that parallel to its positive effect on motor impairment it also reduces severity of dyskinesias. ZNS may be effective in bipolar disorder, obesity, eating disorders, and migraine prophylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Although Parkinson disease (PD) is common throughout the world, the evidence for physical therapy interventions that enable long-term improvement in walking is still emerging. This article critiques the major physical therapy approaches related to gait rehabilitation in people with PD: compensatory strategies, motor skill learning, management of secondary sequelae, and education to optimize physical activity and reduce falls. The emphasis of this review is on gait specifically, although balance and falls are of direct importance to gait and are addressed in that context. Although the researchers who have provided the evidence for these approaches grounded their studies on different theoretical paradigms, each approach is argued to have a valid place in the comprehensive management of PD generally and of gait in particular. The optimal mix of interventions for each individual varies according to the stage of disease progression and the patient's preferred form of exercise, capacity for learning, and age.",

    "abstract": "To assess the impact of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on the sweating function in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).\nNineteen patients with idiopathic PD (mean age+/-SD, 61.58+/-9.47) were examined immediately before and 6 months after DBS. Each examination session included registration of autonomic symptoms by means of a semi-structural questionnaire and recording of sympathetic skin response (SSR) from both palms and one sole. The neurophysiological measurements were compared to those of 19 matched for sex and age healthy controls.\nSix months post-DBS motor improvement was amounted to 65.9% and the daily levodopa equivalent dose was decreased by 36.4%. Post-operatively, dyshidrosis manifestations were reduced by 66.7% (pre-DBS sudomotor dysfunction in 47.4% of patients and sudomotor fluctuation in 57.1% of the above patients). There were no significant differences in-between pre- and post-DBS results of SSR study. However, the number of patients with at least one abnormal SSR pre-operative was reduced from 6 to 3 post-operative. No correlation was found between this neurophysiological finding and the change of clinical symptoms of hyperhidrosis or the DBS motor improvement.\nThese results, although based on a small sample, suggest that STN DBS, in addition to the effect to the mobility, might also favorably regulate sweat in idiopathic PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that has a major impact on health and longevity in Eastern countries. Studies investigating health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Eastern European and Asian countries are scarce. The objective of this cross-sectional survey was to assess HRQoL in Russian patients with PD and identify its social and clinical determinants. The study included 100 outpatients with idiopathic PD and 100 controls. Patients were consecutively recruited from the neurological department of the Russian Medical State University in Moscow between October 2004 and December 2005. Regional healthy controls were matched for age and sex. The evaluation of HRQoL was performed using the EuroQol instrument (EQ-5D and EQ VAS). Disease severity was assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Multivariate regression analyses were used to identify independent determinants of HRQoL. HRQoL was more notably decreased in PD patients than in controls (98% versus 74% of individuals with moderate or severe problems in at least one dimension of the EQ-5D (p < 0.001), respectively). As compared to patients, the controls reported a higher mean EQ VAS score (74.0 +/- 16.0 versus 47.7 +/- 16.7, p < 0.001). Social and clinical determinants of HRQoL were age, disease severity, dystonia, depression, dementia and social support. While the HRQoL of patients with PD in Western countries is predominately affected by clinical parameters, social factors play an important role in Eastern countries. Our data should be considered in the development of national healthcare programs that seek to provide better social services support for patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD), a three-phase study was conducted.\nIn phase 1, standardized interviews were performed in a random sample of elderly aged 65 years or older using a questionnaire. In phase 2, neurological examinations were performed to clinically diagnose PD. In phase 3, dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging was performed to support the clinical diagnosis. After the three-phase study, longitudinal clinical observation was performed.\nA total of 714 subjects participated in the phase-1. Two hundred and twenty-two subjects, scored more than two points, were referred to the movement disorder specialist. Eighteen of these subjects showed overt or equivocal parkinsonian features. Three subjects were clinically diagnosed with possible PD: five with essential tremor with equivocal extrapyramidal signs, eight with frontal-subcortical gait disorder and two with drug-induced parkinsonism. The three subjects with possible PD showed a typical PD pattern of reduced DAT density. DAT density was normal in the other 15 subjects. Results of long-term follow-up supported the diagnoses. The crude prevalence of PD was 0\u00b742 per 100 persons.\nDuring the clinical evaluation, we encountered a very large proportion of subjects with equivocal parkinsonian features, who posed a diagnostic challenge and a substantial risk of misestimating the prevalence of PD. The combination of DAT imaging and longitudinal clinical observation of equivocal cases enabled us to differentiate PD from other conditions. We suspect that the variation in estimates of the prevalence of PD may be attributable to a considerable proportion of subjects with equivocal parkinsonian features and how they are evaluated.",

Eighteen of these subjects showed overt or equivocal parkinsonian features. Three subjects were clinically diagnosed with possible PD: five with essential tremor with equivocal extrapyramidal signs, eight with frontal-subcortical gait disorder and two with drug-induced parkinsonism. The three subjects with possible PD showed a typical PD pattern of reduced DAT density. DAT density was normal in the other 15 subjects. Results of long-term follow-up supported the diagnoses. The crude prevalence of PD was 0\u00b742 per 100 persons.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of central nervous system (CNS) that impaired the patient motor skills, speech and other functions. Adenosine A2A receptors have a unique cellular distribution in the neuron, which is used as a potential target for PD. Homology modeling was used to construct the 3-D structure of A2A using the known template (PDB: 2VT4), and the stereochemical quality was validated. Several effective antagonist drugs were selected and active amino acid residues in A2A were targeted on the basis of robust binding affinity between protein-drug interactions in molecular docking. Six antagonists, Bromocriptine, Cabergoline, Etilevodopa, Lysuride, Melevodopa and Pramipexole, were found more potent for binding and the active amino acids residues were identified (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/) in A2A receptor. It could be used as the basis for rationale designing of novel antagonist drugs against Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Depositions of proteins in form of amyloid and non-amyloid plaques are common pathogenic signs of more than 20 degenerative diseases affecting the central nervous system or a variety of peripheral tissues. Among the neuropathological conditions, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and the prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), present ambiguities as regarding their differential diagnosis. At present, their diagnosis must be confirmed by post-mortem examination of the brain. Currently the ante-mortem diagnosis is still based on the integration of multiple data (clinical, paraclinical and biological analyses) because no unique marker exists for such diseases. The detection of specific biomarkers would be useful to develop a differential diagnostic, distinguishing not only different neurodegenerative diseases but also the disease from the non-pathological effects of aging. Several neurodegenerative biomarkers are present at very low levels during the early stages of the disease development and their ultra-low detection is needed for early diagnosis, which should permit more effective therapeutic interventions, before the disease concerned can progress to a stage where considerable damage to the brain has already occurred. In the case of prion diseases, there are concerns regarding not only patient care, but the wider community too, with regard to the risk of transmission of prions, especially during blood transfusion, for which, four cases of variant CJD infection associated with transfusion of non-leukocyte-depleted blood components have been confirmed. Therefore the development of techniques with high sensitivity and specificity represent the major challenge in the field of the protein misfolding diseases. In this paper we review the current analytical and/or biochemical diagnostic technologies used mainly in prion, but also in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases and emphasizing work on the protein detection as a surrogates and specific biomarker in the body fluid of patients (urine, CSF and blood). This review highlights the urgency of the development of early and sensitive diagnostics in terms of therapeutic challenge.",

    "abstract": "A 2 x 8 button-press task is a sequential hand movement task in which subjects are required to press eight pairs of buttons as accurately and quickly as possible. The 2 x 8 task allows us to examine flexible sequential learning, more aptly called sequence-unselective learning. Sequence-unselective learning is observed after repeated experiences with the task, when subjects have shown good progress in learning, with new sequences as well as previously learned ones. Although cognitive inflexibility has been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), there have been few studies investigating their flexibility in sequential learning. We examined PD patients' ability for sequence-unselective learning through the use of a 2 x 8 button-press task. In the first session, PD patients and subjects from the control group performed a sequential 2 x 8 task until the learning criterion was fulfilled (Session 1). After 1 month, they participated in other sessions: one involving the learned sequence (Session 2) and another involving the new sequence (Session 3). We found that PD patients made more errors than the normal control subjects only when learning the new sequence (Session 3) (P < 0.01). In Session 3, control subjects reached the learning target with fewer errors than in the Session 1 (normal sequence-unselective learning), whereas the PD patients did not exhibit such an improvement. Our results revealed a sequence-unselective deficit in PD patients. The deficit may help to emphasize the cognitive and physical inflexibility of PD.",

    "abstract": "We studied the time course and nature of interactions between the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the motor cortex in 8 Parkinson disease (PD) patients with chronically implanted STN deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes. We first identified the cortical evoked potentials following STN stimulation. The most consistent potential was positive wave with peak latency of 22.2 +/- 1.2 ms from stimulation of clinically effective contacts. We then stimulated the motor cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at 2-15 ms and at the latency of the evoked potential ( approximately 23 ms) following STN DBS. TMS induced currents in 3 directions: lateral-medial (LM) direction activated corticospinal axons directly, posterior-anterior (PA), and anterior-posterior (AP) directions activated corticospinal neurons transynaptically. Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) elicited by AP and PA TMS were facilitated at short (2-4 ms) and medium latencies (21-24 ms). However, MEPs elicited by LM TMS were not modified by STN DBS. Short-latency antidromic stimulation of the corticosubthalamic projections and medium latency transmission likely through the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit led to cortical evoked potentials and increased motor cortex excitability at specific intervals following STN stimulation at clinically effective contacts. Cortical activation may be related to the clinical effects of STN DBS in PD.",

    "abstract": "The capacity to learn new motor sequences is fundamental to adaptive motor behavior. The early phase of motor sequence learning relies on the ventral and anterior striatal circuitry, whereas the late phase relies on the dorsal and posterior striatal circuitry. Early Parkinson's disease (PD) is mainly characterized by dopaminergic denervation of the dorsal and posterior striatum while sparing anterior and ventral regions. Dopaminergic medication improves dorsal and posterior striatum function by compensating for the loss of dopamine. However, previous work has shown that dopaminergic medication interferes with the ventral and anterior striatum function by overdosing this relatively intact structure in early-state PD. Here we test whether these effects are also observed over the time course of motor sequence learning. Fourteen PD patients ON and OFF dopaminergic medications and 11 healthy age-matched control participants performed an explicit motor sequence learning task. When sequence learning was compared across different learning phases in patients ON and OFF medication, a significant impairment associated with medication was observed in the early relative to later phases of learning. The rate of learning in the early phase measured trial by trial in patients ON medication was significantly slower than that in controls and when patients were OFF medication. No significant impairment was found in the later learning phases. These results demonstrate that dopaminergic medications may selectively impair early-phase motor sequence learning. These results extend and generalize the dopamine overdose effects previously reported for (antero)ventral striatum-mediated cognitive tasks to motor sequence learning.",

    "abstract": "To assess road safety and its predictors in drivers with Parkinson disease (PD).\nLicensed, active drivers with PD (n = 84; age = 67.3 +/- 7.8, median Hoehn & Yahr stage II) and controls (n = 182; age = 67.6 +/- 7.5) underwent cognitive, visual, and motor tests, and drove a standardized route in urban and rural settings in an instrumented vehicle. Safety errors were judged and documented by a driving expert based on video data review.\nDrivers with PD committed more total safety errors compared to controls (41.6 +/- 14.6 vs 32.9 +/- 12.3, p < 0.0001); 77.4% of drivers with PD committed more errors than the median total error count of the controls (medians: PD = 39.5, controls = 31.0). Lane violations were the most common error category in both groups. Group differences in some error categories became insignificant after results were adjusted for demographics and familiarity with the local driving environment. The PD group performed worse on tests of motor, cognitive, and visual abilities. Within the PD group, older age and worse performances on tests of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, attention, visuospatial abilities, visual memory, and general cognition predicted error counts. Measures of visual processing speed and attention and far visual acuity were jointly predictive of error counts in a multivariate model.\nOverall, drivers with Parkinson disease (PD) had poorer road safety compared to controls, but there was considerable variability among the drivers with PD, and some performed normally. Familiarity with the driving environment was a mitigating factor against unsafe driving in PD. Impairments in visual perception and cognition were associated with road safety errors in drivers with PD.",

    "results": "Drivers with PD committed more total safety errors compared to controls (41.6 +/- 14.6 vs 32.9 +/- 12.3, p < 0.0001); 77.4% of drivers with PD committed more errors than the median total error count of the controls (medians: PD = 39.5, controls = 31.0). Lane violations were the most common error category in both groups. Group differences in some error categories became insignificant after results were adjusted for demographics and familiarity with the local driving environment. The PD group performed worse on tests of motor, cognitive, and visual abilities. Within the PD group, older age and worse performances on tests of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, attention, visuospatial abilities, visual memory, and general cognition predicted error counts. Measures of visual processing speed and attention and far visual acuity were jointly predictive of error counts in a multivariate model.",

    "abstract": "To survey the point prevalence of impulse control and repetitive behavior disorders (ICRBs) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and to determine the relationship between PD medication dose and the risk of ICRBs.\nA multicenter cross-sectional survey was applied to consecutive patients with PD over a 3-month period. The presence of ICRBs was screened using a modified version of the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview that comprised five ICRB modules: compulsive buying, gambling, sexual behavior, eating, and punding. Data regarding the patients' clinical features and concurrent anti-PD drugs were also collected during the interview. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of the daily doses of dopamine agonist and L-dopa for the development of an ICRB were calculated after adjustment for clinical variables.\nAmong the 1167 patients recruited, 118 (10.1%) exhibited ICRBs. Punding was the most common ICRB (4.2%), followed by compulsive eating (3.4%), sexual behaviors (2.8%), buying (2.5%), and gambling (1.3%). Two or more ICRBs were present concomitantly in 34 of these 118 patients (28.8%). There were dose-response relationships between the dopamine agonist dose and the ORs for compulsive buying, gambling and sexual behaviors. On the other hand, the OR for punding was positively correlated with the dose of L-dopa. The OR for compulsive eating was not associated with the dose of dopamine agonist or L-dopa.\nThe dose of dopaminergic medication is significantly associated with the development of ICRB, except compulsive eating, in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting voluntary motor control. However, little is known about the experience of voluntary action in PD patients. A key component of action experience is the feeling of controlling one's own actions, and through them, external events. In healthy individuals this sense of agency (SoA) is associated with a subjective compression of time, such that actions and their effects are perceived as bound together across time. This action-effect binding provides an indirect measure of SoA. Nine PD patients and age-matched controls judged the time of voluntary actions and of an auditory effect (a tone) of the action. The pattern of results resembled previous studies, with the perceived time of actions showing a shift towards the subsequent tone, relative to a baseline condition involving actions without tones. Similarly, the perceived times of tones showed a shift towards the preceding action that caused the tone, relative to a baseline condition involving tones only. The patients were tested both on and off dopaminergic medication. PD patients off medication showed no significant change in action-effect binding relative to controls. Conversely, PD patients on medication showed a significant increase in action-effect binding relative to their own performance off medication. Increased availability of dopamine strengthened the experience of association between actions and external events, enhancing the sense of agency. These results shed light on the contribution of dopamine to the experience of instrumental action, and also on impulse control disorders and psychosis in medicated PD patients.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) was studied over a 3-year period (2002-2004) in the district of Plovdiv, Bulgaria with a mean population of 713,090. Of 663 possible cases, 244 patients diagnosed with PD were included in the study. The diagnosis PD was based on UK PD Society Brain Bank Criteria. The average crude incidence rate of PD was 11.44/ 100,000 person-years. After age adjustment to the general Bulgarian population, incidence was 11.65/100,000: 17.46 for men; 7.24 for women; 12.97 for the urban group and 9.55 for the rural group. Age-specific incidence was 0.67/100,000 in the age range 40-44, reached a maximum of 112.73/100,000 for males and 52.58/100,000 for females in the age range 75-79 years and declined in the elderly. The present study estimates the incidence of PD in Bulgaria, which is similar to that in other European countries. The incidence rate in the Bulgarian population is twofold higher in men compared to women and slightly higher in the urban population compared with the rural population.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical correlates of apathy and depression in Parkinson disease (PD), and to clarify whether apathy can be dissociated from depression. One hundred fifty patients with PD completed the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II), Starkstein's Apathy Scale (AS), and a quality of life (QOL) battery. Hoehn and Yahr (HY) staging, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were performed on the same day. Apathy (AS score > or = 16) was diagnosed in 60% of patients and depression (BDI-II score > or = 14) in 56%. Apathy coexisted with depression in 43% of patients, compared with depression without apathy in 13% and apathy without depression in 17%. Apathy scale score was significantly correlated with UPDRS scores, HY stage, and age, whereas BDI-II score was correlated only with UPDRS scores. Both AS and BDI-II scores were negatively correlated with QOL. However, multiple regression analysis revealed that depression was strongly and negatively associated with emotional well-being and communication, whereas apathy was mainly associated with cognition and stigma. These findings suggest that apathy and depression may be separable in PD, although both are common in patients with PD and are associated with QOL.",

This paper is the second part of a review of the current state of the art concerning HRQL in PD and focuses on its main determining and associated factors.\nA total of 56 studies are reviewed and the determining factors are grouped according to different variables, which may be disease-related (including motor and non-motor symptoms), sociodemographic (level of schooling, economic factors, gender and others), psychological and related to mental status (depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, physician-patient relationship and others), and disability. The following characteristics of the studies were taken into account: the type of design (longitudinal or cross-sectional), the instrument used for measuring the HRQL (generic or specific), the statistical method employed (univariate or multivariate) and the sample size.\nMost of the studies are cross-sectional and the majority use the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire as a measure of HRQL with multivariate data analysis. The three most important factors determining HRQL in PD are depression, the stage of the disease and the time elapsed since onset of the disease. Nevertheless, the preferred methodology does not allow for causal inferences, due to the scarcity of longitudinal studies.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are often impaired when performing motor acts and in the acquisition of new motor skills. However, the role of dopamine in developing plans for skill acquisition is unclear. To assess the role of dopamine on the planning of actions, we tested 12 PD and 12 matched normal participants on two skill acquisition tasks matched for motor demands, but varying in requirements for planning. The participants with PD were tested on these tasks when they were on and off dopaminergic medications. To minimize influence of movement related deficits, the subjects used a computer track-pointer that generated the required straight lines when the subjects applied a slight force and clicked the track-pointer to initiate and terminate each line segment. The amount of time the track-pointer was deflected determined the line lengths, while clicking of the mouse determined the location of the line. The simple figure replication task only required the subjects to repeatedly generate lines of two sizes, while the complex figure replication task required subjects to generate lines of different sizes. Thus, this complex task demanded more anticipatory planning. Compared to controls, the subjects with PD were slower to learn the programs needed to produce these figures and produced figures with reduced amplitudes on both the simple and complex tasks. Dopamine treatment, however, only improved the speed of figure completion on the complex task, suggesting that dopamine is important in action planning.",

    "abstract": "Genomic rearrangements (exon dosage) are common mutations reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of genomic rearrangements in 88 South African patients with predominantly early-onset PD (age-at-onset <or=50 years). The multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method was used to detect exon dosage changes. Two commercially available probe kits, SALSA P051 and P052, were used and together the kits consisted of probes for exons of alpha-synuclein, parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, LRRK2, UCH-L1, ATP13A2, LPA, TNFRSF9, CAV2, CAV1, GCH1, and two-point mutations. We identified exonic rearrangements in parkin and alpha-synuclein in 8% of South African patients from different ethnic groups. One patient had a whole-gene triplication of alpha-synuclein; representing only the fourth family with this mutation reported to date. We found six patients with parkin mutations who had either heterozygous duplications and deletions, or homozygous deletions. A false positive result of an exonic deletion detected in one patient turned out to be homozygous point mutation (Y258X) in PINK1. No exonic rearrangements were found in four of the PD genes; LRRK2, PINK1, DJ-1, and ATP13A2. Mutations in parkin were the predominant genetic cause; however, the frequency of exon dosage in our study group is low compared with previous studies. This indicates the possible involvement of other as yet unidentified PD genes in the development of the disease in the South African population.",

    "abstract": "The study objective was to assess the efficacy, safety and feasibility of switching from levodopa/benserazide (LB) or levodopa/carbidopa (LC) to levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (LCE) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with wearing-off. This was a multicenter, open-label, 6-week study; the primary outcome was success rate based on the patient-assessed Clinical Global Impression of Change (P-CGI-C). Secondary outcomes included investigator-assessed CGI-C (I-CGI-C), change from baseline in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), motor/non-motor wearing-off symptoms and quality of life-visual analog scale (QoL-VAS). After switching to LCE, 77% of patients reported an 'improvement' (p < 0.0001 vs. patients reporting 'no change or worsening'). Significant improvements were seen in I-CGI-C, UPDRS and QoL-VAS, regardless of prior therapy. Oral levodopa dosing was increased in 28% of patients; the primary outcome remained significant when these patients were excluded. The data suggest that switching from LB/LC to LCE provided a significant benefit in PD patients with wearing-off.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is often associated with substantial impairment of speech respiratory and phonatory control. However, the degree to which these impairments are related to abnormal laryngeal sensory function is unknown. This study examined whether individuals with PD exhibited abnormal and more asymmetric laryngeal somatosensory function compared with healthy controls, and whether these deficits were associated with disease and voice severity. Nineteen PD participants were tested and compared with 18 healthy controls. Testing included endoscopic assessment of laryngeal somatosensory function, with aerodynamic and acoustic assessment of respiratory and phonatory control, and clinical ratings of voice and disease severity. PD participants exhibited significantly abnormal and asymmetric laryngeal somatosensory function compared with healthy controls. Sensory deficits were significantly associated with timing of phonatory onset, voice intensity, respiratory driving pressure, laryngeal resistance, lung volume expended per syllable, disease severity, and voice severity. These results suggest that respiratory and phonatory control are influenced by laryngeal somatosensory function, that speech-related deficits in PD are related to abnormal laryngeal somatosensory function, and that this function may degrade as a function of disease severity. Thus, PD may represent a model of airway sensorimotor disintegration, highlighting the important role of the basal ganglia and related neural networks in the integration of laryngeal sensory input for speech-related motor control.",

    "abstract": "While the beneficial effect of levodopa on motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been well documented, its effect on speech has rarely been examined and the respective literature is inconclusive. The aim of our study was to analyze the effect of short-term levodopa admission and long-term dopaminergic treatment on speech in PD patients in early stages of the disease. Motor examination according to UPDRS III and speech testing were performed in 23 PD patients (9 males; median age 68, 42-78 years) in the early morning after having abstained from dopaminergic medication overnight (\"off\" state, t0) after administration of 200 mg of soluble levodopa (t1), and at follow-up after 12-14 weeks under stable dopaminergic medication (t2). Speech examination comprised the perceptual rating of global speech performance and an acoustical analysis based upon a standardized reading task. While UPDRS III showed a significant amelioration after L: -dopa application, none of the parameters of phonation, intonation, articulation and speech velocity improved significantly in the \"on\" state, neither under short-term levodopa administration (t1) nor on stable dopaminergic treatment (t2). However, there was a positive effect of dopaminergic stimulation on vowel articulation in individual patients. Results indicated significant beneficial effect of short-term levodopa administration or long-term dopaminergic medication on different dimensions of speech in PD patients. As some improvement of vowel articulation was seen in individual patients, the pre-existing pattern of speech impairment might be responsible for the different response to pharmacological treatment.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in mitochondrial homeostasis have been implicated in the etiology of Parkinson disease (PD) as demonstrated by human tissue studies, cell culture and in vivo genetic and toxin models. Mutations in the genes encoding PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), Omi/HtrA2 and parkin contribute to rare forms of parkinsonian neurodegeneration. Recently, each of these proteins has been shown to play a normal role in regulating mitochondrial structure, function, fission-fusion dynamics, or turnover (autophagy and biogenesis), promoting neuronal survival. Here, we review the biochemical mechanisms of mitochondrial protection conferred by each of these PD associated gene products in neurons, neuronal cell lines and other cell types. Potential molecular interactions and mitoprotective signaling pathways involving these three PD associated gene products are discussed in the context of mitochondrial quality control, in response to increasing levels of mitochondrial damage. We propose that PINK1, Omi/HtrA2 and parkin participate at different levels in mitochondrial quality control, converging through some overlapping and some distinct steps to maintain a common phenotype of healthy mitochondrial networks.",

    "abstract": "About 50% of the patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from freezing of gait (FOG), which is a sudden and transient inability to walk. It often causes falls, interferes with daily activities and significantly impairs quality of life. Because gait deficits in PD patients are often resistant to pharmacologic treatment, effective non-pharmacologic treatments are of special interest.\nThe goal of our study is to evaluate the concept of a wearable device that can obtain real-time gait data, processes them and provides assistance based on pre-determined specifications.\nWe developed a real-time wearable FOG detection system that automatically provides a cueing sound when FOG is detected and which stays until the subject resumes walking. We evaluated our wearable assistive technology in a study with 10 PD patients. Over eight hours of data was recorded and a questionnaire was filled out by each patient.\nTwo hundred and thirty-seven FOG events have been identified by professional physiotherapists in a post-hoc video analysis. The device detected the FOG events online with a sensitivity of 73.1% and a specificity of 81.6% on a 0.5 sec frame-based evaluation.\nWith this study we show that online assistive feedback for PD patients is possible. We present and discuss the patients' and physiotherapists' perspectives on wearability and performance of the wearable assistant as well as their gait performance when using the assistant and point out the next research steps. Our results demonstrate the benefit of such a context-aware system and motivate further studies.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the dysfunction of dopaminergic dependent cortico-basal ganglia loops and diagnosed on the basis of motor symptoms (tremors and/or rigidity and bradykinesia). Post-mortem studies tend to show that the destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra constitutes an intermediate step in a broader neurodegenerative process rather than a unique feature of Parkinson's disease, as a consistent pattern of progression would exist, originating from the medulla oblongata/pontine tegmentum. To date, neuroimaging techniques have been unable to characterize the pre-symptomatic stages of PD. However, if such a regular neurodegenerative pattern were to exist, consistent damages would be found in the brain stem, even at early stages of the disease. We recruited 23 PD patients at Hoenn and Yahr stages I to II of the disease and 18 healthy controls (HC) matched for age. T1-weighted anatomical scans were acquired (MPRAGE, 1 mm3 resolution) and analyzed using an optimized VBM protocol to detect white and grey matter volume reduction without spatial a priori. When the HC group was compared to the PD group, a single cluster exhibited statistical difference (p<0.05 corrected for false detection rate, 4287 mm3) in the brain stem, between the pons and the medulla oblongata. The present study provides in-vivo evidence that brain stem damage may be the first identifiable stage of PD neuropathology, and that the identification of this consistent damage along with other factors could help with earlier diagnosis in the future. This damage could also explain some non-motor symptoms in PD that often precede diagnosis, such as autonomic dysfunction and sleep disorders.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the influence of gait disorders (GD) on quality of life (QOL) in Parkinson's disease (PD). In a survey including the PDQ-39 and a new 8-item questionnaire of GD (8-QGD), 491 PD patients estimated their gait at the worst state, the effect of their GD on activities of daily living, compared the severity of GD with the other PD symptoms, evaluated the occurrence of freezing of gait (FOG), levodopa-resistant FOG, falls, activity limitation due to fear of falling (FOF), and the occurrence of injuries. Significant differences in PDQ-39 scores were found between three groups of patients divided with respect to the severity of GD. Linear multiple regression analysis showed that FOF had the highest impact on PDQ-39 scores (r=0.32, p<0.001). These results confirm that GD have a substantial impact upon the QOL in PD and suggest that FOF plays a major role in QOL deterioration.",

    "abstract": "We have previously reported the results of a 1-y double-blind, placebo-controlled study of embryonic dopamine cell implantation for Parkinson's disease. At the end of the blinded phase, we found a significant increase in putamen uptake on (18)F-fluorodopa ((18)F-FDOPA) PET reflecting the viability of the grafts. Nonetheless, clinical improvement was significant only in younger (age < or = 60 y) transplant recipients, as indicated by a reduction in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores.\nWe now report long-term clinical and PET outcomes from 33 of the original trial participants who were followed for 2 y after transplantation and 15 of these subjects who were followed for 2 additional years. Longitudinal changes in UPDRS motor ratings and caudate and putamen (18)F-FDOPA uptake were assessed with repeated-measures ANOVA. Relationships between these changes over time were evaluated by the analysis of within-subject correlations.\nWe found that UPDRS motor ratings declined over time after transplantation (P < 0.001). Clinical improvement at 1 y was relatively better for the younger transplant recipients and for men, but these age and sex differences were not evident at longer-term follow-up. Significant increases in putamen (18)F-FDOPA uptake were evident at all posttransplantation time points (P < 0.001) and were not influenced by either age or sex. Posttransplantation changes in putamen PET signal and clinical outcome were significantly intercorrelated (P < 0.02) over the course of the study. Image analysis at the voxel level revealed significant bilateral increases in (18)F-FDOPA uptake at 1 y (P < 0.001) in the posterior putamen engraftment sites. PET signal in this region increased further at 2 and 4 y after engraftment. Concurrently, this analysis disclosed progressive declines in radiotracer uptake in the nonengrafted caudate and ventrorostral putamen. Clinical improvement after transplantation correlated with the retention of PET signal in this region at the preoperative baseline.\nThese results suggest that clinical benefit and graft viability are sustained up to 4 y after transplantation. Moreover, the dependence of clinical (but not imaging) outcomes on subject age and sex at 1 y may not persist over the long term. Last, the imaging changes reliably correlate with clinical outcome over the entire posttransplantation time course.",

    "abstract": "Partnered tango dance can improve balance and gait in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Partnered dance may allow these individuals to challenge balance more than nonpartnered dance. Alternatively, partnered practice could reduce balance gains because the participant may rely on the partner as a balance aid when challenged. The authors compared the effects of partnered and nonpartnered dance on balance and mobility in 39 people (11 women) with mild-moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages I-III). Participants were randomly assigned to partnered or nonpartnered tango and attended 1-hour classes twice per week, completing 20 lessons within 10 weeks. Balance and gait were evaluated in the weeks immediately before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention. Both groups significantly improved on the Berg Balance Scale, comfortable and fast-as-possible walking velocity, and cadence. Improvements were maintained at the 1-month follow-up. The nonpartnered class improved as much as the partnered class; however, partnered participants expressed more enjoyment and interest in continuing.",

    "abstract": "To determine the motor phenotype of LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers. LRRK2 mutation carriers were previously reported to manifest the tremor dominant motor phenotype, which has been associated with slower motor progression and less cognitive impairment compared with the postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) phenotype.\nCross-sectional observational study.\nThirteen movement disorders centers.\nNine hundred twenty-five early-onset Parkinson disease cases defined as age at onset younger than 51 years.\nLRRK2 mutation status and Parkinson disease motor phenotype: tremor dominant or PIGD. Demographic information, family history of Parkinson disease, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score were collected on all participants. DNA samples were genotyped for LRRK2 mutations (G2019S, I2020T, R1441C, and Y1699C). Logistic regression was used to examine associations of G2019S mutation status with motor phenotype adjusting for disease duration, Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, levodopa dose, and family history of Parkinson disease.\nThirty-four cases (3.7%) (14 previously reported) were G2019S carriers. No other mutations were found. Carriers were more likely to be Ashkenazi Jewish (55.9% vs 11.9%; P < .001) but did not significantly differ in any other demographic or disease characteristics. Carriers had a lower tremor score (P = .03) and were more likely to have a PIGD phenotype (92.3% vs 58.9%; P = .003). The association of the G2019S mutation with PIGD phenotype remained after controlling for disease duration and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (odds ratio, 17.7; P < .001).\nEarly-onset Parkinson disease G2019S LRRK2 carriers are more likely to manifest the PIGD phenotype, which may have implications for disease course.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the validity and feasibility of online delivery of the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT) for the treatment of the speech disorder of a patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The treatment was delivered in 16 sessions to the participant's home, 90 km from the speech language pathologist. A PC-based videoconferencing system was used, operating at 128 kbit/s over the public telecommunications network. The patient achieved substantial improvements in vocal sound pressure levels during sustained vowel phonation (6.13 dB), reading (12.28 dB) and conversational monologue (11.32 dB). There were improvements in the duration of sustained vowel phonation (4 s). Improvements were also perceived in the degree of breathiness and roughness in the voice, and in overall speech intelligibility in conversation. The patient was very satisfied with the audio and video quality of the conferencing, and with the online treatment overall. He reported a preference for online sessions for the future management of his condition, rather than face-to-face treatment. Remote LSVT delivery was found to be feasible and effective.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is a frequent nonmotor symptom in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and may be considered as an early clinical feature of the disease preceding motor symptoms by years. According to recent neuropathological staging concepts, impaired olfaction is assumed to indicate an early pathological process and might be associated with structural changes in the brain. A morphometric analysis of magnetic resonance images [voxel-based morphometry (VBM)] was used to investigate gray matter atrophy related to psychophysically measured scores of olfactory function in early PD patients (n = 15, median Hoehn and Yahr stage 1.5), moderately advanced PD patients (n = 12, median Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.5), and age-matched healthy controls (n = 17). In PD patients, but not in controls, cortical atrophy in olfactory-related brain regions correlated specifically with olfactory dysfunction. Positive correlations between olfactory performance and gray matter volume were observed in the right piriform cortex in early PD patients and in the right amygdala in moderately advanced patients. The results provided first evidence that olfactory dysfunction in PD is related to atrophy in olfactory-eloquent regions of the limbic and paralimbic cortex. In addition, olfactory-correlated atrophy in these brain regions is consistent with the assumption that olfactory impairment as an early symptom of PD is likely to be associated with extranigral pathology.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), it is possible that tonic increase of dopamine associated with levodopa medication overshadows phasic release of dopamine, which is essential for learning. Thus while the motor symptoms of PD are improved with levodopa medication, learning would be disrupted. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of levodopa medication on learning on the weather prediction task (WPT), which involves probabilistic classification learning. 11 PD patients and 13 matched controls completed 200 trials of the WPT, with the patients either on or off their usual levodopa medication. Consistent with prior studies, when PD patients were assessed on medication, overall WPT performance was significantly worse than controls. However, when these patients were studied following withdrawal from medication, overall performance was equivalent to controls, and significantly better than when on medication. The significant deterioration of learning on the WPT in PD patients when on compared to off medication supports the proposal that tonic increase of dopamine with dopaminergic medication masks phasic changes in dopamine release essential for learning. These results highlight the need for careful 'titration' of dopaminergic medication to produce the desired improvement of the motor symptoms without the associated detrimental effects on cognition and learning.",

    "abstract": "The observation of a voluntary movement executed by another person is associated with an alpha and beta EEG desynchronization over the motor cortex, thought to reflect activity from the human \"mirror neuron\" system. The aim of our work was to study the changes in local field potentials (LFP) recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and their relationship with cortical activity, during movement observation.\nBilateral EEG and STN LFP recordings were acquired in 18 patients with Parkinson's disease, through surgically implanted electrodes for deep brain stimulation. Oscillatory changes during movement execution and movement observation were compared with two different control conditions (simple stimulus and rotating stimulus observation), in \"off\" and \"on\" motor states. Time-frequency transforms and event-related coherence were used for the analysis.\nMovement observation was accompanied by bilateral beta reduction in subthalamic power and cortico-STN coherence, which was smaller than the decrease observed during movement execution, but significant when compared with the two control conditions.\nMovement observation is accompanied by changes in the beta oscillatory activity of the STN, similar to those observed in the EEG.\nThese changes suggest that the basal ganglia might be engaged by the activity of the human mirror system.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by extensive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system. Neurochemical and neuropathological analyses clearly indicate that oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are major mechanisms of dopaminergic degeneration. Evidence from experimental models and postmortem PD brain tissues demonstrates that apoptotic cell death is the common final pathway responsible for selective and irreversible loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Epidemiological studies imply both environmental neurotoxicants and genetic predisposition are risk factors for PD, though the cellular mechanisms underlying selective dopaminergic degeneration remain unclear. Recent progress in signal transduction research is beginning to unravel the complex mechanisms governing dopaminergic degeneration. During the 12th International Neurotoxicology meeting, discussion at one symposium focused on several key signaling pathways of dopaminergic degeneration. This review summarizes two novel signaling pathways of nigral dopaminergic degeneration that have been elucidated using neurotoxicity models of PD. Dr. Anumantha Kanthasamy described a cell death pathway involving the novel protein kinase C delta isoform (PKCdelta) in oxidative stress-induced apoptotic cell death in experimental models of PD. Dr. Ajay Rana presented his recent work on the role of mixed lineage kinase-3 (MLK3) in neuroinflammatory processes in neurotoxic cell death. Collectively, PKCdelta and MLK3 signaling pathways provide new understanding of neurodegenerative processes in PD, and further exploration of these pathways may translate into effective neuroprotective drugs for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "The recognition of facial emotions is impaired following subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD). These changes have been linked to a disturbance in the STN's limbic territory, which is thought to be involved in emotional processing. This was confirmed by a recent PET study where these emotional modifications were correlated with changes in glucose metabolism in different brain regions, including the amygdala and the orbitofrontal regions that are well known for their involvement in emotional processing. Nevertheless, the question as to whether these emotional changes induced by STN DBS in PD are modality-specific has yet to be answered. The objective of this study was therefore to examine the effects of STN DBS in PD on the recognition of emotional prosody. An original emotional prosody paradigm was administered to twenty-one post-operative PD patients, twenty-one pre-operative PD patients and twenty-one matched controls. Results showed that both the pre- and post-operative groups differed from the healthy controls. There was also a significant difference between the pre and post groups. More specifically, an analysis of their continuous judgments revealed that the performance of the post-operative group compared with that of the other two groups was characterized by a systematic emotional bias whereby they perceived emotions more strongly. These results suggest that the impaired recognition of emotions may not be specific to the visual modality but may also be present when emotions are expressed through the human voice, implying the involvement of the STN in the brain network underlying the recognition of emotional prosody.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to quantify gait termination in people with Parkinson (PwP) as the basis for understanding the underlying pathophysiology of stopping difficulties. Fourteen PwP and 14 age- and gender-matched comparisons completed five trials each of four walking tasks: preferred walk, preferred walk with secondary motor task, coming to a planned stop, and planned stop with a secondary motor task. Spatio-temporal data of walks were compared to steady state walking in stopping trials. Results showed that PwP walked with shorter step length, slower speed, yet similar cadence to comparisons. Both groups decreased step length and step speed when performing a secondary task. Neither group showed changes of gait characteristics in steady state walking prior to stopping. For stopping trials, the number of steps, time, and distance taken to stop were compared for PwP and controls. In planned stops PwP used more steps and took a longer time to stop, but both groups stopped within a similar distance. A secondary motor task did not alter stopping distance or number of steps to stop, but stopping time increased in the comparisons. The results indicate that central control mechanisms regulating planned stopping appear to be intact in people with mild to moderate Parkinson.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in GBA gene have been reported to be in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) from different ethnic populations, including Taiwanese Chinese. To explore whether mutation in GBA is also associated with PD in Mainland China, we have now a case control study. The occurrence of the GBA L444P mutation was analyzed in an independent cohort of PD patients and controls from Mainland China. This mutation was present in 20/616 (3.2%) of PD compared with 1/411 (0.2%) of controls (odds ratio, OR=13.76, 95% Confidence interval, CI: 1.84-102.92, p=0.001). All carriers harbored the heterozygous genotype. In a subset analysis, the frequency of this mutation was higher both in early onset (EOPD) and late onset PD (LOPD) than in controls. However, no difference in clinical characteristics, such as gender, age at onset, onset symptoms, Hoehn-Yahr stage and UPDRS, was found between L444P carriers and non-carriers. In addition, we also explored the potential relationship between GBA L444P mutation and LRRK2 G2385R and R1628P variants in patients with PD. But no association was found, either. In conclusion, our data suggest that the GBA L444P mutation plays an important role in the development of PD also in Han-Chinese patients from Mainland China.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic deficiency may affect Parkinson's disease patients (PD) in the central as well as the peripheral tissues. In the retina, the neuromodulatory role of the dopaminergic Interplexiform cell layer (IP) plays a major role in the retinal light adaptation and may account for the duration of the negative afterimage. Here we present results showing a significant reduction of negative afterimage duration in PD patients. This supports the hypothesis that the retinal dopaminergic system may be the main cause for the long duration of negative afterimage. We suggest that the observed reduction of afterimage duration is due to possible dopaminergic deficiency in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "(1) To present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with Parkinson's disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in Parkinson's disease.\nWe report a 73-year-old Parkinson's disease patient who developed acute stridor due to prolonged laryngospasm triggered by overspill of excessive secretions. The literature was reviewed, following a Medline search using the keywords 'Parkinson's disease' and 'stridor' or 'airway obstruction' or 'laryngospasm' or 'laryngeal dystonia' or 'bilateral vocal cord palsy'.\nOnly 12 previously reported cases of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients were identified. Causes included bilateral vocal fold palsy (eight cases), laryngospasm (five), and dystonia of the jaw and neck muscles (two). The mechanism of laryngospasm in our patient was similar to 'dry drowning', and has not previously been described.\nLaryngospasm can be triggered in Parkinson's disease by excessive secretions entering the larynx. The mechanism is similar to 'dry drowning'. Treatment focuses on reducing secretions. The use of botulinum toxin to reduce spasm is inappropriate in this situation. This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients, as this affects management.",

    "conclusions": "Laryngospasm can be triggered in Parkinson's disease by excessive secretions entering the larynx. The mechanism is similar to 'dry drowning'. Treatment focuses on reducing secretions. The use of botulinum toxin to reduce spasm is inappropriate in this situation. This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients, as this affects management.",

    "abstract": "Executive function impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) are well documented. However, uncertainties remain regarding the impact of these deficits on other areas of cognitive functioning. The goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive assessment of cognitive characteristics in patients with PD without dementia and to assess how any such deficits affected other areas of cognitive functioning. Forty PD patients without dementia were compared to healthy controls using measures of attention and speed of processing and a comprehensive set of executive function tests including working memory, planning, and problem solving. Measures of memory/learning and visuospatial skills were also included to examine the relationship between aspects of executive function and other areas of cognition. Patients with PD showed deficits on measures of executive function, problem solving, and visuospatial skills. However, they were unimpaired on measures of planning, attention, and memory/learning. Deficits in problem solving were only evident for tasks with a high visuospatial content and were no longer significant when visuospatial skills were controlled for. While deficits in executive function and visuospatial skills were apparent for PD patients compared to controls, many aspects of cognition remained intact. These can provide a focus for cognitive intervention strategies that can be effective in delaying decline for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "To study the neurocognitive profile and its relationship to prefrontal dysfunction in non-demented Parkinson's disease (PD) with deficient haptic perception.\nTwelve right-handed patients with PD and 12 healthy control subjects underwent thorough neuropsychological testing including Rey complex figure, Rey auditory verbal and figural learning test, figural and verbal fluency, and Stroop test. Test scores reflecting significant differences between patients and healthy subjects were correlated with the individual expression coefficients of one principal component, obtained in a principal component analysis of an oxygen-15-labeled water PET study exploring somatosensory discrimination that differentiated between the two groups and involved prefrontal cortices.\nWe found significantly decreased total scores for the verbal learning trials and verbal delayed free recall in PD patients compared with normal volunteers. Further analysis of these parameters using Spearman's ranking correlation showed a significantly negative correlation of deficient verbal recall with expression coefficients of the principal component whose image showed a subcortical-cortical network, including right dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex, in PD patients.\nPD patients with disrupted right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex function and associated diminished somatosensory discrimination are impaired also in verbal memory functions. A negative correlation between delayed verbal free recall and PET activation in a network including the prefrontal cortices suggests that verbal cues and accordingly declarative memory processes may be operative in PD during activities that demand sustained attention such as somatosensory discrimination. Verbal cues may be compensatory in nature and help to non-specifically enhance focused attention in the presence of a functionally disrupted prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral midbrain (vMB) and results in severely disturbed regulation of movement. The disease inflicts considerable suffering for the affected and their families. Today, the opportunities for pharmacological treatment are meager and new technologies are needed. Previous studies have indicated that activation of the nuclear receptor Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) provides trophic support for DA neurons. Detailed investigations of these neurotrophic effects have been hampered by the lack of readily available DA neurons in vitro. The aim of this study was to further describe the potential neurotrophic actions of RXR ligands and, for this and future purposes, develop a suitable in vitro-platform using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).\nWe studied the potential neurotrophic effects of the RXR ligand LG100268 (LG268) and the RXR-Nurr1 ligand XCT0139508 (XCT) in neuronal cultures derived from rat primary vMB and mESCs. RXR ligands protect DA neurons from stress, such as that induced by the PD-modeling toxin 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA) and hypoxia, but not from stress induced by oxidative hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or the excitotoxic agent kainic acid (KA). The neurotrophic effect is selective for DA neurons. DA neurons from rat primary vMB and mESCs behaved similarly, but the mESC-derived cultures contained a much higher fraction of DA cells and thus provided more accessible experimental conditions.\nRXR ligands rescue DA neurons from degeneration caused by the PD simulating 6-OHDA as well as hypoxia. Thus, RXR is a novel promising target for PD research. mESC-derived DA cells provide a valid and accessible in vitro-platform for studying PD inducing toxins and potential trophic agents.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) results from the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the consequent deficit of dopamine released in the striatum. Current oral dopamine replacement or surgical therapies do not address the underlying issue of neurodegeneration, they neither slow nor halt disease. Neurotrophic factors have shown preclinical promise, but the choice of an appropriate growth factor as well as the delivery has proven difficult. In this study, we used a rotenone rat midbrain culture model to identify genes that are changed after addition of the neurotoxin. (1) We challenged rat midbrain cultures with rotenone (20 nM), a pesticide that has been shown to be toxic for dopaminergic neurons and that has been a well-characterized model of PD. A gene chip array analysis demonstrated that several genes were up-regulated after the rotenone treatment. Interestingly transcriptional activation of vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) was evident, while vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) levels remained unaltered. The results from the gene chip array experiment were verified with real time PCR and semi-quantitative western analysis using beta-actin as the internal standard. (2) We have also found evidence that exogenously applied VEGF-B performed as a neuroprotective agent facilitating neuron survival in an even more severe rotenone culture model of PD (40 nM rotenone). VEGF-B has very recently been added to the list of trophic factors that reduce effects of neurodegeneration, as was shown in an in vivo model of motor neuron degeneration, while lacking potential adverse angiogenic activity. The data of an in vivo protective effect on motor neurons taken together with the presented results demonstrate that VEGF-B is a new candidate trophic factor distinct from the GDNF family of trophic factors. VEGF-B is activated by neurodegenerative challenges to the midbrain, and exogenous application of VEGF-B has a neuroprotective effect in a culture model of PD. Strengthening this natural protective response by either adding exogenous VEGF-B or up-regulating the endogenous VEGF-B levels may have the potential to be a disease modifying therapy for PD. We conclude that the growth factor VEGF-B can improve neuronal survival in a culture model of PD.",

To further validate this model, we have extended both behavioral and biochemical analyses in these animals. We found that vertical movements decline earlier and faster than horizontal movements, possibly modeling the early occurrence of axial, postural instability in PD. L-DOPA induces different locomotor responses depending on the age: in young MitoPark mice the L-DOPA-induced motor activation is small; middle-aged MitoPark mice respond in a dose-dependent manner to L-DOPA, whereas aged MitoPark mice display a double-peaked locomotor response to a high dose of L-DOPA that includes an intermittent period of very low motor activity, similar to the 'on-off' phenomenon in PD. To correlate behavior with biochemical data, we analyzed monoamine levels in three different brain areas that are highly innervated by the DA system: striatum, anterior cortex and olfactory bulb. DA levels declined earlier and faster in striatum than in cortex; only at the latest time-point analyzed, DA levels were found to be significantly lower than control levels in the olfactory bulb. Interestingly, the ratio between homovanillic acid (HVA) and DA differed between regions over time. In striatum and olfactory bulb, the ratio increased steeply indicating increased DA turnover. In contrast, the ratio decreased over time in cortex, revealing important differences between DA cells in substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area.",

    "abstract": "Arachidonic acid (AA) signaling is upregulated in the caudate-putamen and frontal cortex of unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rats, a model for asymmetrical Parkinson disease. AA signaling can be coupled to D(2)-like receptor initiated AA hydrolysis from phospholipids by cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) and subsequent metabolism by cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. In unilaterally 6-OHDA- and sham-lesioned rats, we measured brain expression of cPLA(2), other PLA(2) enzymes, and COX-2. Activity and protein levels of cPLA(2) were significantly higher as was COX-2-protein in caudate-putamen, frontal cortex and remaining brain on the lesioned compared to intact side of the 6-OHDA lesioned rats, and compared to sham brain. Secretory sPLA(2) and Ca(2+)-independent iPLA(2) expression did not differ between sides or groups. Thus, the tonically increased ipsilateral AA signal in the lesioned rat corresponds to upregulated cPLA(2) and COX-2 expression within the AA metabolic cascade, which may contribute to symptoms and pathology in Parkinson disease.",

Personality features were evaluated using the Big Five Adjectives checklist.\nThe study provided evidence of a significant correlation between the Tower of London and the Emotional Stability factor and between Alternating Fluencies and the Openness to Experience factor.\nThe Tower of London test and the Emotional Stability factor may require filtering of irrelevant information, activation of inhibition mechanisms, and use of negative feedback. The Alternating Fluency tasks and the Openness to Experience factor may require the ability to switch set and to express flexible thoughts or opinions in daily life. These results indicate that cognitive and personality changes in PD may be different expressions of a common psychologic mechanism related to the dysfunction of the frontostriatal system.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson disease (PD), cognitive impairment is common, occurs mainly in the form of milder deficits (as opposed to dementia), and commonly coincides with depression. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated whether depression that existed before the onset of typical motor symptoms (pre-PD depression) reflected on the actual cognitive performance. Nondemented nonpsychotic PD patients with (test, n = 27) and without (control, n = 112) a history of pre-PD depression, caliper-matched for age, education, and disease duration were assessed for motor and nonmotor disease characteristics and in a battery of cognitive tests. Test patients had higher actual depression/anxiety levels. Gradual multivariate and mediation analysis indicated unfavorable effects of pre-PD depression on cognition: a direct effect on mental set shifting/response inhibition (independent of actual depression/ anxiety or other factors); and indirect effects on other cognitive domains mediated through the increased depression/anxiety. Data suggest that pre-PD depression favors poorer cognitive abilities in nondemented patients at a given time after PD has been diagnosed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease has a major impact on quality of life. This cross-sectional study assessed 43 idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients in order to evaluate the impact of Parkinson's disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr scale), anxiety, and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) on quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey questionnaire). Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Short Form-36 Health Survey scores were significantly correlated in Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 Parkinson's disease (n=33), and anxiety had a strong correlation with physical score. Multivariate analysis (n=43) revealed that anxiety was the strongest predictor of quality of life. Anxious and depressive symptoms have a different meaning in Parkinson's disease, and both must be routinely assessed in order to optimize quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Involuntary emotional expression disorder (IEED) is a syndrome characterized by involuntary episodes of emotional expression, particularly crying or laughing, that occur in patients with a neurological illness, including neuro-degenerative diseases. The authors assessed the frequency and clinical correlates of IEED among 131 patients with Parkinson's disease. IEED was present in 16.8% of patients overall and in 15.3% of depressed patients. The only clinical correlate of IEED diagnosis was greater severity of Parkinson's disease. The lack of an association between IEED and depression suggests that, in spite of some symptom overlap, the two disorders are distinct neuropsychiatric syndromes in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the role of dopamine in working memory by examining effects of withdrawing dopaminergic medication in patients with Parkinson's disease. Resistance to distraction during a delayed response task was abnormally enhanced in Parkinson's disease patients OFF medication relative to controls. Conversely, performance on a backward digit span test was impaired in these same Parkinson's disease patients OFF medication. Dopaminergic medication reinstated susceptibility to distraction and backward digit span performance, so that performance of Parkinson's disease patients ON medication did not differ from that of controls. We hypothesize that the enhanced distractor resistance and impaired backward digit span in Parkinson's disease reflects low dopamine levels in the striatum, and perhaps upregulated frontal dopamine levels. Dopaminergic medication may reinstate distractibility by normalizing the balance between striatal and prefrontal dopamine transmission.",

    "abstract": "Gait disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) are accentuated when they perform another task simultaneously. This study examines whether practice enables people with PD to walk with large steps while performing added tasks, and to determine if training people with PD to walk with added working memory tasks leads to improvements in gait when walking and performing other tasks simultaneously.\nWalking patterns were recorded pre and post a 20min dual task training session in 20 people with PD. Participants performed a series of 10m walking trials under seven conditions: gait only, and with six different added tasks varying by task type (e.g. motor, cognitive), domain (e.g. postural, manual manipulation, language, calculation, auditory, visuospatial), and difficulty level. Dual task training aimed to improve step length while simultaneously undertaking a variety of language and counting working memory tasks that were different to those used in assessment.\nFollowing training, step length increased when performing five of the six added tasks, indicating transfer of dual task training when walking occurred across task types and domains. Improvements in gait speed occurred in three of the six added tasks. When other gait variables were examined, such as step length variability, few improvements with training were found.\nTraining can lead to larger steps when walking under dual task conditions in people with PD. The gait variable emphasised during dual task training appears to be an important factor in enabling the transfer of training improvements across tasks.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative damage has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD) but the literature data are confusing. Using products of lipid and DNA oxidation measured by accurate methods, we assessed the extent of oxidative damage in PD patients. The levels of plasma F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-IsoPs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid products (HETEs), cholesterol oxidation products, neuroprostanes (F(4)-NPs), phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) activities, urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were compared in 61 PD patients and 61 age-matched controls. The levels of plasma F(2)-IsoPs, HETEs, 7beta-and 27-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, F(4)-NPs, and urinary 8-OHdG were elevated, whereas the levels of plasma PLA(2) and PAF-AH activities were lower, in PD patients compared to controls (p< 0.05). The levels of plasma F(2)-IsoPs, HETEs, and urinary 8-OHdG were higher in the early stages of PD (p trend< 0.05). There was a significant negative correlation between the cumulative intake of levodopa and urinary 8-OHdG (r= -0.305, p= 0.023) and plasma total HETEs (r= -0.285, p= 0.043). Oxidative damage markers are systemically elevated in PD, which may give clues about the relation of oxidative damage to the onset and progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene DJ-1 have been shown to be a rare cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD). Since DJ-1 mutations have been found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) from southern Italy, we aimed to investigate whether polymorphisms within the DJ-1 gene could represent a risk factor for sporadic PD. First, we genotyped 294 patients with PD and 298 controls coming from southern Italy to assess the distribution of the insertion/deletion (Ins/Del) polymorphism. In a second phase, we identified five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) useful to delimit a region potentially involved and genotyped all patients and controls for these markers. All the markers analyzed were significantly associated with PD at both allelic and genotypic level. The most significant association with the disease was found at the Ins/Del polymorphism (p = 0.0001; adjusted odds ratio (OR ) = 2.05; confidence interval (CI ) = 1.36-3.08). When we considered a three-marker sliding window, we found a highly significant association between the disease and the haplotypes including markers rs17523802, Ins/Del, and rs3766606 (p = 0.0007) and markers Ins/Del, rs3766606 and rs7517357 (p = 0.0054). Our results indicate that polymorphisms located in a region spanning 3535 bp from the promoter to the intron 2 of the DJ-1 gene confer risk to sporadic PD in southern Italy.",

    "abstract": "It has been long thought that neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) is related to reactive oxygen species from mitochondrial dysfunction. However, there have been few investigations surveying both transcriptome and proteome in PD. This review focuses on recent work using microarrays and mass spectrometry to examine neurotoxicological models of PD in the mouse. Molecular pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, apoptosis/cell death, signal transduction and neurotransmission were highlighted. Analysis of tyrosine nitration suggested that this important post-translational modification, due to conjugation of reactive oxygen species with nitric oxide, may play an important role in signal transduction as well as the molecular pathology of PD. Thus, the combined investigations highlight known pathways in PD but also point to new directions for research, implicating particularly the role of relatively understudied classes of post-translational modifications in normal cell signaling and neurological disorders.",

Dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta have been shown to degenerate to a greater extent in PD than other neurons suggesting the possibility that DA itself may be contributing to the neurodegenerative process.

Subthalamic stimulation induce a significant improvement during the \"off\" medication in the assessment motor score UPDRS (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale) 3-5 years after surgery. Results show that the benefits obtained in tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, dyskinesias induced by medication and levodopa reduction are significantly maintained during long term. The improvement in other clinical signs as gait and postural stability at long follow-up are not maintained comparing with the benefits obtained one year after surgery. A high percentage of patients show a cognitive disturbance during the follow-up period that may be correlated with the disease progression. The conclusion is that bilateral STN stimulation is an effective treatment for PD patients at long term but it should be considered earlier in the course of PD.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to determine whether lesion of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) promoted by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) would rescue nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons after unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). Initially, 16 mg 6-OHDA (6-OHDA group) or vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid - aCSF; Sham group) was infused into the right MFB of adult male Wistar rats. Fifteen days after surgery, the 6-OHDA and SHAM groups were randomly subdivided and received ipsilateral injection of either 60 mM NMDA or aCSF in the right STN. Additionally, a control group was not submitted to stereotaxic surgery. Five groups of rats were studied: 6-OHDA/NMDA, 6-OHDA/Sham, Sham/NMDA, Sham/Sham, and Control. Fourteen days after injection of 6-OHDA, rats were submitted to the rotational test induced by apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg, ip) and to the open-field test. The same tests were performed again 14 days after NMDA-induced lesion of the STN. The STN lesion reduced the contralateral turns induced by apomorphine and blocked the progression of motor impairment in the open-field test in 6-OHDA-treated rats. However, lesion of the STN did not prevent the reduction of striatal concentrations of dopamine and metabolites or the number of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons after 6-OHDA lesion. Therefore, STN lesion is able to reverse motor deficits after severe 6-OHDA-induced lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway, but does not protect or rescue dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta.",

    "abstract": "Objective Olfactory dysfunction is an early and common symptom in Parkinson disease (PD). Previously, the authors demonstrated that idiopathic olfactory dysfunction in first-degree relatives of PD patients is associated with an increased risk of developing PD within 2 years. The aim of the present study was to determine the value of combined olfactory testing and SPECT scanning in predicting future PD in the same population of relatives over a 5-year period. Methods In a cohort of 361 non-parkinsonian, non-demented first-degree relatives of PD patients, a combination of olfactory processing tasks was used to select groups of hyposmic (n=40) and normosmic (n=38) individuals for a 5-year clinical follow-up evaluation and sequential SPECT scanning, using a dopamine transporter ligand to assess nigrostriatal dopaminergic function at baseline and 5 years from baseline. A validated questionnaire, sensitive to the presence of parkinsonism, was used in the follow-up of the remaining 283 relatives. Results Five years from baseline, five out of the 40 hyposmic relatives fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for PD. None of the other 349 relatives available for follow-up developed PD. All hyposmic individuals developing PD had an abnormal baseline SPECT scan. Discussion In conclusion, idiopathic hyposmia in first-degree relatives of PD patients is associated with an increased risk of developing clinical PD of 12.5% over a 5-year period. The present data suggest that a two-step approach using olfactory testing followed by SPECT scanning in hyposmic individuals has a very high sensitivity and specificity in detecting PD. The usefulness of this two-step approach needs to be confirmed in larger populations.",

Grey-matter changes over time were assessed by means of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cognitive changes by an extensive neuropsychological battery.\nAt follow-up, 75% of patients with VH developed dementia. The greatest decline was observed in verbal memory, semantic fluency, language comprehension and visuoperceptive functions. None of the patients without VH met criteria for dementia and did not show any worsening in cognitive functions over time. Patients with VH showed widespread limbic, paralimbic and neocortical grey-matter loss, whereas in the PD without VH group, grey-matter loss was restricted to a small region in the frontal cortex and cerebellum. The authors also found significant correlations between the changes in several cognitive functions and grey-matter loss over time in PD patients with VH.\nThe presence of VH in PD determines a different cognitive outcome and a different pattern of progressive brain atrophy. PD patients with VH, unlike PD without VH, frequently develop dementia and show a widespread atrophy involving limbic, paralimbic and neocortical areas.",

    "abstract": "Study on small animal model using multiple imaging is an important procedure in medicine and physiology. Recently, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) of dopamine transporter with (99cm)Tc-TRODA-1 has been proved to be a valuable and feasible mean of assessing the integrity of dopamine neurons. In this paper, an image registration algorithm for MRI and SPECT is proposed to evaluate the changes of a Parkinson's rat in brain organization and function. In addition, an automatic labeling algorithm which highlights striatum is necessary because manually segmenting these tissues from MRI is usually time consuming. As a result, we have built a computer-aid clinical diagnosis system which automates all the processes. This paper provides effective evaluation of Parkinson's symptoms by calculating the values of binding potentials for dopamine for quantification. Experimental result shows that the performance of the proposed method is better than the previous approach based on automated image registration.",

    "abstract": "Stereotactic neurosurgery for Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most used treatments for relief symptoms of this degenerative disorder. Current methods include ablation and deep brain stimulation (DBS) that can be applied to the various nuclei in the basal ganglia (BG), for instance to the Subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the Ventral medial nucleus (Vim). Identification of thus regions must be rigorous and within a minimum position error. Usually, skilled specialist identifies the brain area by comparing and listening to the rhythm created by the temporal and spatial aggregation of action potentials presented in microelectrode recordings (MER). We present a novel system for automatic identification of the various nuclei in the BG which addresses the limitations of the subjectivity and the non-stationary nature of MER signals. This system incorporates the time-frequency analysis using the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), which is a recent tool for processing nonlinear and non-stationary data, with a dynamic classifier based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Classification accuracy in two different databases is compared to validate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that system can recognize selected nuclei with a mean accuracy of 90%.",

    "abstract": "Changes in turning are one of the early motor deficiencies in Parkinson's Disease (PD). We have proposed a system based on wearable, inertial sensors and a novel automatic analysis algorithm that can assess 180 degrees turns. Twelve patients in early stages of PD and 14 age-matched healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Inertial sensors were attached on shanks and sternum. Measurement protocol included walking on a straight pathway, turning 180 degrees and returning back. Subjects were measured 4 times, once every 6 months during an 18 months period. At the baseline, 9 subjects from each group repeated the test twice to assess test-retest reliability. Patients with mild PD had a very low Postural Instability Gait Difficulty (PIGD subscore of UPDRS III) score (average 0.67, min 0, max 3). The analysis showed that the patients had a significantly longer turning duration (2.18+/-0.43 vs. 1.79+/-0.27 seconds, p<0.02) and longer delay in their last step before initiating a turn (0.56+/-0.04 vs. 0.52+/-0.04 seconds, p<0.03). Estimated turning duration and other metrics had a high test-retest reliability (rho>0.85). Turning duration also showed a significant Group *Time interaction (p<0.03) during the longitudinal study highlighting early signs of the progression of the disease.",

The trained PNN was further used for evaluating the effects of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) on PD, with and without medication. A sample of 45 subjects (30 normal and 15 PD subjects who underwent STN DBS) was evaluated by gait analysis. PD subjects were assessed under four test conditions: without treatment (mof-sof), only with stimulation (mof-son) or medication (mon-sof), and with combined treatments (mon-son). PC analysis was applied on vGRF, where six PC scores were chosen by the broken stick test. Using a bootstrap approach for the PNN model, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as performance measurement, the first three and fifth PCs were selected as input variables. The PNN presented AUC = 0.995 for classifying controls and PD subjects in the mof-sof condition. When applied to classify the PD subjects under treatment, the PNN indicated that STN DBS alone is more effective than medication, and further vGRF enhancement is obtained with combined therapies.",

Synchronous oscillatory activity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus external (GPe) is simulated at both the parkinsonian tremor (3-9) Hz and beta (15-30) Hz frequencies. The model extends previous models to incorporate cortical inputs to the subthalamic nucleus through the 'hyperdirect' pathway, changes in coupling between STN neurons due to dopamine depletion and the plateau potential generating capacity of STN neurons. The effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) across a range of frequencies on the oscillatory activity is examined. High frequency DBS attenuates synchronous oscillatory activity within the STN-GPe network at both the tremor and beta frequencies. The efficacy of the DBS input in quenching the pathological oscillations is shown to vary systematically with the frequency, pulse width and amplitude of the applied stimulus.",

In urethane anesthetized mice, electrical stimulations (20 monophasic pulses at 50 Hz every 30 sec) were applied to the STN or DFB while infusing the local anesthetic lidocaine (4%) into the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) or pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT). Findings suggest that DFB stimulation activates ascending SNc dopamine axons, while STN stimulation evokes striatal dopamine release directly via excitatory glutamatergic inputs to SNc dopamine cells and indirectly via excitatory cholinergic/glutamatergic STN-PPT-SNc pathways.",

The current work is related to a module of the project that is in charge of assessing PD patients during locomotion. These initial analyses of gait are based on analyses of Sample Entropy in the acceleration signals. Four PD patients are compared to four healthy using a set of five wireless sensors located in the limbs and in the trunk. A metric to assess the level of symmetry during locomotion, an important clinical feature, is proposed. Results show considerable differences between the patients and the subjects, both for sample entropy (in 3 of the 5 sensors) and in the gait asymmetry index (left vs. right limbs). Future work is proposed including age-matched subjects and a larger sample.",

    "abstract": "Effective evaluation of potential neuroprotective interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) requires precise quantification of the motor signs associated with this disease. We have created a protocol that uses force tracking in a simultaneous task paradigm to quantify the fine motor control deficits in individuals with PD. We have used this protocol to collect data from 30 individuals with early to moderate PD and 30 age-matched controls. Based on this data, we computed 60 variables. We generated all possible combinations of three of these variables, and we then computed the classification accuracy of a support vector machine (SVM) trained on each variable combination. We were able to correctly classify 85% of subjects as with or without PD. We found that root-mean-square error variables were the most important features for classification and that utilizing a simultaneous task paradigm improves classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Many different tests that address aspects of human performance have been reported. Yet, critical issues remain. The hierarchical organization of tests, the degree of involvement of different human subsystems, and the relationship between measures are often unclear. General Systems Performance Theory provides the basis for a novel analytic method, termed Nonlinear Causal Resource Analysis, to determine task demands (i.e., analyze tasks) and predict performance in complex tasks using only measures of lower level subsystem performance capacities. Recently, we realized new insights and discovery of a new application of these concepts to address the issues noted. A quasi-objective methodology is presented to identify hierarchical relationships among performance measures. The method is applied to seven different performance measures in a study of Parkinson's Disease subjects (n = 197) exhibiting a wide range of disease severity. Resource economic interpretations of experimental data using performance theory concepts were used to define relationships between performance measures and to organize them hierarchically. This method is anticipated to have broad utility for identifying relationships between performance measures.",

    "abstract": "We propose a partial directed coherence (PCD) method based on a sparse multivariate autoregressive (mAR) model to investigate patterns of information flow in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients performing a visually-guided motor task. The use of a sparsity constraint on the mAR matrix addresses issues such as sample size, model order selection and number of parameters to be estimated, particularly when the number of EEG channels used is large and the window size is small in order to capture dynamic changes. The proposed PDC-based information flow analysis demonstrated distinctly altered patterns of connectivity between PD patients off medication and healthy subjects, particularly with respect to net information outflow from the left sensorimotor (L Sm) region, which might indicate excessive spreading of activity in the diseased state. Disrupted patterns of connectivity in PD were partially restored by levodopa medication. In addition, PDC-based analysis proved to be more sensitive to temporally-dynamic connectivity changes as compared to traditional spectral analysis, which might be influenced primarily by large-scale changes. We suggest that the proposed sparse-PDC method is a suitable technique to investigate altered connectivity in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Recent research efforts in studying brain connectivity has provided new perspectives to understanding of neurophysiology of brain function. Connectivity measures are typically computed from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, yet the presence of volume conduction makes interpretation of results difficult. One possible alternative is to model the connectivity in the source space. In this study, we proposed a novel source separation technique in which EEG signals are represented as a state-space framework. The framework jointly models the underlying brain sources and the connectivity between them in the form of a generalized autoregressive (AR) process. The proposed technique was applied to real EEG data collected from normal and Parkinson's patients during a motor task. The extracted sources revealed the abnormal beta activity in Parkinson's subjects and showed similar biological networks as previous studies.",

    "abstract": "While the majority of tremor-afflicted Parkinso-nian (PD) patients suffer from rest tremors, which is not considered highly disabling, a portion of these PD patients also demonstrate action tremors that interfere with their daily lives. Two main considerations in designing an orthosis that aims at suppressing the tremor, are the frequency bands of the tremor and the joints tremor affects. Nine subjects, which included six healthy people, two PD patients with typical tremor afflictions, and a PD patient with severe tremor of not only in her fingers and wrist, but also in her elbow, participated in this study. The highly afflicted patient displayed the need for tremor suppression in action as well as when in rest. The study focuses on uncommon elbow tremors and demonstrates that, for typically afflicted patients, tremor amplitudes are comparable to healthy subjects, but the frequency distribution of the tremors are different at high levels of elbow torque. For the highly afflicted patient, both tremor amplitude and its frequency distribution are different at all levels of elbow torque. The study further investigates the tremors in two bands of frequency on both hands of the highly troubled patient before, and after medication. The two bands are those of classical Parkinsonian tremor (4-6 Hz) and physiological (or enhanced physiological) tremor (8-12 Hz). Power spectrum and tremor amplitude comparisons reveal that, for part of tremulous PD patients, both tremors coexist and, depending on the level of affliction, the designed orthosis needs to suppress tremors in both bands, even at more proximal joints, such as the elbow.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic benefits of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) for motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are well-documented. However, the mechanisms underlying motor improvement with DBS remain poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that STN-DBS-related improvements in voluntary arm movement kinematics are mediated by changes in the velocity and temporal sequencing of proximal joint angles. We evaluated a 56 year old male and 66 year old female with idiopathic Parkinson's disease chronically implanted with bilateral STN-DBS. Patients performed a button press task while off medication in the DBS-on and DBS-off conditions. Movements of the upper limb were recorded using a 3D motion analysis system, and detailed kinematic measures were obtained for the arm and forearm. As expected, reaction and movement times were improved in the DBS-on compared to DBS-off condition. The two subjects differed with regards to the magnitude of their changes in peak linear velocity and peak angular velocities (shoulder flexion extension, shoulder abduction adduction and elbow flexion extension). Surprisingly, both PD patients increased the frequency with which they used a preferred sequence of shoulder and elbow joint activations when in the DBS-on condition. This preferred pattern was adopted with twice the frequency than in the DBS-off condition, and with increased frequency relative to a control group of 9 age-matched controls. These results suggest that STN-DBS may improve movement execution at the cost of flexibility in movement execution strategy.",

Current diagnosis is based on subjective clinical assessment, which is not always easy to capture subtle, mild and intermittent tremors. The aim of the present study is to assess the suitability and clinical value of a computer based real-time system as an aid to diagnosis of PD, in particular the presence of RT. Five healthy subjects were asked to simulate several severities of RT in hands and feet in three static activities. The behaviour of the subjects is measured using tri-axial accelerometers, which are placed at four different positions on the body. Frequency-domain features, strongly correlated with the RT activity, are extracted from the accelerometer data. The classification of RT severity based on those features, provided accuracy 76%. The real-time system designed for efficient extraction of those features and the provision of a continuous RT severity measure is described.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic therapy to eradicate Helicobacter pylori, the causative agent of gastric and duodenal ulcers, has been suggested to improve L-DOPA bioavailability in Parkinson's and thereby improve patient symptomology. To date, there has been no proven mechanism to explain the purported benefit of treatment of H. pylori in the management of Parkinson's disease. I propose the hypothesis, and provide initial data, that the mechanism of action is due to direct utilization of L-DOPA by H. pylori to maintain its ecological niche within the gastrointestinal tract. In support of this hypothesis, data is presented which demonstrates for the first time the ability of L-DOPA to influence the in vitro growth of H. pylori in an iron-restricted minimal medium. H. pylori utilization of L-DOPA for its own growth requirement reduces the amount of per orally administered L-DOPA that would be available to the patient for the treatment of Parkinson's disease-related pathology. Neuroendocrine-mediated interactions with bacteria represent the emerging interdisciplinary field of microbial endocrinology. Thus, microbial endocrinology provides for a mechanism between L-DOPA and H. pylori with which to explain the purported benefit of H. pylori-directed antibiotic therapy to improve L-DOPA bioavailability in Parkinson's patients and thereby improve drug therapy management. Further, if other bacterial species within the gastrointestinal tract depend on the availability of L-DOPA or other similar neuroendocrine-based drugs for their survival, then the efficacy of such neuroendocrine-based drugs not restricted solely for the management of parkinsonian symptomology may also be adversely affected and may therefore justify the use of an antibiotic regimen to eradicate them.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of Parkinson's disease (PD) on foot trajectories and spatiotemporal gait adaptations when approaching and stepping over a ground-based obstacle. Twenty people with mild-moderate PD and 20 age and sex matched controls walked 10 steps at their preferred speed along a walkway and stepped over an obstacle (height 10% of leg length \u00d7 600 mm \u00d7 10 mm). Control participants also performed trials at the same speed and step length as their matched PD participant. People with PD approached and stepped over the obstacle slower and with smaller steps, but had a similar foot clearance. Those with PD were also more likely to step on the obstacle because they did not place their foot close enough to the front of the obstacle before crossing it to accommodate for their reduced step length. During the lead limb crossing step, people with PD increased their step width, whereas controls maintained a narrow step width. These findings indicate that people with PD have difficulty lengthening their step over the obstacle rather than increasing foot height. Increasing step width is a possible compensation strategy used to overcome postural instability during obstacle crossing in those with PD.",

    "abstract": "Many patients with Parkinson's disease are treated with physiotherapy. We have developed a community-based professional network (ParkinsonNet) that involves training of a selected number of expert physiotherapists to work according to evidence-based recommendations, and structured referrals to these trained physiotherapists to increase the numbers of patients they treat. We aimed to assess the efficacy of this approach for improving health-care outcomes.\nBetween February, 2005, and August, 2007, we did a cluster-randomised trial with 16 clusters (defined as community hospitals and their catchment area). Clusters were randomly allocated by use of a variance minimisation algorithm to ParkinsonNet care (n=8) or usual care (n=8). Patients were assessed at baseline and at 8, 16, and 24 weeks of follow-up. The primary outcome was a patient preference disability score, the patient-specific index score, at 16 weeks. Health secondary outcomes were functional mobility, mobility-related quality of life, and total societal costs over 24 weeks. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number NCT00330694.\nWe included 699 patients. Baseline characteristics of the patients were comparable between the ParkinsonNet clusters (n=358) and usual-care clusters (n=341). The primary endpoint was similar for patients within the ParkinsonNet clusters (mean 47.7, SD 21.9) and control clusters (48.3, 22.4). Health secondary endpoints were also similar for patients in both study groups. Total costs over 24 weeks were lower in ParkinsonNet clusters compared with usual-care clusters (difference euro727; 95% CI 56-1399).\nImplementation of ParkinsonNet networks did not change health outcomes for patients living in ParkinsonNet clusters. However, health-care costs were reduced in ParkinsonNet clusters compared with usual-care clusters.\nZonMw; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research; Dutch Parkinson's Disease Society; National Parkinson Foundation; Stichting Robuust.",

    "abstract": "Religion is central to the lives of billions of people worldwide. To probe processing dynamics of religious cognition and its potential brain correlates, we used a novel priming procedure to assess the integrity of religious and control semantic networks in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and controls. Priming for control, but not religious, concepts was intact in PD patients. Patients with left-onset (right-forebrain disease) evidenced severe impairment activating religious concepts. We next modeled the priming performance with modified cable equations. These analyses suggested that deficient performance of PD patients on activation of religious concepts was due to a change in the time constants governing gain and rate of decay of activation in these semantic networks. These modeling results are consistent with dopaminergic dysfunction in right-sided striatal-prefrontal networks. We conclude that right striatal-prefrontal dopaminergic networks support activation of complex religious concepts but not equally complex and related control concepts.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), there is a progressive loss of neuromelanin (NM)-containing dopamine neurons in substantia nigra (SN) which is associated with microgliosis and presence of extracellular NM. Herein, we have investigated the interplay between microglia and human NM on the degeneration of SN dopaminergic neurons. Although NM particles are phagocytized and degraded by microglia within minutes in vitro, extracellular NM particles induce microglial activation and ensuing production of superoxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082), and pro-inflammatory factors. Furthermore, NM produces, in a microglia-depended manner, neurodegeneration in primary ventral midbrain cultures. Neurodegeneration was effectively attenuated with microglia derived from mice deficient in macrophage antigen complex-1, a microglial integrin receptor involved in the initiation of phagocytosis. Neuronal loss was also attenuated with microglia derived from mice deficient in phagocytic oxidase, a subunit of NADPH oxidase, that is responsible for superoxide and H\u2082O\u2082 production, or apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. In vivo, NM injected into rat SN produces microgliosis and a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase neurons. Thus, these results show that extracellular NM can activate microglia, which in turn may induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD. Our study may have far-reaching implications, both pathogenic and therapeutic.",

    "abstract": "Making appropriate choices often requires the ability to learn the value of available options from experience. Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, neurons hypothesized to play a role in reinforcement learning. Although previous studies have shown that Parkinson's patients are impaired in tasks involving learning from feedback, they have not directly tested the widely held hypothesis that dopamine neuron activity specifically encodes the reward prediction error signal used in reinforcement learning models. To test a key prediction of this hypothesis, we fit choice behavior from a dynamic foraging task with reinforcement learning models and show that treatment with dopaminergic drugs alters choice behavior in a manner consistent with the theory. More specifically, we found that dopaminergic drugs selectively modulate learning from positive outcomes. We observed no effect of dopaminergic drugs on learning from negative outcomes. We also found a novel dopamine-dependent effect on decision making that is not accounted for by reinforcement learning models: perseveration in choice, independent of reward history, increases with Parkinson's disease and decreases with dopamine therapy.",

    "abstract": "Two broad hypotheses have been advanced to explain the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for treatment of Parkinson's disease. One is that stimulation inactivates STN neurons, producing a functional lesion. The other is that electrical stimulation activates the STN output, thus \"jamming\" pathological activity in basal ganglia-corticothalamic circuits. Evidence consistent with both concepts has been adduced from modeling and animal studies, as well as from recordings in patients. However, the stimulation parameters used in many recording studies have not been well matched to those used clinically. In this study, we recorded STN activity in patients with Parkinson's disease during stimulation delivered through a clinical DBS electrode using standard therapeutic stimulus parameters. A microelectrode was used to record the firing of a single STN neuron during DBS (3-5 V, 80-200 Hz, 90- to 200-micros pulses; 33 neurons/11 patients). Firing rate was unchanged during the stimulus trains, and the recorded neurons did not show prolonged (s) changes in firing rate on termination of the stimulation. However, a brief (approximately 1 ms), short-latency (6 ms) postpulse inhibition was seen in 10 of 14 neurons analyzed. A subset of neurons displayed altered firing patterns, with a predominant shift toward random firing. These data do not support the idea that DBS inactivates the STN and are instead more consistent with the hypothesis that this stimulation provides a null signal to basal ganglia-corticothalamic circuitry that has been altered as part of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "During the administration of timed bilateral alternate vibration to homonymous leg or trunk muscles during quiet upright stance, Parkinsonian (PD) patients undergo cyclic antero-posterior and medio-lateral transfers of the centre of foot pressure. This event might be potentially exploited for improving gait in these patients. Here, we tested this hypothesis by applying alternate muscle vibration during walking in PD.\nFifteen patients and 15 healthy subjects walked on an instrumented walkway under four conditions: no vibration (no-Vib), and vibration of tibialis anterior (TA-Vib), soleus (Sol-Vib) and erector spinae (ES-Vib) muscles of both sides. Trains of vibration (internal frequency 100 Hz) were delivered to right and left side at alternating frequency of 10% above preferred step cadence.\nDuring vibration, stride length, cadence and velocity increased in both patients and healthy subjects, significantly so for ES-Vib. Stance and swing time tended to decrease. Width of support base increased with Sol-Vib or TA-Vib, but was unaffected by ES-Vib.\nAlternate ES vibration enhances gait velocity in PD. The stronger effect of ES over leg muscle vibration might depend on the relevance of the proprioceptive inflow from the trunk muscles and on the absence of adverse effects on the support base width.\nTrunk control is defective in PD. The effect of timed vibratory stimulation on gait suggests the potential use of trunk proprioceptive stimulation for tuning the central pattern generators for locomotion in PD.",

    "abstract": "Aetiologically, genetic and environmental factors having an uneven spatial distribution may underlie Parkinson's disease (PD). Undiagnosis of PD in selected regions might have limited access to treatment with levodopa and simultaneously, if present at death, determined PD underreporting at the death record. The purpose of this study was to describe and analyse municipal mortality due to PD in Spain in aetiological and interventional perspective.\nPD mortality at a municipal level was modelled using the Besag-York- Molli\u00e8 autoregressive spatial model, combining demographic information with cause-of-death diagnostic data (International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision (ICD-9) code 332.0). Municipal relative risks (RRs) were independently estimated for women, men and both sexes, and plotted on maps depicting smoothed RR estimates and the distribution of the posterior probability of RR>1.\nA south-north gradient, with large geographical areas suggesting clustered towns with high mortality, was seen in Asturias, the Basque Country, Balearic Islands and, particularly, in the Lower Ebro valley around Tarragona. Similarly, there was a suggestion that lowest mortality was clustered in the south-east and south-west. We identified some isolated or clustered municipalities with high mortality that were situated near industrial plants reported to be associated with environmental xenobiotic emissions. However, the same pattern was also observed for some cities with low mortality.\nMunicipal PD mortality in Spain was unevenly distributed. Patterns were roughly similar to reported provincial PD mortality and use of levodopa. While the overall pattern appears to result from spatially selective PD undiagnosis, and can not be ascribed to industrial emissions, it can not be excluded that selected \"hot spots\" reflect genetic factors and/or environmental exposures inducing parkinsonism. A few municipal populations, located in low-mortality-risk areas in the vicinity of polluting plants or registering high excess PD mortality, might constitute a priority for conducting direct etiological studies. Additionally, interventions aimed to reduce potential PD undiagnosis might be most appropriate in the South.",

While the overall pattern appears to result from spatially selective PD undiagnosis, and can not be ascribed to industrial emissions, it can not be excluded that selected \"hot spots\" reflect genetic factors and/or environmental exposures inducing parkinsonism. A few municipal populations, located in low-mortality-risk areas in the vicinity of polluting plants or registering high excess PD mortality, might constitute a priority for conducting direct etiological studies. Additionally, interventions aimed to reduce potential PD undiagnosis might be most appropriate in the South.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, an effective treatment for medication-refractory Parkinson's disease (PD), may also lead to selective cognitive declines. In this continuation of a report by Zahodne et al. (2009), we compare cognitive performance of 24 PD patients who underwent unilateral implantation of the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) or subthalamic nucleus (STN) to that of 19 PD controls. We used group statistical comparisons as well as Reliable Change Indexes (RCIs) to examine performance on measures of memory, processing speed, executive function, and visuospatial perception at baseline and 16 months after surgery. Significant between-group differences were noted on a psychomotor processing speed task. However, a significantly higher proportion of DBS patients than controls demonstrated reliable individual decline on a word list recall task (HVLT-R) and on several processing speed tests. Reliable improvements were noted on tests of visuospatial functioning. There was variability in individual outcome on executive functioning tests, with a small proportion of DBS patients demonstrating reliable decline and some demonstrating reliable improvement. Use of Reliable Change highlights the occurrence of individual variability, revealing declines and improvements in a small proportion of unilateral DBS patients that were not evident upon group comparison. These findings must be interpreted in light of group-level differences between the PD control and DBS patients on demographic and disease-related factors.",

    "abstract": "In the course of Parkinson disease (PD), apart from motor symptoms, presence of mental disturbances such as dementia and depression is common. The aims of this study were to assess the auditory system involvement in patients with PD using electrophysiological and neuropsychological tests and to correlate the cognitive impairment and the auditory evoked potentials tests results. The auditory and cognitive functions were studied in 53 patients with idiopathic PD, mean age 65.8 +/- 9.1 years; mean disease duration 7.8 +/- 5.0 years; mean motor disability score 2.5 +/- 0.8 points in Hoehn-Yahr scale compared with a control group matched for age and sex. In patients and controls, cognitive functions were analyzed electrophysiologically using middle latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEP) and long latency (event-related potentials, P300) auditory evoked potentials. Neuropsychological testing consisted of Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). According to WCST results, patients with PD were divided into 2 subgroups: patients with normal and abnormal WCST performance (WCST(-) and WCST(+) subgroups, respectively). Sixteen of 46 patients (34.8%) showed cognitive impairment when evaluated with WCST. Statistically significant differences in middle latency auditory evoked potentials and P300 results between WCST(-) and WCST(+) groups were found consisting of P300 abnormalities in 93.8% patients in WCST(+) and 57.7% in WCST(-) group. Middle latency auditory evoked potentials were abnormal in 71.4% and 63% patients in WCST(+) and WCST(-) group, respectively. P300 was absent significantly more often (P < 0.01) in the subgroup with cognitive impairment. The difference in middle latency auditory evoked potentials results between these subgroups was statistically insignificant. The auditory evoked potentials changes were more common among patients with abnormal WCST performance. According to our results, the auditory evoked potentials of different latencies are helpful in the assessment of cognitive changes accompanying PD.",

    "abstract": "The previous association study confirmed that diffuse slowing of EEGs was present in Parkinson's disease (PD), demonstrated with the use of the quantitative EEG technique. This study was the first to assess the relationship between progression of PD and quantitative EEG. A total of 106 patients with PD with a mean Hoehn-Yahr stage of 2.73 were serially enrolled. Lack of ischemic lesions was confirmed in all patients by magnetic resonance imaging. Absolute power values were measured for four frequency bands from delta to beta. The electrodes were divided among six locations: frontal pole, frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital locations. Spectral ratio was calculated as the sum of power values for the alpha and beta waves divided by the sum values for the slow waves. The relationship between the progression of PD and spectral ratio was assessed by the Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test. At all electrode locations, spectral ratio significantly decreased with progression of Hoehn-Yahr stage (frontal pole, P = 0.007; frontal, P = 0.005; central, P = 0.031; parietal, P = 0.017; temporal, P = 0.005; occipital, P = 0.010). This shows that the slowing of EEGs became more obvious with PD progression.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction hypothetically contributes to neuronal degeneration in patients with Parkinson's disease. While several in vitro data exist, the measurement of cerebral mitochondrial dysfunction in living patients with Parkinson's disease is challenging. Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging combined with phosphorus and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging provides information about the functional integrity of mitochondria in specific brain areas. We measured partial volume corrected concentrations of low-energy metabolites and high-energy phosphates with sufficient resolution to focus on pathology related target areas in Parkinson's disease. Combined phosphorus and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in the mesostriatal region was performed in 16 early and 13 advanced patients with Parkinson's disease and compared to 19 age-matched controls at 3 Tesla. In the putamen and midbrain of both Parkinson's disease groups, we found a bilateral reduction of high-energy phosphates such as adenosine triphophosphate and phosphocreatine as final acceptors of energy from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, low-energy metabolites such as adenosine diphophosphate and inorganic phosphate were within normal ranges. These results provide strong in vivo evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction of mesostriatal neurons is a central and persistent phenomenon in the pathogenesis cascade of Parkinson's disease which occurs early in the course of the disease.",

The patient underwent 3 formal speech assessments of spontaneous speech and the reading of passages with DBS off and on. Speech samples were videotaped and placed in random order, and 2 independent speech-language pathologists calculated the percentage of stuttered syllables and classified individual stuttering events.\nStuttering improved significantly in the DBS-on condition. In total, 10% of syllables were affected by stuttering events with DBS off, and less than 1% of syllables were affected by stuttering events with DBS on (n = 2,281 syllables, p < .00001, in a chi(2) test). The effect of unilateral STN DBS on stuttering was relatively independent of whether the patient was on or off dopaminergic medications.\nThis article emphasizes the important role of the subthalamic region in the motor control of speech and language.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Given the aging population, the prevalence of the disease is expected to increase substantially. The mainstay of treatment has been dopamine replacement therapy with carbidopa, levodopa, dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors, catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors and amantadine. Nonmotor features, such as cognitive impairment, mood disorders, autonomic dysfunction, gastrointestinal and genitourinary dysfunction, have a substantial impact on Parkinson's disease patients and their quality of life. This review will provide an overview on medications currently available for management of both motor and nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Focus will be placed on recent and evolving studies evaluating symptomatic and neuroprotective effects of medications, and how such studies may impact the future management of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence from numerous studies, using both psychophysical and electrophysiological approaches, that impairment of olfaction is a characteristic and early feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Deficits in the sense of smell may precede clinical motor symptoms by years and can be used to assess risk for developing PD in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Recent data indicate that over 95% of patients with PD present with significant olfactory loss. Thus, olfactory dysfunction should be considered a reliable marker of the disease. This review summarizes the available information about olfactory function in PD, indicating the advantageous use of olfactory probes in early and differential diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Opportunities for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) by cortical stimulation are open. This review outlines the main arguments for the use of cortical stimulation in PD: the widespread cortical dysfunction that could be corrected by cortical stimulation; the main mechanism of action of subthalamic nucleus stimulation that could take place within the primary motor cortex; and the ability of cortical stimulation to modulate basal ganglia activity by exciting cortico-basal ganglia projections. Such neuromodulatory effects could correspond to either stimulus-locked changes in brain rhythms or delayed changes in synaptic plasticity. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can produce transient improvement of motor performance when the primary motor cortex or the supplementary motor area is targeted. Alleviation of mood and cognitive disorders are rather observed when repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, to produce more permanent therapeutic effects, chronic stimulation using surgically implanted electrodes is necessary. For this purpose, epidural implantation is safer and should be used in preference to subdural implantation. Pioneering results of epidural motor cortex stimulation in PD have been published, but they relate to case reports and open studies, precluding any definitive conclusion. Epidural cortical stimulation is easy to perform and could be a valuable therapeutic alternative to deep-brain stimulation. However, new epidural leads need to be designed before considering the development of such a technique for PD treatment.",

We report a 54-year-old woman who underwent radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation for Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The surface electrocardiography (ECG) demonstrated pre-excitation, indicating a posteroseptal accessory pathway. A catheter ablation via a transaortic approach failed to ablate the accessory pathway. Coronary sinus venography revealed the presence of a diverticulum near the ostium. An electrogram in the neck of the diverticulum showed the coronary sinus myocardial extension potential, which was successfully ablated by delivery of RF energy.",

Although individual signs of Parkinson's disease - most frequently tremor - have been described since ancient times, the first systematic description of the disease is attributed to James Parkinson in 1817. Here we present evidence that not only individual signs, but the disease itself with all four cardinal signs were described in 1690 by Ferenc P\u00e1pai P\u00e1riz, in a Hungarian medical text over 120 years before the classical description of James Parkinson. In this article I draw the reader's attention to the descriptive chapter in P\u00e1pai's book that was published in Hungarian, which because it is understood by so few people, has resulted in this description of PD being ignored in the medical literature.",

    "abstract": "Rotigotine is a highly lipophilic dopamine-receptor agonist and the first transdermally delivered agent to demonstrate efficacy and safety as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease and to reduce \"off\" hours in levodopa-treated patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. The rotigotine pharmacophore is nonergolinic and demonstrates high affinity for dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptors. With once-daily application, the patch matrix provides continuous, nonfluctuating plasma drug levels at steady state, resulting in continuous and steady plasma and brain levels and striatal dopamine-receptor stimulation. In early Parkinson's disease, doses of rotigotine up to 8 mg/24 hours demonstrate comparable efficacy to ropinirole (at doses up to 12 mg/day); in advanced Parkinson's disease, doses of rotigotine up to 16 mg/24 hours demonstrate comparable efficacy and tolerability to pramipexole (at doses up to 4.5 mg/day). In the registration trials for early and advanced Parkinson's disease, the adverse effects most commonly observed with rotigotine were minor application site reactions, dizziness, nausea, and somnolence. Doses of transdermal rotigotine can be titrated to a maintenance dose within 2-3 weeks, and the once-daily regimen minimizes complexity of therapy. The transdermal delivery system is also an advantage when nonoral administration is desired, and the 24-hour, continuous, nonfluctuating drug levels can improve early morning and nocturnal symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Thus, transdermally delivered rotigotine is a clinically innovative and useful addition to the dopamine-receptor agonist class. This review summarizes the key pharmacologic and clinical data for rotigotine and provides a focused clinical context for its use in early-to-advanced Parkinson's disease, as well as a brief summary for its role in restless legs syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Motor dysfunctions in Parkinson's disease are believed to be primarily due to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Numerous cell replacement therapy approaches have been developed and tested, including these based on donor cell transplantation (embryonic and adult tissue-derived), adult mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)-, neural stem cells (hNSCs)- and finally human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-based. Despite the progress achieved, numerous difficulties prevent wider practical application of stem cell-based therapy approaches for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Among the latter, ethical, safety and technical issues stand out. Current series of reviews (Cell therapy for Parkinson's disease: I. Embryonic and adult donor tissue-based applications; II. Adult stem cell-based applications; III. Neonatal, fetal and embryonic stem cell-based applications; IV. Risks and future trends) aims providing a balanced and updated view on various issues associated with cell types (including stem cells) in regards to their potential in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Essential features of the individual cell subtypes, principles of available cell handling protocols, transplantation, and safety issues are discussed extensively.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) impairs driving performance, and simulator studies have shown increased crashes compared to controls. In this pilot study, eight drivers with PD participated in three drive sessions with multiple simulator intersections of varying visibility and traffic load, where an incurring vehicle posed a crash risk. Over the course of the three sessions (once every 1-2 weeks), we observed reduction in crashes (p=0.059) and reaction times (p=0.006) to the vehicle incursion. These findings suggest that our simulator training program is feasible and potentially useful in drivers with PD. Future research questions include transfer of training to different driving tasks, duration of benefit, and the effect on long term real life outcomes in comparison to a standard intervention (e.g., driver education class) in a randomized trial.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a reduction of health-related quality of life (HrQoL). Demographic and clinical determinants of HrQoL in PD have been previously investigated, but less is known about its social determinants. Data on HrQoL in Austrian patients with PD are not available. The objective of this cross-sectional survey was to evaluate HrQoL of Austrian patients with PD and to provide a comprehensive analysis of its social and clinical determinants. Outpatients (n = 100) with idiopathic PD were recruited in the Department of Neurology of the University Innsbruck. Clinical status was estimated using the Unified Parkison's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). HrQoL was evaluated using a generic instrument, the EuroQol (EQ5D and EQ-VAS). Independent determinants of HrQoL were assessed in multivariate regression analysis. The proportion of PD patients with moderate or severe problems in at least one dimension of the EQ5D was significantly higher than in the general population (90.1 vs. 35.1%, P < 0.001). The mean EQ-VAS score in PD was lower than in the general population (48.9 +/- 19.6 vs. 77.0 +/- 20.8, P < 0.001). Social support (number of household members) was identified as an independent social determinant of HrQoL. Demographic and clinical determinants were age, depression, UPDRS and motor fluctuations. The analysis of determinants of HrQoL showed that a greater attention should be paid to social support and home care. Our data on HrQoL in PD should be considered in the development of new health care programs.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to report trends in mortality, as certified on death certificates, from multiple sclerosis (MS), motor neuron disease (MND), primary Parkinson's disease (PD), and epilepsy, analysing not only the underlying cause of death but also all certified causes for each disease. Death records in the Oxford region, 1979-2006, and England, 1996-2006, were analysed for ascertaining the trends in mortality. The percentage of deaths coded as the underlying cause changed over time, coinciding with changes to the rules for selecting the underlying cause of death. Changes over time to coding rules had a large impact on apparent trends in death rates for PD when studied by underlying cause alone. They also had significant, though smaller, effects on trends in death rates for MS, MND and epilepsy. Nationally, in the last period of the study, underlying cause mortality identified 64% of deaths with a mention of MS, 88% of MND, 56% of PD, and 48% of epilepsy. In the longstanding Oxford data from 1979 to 2006, death rates based on all certified causes of death showed no significant change for MS; an upward trend for MND (notably in women over 75), though only in the last few years of the study; a significant but small decline for PD; and no significant change for epilepsy. When mortality statistics are analysed by underlying cause only, their value is reduced. A substantial percentage of neurological deaths are missed. Time trends may be misleading. All certified causes for each disease, as well as the underlying cause, should be analysed.",

The results of the participation of the caregivers are presented next to the data of the patients.\nCaregivers (n = 137) and patients with PD (n = 151) participated in the 8-week program in separate groups. Measurements were performed on psychosocial problems (BELA-P/A-k), health state (EQ-5D VAS), quality of life (PDQ-39) and depression (SDS) 1 week before and 1 week after the program. Participants rated their mood on a visual analogue scale before and after each session, and they filled in an evaluation questionnaire after the last session.\nScores on the BELA-P/A-k improved significantly on the 'bothered by scale' as well as the 'need for help scale'. No improvements were found on EQ-5D VAS, PDQ-39 and SDS. Mood ratings improved significantly after each session. Most participants evaluated the program as positive. Feedback led to improvements in the program, which are incorporated in a final manual.\nThe program was feasible to run in the different countries. This exploratory study led to improvements in the program and recommendations for further research. A study on the effectiveness of the program is the next step.",

    "abstract": "Mutation of the gene PARK2, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is the most common cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease. In a search for multisite tumor suppressors, we identified PARK2 as a frequently targeted gene on chromosome 6q25.2-q27 in cancer. Here we describe inactivating somatic mutations and frequent intragenic deletions of PARK2 in human malignancies. The PARK2 mutations in cancer occur in the same domains, and sometimes at the same residues, as the germline mutations causing familial Parkinson's disease. Cancer-specific mutations abrogate the growth-suppressive effects of the PARK2 protein. PARK2 mutations in cancer decrease PARK2's E3 ligase activity, compromising its ability to ubiquitinate cyclin E and resulting in mitotic instability. These data strongly point to PARK2 as a tumor suppressor on 6q25.2-q27. Thus, PARK2, a gene that causes neuronal dysfunction when mutated in the germline, may instead contribute to oncogenesis when altered in non-neuronal somatic cells.",

We compared the risk of developing incident cancer between patients with or without PD.\nWe conducted a population-based follow-up study and a nested case-control analysis using data from the UK-based General Practice Research Database. We included PD patients aged >or=40 years with a first PD diagnosis between 1994 and 2005, and a matched comparison group free of PD. We assessed cancer incidence rates and relative risk estimates (odds ratios [ORs] with 95% confidence intervals [CI]).\nThe risk of developing cancer overall was lower in PD patients as compared to patients without PD (crude incidence rate ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.92). In the nested case-control analysis (adj. OR for all cancers 0.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.87) the risk reduction was strongest for smoking-related cancers (adj. OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.72). The adjusted OR for hematological malignancies was 0.32 (95% CI 0.14-0.74). Due to small numbers, ORs for other cancer entities did not reach statistical significance.\nWith the exception of melanoma, PD patients were less likely to develop cancer than individuals without PD in this large observational study.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) have recently been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson disease (PD). GBA mutations have been observed to be particularly prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Interestingly, this population also has a high incidence of the Lrrk2 p.G2019S mutation which is similar in North African Arab-Berber populations. Herein, our sequencing of the GBA gene, in 33 North African Arab-Berber familial parkinsonism probands, identified two novel mutations in three individuals (p.K-26R and p.K186R). Segregation analysis of these two variants did not support a pathogenic role. Genotyping of p.K-26R, p.K186R and the common p.N370S in an ethnically matched series consisting of 395 patients with PD and 372 control subjects did not show a statistically significant association (P>0.05). The p.N370S mutation was only identified in 1 sporadic patient with PD and 3 control subjects indicating that the frequency of this mutation in the North African Arab-Berber population is much lower than that observed in Ashkenazi Jews, and therefore arose in the latter after expansion of the Lrrk2 p.G2019S variant in North Africa.",

    "abstract": "Stimulation of endogenous repair in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), appears to be a novel and promising therapeutic application of stem cells (SCs). In fact SCs could propel local microenvironmental signals to sustain active endeavors for damaged neurons substitution, normally failing in non-supportive pathological surroundings. In this study, we demonstrated that two different doses of na\u00efve human adult mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), implanted in the striatum of rats lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), positively survived 23 days after transplantation. Their fate was directly influenced by the surrounding host environment while grafted hMSCs, dose dependently, regionally sustained the survival of striatal/nigral dopaminergic terminals and enhanced neurogenesis in the Subventricular Zone (SVZ). The number of proliferative cells (Ki67/Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen +) as well as neuroblasts migration significantly augmented in the lesioned striatum of transplanted animals compared to controls. No SVZ astrogenesis was detected in all experimental conditions, irrespectively of graft presence. Activation of endogenous stem cell compartments and rescue of dopaminergic neurons, supported by the persistent release of specific cytokine by MSCs in vivo, appeared in principle able to contrast the neurodegenerative processes induced by the 6-OHDA lesion. Our results suggest that reciprocal influences between grafted cells and endogenous neural precursors could be important for the observed neurorescue effect on several brain regions. Altogether, our data provide remarkable cues regarding the potential of hMSCs in promoting endogenous reparative mechanisms that may prove applicable and beneficial for PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "The later stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by altered gait patterns. Although decreased arm swing during gait is the most frequently reported motor dysfunction in individuals with PD, quantitative descriptions of gait in early PD have largely ignored upper extremity movements. This study was designed to perform a quantitative analysis of arm swing magnitude and asymmetry that might be useful in the assessment of early PD. Twelve individuals with early PD (in \"off\" state) and eight controls underwent gait analysis using an optically-based motion capture system. Participants were instructed to walk at normal and fast velocities, and then on heels (to minimize push-off). Arm swing was measured as the excursion of the wrist with respect to the pelvis. Arm swing magnitude for each arm, and inter-arm asymmetry, were compared between groups. Both groups had comparable gait velocities (p = 0.61), and there was no significant difference between the groups in the magnitude of arm swing in all walking conditions for the arm that swung more (p = 0.907) or less (p = 0.080). Strikingly, the PD group showed significantly greater arm swing asymmetry (asymmetry angle: 13.9 + or - 7.9%) compared to the control group (asymmetry angle: 5.1 + or - 4.0%; p = 0.003). Unlike arm swing magnitude, arm swing asymmetry unequivocally differs between people with early PD and controls. Such quantitative evaluation of arm swing, especially its asymmetry, may have utility for early and differential diagnosis, and for tracking disease progression in patients with later PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology has been attributed both to genetic and environmental factors, although the exact mechanisms of its pathogenesis remains elusive. We investigated Brazilian early-onset PD (EOPD) patients with PINK1 polymorphisms (SNPs) in order to find possible correlations between SNPs, environmental exposure, and disease age of onset. We enrolled 48 patients and 61 controls. PINK1 SNPs and environmental exposure (living in rural areas, well-water drinking, exposure to pesticides, herbicides and organic solvents and smoking) were investigated in both groups. We divided our group of patients into four subgroups, according to the presence/absence of PINK1 SNP IVS1-7 A-->G and the presence/absence of environmental factors exposure. We found a significant decrease (ANOVA test: p=0.02) of age at disease onset in those patients that had the IVS1-7 A-->G SNP and were exposed to environmental risk factors. Our data suggest that the interaction of PINK1 SNP IVS1-7 A-->G and environmental risk factors together have an important role in EOPD: each of them individually has a minor influence, whereas their interaction is associated with a significant effect in anticipating the disease clinical onset.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that mitochondrial oxidative damage, oxidative DNA damage or both contribute to the neurodegenerative process of Parkinson's disease (PD). We employed high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an electrochemical detector to measure concentrations of the reduced and oxidized forms of coenzyme Q-10 (CoQ-10) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 20 patients with PD and 20 age-matched controls with no neurological disease. The percentage of oxidized to total CoQ-10 (%CoQ-10) in the CSF of the PD group (80.3+/-17.9%) was significantly higher than in the control group (68.2+/-20.4%, P<0.05). In addition, the concentration of 8-OHdG in the CSF of PD patients was greater than in the CSF of controls (P<0.0001) and was positively correlated with the duration of illness (r(s)=0.87, P<0.001). Finally, the %CoQ-10 was correlated with concentrations of 8-OHdG in the CSF of PD patients (r(s)=0.56, P<0.01). The present study suggests that both mitochondrial oxidative damage and oxidative DNA damage play important roles in the pathogenesis of early PD development.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal synchronization of neuronal activity in the basal ganglia has been associated with the dysfunction of sensorimotor circuits in Parkinson's disease (PD). In particular, oscillations at frequencies within the beta range (13-35 Hz) are specifically modulated by dopaminergic medication and are correlated with the clinical state of the subjects. While these oscillations have been shown to be coherent ipsilaterally within the basal ganglia and between the basal ganglia nuclei and the ipsilateral motor cortex in PD, the bilateral extent of their coherence has never been characterized. Here we demonstrate for the first time that the beta band oscillations recorded in the local field potential of the subthalamic nuclei (STN), while appearing different across subjects, are occurring at the same frequencies bilaterally (p<0.001) and are coherent between the two STNs of individual PD subjects (11/12 cases, p<0.05). These findings suggest the existence of a bilateral network controlling the beta band activity in the basal ganglia in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. A progressive movement disorder typified by the production of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and impairment of postural reflexes, PD is characterized by a depletion of dopamine in the striatum. For the last decade, several Mendelian forms of PD have been identified. Mutations in these genes potentially lead to autosomal dominant (alpha-synuclein and LRRK2), or autosomal recessive PD (Parkin, PINK1, DJ1, and ATP13A2). This article will spotlight these six distinct genes unambiguously associated with Mendelian PD and the function of their encoded proteins.",

    "abstract": "The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test is a widely used measure of mobility and fall risk in older adults and in Parkinson's disease (PD). We tested the hypothesis that body-fixed accelerometers can provide insight into TUG performance in PD patients.\nWe examined 17 patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr score: 2.7+/-0.7; ON state) and 15 age-matched healthy controls; mean ages were 66.8+/-5.9 years, 67.6+/-9.6 years, respectively. Subjects wore a 3D-accelerometer (ADXL330, Analog Devices) on the lower back while performing the TUG test. Sit-to-Stand and Stand-to-Sit times were extracted from the anterior-posterior (AP) signal. Parameters included Sit-to-Stand, Stand-to-Sit durations, amplitude range (Range) and slopes (Jerk). Acceleration median and standard deviation (SD) were also calculated.\nStopwatch-based TUG duration tended to be higher for the PD patients compared to the control group, although not significantly (p=0.08). In contrast, the TUG duration that was extracted from the acceleration signal was significantly (p<0.02) higher in the PD group compared to the control group. Many acceleration-parameters were also significantly different (p<0.05) between groups; most were not correlated with TUG duration.\nAccelerometer-derived parameters are sensitive to group differences, indicating that PD patients have poorer mobility during specific aspects of the TUG. In addition to test duration, these measures may serve as complementary and objective bio-markers of PD to augment the evaluation of disease progression and the response to therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "PET studies with the DOPA decarboxylase substrate 6-[(18)F]fluoro-l-DOPA (FDOPA) reveal the storage of [(18)F]-fluorodopamine within synaptic vesicles, mainly of dopamine fibres. As such, FDOPA PET is a sensitive indicator of the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopamine innervation. Nonetheless, there have been several reports of focal elevations of FDOPA utilization in brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), all based on reference tissue methods. To investigate this phenomenon further, we used voxel-wise steady-state kinetic analysis to search for regions of elevated FDOPA utilization (K; ml g(-1) min(-1)) and steady-state trapping (V(d); ml g(-1)) in a group of well-characterized patients with early, asymmetric PD, who were contrasted with an age-matched control group. Subtraction of the population mean parametric maps revealed foci of increased FDOPA utilization K (+25%) in the bilateral medial nucleus accumbens, whereas the expected declines in the trapping of FDOPA were seen in the caudate and putamen. This observation suggests hyperfunction of catecholamine fibres innervating specifically the limbic striatum, which could guide the design of future prospective FDOPA-PET studies of the impulse control disorders occurring in some PD patients under treatment with dopamine agonists. A focus of increased FDOPA influx and also V(d) was detected in the periaqueductal grey, consistent with some earlier reports based on reference tissue analysis. Increased FDOPA trapping in the periaqueductal grey of PD patients seems consistent with recent reports of increased activity of serotonin neurons in a rat model of parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) have been widely associated to beneficial effects over different neuropathologies, but only a few studies associate them to Parkinson's disease (PD). Rats were submitted to chronic supplementation (21-90 days of life) with fish oil, rich in omega-3 PUFAs, and were uni- or bilaterally lesioned with 4microg of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the medial forebrain bundle. Although lipid incorporation was evidenced in neuronal membranes, it was not sufficient to compensate motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA. In contrast, omega-3 PUFAs were capable of reducing rotational behavior induced by apomorphine, suggesting neuroprotection over dyskinesia. The beneficial effects of omega-3 PUFAs were also evident in the maintenance of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances index from animals lesioned with 6-OHDA similar to levels from SHAM and intact animals. Although omega-3 PUFAs did not modify the tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the ventral tegmental area, nor the depletion of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in the striatum, DA turnover was increased after omega-3 PUFAs chronic supplementation. Therefore, it is proposed that omega-3 PUFAs action characterizes the adaptation of remaining neurons activity, altering striatal DA turnover without modifying the estimated neuronal population.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is well documented in presymptomatic brain tissue with Parkinson's disease (PD). Identification of the autosomal recessive variant PARK6 caused by loss-of-function mutations in the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 provides an opportunity to dissect pathogenesis. Although PARK6 shows clinical differences to PD, the induction of alpha-synuclein \"Lewy\" pathology by PINK1-deficiency proves that mitochondrial pathomechanisms are relevant for old-age PD. Mitochondrial dysfunction is induced by PINK1 deficiency even in peripheral tissues unaffected by disease, consistent with the ubiquitous expression of PINK1. It remains unclear whether this dysfunction is due to PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of proteins inside or outside mitochondria. Although PINK1 deficiency affects the mitochondrial fission/fusion balance, cell stress is required in mammals to alter mitochondrial dynamics and provoke apoptosis. Clearance of damaged mitochondria depends on pathways including PINK1 and Parkin and is critical for postmitotic neurons with high energy demand and cumulative stress, providing a mechanistic concept for the tissue specificity of disease.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this prospective study was to examine whether fibrinogen level is associated with Parkinson disease (PD) for both prevalent and incident cases.\nThe Honolulu Asia-Aging Study is a longitudinal study of Japanese-American men based on the Honolulu Heart Study birth cohort. The original cohort consisted of 8,006 participants with selective service records who were living on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, in 1965. For this analysis, baseline was defined as the 1991-1993 examination (n = 3,845) when men were aged 71-93 years old. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used, adjusting for potential confounders.\nWe identified 61 prevalent cases and 61 incident cases of PD during the follow-up. High fibrinogen level (presence in the top quintile) was associated with higher frequency of PD for both prevalent (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.10-3.88, p = 0.024) and incident cases (HR = 3.05, 95% CI = 1.34-6.97, p = 0.008) among men aged 76-93 years, after adjusting for age, smoking, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\nThese results suggest high fibrinogen level is associated with increased risk of PD among men over 75 years.",

Statistical parametric mapping was used to identify significant changes in rCBF from the preoperative to the postoperative conditions. rCBF was increased in the bilateral cingulate cortices and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. rCBF was decreased in the bilateral medial frontal cortices and left superior temporal cortex. Unilateral STN DBS produced rCBF changes in the bilateral cingulate cortices, cerebellar hemispheres, and medial frontal cortices. These findings indicate that unilateral STN DBS affects rCBF in both hemispheres.",

    "abstract": "Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes, mGlu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia, but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of PD is not known. The effects of N,N'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine dihydrochloride (AMN082), the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors, were thus tested in different rodent models of PD. Here, we show that oral (5 mg/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of AMN082 reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. AMN082 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) reduces apomorphine-induced rotations in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of PD patients, 5 mg/kg AMN082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. In addition, AMN082 reduces the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in a mGlu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice. Higher doses of AMN082 (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) have no effect on the same models of PD. Overall these findings suggest that mGlu7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced dopamine activity. Selective ligands of mGlu7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this project were to determine the risk factors for and clinical characteristics of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Parkinson's disease (PD). We performed a retrospective record review of 72 non-demented PD patients (age: 57.79 +/- 10.57, duration of PD: 7.32 +/- 4.97) who completed a standardized neurological assessment, including a full neuropsychological battery, as part of their diagnostic work-up. Of these participants, 47.2% were cognitively normal and 52.8% met criteria for MCI. The majority of MCI patients had single domain MCI (23/38), the affected domains being memory (n = 9), executive function (n = 6), visuospatial skills (n = 6), and language (n = 2). The MCI group had longer duration of disease and higher postural instability and gait disorder subscale scores than the cognitively normal group. This report provides further support for use of the concept of MCI in PD research. There may be certain disease characteristics that could alert practitioners to the emergence of cognitive changes in patients. Future studies should focus on additional risk factors for MCI subtypes and their possible progression to frank dementia.",

    "abstract": "Nigrostriatal and cerebellar systems are important postural subsystems in neurologic rehabilitation. In this study, we investigated the ability to differentiate both systems via posturography and spectral analysis. This cross-sectional study included 156 study subjects with 52 individuals in each group (healthy controls, Parkinson's disease and cerebellar disease patients). The mean age of all groups was 61.3+/-13.4 years. We used the interactive balance system (IBS) to differentiate vertical pressure fluctuations on four independent force plates, each supporting one heel or the toes of each leg in eight test positions. We also performed a frequency analysis of the force/time signal. The univariate, multifactor covariance analysis was used for statistical evaluation. Variance analysis of the Parkinson's group (mean/95% CI: 23.0/20.5-25.5) and control group (mean/95% CI: 16.7/14.2-19.2) revealed the greatest differences in frequency range F1. Subjects with cerebellar disease showed significant differences compared with controls in all frequency ranges. Furthermore, cerebellar disease subjects showed a consistently lower postural stability compared with the Parkinson's (p<0.001) and control groups (p<0.001). Results from the present study suggest that the cerebellar and nigrostriatal system can be effectively differentiated and assessed with frequency-analyzed posturographic parameters. Furthermore, the IBS allows a highly practical differential assessment in neurologic rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "The oral and dental health of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been well documented and the findings are conflicting. Patients with PD were invited to take part in a clinical and radiographic examination together with a comparison control group of persons who were a spouse or family member. Subjects (n = 67) and controls (n = 55) were examined and compared. Subjects with PD had more missing teeth, caries, dental plaque, and poorer periodontal health. Counts of cariogenic bacteria in saliva were significantly higher for subjects with PD. They did not consume more sweets or sugar, did not brush less frequently, used dental floss more than controls, and visited the dentist at least as often. Salivary flow levels were comparable between subjects with PD and controls. The lack of muscular control may explain the poorer oral health of patients with PD. Dentists and patients with PD may be reluctant to embark on complex dental procedures, and this may explain the increased number of missing teeth in persons with PD in this study.",

    "abstract": "Cell-based therapies that involve transplantation into the striatum of dopaminergic cells have attracted considerable interest as possible treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, all double-blind, sham-controlled, studies have failed to meet their primary endpoints, and transplantation of dopamine cells derived from the fetal mesencephalon is associated with a potentially disabling form of dyskinesia that persists even after withdrawal of levodopa (off-medication dyskinesia). In addition, disability in advanced patients primarily results from features such as gait dysfunction, freezing, falling, and dementia, which are likely due to nondopaminergic pathology. These features are not adequately controlled with dopaminergic therapies and are thus unlikely to respond to dopaminergic grafts. More recently, implanted dopamine neurons have been found to contain Lewy bodies, suggesting that they are dysfunctional and may have been affected by the PD pathological process. Collectively, these findings do not bode well for the short-term future of cell-based dopaminergic therapies in PD.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa (LD) is the oldest, most efficacious and best-tolerated drug for dopaminergic substitution of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Its main drawback is its short half-life, which supports onset of motor complications in the long term. Therefore well-informed PD patients mostly accept LD therapy as late as possible. Recent LD trials indicate that a combination of LD with carbidopa (CD) and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone (EN) may reduce the onset of these motor complications to a certain extent. This observation is further supported by pharmacokinetic trials and experimental research, but there is still a need to confirm this in a clinical trial, which is under way. Additionally, combined LD/CD/EN was superior to LD/CD administration regarding cognition, muscle behavior and gastrointestinal function in small clinical trials. Moreover there is accumulating evidence that combined COMT inhibition with LD administration reduces homocysteine synthesis. In the long term, homocysteine elevation supports onset of arteriosclerosis-related disorders, which are more frequent in PD patients according to epidemiological studies than in the normal healthy population. The introduction of LD/CD/EN in one tablet supported patients' preference of COMT inhibition as an essential component of LD/DDI therapy, as this combination reduced number and size of tablets.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) share alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. These \"synucleinopathies\" have overlapping signs and symptoms, but less is known about similarities and differences in their cognitive and neuropsychiatric profiles. We compared the cognitive and neuropsychiatric profiles of individuals with PD, MSA, and DLB. Overall, the DLB group showed the most cognitive impairment, the MSA group demonstrated milder impairment, and the PD group was the least cognitively impaired. The DLB and MSA groups showed worse executive function and visuospatial skills than PD, whereas DLB showed impaired memory relative to both PD and MSA. On the neuropsychiatric screening, all groups endorsed depression and anxiety; the DLB group alone endorsed delusions and disinhibition. Consistent with their greater level of cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment, the DLB group showed the greatest amount of functional impairment on a measure of instrumental activities of daily living (Functional Activities Questionnaire). We found that MSA subjects had cognitive difficulties that fell between the mild deficits of the PD group and the more severe deficits of the DLB group. PD, MSA, and DLB groups have similar neuropsychiatric profiles of increased depression and anxiety. Similar underlying alpha-synuclein pathology may contribute to these shared features.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative condition in the UK. Care needs increase as the disease progresses, but there are very few published data in relation to this.\nthe aim of this study was to elicit the care requirements for a prevalent PD population and compare these to a similarly aged background population.\nall people diagnosed with idiopathic PD from within a defined area of north-east England were asked to participate in this study. Those who agreed to participate were assessed using a number of standard rating scales including Hoehn and Yahr stage, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Parkinson's Disease Questionaire-39 and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). In addition, participants were asked whether they had experienced hallucinations. Social and demographic information (e.g. age, sex and place of abode) was also recorded.\nfrom all cases (n = 161), 135 people (83.8%) agreed to participate. Of these, 19 (14.1%) were living in residential or nursing homes, representing 1.6% of the total nursing/residential home residents in the study area. Participants had a mean age of 74.8 years and disease duration of 5.6 years. Those in care were significantly older and had significantly poorer Hoehn and Yahr, MMSE and UPDRS scores.\nPD patients in institutional care have poorer cognitive function, are older, have later stage disease and worse functional ability than those living at home.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) may affect the autonomic nervous system and may cause constipation; however, few studies have explored constipation preceding the motor onset of PD. We investigated constipation preceding PD using a case-control study design in a population-based sample.\nUsing the medical records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we identified 196 subjects who developed PD in Olmsted County, MN, from 1976 through 1995. Each incident case was matched by age (+/-1 year) and sex to a general population control. We reviewed the complete medical records of cases and controls in the medical records-linkage system to ascertain the occurrence of constipation preceding the onset of PD (or index year).\nConstipation preceding PD or the index year was more common in cases than in controls (odds ratio [OR] 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49 to 4.11; p = 0.0005). This association remained significant after adjusting for smoking and coffee consumption (ever vs never), and after excluding constipation possibly induced by drugs. In addition, the association remained significant in analyses restricted to constipation documented 20 or more years before the onset of motor symptoms of PD. Although the association was stronger in women than in men and in patients with PD with rest tremor compared with patients with PD without rest tremor, these differences were not significant.\nOur findings suggest that constipation occurring as early as 20 or more years before the onset of motor symptoms is associated with an increased risk of Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Due to the high prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in Parkinson disease (PD), routine cognitive screening is important for the optimal management of patients with PD. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is more sensitive than the commonly used Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in detecting MCI and dementia in patients without PD, but its validity in PD has not been established.\nA representative sample of 132 patients with PD at 2 movement disorders centers was administered the MoCA, MMSE, and a neuropsychological battery with operationalized criteria for deficits. MCI and PD dementia (PDD) criteria were applied by an investigator blinded to the MoCA and MMSE results. The discriminant validity of the MoCA and MMSE as screening and diagnostic instruments was ascertained.\nApproximately one third of the sample met diagnostic criteria for a cognitive disorder (12.9% PDD and 17.4% MCI). Mean (SD) MoCA and MMSE scores were 25.0 (3.8) and 28.1 (2.0). The overall discriminant validity for detection of any cognitive disorder was similar for the MoCA and the MMSE (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [95% confidence interval]): MoCA (0.79 [0.72, 0.87]) and MMSE (0.76 [0.67, 0.85]), but as a screening instrument the MoCA (optimal cutoff point = 26/27, 64% correctly diagnosed, lack of ceiling effect) was superior to the MMSE (optimal cutoff point = 29/30, 54% correctly diagnosed, presence of ceiling effect).\nThe Montreal Cognitive Assessment, but not the Mini-Mental State Examination, has adequate psychometric properties as a screening instrument for the detection of mild cognitive impairment or dementia in Parkinson disease. However, a positive screen using either instrument requires additional assessment due to suboptimal specificity at the recommended screening cutoff point.",

    "abstract": "Tracking Parkinson's disease (PD) symptom progression often uses the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) that requires the patient's presence in clinic, and time-consuming physical examinations by trained medical staff. Thus, symptom monitoring is costly and logistically inconvenient for patient and clinical staff alike, also hindering recruitment for future large-scale clinical trials. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate rapid, remote replication of UPDRS assessment with clinically useful accuracy (about 7.5 UPDRS points difference from the clinicians' estimates), using only simple, self-administered, and noninvasive speech tests. We characterize speech with signal processing algorithms, extracting clinically useful features of average PD progression. Subsequently, we select the most parsimonious model with a robust feature selection algorithm, and statistically map the selected subset of features to UPDRS using linear and nonlinear regression techniques that include classical least squares and nonparametric classification and regression trees. We verify our findings on the largest database of PD speech in existence (approximately 6000 recordings from 42 PD patients, recruited to a six-month, multicenter trial). These findings support the feasibility of frequent, remote, and accurate UPDRS tracking. This technology could play a key part in telemonitoring frameworks that enable large-scale clinical trials into novel PD treatments.",

Steady-state responses (SSR) are the result of averaging individual responses to trains of rhythmic stimuli delivered at a constant frequency. The amplitude of the response varies depending on the stimulus modality and stimulation rate, with a frequency of maximal response that is probably associated to the working frequency of the pathway involved. The study of SSR may be of interest in PD as a non-invasive test of cortical oscillatory activity. Our aim was to study the changes in auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of Parkinson's disease in rats. We recorded the ASSR over the auditory cortex in a group of 10 control and 17 6-OHDA lesioned rats (the latter before and after the administration of the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine) both awake and under anesthesia with ketamine/xylazine, using chirp-modulated stimuli. The three conditions (control, lesion, lesion plus apomorphine) were compared with special emphasis on the amplitude, inter-trial phase coherence, and frequency of maximal response. A reduction in the frequency of maximal response (between 40 and 60 Hz) was observed in the 6-OHDA lesioned rats that was normalized after apomorphine injection. The administration of this dopaminergic agonist also reduced the inter-trial phase coherence of the response in frequencies above 170 Hz. These findings suggest that the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system may be involved in the regulation of oscillatory activity not only in motor circuits, but also in sensory responses.",

    "abstract": "A botanical extract (Regrapex-R) prepared from whole grape (Vitis vinifera) and Polygonum cuspidatum, which contains polyphenols, including flavans, anthocyanins, emodin, and resveratrol, exhibited dose-dependent scavenging effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS). The extract inhibited increases of ROS and protein carbonyl in isolated rat liver mitochondria following exposure to 2,2'-azobis (2-amidino propane) dihydrocholoride (AAPH), a potent lipid oxidant generator. The antioxidant effects of this extract were further demonstrated by protecting enzyme activities of the mitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain (complexes I and II) and pyruvate dehydrogenase in isolated liver mitochondria with AAPH insult. In human neuroblastoma cells (SKN-MC), pretreatment of extract protected cells against AAPH induced oxidation in maintaining cell viability and inhibiting excessive ROS generation. Extract was fed to transgenic Drosophila expressing human alpha-synuclein. This model for Parkinson disease recapitulates essential features of the disorder, including loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and a locomotor dysfunction that is displayed by a progressive loss of climbing ability measured using a geotaxis assay. Male transgenic flies fed the extract (0.16-0.64 mg/100 g of culture medium) showed a significant improvement in climbing ability compared to controls. Female transgenic flies showed a significant extension in average lifespan. These results suggest that Regrapex-R is a potent free radical scavenger, a mitochondrial protector, and a candidate for further studies to assess its ability to protect against neurodegenerative disease and potentially extend lifespan.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) has been recently shown to decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. It is also known that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups might confer different coupling properties, resulting in different ROS levels. We hypothesized that potentially functional TFAM variants could influence PD risk depending on haplogroup background. To test this we assessed the role of six TFAM variants on PD risk in 326 PD patients and 316 controls, and correlated it with mtDNA haplogroup clusters (HV, JTKU and a putative functionally different group U4U5a1KJ1cJ2, connected previously with partial uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation). Both genotype and haplotype analysis showed that intronic variant rs2306604 modifies PD risk. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that rs2306604 G/G genotype is an independent risk factor for PD (OR 1.789, 95% CI 1.162-2.755, p=0.008). There was a borderline interaction between G/G genotype and HV haplogroup (p=0.075). Haplotype analysis showed that all three haplotypes containing rs2306604 allele A occurred at higher frequencies in controls, but only one of them reached statistical significance (chi(2) 4.523, p=0.0334). Conversely, four of five haplotypes containing allele G had higher frequencies in PD group, with no statistical significance.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease was long considered a non-hereditary disorder. Despite extensive research trying to find environmental risk factors for the disease, genetic variants now stand out as the major causative factor. Since a number of genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis it seems likely that several molecular pathways and downstream effectors can affect the trophic support and/or the survival of dopamine neurons, subsequently leading to Parkinson's disease. The present review describes how toxin-based animal models have been valuable tools in trying to find the underlying mechanisms of disease, and how identification of disease-linked genes in humans has led to the development of new transgenic rodent models. The review also describes the current status of the most common genetic susceptibility factors for Parkinson's disease identified up to today.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to evaluate pursuit ocular movements (POM) by using a vision-based non-intrusive eye tracker, in patients with suspected Parkinson's disease (PD), before and after L: -Dopa administration. We studied ten patients with suspected diagnosis of idiopathic PD. We compared POM values to those of a group of normal controls (NC), and evaluated them before and after L: -Dopa administration. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor subscores improved significantly (p = 0.001). At baseline, values of POM were lower in suspected PD patients than in NC (p = 0.01). One hour after L: -Dopa administration, POM values correlated with UPDRS motor subscore (p = 0.01). We used a recent method, a new vision-based non-intrusive eye tracker, previously described, which can be proposed as a possible tool for supporting the diagnosis of PD in association with levodopa test, as an add-on to the UPDRS score.",

    "abstract": "A clinically-related animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD) may enable the elucidation of the etiology of the disease and assist the development of medications. However, none of the current neurotoxin-based models recapitulates the main clinical features of the disease or the pathological hallmarks, such as dopamine (DA) neuron specificity of degeneration and Lewy body formation, which limits the use of these models in PD research. To overcome these limitations, we developed a rat model by stereotaxically (ST) infusing small doses of the mitochondrial complex-I inhibitor, rotenone, into two brain sites: the right ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra. Four weeks after ST rotenone administration, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the infusion side decreased by 43.7%, in contrast to a 75.8% decrease observed in rats treated systemically with rotenone (SYS). The rotenone infusion also reduced the DA content, the glutathione and superoxide dismutase activities, and induced alpha-synuclein expression, when compared to the contralateral side. This ST model displays neither peripheral toxicity or mortality and has a high success rate. This rotenone-based ST model thus recapitulates the slow and specific loss of DA neurons and better mimics the clinical features of idiopathic PD, representing a reliable and more clinically-related model for PD research.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have found that Parkinson's disease (PD) disrupts the organization of complex motor sequences regardless of the influence of parkinsonian medications. A clear candidate for the neural bases of such deficits, which we term \"coordinative,\" is the failure to integrate propioceptive and visual information by cortico-striatal circuits in a timed fashion. Recent reports, however, have indicated that deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) may result in an improvement in coordinative deficits beyond the amelioration of \"intensive deficits\" such as bradykinesia and scaling errors. The present study examined the spatio-temporal organization underlying the shaping of the hand during reaching to grasp objects differing in shape. Six PD patients ON and OFF their STN DBS when OFF their concomitant medications and six age-matched controls participated in this study. STN DBS improved the coordination involved in preshaping the hand while grasping. We discuss these results in light of our earlier work with PD patients on and off dopamine replacement therapy.",

    "abstract": "Chronological research on the therapeutic history of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been conducted by Chinese medical treatises from ancient to modern times. It outlines the division by the early, middle, and modern periods. The precise records for the clinical symptoms of PD and its preliminary treatment prescriptions could date back to the Eastern Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD). Thereafter (220 AD-1911), due to an increase in the understanding of PD in Chinese medical science, prescriptions for treatment also sprang up.\nFrequency statistics and cluster analysis have been carried out to elucidate the medication rules and commonly used Chinese medicinal materials (CMM) for prevention and treatment of PD during the middle period.\nIn modern times, the dozens of prescriptions or bioactive ingredients of CMM used for the symptomatic treatment of PD have been shown to be effective in clinical trials. However, an analysis of contemporary Chinese clinical literature on PD has suggested the need for more rigorous research methodology before CMM could be adopted by evidence-based medicine.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade there has been growing interest in the study of the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of patients. Specific instruments have been developed to measure it and today these are frequently applied, together with generic measurements of HRQL, in clinical trials and other studies. This review is part of a series of two papers, the aim of which is to describe the current situation of studies on HRQL in PD and to detect areas in which knowledge is lacking, as a possible guide to researchers in future projects.\nTo review the concepts, instruments, comparative studies and the effect of treatments on the HRQL of patients with PD.\nThe fundamental concepts of HRQL and the instruments used to measure it are described. The main findings as regards comparative studies about the HRQL of patients with PD are also outlined. Finally, the article examines the effect of treatments on HRQL, including alternative therapies.\nDespite the significant progress being made in this field, further studies with a rigorous methodology and longitudinal data are needed.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the gender-related long-term efficacy and safety after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) implant for Parkinson's disease (PD), although some differences could be expected as recently stated in a short-term report. We assessed the possible gender-related differences in clinical outcome and disease progression along a 5-year period after STN DBS for PD. A prospective cohort of PD patients who underwent STN DBS and reached the 5-year follow-up (FU) was considered. Clinical outcome, disease progression and side effects were assessed at baseline and 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery. Eleven men and nine women were included in the study. At baseline, no inter-gender difference of age at implant, disease duration and severity or levodopa responsiveness was detected. A higher motor responsiveness in men compared to women was detected only at 1-year FU: this difference was mainly related to worse lower limb akinesia and gait score in women. The difference was not confirmed at 3 and 5 years. Antiparkinsonian drugs reduction, improvement in motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, functional measures and progression of underlying PD, were comparable in both groups. Women had persistent adverse events comparable to men. The present long-term observation confirms the occurrence of slight gender-related differences in PD patients treated with STN DBS, indicating a transient poorer outcome in women. Further observational time and a wider number of patients are needed to better analyze the dimension of long-term gender-related differences.",

    "abstract": "In both Parkinson disease and in animal models of Parkinson disease, there is a microglial reaction in addition to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain. To determine the pathological role of this microglial reaction, we analyzed the kinetics of microglial activation and dopaminergic cell death induced in rats with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine. As early as Day 1 after the injection, there was a decline in the motor performance of the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats that correlated with a reduction of dopaminergic innervation of the contralateral striatum. Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain developed a few days later and seemed to follow a specific temporospatial pattern. Degenerating neurons and activated microglia were seen only in areas in which dopaminergic cells were no longer observed, suggesting that the loss of the dopaminergic phenotype preceded the degenerative process. In sham-lesioned rats, there was a transient activation of microglia in the vicinity of the needle tract without any cell degeneration. This chronology of events supports the hypothesis that microglial activation is a secondary rather than primary phenomenon in dopaminergic cell degeneration induced by 6-hydroxydopamine.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relationships between history of falls and cholinergic vs dopaminergic denervation in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nThere is a need to explore nondopaminergic mechanisms of gait control as the majority of motor impairments associated with falls in PD are resistant to dopaminergic treatment. Alterations in cholinergic neurotransmission in PD may be implicated because of evidence that gait control depends on cholinergic system-mediated higher-level cortical and subcortical processing, including pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) function.\nIn this cross-sectional study, 44 patients with PD (Hoehn & Yahr stages I-III) without dementia and 15 control subjects underwent a clinical assessment and [(11)C]methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate (PMP) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and [(11)C]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) brain PET imaging.\nSeventeen patients (38.6%) reported a history of falls and 27 patients had no falls. Analysis of covariance of the cortical AChE hydrolysis rates demonstrated reduced cortical AChE in the PD fallers group (-12.3%) followed by the PD nonfallers (-6.6%) compared to control subjects (F = 7.22, p = 0.0004). Thalamic AChE activity was lower only in the PD fallers group (-11.8%; F = 4.36, p = 0.008). There was no significant difference in nigrostriatal dopaminergic activity between PD fallers and nonfallers.\nUnlike nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation, cholinergic hypofunction is associated with fall status in Parkinson disease (PD). Thalamic AChE activity in part represents cholinergic output of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), a key node for gait control. Our results are consistent with other data indicating that PPN degeneration is a major factor leading to impaired postural control and gait dysfunction in PD.",

    "abstract": "Polysomnographic studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with visual hallucinations (VH) usually reveal short, fragmented rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, with lower sleep efficiency and reduced total REM sleep. Quetiapine has been demonstrated in open-label trials to be effective for the treatment of insomnia and VH in PD. To confirm quetiapine's efficacy in improving VH, and to determine whether the mechanism was due to its effect on REM sleep architecture, we performed a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Sixteen PD patients experiencing VH were recruited. Eight patients were randomized to quetiapine and eight patients to placebo. Patients underwent pre- and post-treatment polysomnography. The Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor subscale were obtained. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the treatment arms except that the placebo group had more sleep in stage REM (74.7 min vs. 40.1 min; p < .001). Data were imputed for all patients who prematurely discontinued (four quetiapine and one placebo) in an intention-to-treat analysis. The average quetiapine dose was 58.3 mg/day. While there was no significant difference in the change in REM duration pre- vs. post-treatment in either arm, patients randomized to quetiapine improved on the CGIS (p = .03) and the hallucination item of the BPRS (p = .02). No difference was noted in the UPDRS motor scores. Despite the small sample, this is the first double-blind trial to show quetiapine's efficacy over placebo in controlling VH in the PD population. However, normalization of sleep architecture was not supported as the mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, mainly classified as a movement disorder which manifests among others nonmotor symptoms such as olfactory dysfunction. The etiopathogenesis of this disease has yet to be elucidated, though it seems to be interconnected with a complex set of genetic, environmental, and immunological interactions. This review unfolds the immune alterations observed in PD patients by describing the increase in the innate immune components including complement and cytokines within their substantia nigra and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These alterations extended to the adaptive immune response with the elevation of T cells and autoantibodies (anti-alpha-synuclein and anti-GM1-ganglioside) in the peripheral blood and CSF of PD patients. Interestingly, another etiopathogenic triad has recently emerged linking PD to autoimmunity through olfactory dysfunction. Smell deficit is one of the earliest signs of PD and a unique observation suggesting olfactory declines to be a consequence of autoimmune mechanisms. Therefore, we considered several undisputed autoimmune diseases known for their olfactory consequences as template examples that may shed more light on the relationship between autoimmunity and PD. We hope that understanding the nature of this disease may lay the ground for successes in the quest to halt the progressive neurodegenerative process.",

The controls had a mean age of 75.4 (6.4), 59 (56.7%) men, 96 (92.3%) Caucasians.

Among PD patients, the UFOV Risk Index score of 3 (range 1-5) was established as the optimal cutoff value for passing the on-road test, with sensitivity 87 percent and specificity 82 percent, AUC = 92 percent (SE 0.61, p = .002).

    "abstract": "Complex factors contribute to the appearance of Parkinson's disease (PD), but with a constant mitochondrial involvement. There are two interdependent conditions in PD: brain mitochondrial dysfunction and brain mitochondrial oxidative damage. Mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced complex I activity are recognized in substantia nigra and in frontal cortex in PD patients. The molecular mechanism involved in the inactivation of complex I is likely accounted by the sum of ONOO(-) mediated reactions, reactions with free radical intermediates of the lipid peroxidation process and amine-aldehyde adduction reactions. The inhibitory effects on complex I lead synergistically to denaturation of the protein structure and to further increases of O(2)(-) and ONOO(-) production at the vicinity of complex I. An adaptive response in PD patients has been described with increases in mtNOS activity, mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondrial dysfunction in the human frontal cortex is to be considered a factor contributing to impaired cognition in PD.",

    "abstract": "To identify susceptibility variants for Parkinson's disease (PD), we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and two replication studies in a total of 2,011 cases and 18,381 controls from Japan. We identified a new susceptibility locus on 1q32 (P = 1.52 x 10(-12)) and designated this as PARK16, and we also identified BST1 on 4p15 as a second new risk locus (P = 3.94 x 10(-9)). We also detected strong associations at SNCA on 4q22 (P = 7.35 x 10(-17)) and LRRK2 on 12q12 (P = 2.72 x 10(-8)), both of which are implicated in autosomal dominant forms of parkinsonism. By comparing results of a GWAS performed on individuals of European ancestry, we identified PARK16, SNCA and LRRK2 as shared risk loci for PD and BST1 and MAPT as loci showing population differences. Our results identify two new PD susceptibility loci, show involvement of autosomal dominant parkinsonism loci in typical PD and suggest that population differences contribute to genetic heterogeneity in PD.",

    "abstract": "We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 1,713 individuals of European ancestry with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 3,978 controls. After replication in 3,361 cases and 4,573 controls, we observed two strong association signals, one in the gene encoding alpha-synuclein (SNCA; rs2736990, OR = 1.23, P = 2.24 x 10(-16)) and another at the MAPT locus (rs393152, OR = 0.77, P = 1.95 x 10(-16)). We exchanged data with colleagues performing a GWAS in Japanese PD cases. Association to PD at SNCA was replicated in the Japanese GWAS, confirming this as a major risk locus across populations. We replicated the effect of a new locus detected in the Japanese cohort (PARK16, rs823128, OR = 0.66, P = 7.29 x 10(-8)) and provide supporting evidence that common variation around LRRK2 modulates risk for PD (rs1491923, OR = 1.14, P = 1.55 x 10(-5)). These data demonstrate an unequivocal role for common genetic variants in the etiology of typical PD and suggest population-specific genetic heterogeneity in this disease.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed the presence of awareness of movement disorders (dyskinesias and hypokinesias) in 25 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and motor fluctuations (dyskinesias, wearing off, on-off fluctuations). Of the few studies that have dealt with this topic, none have analyzed the differences in the awareness of motor deficits by comparing the on and off states using motor scales and an extensive battery of tests to assess cognitive and behavioral functioning.\nPD patients were compared on three different scales that we have devised to measure awareness of movement disorders: Global Awareness of Movement (GAM) Disorders, dyskinesia/hypo-bradykinesia rating scales.\nData showed that PD patients had greater awareness and psychological suffering in the off state than in the on state. In particular, they were troubled by motor disabilities related to hypokinesias and had mood-related symptoms and a perception of disability in activities of daily living. Interestingly, patients only showed a selective reduction of awareness of movement disorders associated with executive functions and related to dyskinesias in the on state, compared to a preserved awareness of hypokinesias in the off state. On the contrary, no association with executive functions was found in the off state.\nOur findings suggest that the dopaminergic overstimulation of mesocorticolimbic pathways may cause a dysfunction of prefrontal-subcortical connections related to the impaired insight.",

Interestingly, patients only showed a selective reduction of awareness of movement disorders associated with executive functions and related to dyskinesias in the on state, compared to a preserved awareness of hypokinesias in the off state. On the contrary, no association with executive functions was found in the off state.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (DBS-STN) is an approved treatment for advanced Parkinson disease (PD) patients; however, there is a need to further evaluate its effect on gait. This study compares logistic regression (LR), probabilistic neural network (PNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for discriminating between normal and PD subjects in assessing the effects of DBS-STN on ground reaction force (GRF) with and without medication. Gait analysis of 45 subjects (30 normal and 15 PD subjects who underwent bilateral DBS-STN) was performed. PD subjects were assessed under four test conditions: without treatment (mof-sof), with stimulation alone (mof-son), with medication alone (mon-sof), and with medication and stimulation (mon-son). Principal component (PC) analysis was applied to the three components of GRF separately, where six PC scores from vertical, one from anterior-posterior and one from medial-lateral were chosen by the broken stick test. Stepwise LR analysis employed the first two and fifth vertical PC scores as input variables. Using the bootstrap approach to compare model performances for classifying GRF patterns from normal and untreated PD subjects, the first three and the fifth vertical PCs were attained as SVM input variables, while the same ones plus the first anterior-posterior were selected as PNN input variables. PNN performed better than LR and SVM according to area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the negative likelihood ratio. When evaluating treatment effects, the classifiers indicated that DBS-STN alone was more effective than medication alone, but the greatest improvements occurred with both treatments together.",

    "abstract": "Early phases of Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by a mild reduction of dopamine (DA) in striatum and by emergence of psychiatric disturbances that precede overt motor symptoms. In order to characterize the neurochemical re-arrangements induced by such striatal impairment, we used a mouse model in which a low dose of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was bilaterally injected into the dorsal striatum. These mice showed a DA reduction of about 40% that remained stable up to 12 weeks after injection. This reduction was accompanied by changes in DA metabolite levels, such as HVA, transiently reduced at 4 weeks, and DOPAC, decreased at 12 weeks. No change in the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels was found but the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)/5-HT ratio was increased at 4 weeks. In addition, at the same time-point, the levels of 15-F(2t)-IsoP, an index of oxidative stress, and of PGE(2), a major product of cyclooxygenase-2, were decreased in different brain areas while BDNF levels were increased. These neurochemical changes were accompanied by altered behavioral responses concerning the emotional reactivity. Overall, the present findings suggest that a change of 5-HT metabolism and a modification of oxidative stress levels may play a role in the early PD degeneration phases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, after Alzheimer's disease. The potential causes of PD remain uncertain, but recent studies suggest neuroinflammation and microglia activation play important roles in PD pathogenesis. Major unanswered questions include whether protein aggregates cause the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that underlies the clinical symptoms and whether neuroinflammation is a consequence or a cause of nigral cell loss. Within the microenvironment of the brain, glial cells play a critical role in homeostatic mechanisms that promote neuronal survival. Microglia have a specialized immune surveillance role and mediate innate immune responses to invading pathogens by secreting a myriad of factors that include, cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and growth factors. Some of these factors have neuroprotective and trophic activities and aid in brain repair processes; while others enhance oxidative stress and trigger apoptotic cascades in neurons. Therefore, pro- and anti-inflammatory responses must be in balance to prevent the potential detrimental effects of prolonged or unregulated inflammation-induced oxidative stress on vulnerable neuronal populations. In this review, we discuss potential triggers of neuroinflammation and review the strongest direct evidence that chronic neuroinflammation may have a more important role to play in PD versus other neurodegenerative diseases. Alternatively, we propose that genetic deficiency is not the only way to reduce protective factors in the brain which may function to keep microglial responses in check or regulate the sensitivity of DA neurons. If chronic inflammation can be shown to decrease the levels of neuroprotective factors in the midbrain, in essence genetic haploinsufficiency of protective factors such as Parkin or RGS10 may result from purely environmental triggers (aging, chronic systemic disease, etc.), increasing the vulnerability to inflammation-induced nigral DA neuron death and predisposing an individual to development of PD. Lastly, we review the latest epidemiological and experimental evidence supporting the potential use of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs as neuroprotective agents to delay the progressive nigrostriatal degeneration that leads to motor dysfunction in PD.",

    "abstract": "Iron-induced oxidative stress is thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Based on our previous in vivo experiments showing that down-regulation of the iron transporters ferroportin 1 (FP1) and hephaestin (HP) might account for the nigral iron accumulation in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned animal models, in this study we investigated whether FP1 and HP were involved in cellular iron accumulation and the underlying mechanisms in a cell model of PD. The findings showed that 6-OHDA induced FP1 and HP down-regulation, followed by decreased iron efflux and iron accumulation in primary ventral mesencephalic neurons and MES23.5 dopaminergic cells. Silencing of FP1 but not HP led to increased iron levels and aggravated reactive oxygen species generation in MES23.5 cells. Under iron-overloaded conditions, FP1 showed dose-dependent up-regulation, whereas HP showed no response, indicating their down-regulation was not due to the increased intracellular iron content. In 6-OHDA-treated cells, both iron-regulatory protein (IRP) 1 and IRP2 were up-regulated, and silencing of IRPs in MES23.5 cells dramatically blocked 6-OHDA-induced FP1 down-regulation and reversed HP down-regulation. These results suggest that FP1 but not HP contributes to 6-OHDA-induced intracellular iron accumulation, and down-regulation of FP1 and HP by 6-OHDA is IRPs-dependent.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) show marked impairments in their ability to generate self-initiated, or \"voluntary\", saccadic eye movements. Investigations of visually guided, or \"reflexive\", saccades have, on the other hand, produced inconclusive results with studies showing response times (RTs) in persons with PD that are slower, faster, or indistinguishable from those of controls. We performed a meta-analysis to establish whether there are consistent effects of PD on the metrics of visually guided saccades. Combining results across 47 studies we found that reflexive saccades are overall initiated more slowly in persons with PD than in controls, however, this analysis also revealed considerable heterogeneity across studies. Step-wise meta-regression, using eleven potential predictors, subsequently showed that differences in mean RT between controls and persons with PD may arise due to aspects of experimental design. In particular, mean target eccentricity was shown to impact substantially on RTs such that persons with PD predictably initiate saccades faster than controls at small target eccentricities, while responding more slowly for large target eccentricities. Changes in eye-tracking and display equipment over the period covered by the review were also found to have impacted on the pattern of results obtained. We conclude that a, previously unsuspected, eccentricity effect could explain why the saccadic eye movements of persons with PD are sometimes found to be \"hyper-reflexive\" compared to controls, and suggest that this effect may arise due to PD-induced changes in both peripheral perceptual processing and in central executive mechanisms involving the basal ganglia.",

    "abstract": "Retroperitoneal fibrosis is best described as a chronic inflammatory process which may be idiopathic, but can rarely be brought about by medications, such as pergolide, used for treating Parkinson's disease. Pergolide can produce a fibrotic process in heart valves, resulting in valve insufficiency in up to 25% of cases. Herein we describe the case of a 68-year-old man who received pergolide for 2 years for Parkinson's disease. The patient developed retroperitoneal fibrosis resulting in renal failure from ureteral obstruction necessitating ureteral stenting, as well as significant aortic and mitral valve insufficiency. He successfully underwent surgery for combined aortic valve, mitral valve and ascending aorta replacement because of severe valve insufficiency and dilated (d = 5.8 cm) ascending aorta. Retroperitoneal fibrosis improved with pergolide cessation and corticosteroid treatment. This is the second case reported in the literature, of a patient who had double valve and ascending aorta replacement surgery because he suffered from this rare but serious adverse effect of dopamine agonists used for managing Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Whilst an association between the tau gene (MAPT)-containing H1 haplotype and supranuclear gaze palsy (PSP) has long been recognized, the effect of H1 on risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) has remained more contentious.\nHerein, we examined the association of H1 and PD in three Caucasian PD patient-control series from Ireland, Norway, and the US (combined: n = 2619), by genotyping two H1/H2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MAPT (rs1052553) and in the Saitohin gene (rs62063857) and one H1-specific SNP (rs242557).\nWe identified a significant association between H1/H2 and risk of PD (rs1052553 OR: 1.43, CI: 1.23-1.64; rs62063857 OR: 1.45, CI: 1.27-1.67), but no effect of the H1-specific SNP rs242557 (OR: 0.92, CI: 0.82-1.03).\nOur findings show that the H1 haplotype is a significant risk factor for PD. However, one H1-specific SNP (rs242557) previously implicated in PSP did not alter the risk of PD, indicating that distinct H1 sub-haplotypes probably drive the associations with PD and PSP.",

However, these desynchronies have not been defined at the molecular level.\nUsing real-time RT-PCR assay, we analyzed the expression profiles of two principle clock genes, PER1 and BMAL1, in total leukocytes for 12 h during the evening, overnight and morning in subjects with PD and age/sex-matched healthy controls.\nA difference in the expression pattern of BMAL1 but not PER1 was apparent during the dark span, where the relative abundance of BMAL1 was significantly lower in PD patients versus control subjects at 21:00, 00:00 and 06:00 h. Furthermore, expression levels of BMAL1 in PD patients correlated with their United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score at 06:00, 09:00 h, and with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score at 06:00 h.\nThese results suggest that a peripheral molecular clock, as reflected in the dampened expression of the clock genes BMAL1 in total leukocytes, is altered in PD patients. In addition, the relative BMAL1 levels correlate positively with PD severity, which could provide a molecular basis to help monitor disease progression and response to investigational drugs.",

    "abstract": "The Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD) for Autonomic Symptoms (SCOPA-AUT) is a specific scale to assess autonomic dysfunction in PD patients. It was developed and validated under the classic test theory approach. This study sought to test whether the SCOPA-AUT meets item response theory standards for reliability, internal construct validity, response category ordering, and differential item functioning by gender and age group.\nThe Rasch measurement model was applied to a sample of 385 PD patients.\nModel fit was obtained after the response categories were rescored and item 10-Incomplete emptying deleted because of redundancy. Person separation index, a reliability measure, was 0.82. All but two items (2-Sialorrhea and 13-Nocturia) were free of gender- and age-related bias. The strict tests of unidimensionality were met, indicating the validity of the total sumscore. Scale targeting suggested the need for items representing milder autonomic symptoms.\nSuggestions for improving the SCOPA-AUT include a shorter scale with a simpler response scheme and a combination of sexual items for men and women. The resulting SCOPA-AUT is a reliable scale, with good internal construct validity, providing Rasch transformed results on a linear metric scale.",

    "abstract": "Previous volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) utilized primarily voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and investigated mostly patients with moderate- to late-stage disease. We now use deformation-based morphometry (DBM), a method purported to be more sensitive than VBM, to test for atrophy in patients with early-stage PD.\nT1-weighted MRI images from 24 early-stage PD patients and 26 age-matched normal control subjects were compared using DBM. Two separate studies were conducted, where two minimally-biased nonlinear intensity-average were created; one for all subjects and another for just the PD patients. The DBM technique creates an average population-based MRI-average in an iterative hierarchical fashion. The nonlinear transformations estimated to match each subject to the MRI-average were then analysed.\nThe DBM comparison between patients and controls revealed significant contraction in the left cerebellum, and non-significant trends towards frontal, temporal and cingulate sulcal expansions with frontal and temporal white matter contractions. Within the patient group, the unified PD rating scores were highly correlated with local expansions in or near sulci bordering on frontal and temporal cortex.\nOur results suggest that DBM could be a sensitive method for detecting morphological changes in early-stage PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex multigenic neurodisorder frequently occurring in elderly persons. To investigate noncoding tiny microRNA mediated gene regulation, miRanda (version 1.0b) was used to predict human miRNA target sites on selected 29 genes related to PD. To verify output generated from miRanda, a similar analysis was performed only for microRNA target sites in 3'UTR using TargetScan (version 5.1). Data extracted by miRanda elucidates the mode of microRNA action based on the location of target sites in the Parkinson genes. Sites prone to action of multiple miRNAs were identified as \"hot spots.\" Important properties of each miRNA including multiplicity and cooperativity appear to contribute towards a complex interplay between miRNAs and their targets. Two sets of predicted results were explored for the occurrence of target sites of 112 miRNAs expressed in midbrain. Overall, convergence of results predicted by two algorithms revealed that 48 target sites for midbrain-specific miRNA occur in close proximity in 9 genes. This study will pave a way for selection of potential miRNA candidates for Parkinson's disease-related genes for quick therapeutic applications and diagnosis.",

Because it is known that there is a link between DA loss in mesolimbic system and depression, we hypothesized that PD patients without depression would have spared limbic DA projections. Consequently, levodopa medication could overdose limbic regions relative to severe dorsal striatal denervation. To evaluate the effect of levodopa on amygdala activation, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in nondemented, nondepressed PD patients compared with healthy volunteers. Patients with PD and healthy subjects received either levodopa or placebo in 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions. Amygdala activation was evaluated during a facial emotion recognition task. A similar right-amygdala activity was seen in both healthy subjects and PD patients in the placebo session. After levodopa administration, activity was reduced in both groups. In the patients, the levodopa dose used significantly improved motor dysfunction. Nondemented, nondepressed PD patients thus seem to have relatively preserved DA mesolimbic projections, and consequently, the same dose of levodopa needed to correct the lack of DA in the severely depleted putamen (motor part of striatum) would incidentally overdose the mesolimbic projections toward the amygdala.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the usefulness of the visual information about the location of the contacts in deep brain stimulation (DBS) programming, we compared the outcomes of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation before and after reprogramming guided by the fused images of MRI and CT.\nOf the 65 patients with Parkinson's disease, who underwent bilateral STN-DBS surgery between March 2005 and September 2006 and had been managed for at least 6 months with conventional programming which was only based on the physiological responses from the patients, 54 patients were reprogrammed based on the 3D anatomical location of the contacts revealed by the fused images of pre-operative MRI and post-operative CT scans taken at 6 months after surgery. A total 51 patients completed the evaluation after reprogramming.\nReprogramming significantly improved the UPDRS part III scores during the on- and off-medication condition. The daily levodopa-equivalent dose was significantly reduced. Improvement in the UPDRS part III scores after reprogramming was greater in the patients with electrodes in the STN than the patients with electrodes off the STN.\nCT-MR fusion images helped to reprogram stimulation parameters with ease and confidence in a time-saving manner and resulted in further clinical improvement. This method could complement the conventional method of adjusting stimulation parameters after bilateral STN-DBS.",

The existence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) significantly limits its development. In this study, lactoferrin (Lf)-modified nanoparticles (NPs) were used as a potential non-viral gene vector due to its brain-targeting and BBB-crossing ability.\nThe neuroprotective effects were examined in a rotenone-induced chronic rat model of PD after treatment with NPs encapsulating human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor gene (hGDNF) via a regimen of multiple dosing intravenous administration. The results showed that multiple injections of Lf-modified NPs obtained higher GDNF expression and this gene expression was maintained for a longer time than the one with a single injection. Multiple dosing intravenous administration of Lf-modified NPs could significantly improve locomotor activity, reduce dopaminergic neuronal loss, and enhance monoamine neurotransmitter levels on rotenone-induced PD rats, which indicates its powerful neuroprotective effects.\nThe findings may have implications for long-term non-invasive gene therapy for neurodegenerative diseases in general.",

    "abstract": "Neuromodulatory or even neuroprotective therapy could soon be available for Parkinson's disease (PD), raising the question of how we should define and measure disease progression. Reported evidence suggests that several symptoms worsen with disease duration. Bradykinesia, rigidity, and activities of daily living deteriorate faster at the beginning of the disease, and this deterioration is paralleled by a decline in functional presynaptic dopaminergic activity, as shown by imaging techniques. Cognitive, speech, sleep, and gait difficulties might progress linearly in proportion to disease duration. Reduced variability in heart rate, orthostatic dysfunction, and visual hallucinations start to develop at mid-stage disease and are more common in late stages than earlier stages. In this Review, we summarise our current understanding of the progression of PD-associated symptoms and markers and conclude that an effective measurement of progression of PD must adapt to the different stages of the disease. In addition to routine clinical rating scales, new quantitative assessments of motor and non-motor symptoms, which should be more broadly available, reasonably priced, and easy-to-use, are needed.",

    "abstract": "To date, there have been few systematic attempts to provide a standard operating procedure for the neuropathological diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Pathological examination cannot classify the clinical syndrome with certainty; therefore, the neuropathological diagnosis is, at best, a probability statement. The neuropathological diagnosis of parkinsonism has become increasingly based on fundamental molecular underpinnings, with recognition that the genetics of parkinsonism is heterogeneous and includes disorders that are associated with and without Lewy bodies. The advent of alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry has substantially improved the ability to identify Lewy pathology, particularly cortical Lewy bodies and smaller aggregates within processes and the neuropil. In this Review we discuss the diagnostic criteria for the neuropathological assessment of PD. These criteria are provisional and need to be validated through an iterative process that could help with their refinement. Additionally, we suggest future directions for neuropathology research on PD.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine is an essential neurotransmitter for many brain functions, and its dysfunction has been implicated in both neurological and psychiatric disorders. Parkinson's disease is an archetypal disorder of dopamine dysfunction characterised by motor, cognitive, behavioural, and autonomic symptoms. While effective for motor symptoms, dopamine replacement therapy is associated not only with motor side-effects, such as levodopa-induced dyskinesia, but also behavioural side-effects such as impulse control disorders (eg, pathological gambling and shopping, binge eating, and hypersexuality), punding (ie, abnormal repetitive non-goal oriented behaviours), and compulsive medication use. We review clinical features, overlapping molecular mechanisms, and a specific cognitive mechanism of habit learning that might underlie these behaviours. We integrate these mechanisms with the emerging view of the basal ganglia as a distributive system involved in the selection and facilitation of movements, acts, and emotions.",

    "abstract": "A dopaminergic deficiency in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) causes abnormalities of movement, behaviour, learning, and emotions. The main motor features (ie, tremor, rigidity, and akinesia) are associated with a deficiency of dopamine in the posterior putamen and the motor circuit. Hypokinesia and bradykinesia might have a dual anatomo-functional basis: hypokinesia mediated by brainstem mechanisms and bradykinesia by cortical mechanisms. The classic pathophysiological model for PD (ie, hyperactivity in the globus pallidus pars interna and substantia nigra pars reticulata) does not explain rigidity and tremor, which might be caused by changes in primary motor cortex activity. Executive functions (ie, planning and problem solving) are also impaired in early PD, but are usually not clinically noticed. These impairments are associated with dopamine deficiency in the caudate nucleus and with dysfunction of the associative and other non-motor circuits. Apathy, anxiety, and depression are the main psychiatric manifestations in untreated PD, which might be caused by ventral striatum dopaminergic deficit and depletion of serotonin and norepinephrine. In this Review we discuss the motor, cognitive, and psychiatric manifestations associated with the dopaminergic deficiency in the early phase of the parkinsonian state and the different circuits implicated, and we propose distinct mechanisms to explain the wide clinical range of PD symptoms at the time of diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinaemia was reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with l-Dopa. The increase in plasma concentration of this sulfur compound arises from the massive methylation of the drug operated by the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which acts as a powerful sink of methyl groups. The contemporary occurrence of C677T polymorphism in homozygosity, leading to a temperature-labile variant of the MTHFR enzyme, induces an even more marked increase in tHcy. Here we show that l-Dopa administration in hyperhomocysteinemic PD patients is able to lower intracellular concentration of S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in erythrocytes (RBC), while the occurrence of hyperhomocysteinaemia causes a significant increase in S-Adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) level. In patients with PD treated with l-Dopa and hyperhomocysteinemic, the remarkable decrease in AdoMet and the concurrent increase in AdoHcy concentration both contribute to significantly lower the transmethylation potential ([AdoMet]/[AdoHcy]), a useful index of the effectiveness of methyl group transfer by methyltransferases. This decrease could indeed contribute to partly attenuate, through a self-limiting kinetic mechanism, the tendency of developing drug resistance, partly mediated in these patients by COMT upregulation. Our results also support the conclusion that COMT inhibitors (entacapone or tolcapone), when administered in PD patients treated with l-Dopa, may potentiate the endogenous AdoHcy-dependent COMT inhibition mechanism already operative in a variable fashion.",

    "abstract": "Early- and late-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD and LOPD) have been associated with mutations in the PARKIN gene. Several studies have reported association of Parkinson's disease (PD) with different polymorphisms in different ethnic populations. To study the role of PARKIN polymorphisms as risk factors for PD in a genetically homogeneous northeastern Mexican population, four previously described coding polymorphisms (Ser167Asn, Val380Leu, Arg366Trp, and Asp394Asn) were analyzed by using the PCR-RFLP technique. This case-control study comprised 117 unrelated patients (mean age 59+/-12 years, range 25-83 years) and 122 healthy unrelated control subjects (mean age 50+/-15 years, range 25-85 years). The homozygous Trp366 and Asn394 genotypes were not present in our study. The Ser167Asn and Val380Leu polymorphisms were not associated with this disease. For the control group, Ser167Asn and Val380Leu were in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium. Given that the main causes of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in controls are selection bias or genotyping error, a competing risk of death associated with the mutant gene could be an explanation of this disequilibrium and lack of association.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is usually defined as a lack of motivation. It may occur as part of another disorder (notably depression and dementia) or as an isolated syndrome. In Parkinson's disease (PD), apathy is common and several studies have reported an association between this condition and more severe cognitive symptoms, such as executive dysfunction. However, this association has not been thoroughly investigated. The aim of this study (in nondepressed, nondemented PD patients) was to examine whether or not cognitive decline and/or dementia occurred more frequently in apathetic subjects than in nonapathetic subjects. Forty consecutive PD patients participated in the study (20 with apathy and 20 without). None of the subjects were either demented or depressed at the time of study entry. The patients' cognitive functions were extensively assessed twice: at study entry and after an 18-month follow-up period. At study entry, the apathetic PD patients had significantly lower global cognitive status and executive function scores than the nonapathetic subjects. After a median period of 18 months, the rate of conversion to dementia was found to be significantly higher in the apathetic group than in the nonapathetic group (8 of 20 and 1 of 20, respectively). Even in nondemented patients, the decrease over time in cognitive performance (mainly executive function but also memory impairment) was significantly greater in apathetic subjects than in nonapathetic subjects. These findings suggest that in nondemented, nondepressed PD patients, apathy may be a predictive factor for dementia and cognitive decline over time.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effects of bromocriptine on bladder function in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and compare these effects with those of (L-dopa). We recruited 8 patients with PD. Urodynamic study (UDS) was performed before and 1 hour after administering 100 mg L-dopa/decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI) and 2.5 hours after administering 7.5 mg bromocriptine. After the bromocriptine administration, urinary urgency aggravated. UDS revealed a decreased bladder volume at which detrusor overactivity (DO) was initiated, a decreased bladder volume at first sensation of bladder filling (FSV) (P < 0.05), an increased maximum Watts Factor value (WFmax) (detrusor contractility), a decreased Abrams-Griffiths (AG) number (urethral obstruction), and a decreased postvoid residual (PVR) (P < 0.01). Similarly, after the L-dopa administration, urinary urgency aggravated. UDS revealed an aggravated DO (P < 0.05), a decreased FSV and bladder capacity (P < 0.01, 0.05), an increased WFmax (P < 0.05), an increased AG number, and a decreased PVR (P < 0.01). A single dose of bromocriptine proved to exacerbate urinary urgency and DO in the storage phase, and improve bladder emptying through increased detrusor contractility and decreased bladder outlet obstruction, within hours. With the exception of bladder outlet obstruction, these effects of bromocriptine are similar to the effects of L-dopa, albeit slightly less pronounced.",

    "abstract": "Impulsivity may be induced by therapeutic interventions (dopamine replacement therapies and sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The present review has two goals. First, to describe the most frequently encountered facets of cognitive impulsivity and to stress the links between cognitive impulsivity and aspects such as reward-related decision making, risk-taking, and time-processing in healthy population. The most widely used related cognitive impulsivity paradigms are presented. Second, to review the results of studies on cognitive impulsivity in healthy volunteers and in patients with PD, the latter support the applicability and clinical relevance of this construct in PD population. Data show that PD treatments may favor impulsivity via different mechanisms. Suggestions on the roles of dopamine and STN in the pathophysiology of cognitive impulsivity are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Deprenyl and Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism (DATATOP) and Parkinson Research Examination of CEP-1347 Trial (PRECEPT) were two clinical trials of potential disease-modifying agents for Parkinson's disease that used the time to reaching disability sufficient to require dopaminergic therapy as the primary endpoint. To compare the thresholds for initiating dopaminergic treatment for Parkinson's disease between the two studies, conducted fifteen years apart. Baseline and 12-month endpoint characteristics for subjects in the placebo arms of the two studies were compared. DATATOP placebo subjects had slightly higher total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores at baseline than PRECEPT placebo subjects (26.1 vs. 23.6, P = 0.03). Time to endpoint was not significantly different. Mean total UPDRS scores at endpoint among those subjects reaching endpoint by 12 months were 48.4 in DATATOP and 37.5 in PRECEPT (P < 0.0001). Baseline disease severity and time to disability requiring dopaminergic therapy were similar in the DATATOP and PRECEPT trials. The threshold for starting dopaminergic treatment was lower in PRECEPT than in the earlier DATATOP study. This may relate to changes in philosophies with respect to starting treatment for Parkinson's disease, but the factors underlying this change remain to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "A clinical overlap between Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET) has prompted a discussion whether these conditions share common genetic susceptibility factors. Recently, the first genome-wide association study in ET revealed a significant association with a variant in the LINGO1 gene. LINGO1 has also been demonstrated to play a role in the survival of dopaminergic neurons in an animal model of PD, and therefore constitutes a potential candidate gene for PD. In this study, SNPs rs9652490, rs11856808, and rs7177008 of LINGO1 were genotyped in a total of 694 Austrian subjects (349 PD, 345 controls). No association could be found between genotype or allele counts and PD. Neither did a subgroup analysis in tremor-dominant patients with PD reveal a significant association. This study on LINGO1-variants in PD argues against a major role of LINGO1 gene variations for PD.",

    "abstract": "To further characterize the short-term levodopa response in early PD, we performed a retrospective analysis of the ELLDOPA study which randomized 361 early PD subjects to placebo, levodopa 150, 300, or 600 mg/day. We evaluated change in UPDRS motor scores (UPDRSm) from baseline to weeks 9 and 24, and identified changes in UPDRSm that best discriminated treatment with levodopa from placebo. Linear regressions were used to determine associations between baseline characteristics and changes in UPDRSm. Mean percent improvement in UPDRSm in levodopa-treated subjects was greater than that for placebo-treated subjects (27.4% vs. 5.8% at 9 weeks, P < 0.001 and 26.2% vs. 4.0% at 24 weeks, P < 0.001). UPDRSm change at 9 weeks ranged from -92.9% (improvement) to 85.7% (worsening) for levodopa and -86.7% to 160% for placebo, and at 24 weeks ranged from -100.0% to 242.9% for levodopa and -87.5% to 112.5% for placebo. UPDRSm improvements of 22.0% at 9 weeks and 23.8% at 24 weeks best discriminated treatment with levodopa 300 mg/day (a common initial maintenance dosage in clinical practice) from placebo. Significant associations were not observed between baseline subject characteristics and magnitude of response from baseline to week 24. We conclude that although levodopa treatment significantly improved PD signs when compared with placebo, there was a wide range and considerable overlap in clinical responses to levodopa and placebo. A substantial proportion of subjects with early PD did not experience a robust response to levodopa. An improvement in UPDRSm of approximately 22% best discriminated levodopa treatment from placebo.",

    "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms occur in up to 40% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Clozapine and quetiapine, two atypical antipsychotic drugs, at doses markedly lower than those effective in schizophrenia, which, nevertheless, still cause sedation, hypotension, and other side effects, are widely used to treat psychotic symptoms in patients with PD psychosis (PDP), although quetiapine has never been shown to be effective in a placebo-controlled study. The demonstrated efficacy of clozapine in PDP has been attributed to serotonin (5-HT(2A)) receptor blockade. We postulated that pimavanserin (ACP-103), a highly selective 5-HT(2A) inverse agonist, would attenuate psychosis in patients with PDP, but avoid motoric worsening and non-motoric side effects. In this double-blind, randomized multicenter 28-day study, the tolerability and efficacy of pimavanserin was compared with placebo in 60 patients with L-DOPA or dopamine (DA) agonist-induced PDP. Motor function was evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts II and III. Antipsychotic efficacy was evaluated using multiple measures from the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and a UPDRS Part I psychosis-relevant item. Pimavanserin did not differentiate from placebo with regard to motor impairment, sedation, hypotension, or other side effects. The principal measures of efficacy of antipsychotic response to pimavanserin, the SAPS total domain score, only showed a trend. However, the pimavanserin-treated patients showed significantly greater improvement in some but not all measures of psychosis, including SAPS global measures of hallucinations and delusions, persecutory delusions, and the UPDRS measure of delusions and hallucinations. Pimavanserin showed significantly greater improvement in psychosis in patients with PDP at a dose which did not impair motor function, or cause sedation or hypotension Thus, pimavanserin may represent a novel treatment for PDP. Furthermore, these results support the hypothesis that attenuation of psychosis secondary to DA receptor stimulation in PDP may be achieved through selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonism.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a wearable assistant for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with the freezing of gait (FOG) symptom. This wearable system uses on-body acceleration sensors to measure the patients' movements. It automatically detects FOG by analyzing frequency components inherent in these movements. When FOG is detected, the assistant provides a rhythmic auditory signal that stimulates the patient to resume walking. Ten PD patients tested the system while performing several walking tasks in the laboratory. More than 8 h of data were recorded. Eight patients experienced FOG during the study, and 237 FOG events were identified by professional physiotherapists in a post hoc video analysis. Our wearable assistant was able to provide online assistive feedback for PD patients when they experienced FOG. The system detected FOG events online with a sensitivity of 73.1% and a specificity of 81.6%. The majority of patients indicated that the context-aware automatic cueing was beneficial to them. Finally, we characterize the system performance with respect to the walking style, the sensor placement, and the dominant algorithm parameters.",

    "abstract": "We occasionally observe cranial synkinesias that involve a lateral jaw movement ipsilateral to the horizontal gaze deviation in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and normal subjects. We term this conjugated movement 'ocular-jaw synkinesia' (OJS). The clinical and electrophysiological features of OJS are described in this study.\nEighty-two subjects were enrolled, 33 PD, 33 non-ill caregivers, and 16 multi system atrophy (MSA-p) patients. The subjects and patients were assessed clinically and electrophysiologically. The data were registered using two scales. The clinical findings were registered using the OJS scale, and the electrophysiological findings were registered using the eyes and chin ipsilateral deviation (ECD) scale. All subjects underwent a video recording.\nTwenty-eight out of the 33 PD patients (84.7%) (P: 0.0141) and 25 out of the 33 normal subjects (83.3%) (P: 0.0144) displayed signs of OJS. None of the MSA-p patients showed signs of OJS, and 13 of the 16 control subjects (81.2%) showed OJS (p: 0.014). Twenty-nine out of the 33 PD patients (87.8%) (P: 0.0123) and 27 out of the 33 normal subjects (90%) (P: 0.0112) showed ECD at the electrophysiological examination. None of the MSA-p patients displayed ECD, showing a strong statistical significance when compared to control subjects (K: 0.0011).\nOJS is a normal and common synkinetic cranial movement easy to observe in PD and normal subjects on both physical and electrophysiological examinations. In contrast, the MSA-p patients showed no physical or electrophysiological signs of OJS in this study.\nThe presence of OJS is supportive of the clinical diagnosis of PD; its absence is uncommon in PD and may suggest an alternative Parkinsonism such as MSA-p.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD) are chronic neurodegenerative conditions of the brain with a variety of clinical presentations including a disorder of movement and a range of nonmotor deficits. HD is genetic in origin and the causative gene and protein known, namely mutant Huntingtin, which leads to widespread early neuronal dysfunction and death throughout the brain. In contrast, the etiology of sporadic PD is unknown, and the pathology targets the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons with the formation of alpha-synuclein positive Lewy bodies. In both diseases, the ability to accurately diagnose the disease in the early stages and monitor progression over time remains a major challenge given the majority of the pathology is sited deep within the CNS. This challenge has gained extra significance as the development of disease-modifying drugs starts to emerge into the clinic. To this end, there is a need to find biomarkers that will help in the accurate diagnosis of the disease and/or prediction of its clinical onset as well as biomarkers that are able to faithfully track disease progression independent of any symptomatic effects of any therapies. In addition, these same markers may also help stratify each of these heterogeneous disorders into specific subtypes that share particular clinical and pathological characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial impairment has been collecting more and more attention as a contributing factor to the etiology of Parkinson's disease. Above all, the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, complex I, of the respiratory chain seems to be most culpable. Complex I dysfunction is translated to an increased production of reactive oxygen species and a decreased energy supply. In the brain, the dopaminergic neurons are one of the most susceptible cells. Their death is directly linked to the disease apparition. Developing an effective gene therapy is challenged by harmful actions of reactive oxygen species. To overcome this problem a therapeutic candidate must be able to restore the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase activity regardless of how complex I is impaired. Here we discuss the potency of the yeast alternative NADH dehydrogenase, the Ndi1 protein, to reinstate the mitochondrial respiratory chain compensating for disabled complex I and the benefit Ndi1 brings toward retardation of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "A defect in cerebral energy production due to dysfunction of the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) has been postulated to be important in the pathogenesis of Parkinson Disease (PD). However, direct in vivo measurements of cerebral mitochondrial function are scant and inconsistent. We directly investigated cerebral mitochondrial function in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) in 12 patients with early, never-medicated PD and 12 age-matched normal controls by combined measurements of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) and the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc). Instead of the decrease in CMRO(2) and CMRO(2)/CMRglc molar ratio characteristic of defects in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, there was a statistically significant 24% general increase in CMRO(2) and no change in CMRO(2)/CMRglc. Since PD symptoms were already manifest, reduced oxidative activity of the mitochondrial ETS cannot be a primary mechanism of neuronal death in early PD. This increase in metabolism could reflect the increased energy requirements of an injured brain or an uncoupling of ATP production from oxidation in the terminal stage of oxidative phosphorylation. Which is the case in early PD and whether these metabolic abnormalities are important in the pathogenesis of PD will require further study.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies and glial cytoplasmic inclusions, pathological hallmarks of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, and it is assumed to be aetiologically involved in these conditions. However, the quantitative status of brain alpha-synuclein in different Parkinsonian disorders is still unresolved and it is uncertain whether alpha-synuclein accumulation is restricted to regions of pathology. We compared membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein, both the full-length 17 kDa and high molecular weight species, by western blotting in autopsied brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (brainstem-predominant Lewy body disease: n = 9), multiple system atrophy (n = 11), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 16), and of normal controls (n = 13). Brain of a patient with familial Parkinsonism-dementia due to alpha-synuclein locus triplication (as positive control) showed increased membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein levels with abundant high molecular weight immunoreactivity. In multiple system atrophy, a massive increase in 17 kDa membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein was observed in highly pathologically affected regions, including putamen (+1760%, range +625-2900%), substantia nigra [+1000% (+356-1850%)], and white matter of internal capsule [+2210% (+430-6830%)] together with numerous high molecular weight species. Levels of 17 kDa membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein were only modestly increased in less affected areas (cerebellar cortex, +95%; caudate, +30%; with both also showing numerous high molecular weight species) and were generally normal in cerebral cortices. In both Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein levels were normal in putamen and frontal cortex whereas a trend was observed for variably increased 17 kDa membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein concentrations [+184% (-60% to +618%)] with additional high molecular weight species in Parkinson's disease substantia nigra. No obvious correlation was observed between nigral membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein accumulation and Lewy body density in Parkinson's disease. Two progressive supranuclear palsy cases had membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein accumulation in substantia nigra similar to multiple system atrophy. Several Parkinson's disease patients had very modest high molecular weight membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein accumulation in putamen. Levels of 17-kDa membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein were generally positively correlated with those of high molecular weight membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein and there was a trend for a positive correlation between striatal dopamine loss and 17-kDa membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein concentrations in multiple system atrophy. Brain membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein accumulations in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy are regionally specific, suggesting that these sporadic alpha-synucleinopathies, unlike familial Parkinsonism-dementia, are not associated with a simple global over-expression of the protein. Despite a similar extent of dopamine depletion, the magnitude of brain membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein changes is disease specific, with multiple system atrophy clearly having the most severe accumulation. Literature discrepancies on alpha-synuclein status in 'Parkinson's disease' might be explained by inclusion of cases not having classic brainstem-predominant Lewy body disease and by variable alpha-synuclein accumulation within this diagnostic classification.",

    "abstract": "The selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is a feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity is the most common experimental model used to investigate the pathogenesis of PD. Administration of MPTP in mice produces neuropathological defects as observed in PD and 1-methyl-4-pyridinium (MPP(+)) induces cell death when neuronal cell cultures are used. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of energy homeostasis. In the present study, we demonstrated that AMPK is activated by MPTP in mice and MPP(+) in SH-SY5Y cells. The inhibition of AMPK by compound C resulted in an increase in MPP(+)-induced cell death. We further showed that overexpression of AMPK increased cell viability after exposure to MPP(+) in SH-SY5Y cells. Based on these results, we suggest that activation of AMPK might prevent neuronal cell death and play a role as a survival factor in PD.",

    "abstract": "A 'case scenario' study on clinical decisions in progressing Parkinson's disease (PD) was developed to complement scientific evidence with the collective judgment of a panel of experts.\nThe opinions of 9 experts in movement disorders on the appropriateness of 9 common pharmacological treatments for 33 hypothetical patient profiles were compared to those of 14 general neurologists. Before rating the case scenarios, all participants received a document integrating European and US guidelines for the treatment of patients with advanced PD. Case scenarios showing disagreement or with inconsistencies in appropriateness ratings were discussed at a feedback meeting. A tool for interactive discussion on the clinical case scenarios included was developed based on the outcome of the study.\nCurrent guidelines are often insufficient to adequately guide the management of patients with progressing PD. The case scenario study did not reveal major differences in opinions between experts in movement disorders and general neurologists about the appropriateness of certain drug choices for specific case scenarios. However in about 1 out of 5 treatment decisions where experts stated appropriateness or inappropriateness, the general neurologists panel had no or dispersed opinions.\nThis study reveals more uncertainty about treatment of advanced PD in general neurologists compared with experts in movement disorders and underlines the need for additional support for guiding treatment decisions in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Instrumental motion assessment, i.e., peg insertion, gains importance as an addition to rating procedures to determine the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and to serve as diagnostic tool in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). One of their motor features is disturbed execution of alternating motions. The objectives of the study were to assess pronation and supination of the forearms and peg insertion with instruments and to correlate the outcomes with rating scores in PD patients. Controls and 27 idiopathic PD patients, taken off treatment for 12 h, were scored and performed on both devices. PD patients showed a reduced maximum velocity (v), performance interval and amplitude of diadochokinetic movements than controls. V outcomes showed closer associations to rated motor behavior, in particular akinesia and rigidity, and peg insertion results than amplitude, respectively periods of diadochokinetic motion sequences. This altered performance of diadochokinetic movements corresponds to the clinical motor symptoms of PD patients and differs from healthy controls.",

    "abstract": "The present project was aimed at investigating how two distinct and important difficulties (coordination difficulty and pronounced dependency on visual feedback) in Parkinson's disease (PD) affect each other for the coordination between hand transport toward an object and the initiation of finger closure during reach-to-grasp movement. Subjects with PD and age-matched healthy subjects made reach-to-grasp movements to a dowel under conditions in which the target object and/or the hand were either visible or not visible. The involvement of the trunk in task performance was manipulated by positioning the target object within or beyond the participant's outstretched arm to evaluate the effects of increasing the complexity of intersegmental coordination under different conditions related to the availability of visual feedback in subjects with PD. General kinematic characteristics of the reach-to-grasp movements of the subjects with PD were altered substantially by the removal of target object visibility. Compared with the controls, the subjects with PD considerably lengthened transport time, especially during the aperture closure period, and decreased peak velocity of wrist and trunk movement without target object visibility. Most of these differences were accentuated when the trunk was involved. In contrast, these kinematic parameters did not change depending on the visibility of the hand for both groups. The transport-aperture coordination was assessed in terms of the control law according to which the initiation of aperture closure during the reach occurred when the hand distance-to-target crossed a hand-target distance threshold for grasp initiation that is a function of peak aperture, hand velocity and acceleration, trunk velocity and acceleration, and trunk-target distance at the time of aperture closure initiation. When the hand or the target object was not visible, both groups increased the hand-target distance threshold for grasp initiation compared to its value under full visibility, implying an increase in the hand-target distance-related safety margin for grasping. The increase in the safety margin due to the absence of target object vision or the absence of hand vision was accentuated in the subjects with PD compared to that in the controls. The pronounced increase in the safety margin due to absence of target object vision for the subjects with PD was further accentuated when the trunk was involved compared to when it was not involved. The results imply that individuals with PD have significant limitations regarding neural computations required for efficient utilization of internal representations of target object location and hand motion as well as proprioceptive information about the hand to compensate for the lack of visual information during the performance of complex multisegment movements.",

    "abstract": "Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) have a great impact on patients with Parkinson disease (PD). The Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) is an instrument specifically designed for the comprehensive assessment of NMS in patients with PD. NMSS psychometric properties have been tested in this study.\nData were collected in 12 centers across 10 countries in America, Asia, and Europe. In addition to the NMSS, the following measures were applied: Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease (SCOPA)-Motor, SCOPA-Psychiatric Complications (SCOPA-PC), SCOPA-Cognition, Hoehn and Yahr Staging (HY), Clinical Impression of Severity Index for Parkinson's Disease (CISI-PD), SCOPA-Autonomic, Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 items (PDQ-39), and EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D). NMSS acceptability, reliability, validity, and precision were analyzed.\nFour hundred eleven patients with PD, 61.3% men, were recruited. The mean age was 64.5 +/- 9.9 years, and mean disease duration was 8.1 +/- 5.7 years. The NMSS score was 57.1 +/- 44.0 points. The scale was free of floor or ceiling effects. For domains, the Cronbach alpha coefficient ranged from 0.44 to 0.85. The intraclass correlation coefficient (0.90 for the total score, 0.67-0.91 for domains) and Lin concordance coefficient (0.88) suggested satisfactory reproducibility. The NMSS total score correlated significantly with SCOPA-Autonomic, PDQ-39, and EQ-5D (r(S) = 0.57-0.70). Association was close between NMSS domains and the corresponding SCOPA-Autonomic domains (r(S) = 0.51-0.65) and also with scales measuring related constructs (PDSS, SCOPA-PC) (all p < 0.0001). The NMSS total score was higher for women (p < 0.02) and for increasing disease duration, HY, and CISI-PD severity level (p < 0.001). The SEM was 13.91 for total score and 1.71 to 4.73 for domains.\nThe Non-Motor Symptoms Scale is an acceptable, reproducible, valid, and precise assessment instrument for nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson disease.",

The NMSS total score correlated significantly with SCOPA-Autonomic, PDQ-39, and EQ-5D (r(S) = 0.57-0.70). Association was close between NMSS domains and the corresponding SCOPA-Autonomic domains (r(S) = 0.51-0.65) and also with scales measuring related constructs (PDSS, SCOPA-PC) (all p < 0.0001). The NMSS total score was higher for women (p < 0.02) and for increasing disease duration, HY, and CISI-PD severity level (p < 0.001). The SEM was 13.91 for total score and 1.71 to 4.73 for domains.",

    "abstract": "To examine the association between demographic and clinical features in early Parkinson disease (PD) and length of survival in a multiethnic population.\nClinical features within 2 years of diagnosis were determined for an inception cohort established during 1994-1995. Vital status was determined through December 31, 2005. Predictor variables included age at diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, as well as clinical subtype (modified tremor dominant, postural instability gait difficulty), symmetry, cognitive impairment, depression, dysphagia, and hallucinations. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with shorter survival.\nKaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, northern California.\nFive hundred seventy-three men and women with newly diagnosed PD.\nThree hundred fifty-two participants in the PD cohort (61.4%) had died in the follow-up period. Older age at diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.12), modified postural instability gait difficulty subtype (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.7), symmetry of motor signs (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7), mild (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.2) and severe (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.9-3.9) cognitive impairment, dysphagia (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9), and hallucinations (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3-3.2) were associated with increased all-cause mortality, after adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. None of the other factors altered mortality risk. In an empirical predictive analysis, most previous significant predictors remained associated with shorter survival.\nBoth motor and nonmotor features in early PD predict increased mortality risk, particularly postural instability gait difficulty, cognitive impairment, and hallucinations. These predictors may be useful in clinical practice and when designing clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Impairment of sequence learning is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the time course of this cognitive abnormality is not known. We assessed longitudinal changes in sequence learning performance and associated task-related cerebral blood flow in 13 early stage PD patients who underwent H(2)(15)O PET at baseline and again 2 years later. Ten healthy volunteer subjects served as controls. A trend toward decline in learning performance (p=0.08) was evident over the 2 years of follow-up. During this interval, significant declines in learning-related activation were detected in parietal and temporo-occipital association areas and in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Learning-related activation in these regions was normal at baseline, but declined to subnormal levels (p<0.01) at 2 years. Significant hippocampal activation (p<0.005) was present in the subjects with high learning performance over time. The findings are consistent with a decline in learning-related neural activity in cortical areas with prominent Lewy body formation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate that rehabilitation ameliorates physical and cognitive impairments of patients with stroke, spinal cord injury, and other neurological diseases and that rehabilitation also has potencies to modulate brain plasticity. Here we examined the effects of compulsive exercise on Parkinson's disease model of rats. Before 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 20 microg) lesion into the right striatum of female SD rats, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected to label the proliferating cells. Subsequently, at 24 h after the lesion, the rats were forced to run on the treadmill (5 days/week, 30 min/day, 11 m/min). As behavioral evaluations, cylinder test was performed at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and amphetamine-induced rotational test was performed at 2 and 4 weeks with consequent euthanasia for immunohistochemical investigations. The exercise group showed better behavioral recovery in cylinder test and significant decrease in the number of amphetamine-induced rotations, compared to the non-exercise group. Correspondingly, significant preservation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive fibers in the striatum and TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) was demonstrated, compared to the non-exercise group. Additionally, the number of migrated BrdU- and Doublecortin-positive cells toward the lesioned striatum was increased in the exercise group. Furthermore, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor increased in the striatum by exercise. The results suggest that exercise exerts neuroprotective effects or enhances the neuronal differentiation in Parkinson's disease model of rats with subsequent improvement in deteriorated motor function.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated episodic memory and metamemory for verbs and nouns in patients who have cognitive impairments associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients and healthy control participants were asked to recall word pairs and provide feeling-of-knowing (FOK) judgments for the items they were unable to recall. This was followed by a 4-alternative recognition test. PD patients were impaired in both recall and recognition, compared with controls. In terms of metamemory, PD patients were less confident in their ability to recognize the unrecalled items in a future recognition test. Most important, accuracy of PD patients' FOK judgments was not above chance and was lower than that of control participants. The PD group correctly recognized fewer verbs than nouns, but type of material (verb vs. noun) had no impact on recall or FOK judgments. In addition, contribution of executive functions to FOK accuracy was different in PD patients and controls.",

    "abstract": "The role of noradrenergic depletion of the locus coeruleus (LC) in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still unclear. In the present study, apomorphine-induced circling behavior and extracellular firing activity of substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) neurons were examined in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the LC, substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and with combined SNc and LC lesions. A moderate contralateral circling was observed in rats with LC lesions after apomorphine. Moreover, the circling behavior was obviously increased by further lesions of LC in SNc-lesioned rats. Extracellular recordings indicated that the firing rate of SNr neurons increased significantly and the firing pattern of these neurons also changed towards more irregular and bursty after SNc lesioning as compared to sham-lesioned rats, while the firing rate and pattern were unaffected in rats with simple lesions of the LC. However, the firing rate of SNr neurons in rats with combined LC and SNc lesions increased significantly when compared to that of rats with simple lesions of the SNc, although the firing pattern was not altered. Furthermore, SNc lesions in rats increased the firing rate of SNr neurons with irregular firing pattern, and additional LC lesions in SNc-lesioned rats increased the firing rate of SNr neurons with regular and irregular firing pattern. These results indicate that lesions of the LC intensify apomorphine-induced circling behavior and lead to a further hyperactivity of SNr neurons in a rat model of PD, suggesting that LC-noradrenergic system is involved in the motor dysfunction of PD.",

    "abstract": "Motor and cognitive processes are required for successful 'real world' walking. We explored the specific contribution of motor function, executive function, and attention to functional gait performance in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) when 'off' medication. Twenty-nine people with PD wearing an accelerometer were tested in their home whilst walking under four task conditions. Explanatory characteristics included age, motor function, executive function, sustained attention and divided attention. Repeated measures ANOVA compared gait speed under different task conditions. Multiple regression analysis explored the effect of characteristics on gait speed and gait interference (difference between dual and single task). Gait performance deteriorated under complex conditions (F=51.0, P<.001). Motor function and attention explained up to 65% variance in gait speed. Motor function, attention and executive function explained up to 66% variance in gait interference. Sustained attention explained up to 10% variance in gait speed; executive function explained up to 21% variance in gait interference and divided attention explained up to 22% variance in gait interference. Motor function, executive function and attention contribute to gait speed and gait interference in PD during a functional walking task whilst 'off' medication. When both executive function and attention are included as explanatory variables, attention discriminates gait performance more effectively. Whilst both contribute to functional gait, they are used selectively to optimise performance for different conditions and to meet complex task requirements.",

    "abstract": "One of the limitations of non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors as anti-depressant or anti-Parkinson drugs is their ability to potentiate the cardiovascular effect of oral tyramine, resulting from inhibition of systemic MAO-A and release of noradrenaline. We have investigated the cardiovascular effect of oral tyramine in response to the novel multifunctional, brain selective MAO-AB inhibitor, M30 [5-(N-methyl-N-propargylaminomethyl)-8-hydroxyquinoline], and compared it to the classical non-selective inhibitor tranylcypromine (TCP) in rats. We also measured MAO-A and B in the striatum, hippocampus, liver, and small intestine and determined brain levels of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. At the doses employed, intraperitoneal (i.p.) M30 (5 and 10 mg/kg) selectively inhibited brain MAO-A and B by more than 85%, with little inhibition of liver and small intestine enzymes while raising striatal levels of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. In contrast to TCP (10 mg/kg, i.p.), which fully inhibits both enzymes in the brain and systemic organs and significantly potentiates the tyramine pressor effect, M30 had a limited pressor effect as compared to it and controls. The limited potentiation of tyramine pressor effect by M30, its ability to raise brain levels of aminergic neurotransmitters together with its neuroprotective and neurorestorative activities make this drug potentially important as an anti-depressant and anti-Parkinsonian agent, for which it is being developed.",

No subject withdrew from the study as a result of serious adverse events.\nA 3-week magnetic conditioning protocol, consisting of a 20-min stimulation session twice daily. Colonic transit time, Knowles-Eccersley-Scott Symptom Questionnaire and the dynamics of defecography were carried out before the intervention and on the final day of the protocol.\nThere was a statistically significant reduction in colonic transit time and in the questionnaire score following the intervention. The difference in the anorectal angles between resting and evacuating process and the changes in pelvic floor descent all reached significance after the intervention. The therapeutic effects that achieved significance remained constant in the 3-month follow-up result. Functional magnetic stimulation may facilitate colonic motility in Parkinson's disease and straighten the anorectal angle, allowing smooth access of rectal contents to the anal canal.",

It resembles neuroleptic malignant syndrome and is characterized by fever, marked rigidity, altered consciousness, leucocytosis and elevated creatine kinase. Malignant syndrome is a potentially fatal condition and awareness of this condition is imperative for prevention and treatment. The commonest precipitating factor is dopaminergic drug withdrawal or dose reduction. We report malignant syndrome (precipitated by hyponatremia) in a case of Parkinson's disease, in the absence of dopaminergic drug withdrawal. A 60-year-old man presented with fever, severe rigidity and altered sensorium following repeated vomiting. On investigation, he was found to have hyponatremia precipitated malignant syndrome. Treatment with hydration, cooling, correction of hyponatremia and dopaminergic drugs reversed his condition. The triad of fever, severe rigidity and altered sensorium should prompt evaluation for malignant syndrome in Parkinson's disease.",

Information was obtained on previous eating habits before diagnosis of PD and other factors. Morning blood samples were collected before breakfast and were used to measure concentrations of metals.\nThe whole-blood Mn and serum iron (Fe) levels were significantly higher in PD patients than in controls. However, no differences in intake of each metal from food or experience of Mn poisoning were seen between the groups.\nIn China, accumulation of Mn and Fe via unknown routes might be involved in the etiology of PD in the general population.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions involving repetitive, excessive and compulsive activities that interfere with life functioning. Examples are pathological gambling, compulsive shopping and hypersexuality. Over the last decade, ICDs have become increasingly recognised as being associated with Parkinson disease (PD), with the literature highlighting a link between dopamine replacement therapy and the development of ICDs. Patients who develop ICDs in the context of compulsive anti-Parkinsonian drug use are described as having dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), which is associated with repetitive complex stereotyped behaviours called punding. Case-control and observational studies have further noted that patients with PD who develop ICDs are more likely to have younger-onset PD, a history of alcohol dependence, novelty-seeking personality traits and psychiatric comorbidities. The pathophysiology of underlying mechanisms is not fully understood, but recent evidence suggests that dopaminergic drugs, particularly dopamine agonists, coupled with changes in reward pathways involving the ventral striatal and related circuitry, may play a role. Neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography and functional MRI have provided valuable information in this area: patients with DDS have been found to show enhanced dopamine release in the ventral striatum, suggesting functional abnormalities in the mesolimbic networks. Management of ICDs in patients with PD can be challenging, as they may not be aware of a change in their behaviour or may conceal their symptoms to avoid embarrassment. Currently, there is no clear evidence of an optimal treatment. Management is based on a careful balance of dopaminergic drugs with control of the aberrant behaviour, supported by psychological interventions. This review aims to summarise the current literature on ICDs, their phenomenology, epidemiology, clinical features, pathophysiology and management.",

    "abstract": "To quantify the extent of self-reported sexual and relationship problems in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA cross-sectional correlation design was used. All people with idiopathic PD, according to the UK Brain Bank criteria, who were known to the Northumbria Healthcare NHS Trust PD service, were asked to participate. Those who consented were assessed by a research nurse during a six month period using a series of rating scales, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the PD Questionnaire-39, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Szasz sexual functioning scale and, for those in long-term relationships, the Golombok Rust Inventory of Marital State.\nConcern over sexual function was reported in 22 (25%) of the 88 participants in the study. Males (p = 0.001) and younger people with PD (p = 0.001) were significantly more likely to report problems with sexual function. Gender (p = 0.007) and UPDRS score (p = 0.045) were significant independent predictors of relationship problems. Males with PD and those with increasing functional problems (UPDRS score) were more likely to report problems in their relationship. Disease duration and levels of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) were not associated with sexual or relationship problems.\nSexual and relationship dysfunction was a problem for many people in this study, but these problems were unlikely to be volunteered unless specifically enquired about. Problems were apparent across all age groups and genders.",

    "abstract": "Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has been established as a powerful technique for the determination of metal and nonmetal distributions within biological systems with high sensitivity. An imaging LA-ICP-MS technique for Fe, Cu, Zn, and Mn was developed to produce large series of quantitative element maps in native brain sections of mice subchronically intoxicated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin (MPTP) as a model of Parkinson's disease. Images were calibrated using matrix-matched laboratory standards. A software solution allowing a precise delineation of anatomical structures was implemented. Coronal brain sections were analyzed crossing the striatum and the substantia nigra, respectively. Animals sacrificed 2 h, 7 d, or 28 d after the last MPTP injection and controls were investigated. We observed significant decreases of Cu concentrations in the periventricular zone and the fascia dentata at 2 h and 7d and a recovery or overcompensation at 28 d, most pronounced in the rostral periventricular zone (+40%). In the cortex Cu decreased slightly to -10%. Fe increased in the interpeduncular nucleus (+40%) but not in the substantia nigra. This pattern is in line with a differential regulation of periventricular and parenchymal Cu, and with the histochemical localization of Fe, and congruent to regions of preferential MPTP binding described in the rodent brain. The LA-ICP-MS technique yielded valid and statistically robust results in the present study on 39 slices from 19 animals. Our findings underline the value of routine micro-local analytical techniques in the life sciences and affirm a role of Cu availability in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Camptocormia (a flexion of the trunk that only appears when standing or walking) affects a minority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). As it responds poorly to levodopa and is associated with reduced midbrain and pons volume, it may result from non-dopaminergic, brainstem lesions. As several sleep abnormalities in PD also result from non-dopaminergic brainstem lesions, we monitored sleep in 24 non-demented PD patients with (n = 12) and without (n = 12) camptocormia and in 12 controls. Nearly half (42%) patients with camptocormia had abnormal periodic leg movement indices (>15/h), versus 17% patients without camptocormia and 8% of controls (p = 0.02). In addition, the percentage of enhanced muscle activity during REM sleep (measured on the chin and on the limb muscles) tended to be higher in patients with than without camptocormia (51 +/- 39% vs. 20 +/- 25%, p = 0.06). The other sleep and REM sleep characteristics (sleep and REM sleep onset latencies, sleep time and sleep stage percentages, REMs density, arousal, and apnea-hypopnea indices) were not different between these two PD groups. Lesions causing this axial dystonia may spare the sleep systems but affect the control of movements during sleep.",

    "abstract": "UK-based community studies have found high rates of misdiagnosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). Searches of prescription databases and case records identified 610 patients taking antiparkinson therapy for a PD diagnosis in 92 West of Scotland General Practices. Patients with no documented progression of parkinsonism and/or no increase in antiparkinson medication for 3 years were assessed by two movement disorder specialists. FP-CIT SPECT scanning was performed in clinically uncertain cases. Those considered unlikely to have PD had antiparkinson drugs tapered then stopped, with a minimum of 6 months follow-up. Age, sex and disease duration matched controls were also assessed. 64 of 89 (71.9%) patients meeting selection criteria were assessed, of whom 36 (56.3%) were appropriate for therapy withdrawal. Thirty three of those 36 patients (91.7%) and 3 of 64 (4.7%) controls stopped antiparkinson therapy without deterioration giving an overall total of 36 of 610 (5.9%). The revised diagnoses in this group were mainly essential tremor (ET) (n = 14) and vascular parkinsonism (VP) (n = 10). Patients managed in Primary Care were significantly more likely to complete therapy withdrawal than those attending a specialist clinic (15.3% vs. 2.6%, P < 0.0001). The total annual cost of antiparkinson medication for these 36 patients was 13,400 pounds; the mean duration of diagnosis was 6.8 years (SD 5.6). At least 1 in every 20 patients taking medication for PD is misdiagnosed. Nearly all of these patients can be identified by simple screening of prescription databases and case records in Primary Care, followed by clinical review, which allows withdrawal of unnecessary medication.",

    "abstract": "In this prospective study of 34 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), measurements of the short duration levodopa motor response have been performed every 3 years in defined off states. The mean time from initiation of levodopa treatment was 14.8 years, and 17 patients survived to the latest assessment stage. Off phase motor function worsened at a yearly rate of 2.2% of the maximum disability score. The magnitude of the levodopa response is well preserved as the disease progresses, and patients who developed motor fluctuations maintained better on phase motor function than nonfluctuators (P = 0.01). Ten patients, of whom 5 survive, developed dementia. There was no difference in pretreatment disability or initial levodopa response between demented and nondemented subjects. However, dementia was associated with worse on and off motor disability scores after 11 and 14 years (P < 0.001), and a smaller levodopa response magnitude after 14 years (P = 0.008). The plot of sequential scores shows the association between cognitive decline and accelerating increase in motor disability. This suggests that the advanced phase of PD, when Lewy body pathology involves the cerebral cortex, progresses in an exponential rather than linear fashion.",

    "abstract": "Few cases of dopamine agonist-induced antecollis in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been reported. Literature review of 16 PD patients including our 3 cases with dopamine agonist-induced antecollis showed predominance of (1) Japanese, (2) women, and (3) Hoehn-Yahr stage of >or=3. We experienced three Japanese PD patients who subacutely exhibited antecollis following increased dopamine agonist dose that improved just after withdrawal of the agonist. One patient developed antecollis during increasing pramipexole dose in combination with cabergoline. Antecollis in another patient appeared during increasing pramipexole dose; it worsened after substituting pergolide for pramipexole, but improved after withdrawal of pergolide. Our cases indicate that there is no specific dopamine agonist causing antecollis, and it is possibly caused by a number of single dopamine agonists or a combination of them. Dopamine agonist-induced antecollis should be considered when encountering antecollis in PD patients being treated with dopamine agonists and withdrawal of the agonist can improve symptoms.",

They were also submitted to a complete neurologic examination which included brief cognitive batteries, the Mini Mental Status Exam, and Frontal Assessment Battery. We analyzed the scores of the section of the MINI related to the risk of suicide as well as the specific questions of BDI and HAM-D concerning suicidal ideation.\nNo patient had ever attempted suicide. According to MINI, suicidal ideation was present in 13 patients (14.4%) with Parkinson's disease. All instruments assessed the risk of suicide in a similar way. Suicidal ideation was associated only with lower age (P=.022), lower age of Parkinson's disease onset (P=.021), panic disorder (P=.004), social anxiety disorder (P=.007), and major depression (P<.001).

    "abstract": "Mutations in PINK1 have been identified in familial and sporadic cases of early onset Parkinson's disease (PD). To determine the contribution of PINK1 variants in Indian PD patients, the gene was screened in 250 patients and 205 ethnically matched controls by polymerase chain reaction, single-stranded conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. Two potentially pathogenic variants (Arg246Gln & Arg276Gln) were detected in the heterozygous state in 5 patients; none of the patients carried homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations. In addition, 13 other variants were identified, including a known polymorphism (Ala340Thr), a few synonymous or intronic changes, none of which are likely to be pathogenic. Unlike the Chinese population, the Ala340Thr variant did not show any association with PD in Indian population. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from dbSNP were genotyped in 531 normal, healthy individuals representing different ethnic groups of India. Most of the SNP markers were observed to be highly heterozygous among Indians, which could be used for segregation analysis of PINK1 alleles in familial PD cases.",

    "abstract": "The development of non-dopaminergic therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) has attracted much interest in recent years. Among new classes of drugs, adenosine A(2A) antagonists have emerged as the best candidates. BIIB014, preladenant and ST-1535 are new adenosine A(2A) antagonists currently in Phase I and II clinical trials for evaluation of their efficacy in patients with PD. All these compounds have been proven safe and well tolerated. Moreover, results from Phase II trials also demonstrate that BIIB014 and preladenant are effective in reducing the waking time spent in OFF state in patients at the late stage of PD treated with L-DOPA. BIIB014 is also efficacious as monotherapy in patients at the early stage of PD. Finally, ST-1535, at this time, displays a very promising potential in experimental models of PD and a safe profile in clinical studies. This review summarizes pharmacological data available on these three A(2A) antagonists, their effects in animal models of PD and their profiles in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Personality traits appear as determinants of quality of life (QoL) in most chronic diseases. Type D personality is characterized by ineffective coping strategies that reduce QoL in patients with coronary heart disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Type D personality also predicts QoL in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, gender differences in Type D personalities are explored.\nThe sample consisted of 153 PD patients (51.4% males; mean age 67.9 +/- 9.3 years). DS-14 was used to measure Type D personality, negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition (SI). The Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39) was used to assess QoL, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was used to assess functional status. The regression model consisted of disease severity, disease duration, age and DS-14 and its two scales (NA and SI).\nType D is negatively associated with overall QoL in PD patients and most subscales of the PDQ-39. Type D explained emotional well-being in both genders but was significant in the models for stigma, cognition, and communication only in men. NA and SI played a less important role in women in comparison with men.\nType D personality is an important part of the QoL model in PD patients of both genders, especially in the NA scale. The gender differences suggest that male and female PD patients require different coping strategies.",

    "abstract": "Rural living has long been debated as a risk factor for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). But few community-based studies compared this difference between urban and rural areas.\nPopulation-based surveys by neurologists using a standardized diagnostic protocol were conducted in the urban areas of Keelung City and compared the prevalence rates of IPD with those we had previously determined in the rural area of Ilan County, Taiwan. Subjects were diagnosed with IPD when at least 2 of the 4 cardinal signs of parkinsonism were present and by exclusion of secondary parkinsonism. Gender-specific age-standardized prevalence rates of IPD by using the 1970 and 2000 US censuses were calculated for comparison.\nThe participation rate was 84.9%. The crude prevalence rate of IPD in persons aged 40 years and over was 706 (95% CI: 551-864) per 100,000 population. The age-adjusted prevalence rates by using the 1970 US census were 633 (95% CI: 620-646) for people aged 40 and over and 230 (95% CI: 227-234) for all ages. Our results were similar to those obtained in Sicily, Rotterdam, and 3 communities in China. Moreover, the prevalence rates of IPD in Keelung, the urban area studied, were twice as high as those in Ilan, the rural area studied (p < 0.001).\nOur results suggest that urban living is more important as a risk factor for IPD development than rural living in Taiwan.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that African-American populations have a lower prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, because African-Americans are underrepresented in many cohorts, this relationship is poorly understood. We evaluated data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study to describe potential racial differences in PD prevalence.\nWe identified subjects using PD medications from the REGARDS study, a national longitudinal cohort study of 30,000 persons over age 45 with approximately equal representation of African-Americans and Whites.\nThe prevalence of PD medication use across the cohort was 0.78% and was less among African-Americans (0.51%) than among Whites (0.97%; OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.31-2.74). There was an association of gender and PD medication use, with a prevalence of 0.61% in females and 0.97% in males (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.13-2.18). There was no association with income, education level or geographic region of residence.\nThe lower rate of PD medication use among African-Americans supports the suspected lower prevalence of PD among African-Americans suggested by other studies. While racial differences in PD diagnosis and treatment may contribute to the differences we observed, comparable disparities have not been observed in the REGARDS cohort for other diagnoses. Further studies of the REGARDS cohort may lead to important insights into potential biological differences in PD among African-Americans and Whites.",

Kinetic gait parameters showed reduced push-off ankle power and lift-off hip power generation. Strong correlations between these important body advancement mechanisms and the walking velocity were observed.\nIn addition to previously described dysfunctional kinematics, abnormal kinetic parameters play an important role in the characterization of gait in PD patients off therapy.

    "abstract": "To investigate the incidence of and risk factors for cognitive impairment in a large, well-defined clinical trial cohort of patients with early Parkinson disease (PD).\nThe Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered periodically over a median follow-up period of 6.5 years to participants in the Deprenyl and Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism trial and its extension studies. Cognitive impairment was defined as scoring 2 standard deviations below age- and education-adjusted MMSE norms.\nCumulative incidence of cognitive impairment in the 740 participants with clinically confirmed PD (baseline age 61.0 +/- 9.6 years, Hoehn-Yahr stage 1-2.5) was 2.4% (95% confidence interval: 1.2%-3.5%) at 2 years and 5.8% (3.7%-7.7%) at 5 years. Subjects who developed cognitive impairment (n = 46) showed significant progressive decline on neuropsychological tests measuring verbal learning and memory, visuospatial working memory, visuomotor speed, and attention, while the performance of the nonimpaired subjects (n = 694) stayed stable. Cognitive impairment was associated with older age, hallucinations, male gender, increased symmetry of parkinsonism, increased severity of motor impairment (except for tremor), speech and swallowing impairments, dexterity loss, and presence of gastroenterologic/urologic disorders at baseline.\nThe relatively low incidence of cognitive impairment in the Deprenyl and Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism study may reflect recruitment bias inherent to clinical trial volunteers (e.g., younger age) or limitations of the Mini-Mental State Examination-based criterion. Besides confirming known risk factors for cognitive impairment, we identified potentially novel predictors such as bulbar dysfunction and gastroenterologic/urologic disorders (suggestive of autonomic dysfunction) early in the course of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Effective clinical trials for neuroprotective interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) require a way to quantify an individual's motor symptoms and analyze the change in these symptoms over time. Clinical scales provide a global picture of function but cannot precisely measure specific aspects of motor control. We have used commercially available sensors to create a protocol called Advanced Sensing for Assessment of Parkinson's disease (ASAP) to obtain a quantitative and reliable measure of motor impairment in early to moderate PD. The ASAP protocol measures grip force as an individual tracks a sinusoidal or pseudorandom target force under three conditions of increasing cognitive load. Thirty individuals with PD have completed the ASAP protocol. The ASAP data for 26 of these individuals were summarized in terms of 36 variables, and modified regression techniques were used to predict an individual's score on the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale based on ASAP data. We observed a mean prediction error of approximately 3.5 UPDRS points, and the predicted score accounted for approximately 76% of the variability of the UPDRS. These results demonstrate that the ASAP protocol can measure differences for individuals who are clinically different. This indicates that the ASAP protocol may be able to measure changes with time in the motor signs of an individual with PD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) or parkin cause autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson disease (PD), but how these mutations trigger neurodegeneration is poorly understood and the exact functional relationship between PINK1 and parkin remains unclear. Here, we report that PINK1 regulates the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase function of parkin through direct phosphorylation. We find that phosphorylation of parkin by PINK1 activates parkin E3 ligase function for catalyzing K63-linked polyubiquitination and enhances parkin-mediated ubiquitin signaling through the IkappaB kinase/nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway. Furthermore, the ability of PINK1 to promote parkin phosphorylation and activate parkin-mediated ubiquitin signaling is impaired by PD-linked pathogenic PINK1 mutations. Our findings support a direct link between PINK1-mediated phosphorylation and parkin-mediated ubiquitin signaling and implicate the deregulation of the PINK1/parkin/NF-kappaB neuroprotective signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder mostly effecting the elder population of the world. Currently there is no definitive treatment or cure for this disease. Therefore, in this study the composition and constituents of the aqueous extract of Banisteriopsis caapi for monoamine oxidases (MAO) inhibitory and antioxidant activities were assessed, which are relevant to the prevention of neurological disorders, including Parkinsonism.\nThe aqueous extract of Banisteriopsis caapi stems was standardized and then fractionated using reversed-phase (RP) chromatography. Pure compounds were isolated either by reversed-phase (RP) chromatography or centrifugal preparative TLC, using a Chromatotron. Structure elucidation was carried out by 1D and 2D NMR, Mass, IR and Circular Dichroism spectroscopy and chemical derivatization. Chemical profiling of the extract was carried out with RP-HPLC. The inhibitory activity of MAO-A, MAO-B, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and catechol-O-methyl transferase enzymes, as well as antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of both Banisteriopsis caapi extract and isolated compounds was evaluated.\nAn examination of the aqueous extracts of Banisteriopsis caapi cultivar Da Vine yielded two new alkaloidal glycosides, named banistenoside A (1) and banistenoside B (2), containing \"azepino[1,2-a]tetrahydro-beta-carboline\" unique carbon framework. One additional new natural tetrahydronorharmine (4), four known beta-carbolines harmol (3), tetrahydroharmine (5), harmaline (6) and harmine (7), two known proanthocyanidines (-)-epicatechin (8) and (-)-procyanidin B2 (9), and a new disaccharide beta-d-fructofuranosyl-(2-->5)-fructopyranose (14) together with known sacharose (15) and beta-d-glucose (16) were also isolated. In addition, the acetates of 1, 2, 8, 9, 14 and 15 (compounds 10-13, 17, 18) were also prepared. Harmaline (6) and harmine (7) showed potent in vitro inhibitory activity against recombinant human brain monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A and -B enzymes (IC(50) 2.5 and 2.0 nM, and 25 and 20 microM, respectively), and (-)-epicatechin (8) and (-)-procyanidin B2 (9) showed potent antioxidant and moderate MAO-B inhibitory activities (IC(50)<0.13 and 0.57 microg/mL, and 65 and 35 microM). HPLC analysis revealed that most of the dominant chemical and bioactive markers (1, 2, 5, 7-9) were present in high concentrations in dried bark of large branch. Analysis of regular/commercial Banisteriopsis caapi dried stems showed a similar qualitative HPLC pattern, but relatively low content of dominant markers 1, 2, 7, and 9, which led to decreased MAO inhibitory and antioxidant potency.\nCollectively, these results give additional basis to the existing claim of Banisteriopsis caapi stem extract for the treatment of Parkinsonism, including other neurodegenerative disorders.",

One additional new natural tetrahydronorharmine (4), four known beta-carbolines harmol (3), tetrahydroharmine (5), harmaline (6) and harmine (7), two known proanthocyanidines (-)-epicatechin (8) and (-)-procyanidin B2 (9), and a new disaccharide beta-d-fructofuranosyl-(2-->5)-fructopyranose (14) together with known sacharose (15) and beta-d-glucose (16) were also isolated. In addition, the acetates of 1, 2, 8, 9, 14 and 15 (compounds 10-13, 17, 18) were also prepared. Harmaline (6) and harmine (7) showed potent in vitro inhibitory activity against recombinant human brain monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A and -B enzymes (IC(50) 2.5 and 2.0 nM, and 25 and 20 microM, respectively), and (-)-epicatechin (8) and (-)-procyanidin B2 (9) showed potent antioxidant and moderate MAO-B inhibitory activities (IC(50)<0.13 and 0.57 microg/mL, and 65 and 35 microM). HPLC analysis revealed that most of the dominant chemical and bioactive markers (1, 2, 5, 7-9) were present in high concentrations in dried bark of large branch. Analysis of regular/commercial Banisteriopsis caapi dried stems showed a similar qualitative HPLC pattern, but relatively low content of dominant markers 1, 2, 7, and 9, which led to decreased MAO inhibitory and antioxidant potency.",

    "abstract": "Turmeric (curry powder), an essential ingredient of culinary preparations of Southeast Asia, contains a major polyphenolic compound known as curcumin or diferuloylmethane. Curcumin is a widely studied phytochemical with a variety of biological activities. In addition to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial/antiviral properties, curcumin is considered as a cancer chemopreventive agent as well as a modulator of gene expression and a potent antioxidant. Since oxidative stress has been implicated in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease (PD), curcumin has been proposed to have potential therapeutic value for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. Following age, a family history of PD is the most commonly reported risk factor, suggesting a genetic component of the disease in a subgroup of patients. The LRRK2 gene has emerged as the gene most commonly associated with both familial and sporadic PD. Here, we report that exposure of rat mesencephalic cells to curcumin induces the expression of LRRK2 mRNA and protein in a time-dependent manner. The expression of other PD-related genes, such alpha-synuclein and parkin, was not affected by exposure to curcumin, and PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) was not expressed in rat mesencephalic cells. As LRRK2 overexpression is strongly associated with the pathological inclusions found in several neurodegenerative disorders, further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of curcumin as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Though strategic deficits are extensively investigated in Parkinson's disease (PD), little is known about the effects of instruction for PD patients. Thus, we compared the ability to internally generate a cognitive strategy with the ability to use a strategy after elaborate strategy instruction.\nPatients with PD (n=14) and matched healthy controls (n=22) were administered a Numerosity Judgement task in which they had to determine different numerosities of blocks presented in a square grid. In more complex task configurations, healthy participants tend to use a subtraction strategy. Participants in our study were confronted with a counting condition (A), a strategy initiation condition without instruction (B), and a strategy elaboration and strategy training condition (C).\nPatients and controls were comparable with respect to basic cognitive measures. PD patients and controls performed equivalently within the counting condition (A), but patients needed significantly more trials to initiate the subtraction strategy. With the exception of 1 PD patient, all patients were able to internally initiate the strategy (condition B). In condition C, both groups increased reaction times, but patients were significantly slower than controls. Moreover, only patients significantly increased error rates after strategy instruction.\nAs long as sufficient time is provided for solving the task, results do not show a general deficit in the ability to internally generate a cognitive strategy in PD. Failures in strategy utilization strongly depend on cognitive load (working memory, executive functions). This bears important implications for the neuropsychological rehabilitation of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a pathological hallmark in Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and is characterized by activated microglia and infiltrating T cells at sites of neuronal injury. In PD and ALS, neurons do not die alone; neuronal injury is non-cell-autonomous and depends on a well-orchestrated dialogue in which neuronally secreted misfolded proteins activate microglia and initiate a self-propagating cycle of neurotoxicity. Diverse populations and phenotypes of CD4(+) T cells crosstalk with microglia, and depending on their activation status, influence this dialogue and promote neuroprotection or neurotoxicity. A greater understanding of the T cell population that mediates these effects, as well as the molecular signals involved should provide targets for neuroprotective immunomodulation to treat these devastating neurodegenerative diseases.",

A novel LRRK2 missense mutation resulting in a single amino acid substitution K616R was present in one family with a dominant form of PD, and not in 200 controls. The patient presented with slowly progressive resting tremor, dyskinesia, and responded well to l-dopa.

    "abstract": "Levodopa is the main medication used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, dyskinesia and wearing-off appear after the administration of high-dose levodopa for a long period. To combat the dyskinesia and wearing-off, levodopa is used together with a dopamine (DA) receptor agonist, and the amount of levodopa is decreased. We have reported the monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor selegiline to be effective for treating motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease model rats. We analyzed the improvement in motor functions and catecholamine contents in various brain regions induced by a combination of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone and a levodopa/dopadecarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) induced Parkinson's disease model rats. Entacapone (10 mg/kg) was administered via a single oral administration with levodopa/DDCI (10 mg/kg). The motor functions of the JEV model rats were significantly worsened, compared with those of the healthy control rats. The motor functions in the Parkinson's disease model rats were significantly recovered to the same levels as the healthy control rats by the combined administration of entacapone and levodopa/DDCI. A significant improvement in motor function was not demonstrated in the case of the administration of levodopa/DDCI alone. The striatal DA concentrations in the model rat brains were significantly increased by using levodopa/DDCI together with entacapone. Motor function was recovered by raising the striatum DA density in the model rats. Thus, COMT inhibitors are useful for decreasing the amount of levodopa administered to Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "The H1 MAPT haplotype in the 17q21 chromosomal region has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. Some reports have suggested that there is an association between genetic variants within the H1 haplotype with Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Here we report a genetic association study using seven SNPs located along the 17q21 region, in PD patients and controls. In addition, we compared these results with a dataset of previously published PSP/CBD patients from the same population. Our results show that the H1-rs242557(G) allele sub-haplotype is increased in PD (p=0.005), while the H1-rs242557(A) allele sub-haplotype is increased in PSP/CBD (p=0.0002), comparing to controls. The rs242557 polymorphism could act modulating the phenotypic expressivity of the H1 risk on these parkinsonisms. The location of this polymorphism in the 5' regulatory region of MAPT gene suggests the presence of a functional mechanism involved in the variation of MAPT expression levels.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease affects more than 1% of individuals older than 60 years of age. The gold standard of its symptomatic treatment is levodopa therapy, which in time leads to motor fluctuations and dyskinesia due to noncontinuous receptor stimulation. Dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors are recommended as initial therapy, but they are less effective in the advanced stages of the disease. Treatment should be individualized for the patient, dependent on the stage, with attention to nonmotor symptoms. No effective neuroprotective therapy for Parkinson's disease is yet available, and there is currently substantial interest in the development of new nondopaminergic agents. Analogs of kynurenic acid and inhibitors of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of quinolinic acid may exert a neuroprotective effect.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging and modern computational techniques like spatial covariance analysis have contributed greatly to the understanding of neural system abnormalities in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The application of network analysis to metabolic PET data obtained from patients with PD has led to the identification and validation of two distinct spatial covariance patterns associated with the motor and cognitive manifestations of the disease. Quantifying the activity of these patterns in individual subjects has provided an objective tool for the assessment of treatment efficacy and differential diagnosis. We have found that activity of the PD motor-related network is modulated by antiparkinsonian treatments such as dopaminergic therapy, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and subthalamic nucleus (STN) gene therapy. By contrast, the cognitive-related network is not altered by these interventions for PD motor symptoms. This pattern may however change in response to therapies targeting the cognitive symptoms of this disorder. Recent work has focused on the identification of specific network biomarkers for atypical parkinsonian conditions such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). These disease-related patterns can potentially be used in an automated imaging-based algorithm to classify patients with these disorders.",

    "abstract": "In many areas of medicine, the focus has shifted from treating existing disease to screening and prevention. The technology to screen for Parkinson's disease (PD) already exists. The current challenge is to define the appropriate use of predictive testing for PD. Imaging technologies currently offer the highest degree of accuracy for identifying premotor PD, but they are expensive as screening tools. Efficiency is greatly enhanced by combining imaging with a prescreening test, such as olfactory testing. This two-step process has the potential to greatly reduce costs while retaining diagnostic accuracy. Ultimately, the role of preclinical detection of PD will be determined by the ability of emerging therapies to influence clinical outcomes. As such, implementation of large-scale screening strategies awaits the arrival of clearly safe and effective therapies that address the underlying pathogenesis of PD. Current research to evaluate efficient screening methods and to understand the clinical and physiological features of \"premotor\" PD will lay the foundation for the screening and prevention strategies of the future.",

    "abstract": "Pathological and neuroimaging studies have shown that in Parkinson's disease (PD) there is a \"subclinical\" or \"premotor\" period during which dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) degenerate but typical motor symptoms have not yet developed. Post-mortem studies based on nigral cell counts and evaluating dopamine levels in the striata, and imaging studies assessing the nigrostriatal pathway in vivo, have estimated that this time period could last 3 to 6 years. In addition, emerging evidence indicates that the neuropathological process of PD does not start in the SN but more likely elsewhere in the nervous system: in the lower brainstem and the olfactory bulb, or even more distant from the SN, such as in the peripheral autonomic nervous system. Patients with PD frequently can present non-motor symptoms, such as hyposmia or constipation, years before the development of classical motor signs. The physiopathology of these \"premotor\" symptoms, though still unclear, is currently thought to be related to early involvement by the pathological process underlying PD of non-dopaminergic lower brainstem structures or autonomic plexuses. However, the answer to the question \"when does PD start\" remains uncertain. Here, we review clinical, pathological, and neuroimaging data related to the onset of the pathological process of PD, and propose that its onset is non-motor and that non-motor symptoms could begin in many instances 10 and 20 years before onset of motor symptoms. The variable course of the disorder once the motor symptoms develop, suggests that the start and progression of premotor PD is also highly variable and given the heterogeneous nature of PD, may differ depending on the cause/s of the syndrome. When and where the neuropathological process develops in PD remains uncertain.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may present impairment in cognitive functions even at early stages of the disease. When compared with the general population, their risk of dementia is five to six times higher. Recent investigations using structural MRI have shown that dementia in PD is related to cortical structural changes and that specific cognitive dysfunctions can be attributed to atrophy in specific structures. We review the structural MRI studies carried out in PD using either a manual region of interest (ROI) approach or voxel-based morphometry (VBM). ROI studies have shown that hippocampal volume is decreased in patients with PD with and without dementia; in addition, hippocampal atrophy correlated with deficits in verbal memory. VBM studies have demonstrated that dementia in PD involves structural changes in limbic areas and widespread cortical atrophy. Findings in nondemented patients with PD are less conclusive, possibly because cognitively heterogeneous groups of patients have been studied. Patients with PD with cognitive impairment and/or visual hallucinations present greater brain atrophy than patients without these characteristics. These findings suggest that cortical atrophy is related to cognitive dysfunction in PD and precedes the development of dementia. Structural MRI might therefore provide an early marker for dementia in PD.",

Fibrillar amyloid load can now be quantitated in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) using imaging biomarkers. Here the reported findings of 11C-PIB PET studies concerning the amyloid load associated with PD and its influence on dementia are reviewed. It is concluded that the presence of amyloid acts to accelerate the dementia process in Lewy body disorders, though has little influence on its nature.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology (3 T and higher), providing increased signal sensitivity and images with more prominent contrasts intrinsic to the brain, offer new opportunities for assessing brain alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this article, the principle benefits of high field MRI for PD research are described and new findings at high magnetic fields are reviewed. Several high field MRI methodologies, including structural MRI, imaging of brain iron, diffusion tensor imaging, arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging, rotating frame imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are critically reviewed for their potential roles in studies of PD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the Parkin (PARK2) and PINK1 gene (PARK 6) can cause recessively inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). The presence of a single Parkin or PINK1 mutation is associated with a dopaminergic nigrostriatal dysfunction and conveys an increased risk to develop PD throughout lifetime. Therefore neuroimaging of non-manifesting individuals with a mutant Parkin or PINK1 allele opens up a window for the investigation of preclinical and very early phases of PD in vivo. Here we review how functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to identify compensatory mechanisms that help to prevent development of overt disease. In two separate experiments, Parkin mutation carriers displayed stronger activation of rostral supplementary motor area (SMA) and right dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) during a simple motor sequence task and anterior cingulate motor area and left rostral PMd during internal movement selection as opposed to externally cued movements. The additional recruitment of the rostral SMA and right rostral PMd during the finger sequence task was also observed in a separate group of nonmanifesting mutation carriers with a single heterozygous PINK1 mutation. Because mutation carriers were not impaired at performing the task, the additional recruitment of motor cortical areas indicates a compensatory mechanism that effectively counteracts the nigrostriatal dysfunction. These first results warrant further studies that use these imaging genomics approach to tap into preclinical compensation of PD. Extensions of this line of research involve fMRI paradigms probing nonmotor brain functions. Additionally, the same fMRI paradigms should be applied to nonmanifesting mutation carriers in genes linked to autosomal dominant PD. This will help to determine how \"generically\" the human brain compensates for a preclinical dopaminergic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Despite all recent advances in symptomatic therapy Parkinson's disease (PD) continues to be a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Therefore therapies that will slow or hold disease progression are a major medical unmet need in PD. Clinical measures of disease progression that have been used in disease modification trials so far have focused on indices of progression of cardinal motor features like bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor as captured by the UPDRS and the emerging need for effective dopaminergic symptomatic therapy. Progression of global disability in PD, however, is driven by additional factors beyond progressive nigrostriatal denervation leading to increasing severity of cardinal motor features. Progressive pathology in extranigral sites in the brain or peripheral autonomic nervous system contribute to poorly levodopa responsive motor symptoms like postural instability, freezing and falls or nonmotor symptoms. In addition treatment-induced motor complications also impact on PD disability. Although it is widely accepted that clinical progression of PD is multidimensional and in addition includes effects of aging, there is no consensus how to best implement more clinically meaningful endpoints for disease progression trials that would reflect these complex interactions impacting on the evolution of global disability in PD. There is an urgent need for biomarkers for disease progression that would faithfully reflect advancing neurodegeneration and resulted clinical disability in PD and that could be used in shorter term clinical trials testing putative disease modifying agents.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic dysfunction is common in Lewy body disorders (Parkinson's disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Pure Autonomic Failure, and REM sleep disorder). The loss of post-ganglionic myocardial sympathetic nerve fibers is a prominent feature of autonomic dysfunction in such disorders. (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy that visualizes catecholaminergic terminals in vivo is a biomarker used to detect cardiac sympathetic degeneration. Abnormal MIBG uptake has been consistently reported in Lewy body disorders. Some studies agree in the notion that increasing bradykinesia is related with an incremental cardiac sympathetic denervation, whereas tremor is not closely linked to cardiac denervation. \"Atypical\" parkinsonian syndromes, including Multiple System Atrophy, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and others, show modest reductions of cardial MIBG uptake. MIBG scintigraphy is moderately sensitive and specific in differentiating Parkinson's disease from such syndromes. Conversely, its sensitivity and specificity might be better in cognitively impaired patients, helping differential diagnosis between Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and Alzheimer disease. Confounding factors (comorbidities, comedications) should be carefully controlled before analyzing MIBG scintigraphy.",

    "abstract": "The question of early, even premotor, detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) has become a major issue because the effect of neuroprotective therapies depends on the time they are started. A number of clinical premotor markers which are helpful especially in the early diagnosis are being discussed; however, they are mostly unspecific and already signs of the progressing neurodegenerative process. An increasingly important risk marker for PD is genetic predisposition, as the number of known disease causing and modulating genes is increasing. Still, only the minority of PD cases can be attributed to monogenetic forms. Substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity, assessed by transcranial sonography, has been shown to be a typical marker for PD. Because of its stability during the disease course, this echofeature is very helpful in early and differential diagnosis. Moreover, functional neuroimaging studies indicate a vulnerability of the nigrostriatal system of yet healthy subjects with SN hyperechogenicity. This vulnerability may become clinically relevant with age, under neuroleptic therapy, or under demanding motor tasks. The fact that still unaffected mutation carriers for monogenetic PD show this echofeature and that over the years some subjects with SN hyperechogenicity have already been observed to develop PD indicates that it may be regarded as a risk factor--a hypothesis which is currently being investigated in large prospective investigations.",

    "abstract": "The ATP-dependent protein chaperone heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) displays broad anti-aggregation functions and has a critical function in preventing protein misfolding pathologies. According to in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease (PD), loss of Hsp70 activity is associated with neurodegeneration and the formation of amyloid deposits of alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn), which constitute the intraneuronal inclusions in PD patients known as Lewy bodies. Here, we show that Hsp70 depletion can be a direct result of the presence of aggregation-prone polypeptides. We show a nucleotide-dependent interaction between Hsp70 and alphaSyn, which leads to the aggregation of Hsp70, in the presence of ADP along with alphaSyn. Such a co-aggregation phenomenon can be prevented in vitro by the co-chaperone Hip (ST13), and the hypothesis that it might do so also in vivo is supported by studies of a Caenorhabditis elegans model of alphaSyn aggregation. Our findings indicate that a decreased expression of Hip could facilitate depletion of Hsp70 by amyloidogenic polypeptides, impairing chaperone proteostasis and stimulating neurodegeneration.",

Since dopamine transporter (DAT) is a protein located presynaptically on dopaminergic nerve terminals, radioligands that bind to these sites are promising radiopharmaceuticals for evaluation of the integrity of the dopamine system. This study using positron emission tomography (PET) tracers, [(11)C]-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane ([(11)C]beta-CFT, radioligand for DAT), was aimed at evaluating the degree of nigrostriatal damage and its change over weeks in a rat model of PD.\nThe brains of these rats were unilaterally lesioned by mechanical transection of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway at the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). Behavioral studies were carried out by apomorphine (APO) challenge prior to and 1, 2 and 4 weeks after MFB axotomy. Small animal PET scans were performed 2 days after the behavioral test. Immunohistochemistry was conducted 4 days after the last PET scan.\nCompared with the contralateral intact side, a progressively decreased [(11)C]beta-CFT binding was observed on the lesioned side which correlated inversely with the APO-induced rotations. Postmortem immunohistochemical studies confirmed the loss of both striatal dopamine fibers and nigral neurons on the lesioned side.\nThese findings not only demonstrate that the neuronal degeneration in this model is relatively slow, but also suggest [(11)C]beta-CFT is a sensitive marker to monitor the degree of nigrostriatal damage and its change over weeks. This marker can be used prospectively to study the progression of the disease, thereby making detection of early phases of PD possible.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, after Alzheimer's disease. It predominantly affects the elderly. Age is the most clearly established risk factor and there is a male:female ratio of 1.5:1. Current incidence in the general population is 8.4-19 per 100,000 population per year with an approximate prevalence of 120 per 100,000 population. NICE recommends that patients with suspected Parkinson's disease should be referred untreated to a specialist with expertise in parkinsonian disorders. The diagnosis is primarily clinical. Parkinson's disease should be suspected in all patients presenting with bradykinesia (which is essential for the diagnosis of any form of parkinsonism, including Parkinson's disease), muscular rigidity, resting tremor (4-6 Hz) and postural instability not caused by a primary visual, vestibular, cerebellar, or proprioceptive dysfunction. At present, there are no specific biochemical, imaging or genetic tests to assist in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Structural brain imaging (MRI or CT) has no role in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease but may be useful to exclude cerebrovascular disease, hydrocephalus and Wilson's disease in selected cases. Parkinson's disease is a condition that results in both motor and non-motor symptoms. Morbidity associated with non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease is becoming increasingly recognised and some non-motor symptoms such as hyposmia, apathy, depression and REM sleep behaviour disorder may precede the onset of motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is a common but under-recognised behavioural disorder associated with depression and cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). However, the longitudinal course of apathy in PD has not been studied.\nTo examine the occurrence of and risk factors for apathy over time in a representative sample of patients with PD.\nA sample of 139 patients was drawn from a population-based prevalence study of PD in Rogaland County, Western Norway. Apathy was measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, using a composite score >or=4 to indicate clinically significant apathy. Additional measurements included standardised rating scales for parkinsonism, depression and cognitive impairment. A follow-up evaluation was carried out in 79 patients (78.2% of the survivors) 4 years later.\nOf the 79 patients included in this study, 29 patients (36.7%) had never had apathy, 11 (13.9%) had persistent apathy, and a further 39 (49.4%) developed apathy during follow-up. At follow-up, patients with apathy were more frequently depressed and demented than never-apathetic patients. Dementia at baseline and a more rapid decline in speech and axial impairment during follow-up were independent risk factors for incident apathy.\nApathy is a persistent behavioural feature in PD with a high incidence and prevalence over time. Progression of motor signs predominantly mediated by non-dopaminergic systems may be a useful preclinical marker for incident apathy in PD.",

    "abstract": "A man with early non-fluctuating Parkinson's disease developed disabling camptocormia. The patient was treated with posterior thoracolumbar fixation, which subsequently had to be augmented with anterior interbody fusion. Although the patient ultimately achieved excellent sagittal correction, his postoperative course was complicated and prolonged. Therefore, although this case demonstrates that spinal fixation surgery can be successful, it should probably only be offered after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation has been unsuccessful, or for well motivated patients who express a strong wish for this major reconstructive surgery.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of the synaptic protein alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body disease (LBD), a heterogeneous group of disorders with dementia and parkinsonism, where Alzheimer's disease and PD interact. Accumulation of alpha-syn in these patients might be associated with alterations in the autophagy pathway. Therefore, we postulate that delivery of beclin 1, a regulator of the autophagy pathway, might constitute a strategy toward developing a therapy for LBD/PD. Overexpression of alpha-syn from lentivirus transduction in a neuronal cell line resulted in lysosomal accumulation and alterations in autophagy. Coexpression of beclin 1 activated autophagy, reduced accumulation of alpha-syn, and ameliorated associated neuritic alterations. The effects of beclin 1 overexpression on LC3 and alpha-syn accumulation were partially blocked by 3-MA and completely blocked by bafilomycin A1. In contrast, rapamycin enhanced the effects of beclin 1. To evaluate the potential effects of activating autophagy in vivo, a lentivirus expressing beclin 1 was delivered to the brain of a alpha-syn transgenic mouse. Neuropathological analysis demonstrated that beclin 1 injections ameliorated the synaptic and dendritic pathology in the tg mice and reduced the accumulation of alpha-syn in the limbic system without any significant deleterious effects. This was accompanied by enhanced lysosomal activation and reduced alterations in the autophagy pathway. Thus, beclin 1 plays an important role in the intracellular degradation of alpha-syn either directly or indirectly through the autophagy pathway and may present a novel therapeutic target for LBD/PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is second only to Alzheimer's disease as the most common devastating human neurodegenerative disorder. Despite intense investigation, no interdictive therapy is available for PD. We investigated whether simvastatin, a Food and Drug Administration-approved cholesterol-lowering drug, could protect against nigrostriatal degeneration after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxication to model PD in mice. First, MPP(+) induced the activation of p21(ras) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in mouse microglial cells. Inhibition of MPP(+)-induced activation of NF-kappaB by Deltap21(ras), a dominant-negative mutant of p21(ras), supported the involvement of p21(ras) in MPP(+)-induced microglial activation of NF-kappaB. Interestingly, simvastatin attenuated activation of both p21(ras) and NF-kappaB in MPP(+)-stimulated microglial cells. Consistently, we found a very rapid activation of p21(ras) in vivo in the substantia nigra pars compacta of MPTP-intoxicated mice. However, after oral administration, simvastatin entered into the nigra, reduced nigral activation of p21(ras), attenuated nigral activation of NF-kappaB, inhibited nigral expression of proinflammatory molecules, and suppressed nigral activation of glial cells. These findings paralleled dopaminergic neuronal protection, normalized striatal neurotransmitters, and improved motor functions in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Similarly, pravastatin, another cholesterol-lowering drug, suppressed microglial inflammatory responses and protected dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-intoxicated mice, but at levels less than simvastatin. Furthermore, both the statins administered 2 d after initiation of the disease were still capable of inhibiting the demise of dopaminergic neurons and concomitant loss of neurotransmitters, suggesting that statins are capable of slowing down the progression of neuronal loss in the MPTP mouse model. Therefore, we conclude that statins may be of therapeutic benefit for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 gene, UCHL1, located on chromosome 4p14, has been studied as a potential candidate gene for Parkinson's disease risk. The authors conducted a Human Genome Epidemiology review and meta-analysis of published case-control studies of the UCHL1 S18Y variant and Parkinson's disease in Asian and Caucasian samples. The meta-analysis of studies in populations of Asian ancestry showed a statistically significant association between the Y allele and reduced risk of Parkinson's disease under a recessive model (odds ratio (OR) for YY vs. SY + SS = 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67, 0.94; P = 0.006). For a dominant model, the association was not significant in Asian populations (OR for YY + SY vs. SS = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.14; P = 0.33). For populations of European ancestry, the meta-analysis showed a significant association between the Y allele and decreased risk of Parkinson's disease under a dominant model (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.98; P = 0.02) but not under a recessive model (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.30; P = 0.65). Using the Venice criteria, developed by the Human Genome Epidemiology Network Working Group on the assessment of cumulative evidence, the authors concluded that moderate evidence exists for an association between the S18Y variant and Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "It was shown that high levels of alpha-synuclein in substantia nigra are essential in pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD), and SNCA expression in neurons is controlled by GATA-2 transcription factor, which plays also crucial role in central nervous system development, and erythroid cells differentiation. Recently, significant association of two GATA2 SNPs with early-onset coronary artery disease has been presented. In this case-control study we tested a hypothesis that polymorphism of GATA2 gene may be associated with sporadic PD. Five tag SNPs within GATA2 gene (rs2860228:G > A, rs2335052:G > A, rs11717152:A > C, rs2713604:G > A, and rs3803:C > T) were investigated in 368 PD patients and 349 controls of Caucasian origin from Poland. We did not find any significant differences in the GATA2 allele and genotype frequencies between PD cases and controls, for individual SNPs, neither in haplotype analysis. Elevated frequency of rs3803T allele was observed in early-onset PD patients (vs. controls and vs. late-onset PD), but this difference was not significant (0.05 < p < 0.1). We conclude that GATA2 polymorphism is not an important risk factor for sporadic PD in Caucasians.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the brain, several studies have linked this central RAS to neurological disorders such as ischaemia, Alzheimer's disease and depression. In the last decade, evidence has accumulated that the central RAS might also play a role in Parkinson's disease. Although the exact cause of this progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the basal ganglia remains unidentified, inflammation and oxidative stress have been suggested to be key factors in the pathogenesis and the progression of the disease. Since angiotensin II is a pro-inflammatory compound that can induce the production of reactive oxygen species due to activation of the NADPH-dependent oxidase complex, this peptide might contribute to dopaminergic cell death. In this review, three different strategies to interfere with the pathogenesis or the progression of Parkinson's disease are discussed. They include inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor and stimulation of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor.",

    "abstract": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands (GDFLs) as well as other trophic factors have, in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD), demonstrated the potential for excellent ameliorative properties. Clinical trials that have mechanically injected GDNF intracerebrally, while demonstrating relative safety, have been clinically disappointing to date. Likewise, recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) delivered neurturin (cere-120) has also been demonstrated to be safe in humans, however clinical results have been negative. The failure of the major clinical trials has cast some doubt in the field about trophic factor delivery for the treatment of PD. In this review, we make the case that GDFLs are likely to function only when there are remaining dopamine neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway as opposed to other candidate modes of action. Thus, it is our view that utilizing earlier stage PD patients who have significant nigrostriatal dopamine innervation remaining would be more ideal to demonstrate the efficacy of GDFLs. This is particularly true when considering a novel delivery method such as gene transfer. However, if earlier stage patients are to be enrolled in GDFL gene transfer trials, then a much better safety profile must be demonstrated by preclinical experiments. One important safety advance might be the use of an external regulation system to control the expression level of the transgene. However, gene regulation systems pose unique safety issues and we will discuss these in detail. It is our view that GDFLs still remain as a promising therapeutic approach for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the extrapyramidal system resulting from the deficiency of dopamine in the basal ganglia. We experienced the perioperative management of a patient with Parkinson's disease with intravenous infusion of levodopa, precursor of which is dopamine. A 73-year-old woman with Parkinson's tremor in her bilateral fingers of Hoehn and Yahr stage II was scheduled for repair of bladder prolapse under general anesthesia. Antiparkinson drug levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa) 400 mg per day had been administered orally to control her bilateral tremor. Three hours before the operation, oral medication including levodopa/carbidopa 100 mg was withdrawn, and intravenous infusion of levodopa 100mg was started. Without any premedication, anesthesia was induced with intravenous infusion of propofol, fentanyl, and vecuronium, and tracheal intubation was facilitated. Anesthesia was maintained with inhalation of air, oxygen, and sevoflurane, and intravenous infusion of fentanyl. After emergence, we found no neurological disorders excluding her tremor. Levodopa/carbidopa 100 mg was readministered orally four hours after the operation and total of 300 mg had been administered orally on the operative day. Levodopa/carbidopa 400 mg per day had been administered orally after the first operative day. She did not show deterioration of her symptom of Parkinson's disease, and develop any complications during the perioperative period. We need to manage Parkinson's disease with intravenous infusion of levodopa during the perioperative period, taking care of the symptom of Parkinson's disease and the occurrence of complications.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and movement disorders, currently one of the leading subspecialties among Spanish neurologists, raised only modest interest during the seventies. This is well reflected in Revista de Neurologia, the first journal entirely devoted to Neurology in Spain. Along five years (1973-1977) only 3% out of papers published were devoted to this subject. The functions of the basal ganglia were poorly known. PD was regarded as a disorder of muscular tone, rigidity playing a pivotal role to explain most, if not all, parkinsonian signs. 'Arteriosclerotic parkinsonism', whatever the symptoms might be, was applied to any form of parkinsonism occurring after the age of sixty. Such cases were usually treated by general practitioners, while younger patients were as a rule channeled for stereotactic surgery. Initial experience on levodopa therapy in Spain began around 1970, the drug being initially administered to severely disabled patients after long years of disease course. This, and probably because of the use of somewhat liberal doses of the new drug as well, severe choreiform dyskinesias were particularly common. Unexpectedly, neurologists were newly confronted to unusual, levodopa-related behavioral effects, such as manic behavior and overt hypersexuality, arising interest on non-motor aspects of PD, which had been mostly neglected at the time. Generalized awareness among physicians of PD as a common disorder in a wide age range in the general population, recognition of early signs and, most important, availability of an effective therapy, prompted widespread interest of Spanish neurologists on parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that anemia may be a risk factor for dementia, for restless legs syndrome, and for Parkinson disease (PD). Thus, we investigated the association of anemia with the subsequent risk of PD using a case-control study design.\nWe used the medical records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to identify 196 subjects who developed PD in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1976 through 1995. Each incident case was matched by age (+/-1 year) and sex to a general population control. We reviewed the complete medical records of cases and controls in the system to detect anemia defined using the World Health Organization criteria.\nAnemia was more common in the history of cases than of controls (odds ratio 2.00, 95% confidence interval 1.31-3.06, p = 0.001). The association remained significant after adjustment for cigarette smoking, exposure to pesticides, or hysterectomy (in women). The association was not significantly different between men and women, or between PD patients with or without rest tremor. Analyses stratified by time of onset of anemia showed a greater association for anemia that started 20 to 29 years before the onset of PD. Hemoglobin levels were slightly but consistently lower in cases than in controls across all ages.\nOur results support an association between anemia experienced early in life and the later development of Parkinson disease. The interpretation of this association remains uncertain.",

    "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness is common in Parkinson's disease and has been associated with Parkinson's disease-related dementia. Narcoleptic features have been observed in Parkinson's disease patients with excessive daytime sleepiness and hypocretin cell loss has been found in the hypothalamus of Parkinson's disease patients, in association with advanced disease. However, studies on cerebrospinal fluid levels of hypocretin-1 (orexin A) in Parkinson's disease have been inconclusive. Reports of sleep studies in Parkinson's disease patients with and without excessive daytime sleepiness have also been disparate, pointing towards a variety of causes underlying excessive daytime sleepiness. In this study, we aimed to measure cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels in Parkinson's disease patients with and without dementia and to study their relationship to dementia and clinical excessive daytime sleepiness, as well as to describe potentially related sleep architecture changes. Twenty-one Parkinson's disease patients without dementia and 20 Parkinson's disease patients with dementia, along with 22 control subjects without sleep complaints, were included. Both Epworth sleepiness scale, obtained with the help of the caregivers, and mini-mental state examination were recorded. Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels were measured in all individuals using a radio-immunoassay technique. Additionally, eight Parkinson's disease patients without dementia and seven Parkinson's disease patients with dementia underwent video-polysomnogram and multiple sleep latencies test. Epworth sleepiness scale scores were higher in Parkinson's disease patients without dementia and Parkinson's disease patients with dementia than controls (P < 0.01) and scores >10 were more frequent in Parkinson's disease patients with dementia than in Parkinson's disease patients without dementia (P = 0.04). Cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels were similar among groups (controls = 321.15 +/- 47.15 pg/ml; without dementia = 300.99 +/- 58.68 pg/ml; with dementia = 309.94 +/- 65.95 pg/ml; P = 0.67), and unrelated to either epworth sleepiness scale or mini-mental state examination. Dominant occipital frequency awake was slower in Parkinson's disease patients with dementia than Parkinson's disease patients without dementia (P = 0.05). Presence of slow dominant occipital frequency and/or loss of normal non-rapid eye movement sleep architecture was more frequent among Parkinson's disease patients with dementia (P = 0.029). Thus, excessive daytime sleepiness is more frequent in Parkinson's disease patients with dementia than Parkinson's disease patients without dementia, but lumbar cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels are normal and unrelated to severity of sleepiness or the cognitive status. Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid does not accurately reflect the hypocretin cell loss known to occur in the hypothalamus of advanced Parkinson's disease. Alternatively, mechanisms other than hypocretin cells dysfunction may be responsible for excessive daytime sleepiness and the sleep architecture alterations seen in these patients.",

    "abstract": "alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn) is a presynaptic protein that is widely implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Emerging evidence indicates a strong correlation between alpha-syn aggregation and proteasomal dysfunction as one of the major pathways responsible for destruction of the dopamine neurons. Using parkinsonism mimetics (MPP(+), rotenone) and related oxidants, we have identified an oxidant-induced alternative splicing of alpha-syn mRNA, generating a shorter isoform of alpha-syn with deleted exon-5 (112-syn). This spliced isoform has an altered localization and profoundly inhibits proteasomal function. The generation of 112-syn was suppressed by constitutively active MEK-1 and enhanced by inhibition of the Erk-MAP kinase pathway. Overexpression of 112-syn exacerbated cell death in a human dopaminergic cell line compared to full-length protein. Expression of 112-syn and proteasomal dysfunction were also evident in the substantia nigra and to a lesser extent in striatum, but not in the cortex of MPTP-treated mice. We conclude that oxidant-induced alternative splicing of alpha-syn plays a crucial role in the mechanism of dopamine neuron cell death and thus contributes to PD.",

    "abstract": "Some studies have demonstrated altered circulating levels of cytokines, including IL-6, in Parkinson's disease (PD), implying a possible involvement of inflammatory and immune-mediated mechanisms in its pathogenesis. Moreover, the increased production of inflammatory cytokines has been associated with cognitive impairment and poor physical performance in the elderly. We compared serum levels of IL-6 in 44 PD patients and 22 healthy subjects, and correlated them with PD specific instruments and functional tests. Serum levels of IL-6 were significantly increased in PD (p=0.015). There was no correlation between serum levels of IL-6 and instruments traditionally used to assess PD severity. However, we found that PD patients with higher serum levels of IL-6 spent more time at functional mobility tests and had lower gait speed. Also, these patients had major problems to keep balance during functional tasks that required postural changes and that had a reduced base support. These results showed that high levels of IL-6 can be involved with an acceleration of muscle catabolism leading to sarcopenia, therefore contributing to weakness and fatigue, and may also be associated with functional disability in PD.",

One avenue holding tremendous potential to find therapies against human diseases is the use of intact living systems where complex biological processes can be examined. Despite key differences that need to be taken into account when using invertebrate models such as Drosophila, there are many advantages offered by this system. The rapid generation time and the ability to easily generate transgenic animals together with the variety of genetic tools to control temporal and spatial expression of any given gene makes the fly model a very attractive system to study human neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we analyze how the use of fruit flies has revealed to be an excellent tool providing valuable insights into the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "The physiopathology of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) is unclear. Presynaptic pharmacokinetic and postsynaptic pharmacodynamic mechanisms may be involved. We have analyzed several clinical and pharmacological parameters, as well as the status of the presynaptic dopamine nigrostriatal pathway by using DaTSCAN, in 14 patients with Parkinson disease who developed early and severe LID despite using low doses of levodopa and 10 patients without this complication despite the use of high levodopa doses. Patients were matched for age at onset, duration, and severity of Parkinson disease. Statistically significant differences were observed only in the duration of LID during the levodopa challenge. However, clear differences were also observed in weight and sex distribution (women with low weight predominate in the group with dyskinesia), severity and duration of LID, and total levodopa dosage. The pattern of response to levodopa and the uptake of (123I)N-w-fluoropropyl-2[beta]-carbomethoxy-3[beta]-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane were similar in both groups. These results indicate that the development of LID needs additional contributions beyond nigrostriatal denervation. Factors related to sex and body weight could play an important role. However, these findings should be considered cautiously because of the limited statistical power of the study.",

    "abstract": "A range of psychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits occur in Parkinson disease (PD), and symptom overlap and comorbidity complicate the classification of nonmotor symptoms. The objective of this study was to use analytic-based approaches to classify psychiatric and cognitive symptoms in PD.\nCross-sectional evaluation of a convenience sample of patients in specialty care.\nTwo outpatient movement disorders centers at the University of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\nOne hundred seventy-seven patients with mild-moderate idiopathic PD and without significant global cognitive impairment.\nSubjects were assessed with an extensive psychiatric, neuropsychological, and neurological battery. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to statistically delineate group-level symptom profiles across measures of psychiatric and cognitive functioning. Predictors of class membership were also examined.\nResults from the LCA indicated that a four-class solution best fit the data. The 32.3% of the sample had good psychiatric and normal cognitive functioning, 17.5% had significant psychiatric comorbidity but normal cognition, 26.0% had few psychiatric symptoms but had poorer cognitive functioning across a range of cognitive domains, and 24.3% had both significant psychiatric comorbidity and poorer cognitive functioning. Age, disease severity, and medication use predicted class membership.\nLCA delineates four classes of patients in mild-moderate PD, three of which experience significant nonmotor impairments and comprise over two thirds of patients. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits follow distinct patterns in PD, and further study is needed to determine whether these classes are generalizable, stable, predict function, quality of life, and long-term outcomes and are amenable to treatment at a class level.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether these variants are a genetic risk factor in sporadic PD patients in the Korean population. A total of 923 patients and 422 healthy subjects were included. The variants were screened by a SNaPshot assay. The LRRK2 G2385R variant was detected in 82 PD patients (8.9%, two homozygous and 80 heterozygous) and in 21 normal controls (5.0%, all heterozygous). The frequency of the LRRK2 G2385R variant in PD was significantly higher than in normal controls (adjusted odds ratio 1.83, p = 0.0170, 95% confidence interval 1.11-3.00). There were no differences in the mean age at onset or gender between the G2385R carriers and the non-carriers in PD patients. The LRRK2 R1628P variant was very rare (0.78% in patients versus 0.26% in controls) in the tested 384 patient-control pairs, and was not a significant risk factor. This study supports that the LRRK2 G2385R variant may be a genetic risk factor for sporadic PD in the Korean population.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the locomotor behavior of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy older adults during obstacle negotiation, both in the approaching and crossing phases. Twelve people with idiopathic PD, with mild to moderate disease, and 12 healthy individuals (CG) walked across an 8m pathway for three obstacle conditions: no obstacle, low obstacle and high obstacle. Each performed five trials for each obstacle condition. Performance was more disturbed for the high obstacle than the low obstacle. During the approach phase, people with PD demonstrated shorter stride length (F(1,22)=8.55, P=0.008) and greater stride duration (F(1,22)=7.371, P=0.013) than controls. Those with PD also increased their stance phase durations (F(1,22)=7.426, P=0.012) for both obstacle conditions, while the CG maintained comparable step durations for all conditions. For the crossing phase, people with PD demonstrated shorter step length (F(1,22)=9.699, P=0.005) over the obstacle. Leading limbs were closer to the obstacle, before and after crossing. Thus PD hypokinesia compromises the approach and crossing phases of obstacle negotiation.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism of gait instability in Parkinson disease (PD) is not completely understood. We examined the saccular part of the otolith function and its possible contribution to gait difficulties in idiopathic PD.\nFifty-four PD patients (mean age 66 years, 32 men) were included. These were characterized with respect to disease severity, duration, treatment, as well as the presence of disease complications, dementia and depression. Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) were recorded in patients and 53 healthy controls.\nVEMP responses were recorded in all controls. Unilaterally absent VEMP responses were found in 20 (37%) of PD patients and bilaterally absent responses in four (7.4%). All patients with preserved peaks had normal latencies as compared with controls. The number of PD patients with abnormal/absent VEMP was thus significantly higher than in controls (p<0.00). There were no correlations between VEMP abnormality and disease stage, falls or medication. A correlation was found between abnormal VEMP and depression/antidepressant treatment.\nPD patients often have absent vestibulocollic reflexes. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the significance of this finding for postural stability and gait in this disorder.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have difficulty in performing learned movements automatically. The neural mechanism of this deficiency remains unclear. In the current study, we used functional MRI (fMRI) and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) methods to investigate the changes in effective connectivity of the brain networks when movements become automatic in PD patients and age-matched normal controls. We found that during automaticity, the rostral supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and cingulate motor area had increased effective connectivity with brain networks in PD patients. In controls, in addition to these regions, the putamen also had automaticity-related strengthened interactions with brain networks. The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex had more connectivity at the novel stage than in the automatic stage in normal subjects, but not in PD patients. The comparison of the PPI results between the groups showed that the rostral supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and cingulate motor area had significantly more increased effective connectivity with several regions in normal subjects than in PD. The changes of effective connectivity in some areas negatively correlated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Our findings show that some of the factors related to PD patients having difficulty achieving automaticity are less efficient neural coding of movement and failure to shift execution of automatic movements more subcortically. The changes of effective connectivity become more abnormal as the disorder progresses. In addition, in PD, the connections of the attentional networks are altered.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) has been reported to accumulate in Lewy bodies (LBs), a histological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Recent findings propose that GRK5 might function in Parkinson's disease via phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein, a major component of LBs. In this study, the changes of the expression levels of GRK5 and its possible effects in Parkinson's disease were evaluated in cell lines and transgenic mice model of alpha-synuclein overexpression. Both the expression levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear distributed GRK5 were induced an increase via alpha-synuclein overexpression in vivo and in vitro. The observations that the levels of alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser-129 (pS129-alpha-synuclein) remain unchanged despite the downregulation of GRK5 by short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA) transfection suggest that GRK5 is not the sole kinase involved in phosphorylating alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease. In addition, the findings that nuclear accumulation of GRK5 inhibits bcl-2 transcription and expression, at least in part by enhancing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, show an unexpected role for nuclear GRK5 in the regulation of an apoptosis-related gene. The present study suggests that GRK5 may be extensively involved in the mechanism of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "To objectively evaluate the clinical efficacy of Gulling Pa'an Capsule (GPC), a Chinese medicine, in treating Parkinson's disease (PD).\nAccording to the good clinical practice (GCP) principle, a multi-centered, double-blinded, layered, randomized and grouping-controlled clinical trial was carried out from May 2002 to January 2005 on 242 PD patients. Among them, 53 patients who had never received levodopa were randomized into two groups, 28 in group A treated with GPC, and 25 in group B treated with placebo; patients who had received levodopa were assigned depending on the Hoehn & Yahr (H-Y) grade, to 4 groups, 75 and 19 of grade 1.5 -3 in group C and E, respectively, 79 and 16 of grade 4 in group D and F, respectively, patients in group C and E were treated with GPC and Levodopa, and those in group D and F treated with placebo and Levodopa for control. The treatment course was 12 weeks for all. Changes of unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) II/III scores in comparing with the baseline were assessed. For the groups C, D, E and F, the dosage of levodopa administered was also recorded. Meanwhile, the blood pressure, pulse rate, blood and urine routine, liver and renal functions, electrocardiogram (ECG) and adverse reactions were monitored as the indices for safety supervise.\n(1) After treatment, symptoms were markedly improved in 1 out of the 28 patients in group A and improved in 11, the markedly improving rate was 3.6% and the improving rate 39.3%; while in group B, the corresponding outcomes were 0 (0/25) and 28.0% (7/25) respectively, showing insignificant difference between the two groups. UPDRS scores, including the total, II and III scores were all significantly lowered in group A after treatment (P < 0.01, P < 0.05); while in group B, significant lowering only showed in terms of UPDRS III (P < 0.05); but the inter-group comparison of the changes in all the three items showed no significant difference. (2) The significant improving rate was 12.0% (9/75) and improving rate 48.0% (36/75) in group C, while those in group D, 12.7% (10/79) and 24.1% (19/79) respectively, the efficacy in group C was better (P < 0.05). The items of 3 UPDRS scores in groups C and D were all significantly lowered after treatment (P < 0.01), and the lowering in group C was more significant in terms of the total and II scores (P < 0.05). (3) The significant improving rate was 5.3% (1/19) and improving rate 36.8% (7/19) in group E, while in group F 0% (0/19) and 25.0% (4/16), respectively, showing insignificant difference between them; UPDRS scores lowered significantly in the two groups after treatment (P < 0.01), also showed no statistical significance in comparison (P > 0.05). (4) The dosage of Levodopa required in groups C and E was significantly reduced after treatment (P < 0.05), while in groups D and F, it was unchanged (P > 0.05); yet, the further analysis displayed that significant reduction only presented in group C (P < 0.05), not in the other three groups.\nThe overall efficacy of levodopa in combined with GPC for treating PD patients of H-Y grade 1.5 -3 is significantly higher than that of levodopa alone. GPC shows obvious effects in improving patients' motor syndrome and the quality of life; as used in combining with levodopa, the dosage of levodopa required could be reduced.",

The study aim was to examine changes in cardiovascular abnormalities after the discontinuation or continuation of anti-parkinson treatment.\nParkinson patients treated with either ergot-derived (n = 32) or non-ergot-derived (n = 8) DAs who had been diagnosed with valvular abnormalities or pulmonary hypertension, were included in this one-year follow up study. After an initial echocardiography, five patients continued ergot-derived DA treatment, while the remaining 35 either changed (n = 27) or continued (n = 8) non-ergot-derived DA treatment. The patients were followed up after a mean of 14 months (range: 12-18 months). Changes in the severity of valve disease and pulmonary hypertension were evaluated by an analysis of digitally stored echocardiograms. The recordings were performed blinded to medical treatment, while the analyses were blinded to both the medical treatment and the timing of image acquisition.\nFollow up revealed the risk of worsening cardiovascular abnormalities to be 60% in patients who continued ergot-derived DA treatment, compared to 14% in those who changed to, or continued with, non-ergot-derived DA medication (p < 0.05). Overall, patients who changed from ergot-derived to non-ergot-derived DAs did not exhibit any significant worsening or improvement of their valve abnormality, although the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) fell from 26 +/- 12 mmHg to 22 +/- 8 mmHg at follow up (p < 0.005).\nAt one year after discontinuation of ergot-derived DAs, a mild but statistically significant reduction in PAP was detected. Overall, valvular regurgitation remained without definite worsening or improvement in these patients. Among patients who continued ergot-derived DAs despite a cardiovascular abnormality, the follow-up indicated an increased risk of worsening.",

    "abstract": "Theories of instrumental learning aim to elucidate the mechanisms that integrate success and failure to improve future decisions. One computational solution consists of updating the value of choices in proportion to reward prediction errors, which are potentially encoded in dopamine signals. Accordingly, drugs that modulate dopamine transmission were shown to impact instrumental learning performance. However, whether these drugs act on conscious or subconscious learning processes remains unclear. To address this issue, we examined the effects of dopamine-related medications in a subliminal instrumental learning paradigm. To assess generality of dopamine implication, we tested both dopamine enhancers in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dopamine blockers in Tourette's syndrome (TS). During the task, patients had to learn from monetary outcomes the expected value of a risky choice. The different outcomes (rewards and punishments) were announced by visual cues, which were masked such that patients could not consciously perceive them. Boosting dopamine transmission in PD patients improved reward learning but worsened punishment avoidance. Conversely, blocking dopamine transmission in TS patients favored punishment avoidance but impaired reward seeking. These results thus extend previous findings in PD to subliminal situations and to another pathological condition, TS. More generally, they suggest that pharmacological manipulation of dopamine transmission can subconsciously drive us to either get more rewards or avoid more punishments.",

    "abstract": "VPS41 is a protein identified as a potential therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease (PD) as a result of a high-throughput RNAi screen in Caenorhabditis elegans. VPS41 has a plausible mechanistic link to the pathogenesis of PD, as in yeast it is known to participate in trafficking of proteins to the lysosomal system and several recent lines of evidence have pointed to the importance of lysosomal system dysfunction in the neurotoxicity of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). We found that expression of the human form of VPS41 (hVPS41) prevents dopamine (DA) neuron loss induced by alpha-syn overexpression and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) neurotoxicity in C. elegans. In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines stably transfected with hVPS41, we determined that presence of this protein conferred protection against the neurotoxins 6-OHDA and rotenone. Overexpression of hVPS41 did not alter the mitochondrial membrane depolarization induced by these neurotoxins. hVPS41 did, however, block downstream events in the apoptotic cascade including activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and PARP cleavage. We also observed that hVPS41 reduced the accumulation of insoluble high-molecular weight forms of alpha-syn in SH-SY5Y cells after treatment with rotenone. These data show that hVPS41 is protective against both alpha-syn and neurotoxic-mediated injury in invertebrate and cellular models of PD. These protective functions may be related to enhanced clearance of misfolded or aggregated protein, including alpha-syn. Our studies indicate that hVPS41 may be a useful target for developing therapeutic strategies for human PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly that may lead to both motor and non-motor symptoms with consequent severe impairment of quality of life. PD also represents a substantial economic burden on society because of the patient's decreased ability to work, increased need for care and need for costly treatment. Evaluation of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) is an important tool in cost-effectiveness analyses. To date, however, few data have become available about the utility gains or losses associated with the disease and its management.\nTo evaluate the changes in health state values in patients with newly diagnosed PD during their first year of drug treatment, and to calculate the gain in QALYs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for this patient group.\nIn this prospective, population-based, cohort study, 199 patients with incident PD and 172 controls were followed over 1 year. Clinical data, drug use and utility scores obtained from the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) health state questionnaire were documented.\nPatients with PD had lower SF-6D utility scores than controls at baseline. Patients started on antiparkinsonian drugs had an improvement in mean utility scores of 0.039 from 0.667 to 0.706 (p < 0.05). The ICER was euros 45,259 (2007 values) per QALY, of which two-thirds consisted of the costs of drugs and one-third represented the costs of clinical consultations.\nDrug treatment in patients with early-stage PD increases health state values, but the ICER is high. Further investigations will be necessary to capture the full consequences of treatment of PD and to evaluate the efficacy of disease management in this setting.",

    "abstract": "This study questions whether increased dopamine (DA) turnover in nigral neurons leads to formation of Lewy bodies (LBs), the characteristic alpha-synuclein-containing cytoplasmic inclusion of Parkinson disease (PD).\nMice with targeted deletion of the dopamine D(2) receptor gene (D(2)R[-/-]) have higher striatal and nigral dopamine turnover and elevated oxidative stress. These mice were examined for evidence of histological, biochemical, and gene expression changes consistent with a synucleinopathy.\nLB-like cytoplasmic inclusions containing alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin were present in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) neurons of older D(2)R(-/-) mice, and were also occasionally seen in aged wild-type mice. These inclusions displaced the nucleus of affected cells and were eosinophilic. Diffuse cytosolic alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in SNpc neurons increased with age in both wild-type and D(2)R(-/-) mice, most likely because of redistribution of alpha-synuclein from striatal terminals to SNpc cell bodies. Gene and protein expression studies indicated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and changes in trafficking and autophagic pathways in D(2)R(-/-) SNpc. These changes were accompanied by a loss of DA terminals in the dorsal striatum, although there was no evidence of progressive cell death in the SNpc.\nIncreased sprouting and DA turnover, as observed in PD and D(2)R(-/-) mice, augments LB-like inclusions and axonal degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. These changes are associated with ER stress and autophagy.",

    "abstract": "We studied the relation between Parkinson disease (PD) and professional exposure to pesticides in a community-based case-control study conducted in a population characterized by a high prevalence of exposure. Our objective was to investigate the role of specific pesticide families and to perform dose-effect analyses.\nPD cases (n = 224) from the Mutualit\u00e9 Sociale Agricole (France) were matched to 557 controls free of PD affiliated with the same health insurance. Pesticide exposure was assessed using a 2-phase procedure, including a case-by-case expert evaluation. Analyses of the relation between PD and professional exposure to pesticides were first performed overall and by broad category (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides). Analyses of 29 pesticide families defined based on a chemical classification were restricted to men. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing values of pesticide families. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression, both using a complete-case and an imputed dataset.\nWe found a positive association between PD and overall professional pesticide use (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-3.1), with a dose-effect relation for the number of years of use (p = 0.01). In men, insecticides were associated with PD (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.1-4.3), in particular organochlorine insecticides (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.2-5.0). These associations were stronger in men with older onset PD than in those with younger onset PD, and were characterized by a dose-effect relation in the former group.\nOur results support an association between PD and professional pesticide exposure, and show that some pesticides (ie, organochlorine insecticides) may be more particularly involved.",

    "abstract": "Since the basal ganglia are thought to have a role in controlling ocular fixation it is expected that patients with parkinsonian conditions would show impaired performance in fixation tasks. Our study examines ocular fixation in patients with a range of parkinsonian conditions (Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease, Multiple System Atrophy and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy). Eye movements were recorded from 44 patients and 50 age matched control subjects during ocular fixation both with and without a visible target. The data for each patient were then characterised in terms of fixation periods and saccadic intrusions (SI). Patient groups exhibited larger and more frequent SI as well as greater displacement from the fixation target. Patients with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy exhibit larger SI than control subjects when fixation targets are visible, this difference is reversed in the absence of a fixation target. Patients with Multiple System Atrophy show increased frequency of SI both with and without a visible target. Our findings show that ocular fixation is impaired in patients with parkinsonian conditions and may prove useful as part of an oculomotor profile to aid with the differentiation of parkinsonian conditions.",

    "abstract": "The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis-mediated cell death and neurotoxin-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. There is a growing body of evidence implicating BDNF in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting it may eventually be used in the development of neuroprotective therapies for PD. The serum BDNF of 47 PD patients and of 23 control subjects was assessed, and serum BNDF levels were significantly decreased in PD patients when compared with controls (p = 0.046). Interestingly enough, BDNF correlated positively with a longer time span of the disease, as well as with the severity of the PD symptoms and with more advanced stages of the disease. Additionally, higher BDNF levels also correlated with poor balance as assessed by the Berg Balance Scale, more time spent at the Timed Up & Go Test, reduced speed of gait and shorter distance walked during the Six-Minute Walk Test. Our results corroborate the literature regarding the involvement of BDNF in PD. We hypothesize that lower BDNF levels in early stages of the disease may be associated with pathogenic mechanisms of PD. The increase of BDNF levels with the progression of the disease may be a compensatory mechanism in more advanced stages of PD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in LRRK2 gene represent the most common known genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nWe used metabolomic profiling to identify biomarkers that are associated with idiopathic and LRRK2 PD. We compared plasma metabolomic profiles of patients with PD due to the G2019S LRRK2 mutation, to asymptomatic family members of these patients either with or without G2019S LRRK2 mutations, and to patients with idiopathic PD, as well as non-related control subjects. We found that metabolomic profiles of both idiopathic PD and LRRK2 PD subjects were clearly separated from controls. LRRK2 PD patients had metabolomic profiles distinguishable from those with idiopathic PD, and the profiles could predict whether the PD was secondary to LRRK2 mutations or idiopathic. Metabolomic profiles of LRRK2 PD patients were well separated from their family members, but there was a slight overlap between family members with and without LRRK2 mutations. Both LRRK2 and idiopathic PD patients showed significantly reduced uric acid levels. We also found a significant decrease in levels of hypoxanthine and in the ratios of major metabolites of the purine pathway in plasma of PD patients.\nThese findings show that LRRK2 patients with the G2019S mutation have unique metabolomic profiles that distinguish them from patients with idiopathic PD. Furthermore, asymptomatic LRRK2 carriers can be separated from gene negative family members, which raises the possibility that metabolomic profiles could be useful in predicting which LRRK2 carriers will eventually develop PD. The results also suggest that there are aberrations in the purine pathway in PD which may occur upstream from uric acid.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies indicate an increased frequency of mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (GBA), a deficiency of which causes Gaucher's disease, among patients with Parkinson's disease. We aimed to ascertain the frequency of GBA mutations in an ethnically diverse group of patients with Parkinson's disease.\nSixteen centers participated in our international, collaborative study: five from the Americas, six from Europe, two from Israel, and three from Asia. Each center genotyped a standard DNA panel to permit comparison of the genotyping results across centers. Genotypes and phenotypic data from a total of 5691 patients with Parkinson's disease (780 Ashkenazi Jews) and 4898 controls (387 Ashkenazi Jews) were analyzed, with multivariate logistic-regression models and the Mantel-Haenszel procedure used to estimate odds ratios across centers.\nAll 16 centers could detect two GBA mutations, L444P and N370S. Among Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, either mutation was found in 15% of patients and 3% of controls, and among non-Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, either mutation was found in 3% of patients and less than 1% of controls. GBA was fully sequenced for 1883 non-Ashkenazi Jewish patients, and mutations were identified in 7%, showing that limited mutation screening can miss half the mutant alleles. The odds ratio for any GBA mutation in patients versus controls was 5.43 across centers. As compared with patients who did not carry a GBA mutation, those with a GBA mutation presented earlier with the disease, were more likely to have affected relatives, and were more likely to have atypical clinical manifestations.\nData collected from 16 centers demonstrate that there is a strong association between GBA mutations and Parkinson's disease.",

GBA was fully sequenced for 1883 non-Ashkenazi Jewish patients, and mutations were identified in 7%, showing that limited mutation screening can miss half the mutant alleles. The odds ratio for any GBA mutation in patients versus controls was 5.43 across centers. As compared with patients who did not carry a GBA mutation, those with a GBA mutation presented earlier with the disease, were more likely to have affected relatives, and were more likely to have atypical clinical manifestations.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability and falls are a major source of disability in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. These problems are currently not well addressed by either pharmacotherapy nor by subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation surgery. The neuroanatomical substrates of posture and gait are poorly understood but a number of important observations suggest a major role for the pedunculopontine nucleus and adjacent areas in the brainstem. We conducted a double-blinded evaluation of unilateral pedunculopontine nucleus deep-brain stimulation in a pilot study in six advanced Parkinson's disease patients with significant gait and postural abnormalities. There was no significant difference in the double-blinded on versus off stimulation Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores after 3 or 12 months of continuous stimulation and no improvements in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III scores compared to baseline. In contrast, patients reported a significant reduction in falls in the on and off medication states both at 3 and 12 months after pedunculopontine nucleus deep-brain stimulation as captured in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II scores. Our results suggest that pedunculopontine nucleus deep-brain stimulation may be effective in preventing falls in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease but that further evaluation of this procedure is required.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of a pilot study to assess the feasibility of using accelerometer data to estimate the severity of symptoms and motor complications in patients with Parkinson's disease. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was implemented to estimate the severity of tremor, bradykinesia and dyskinesia from accelerometer data features. SVM-based estimates were compared with clinical scores derived via visual inspection of video recordings taken while patients performed a series of standardized motor tasks. The analysis of the video recordings was performed by clinicians trained in the use of scales for the assessment of the severity of Parkinsonian symptoms and motor complications. Results derived from the accelerometer time series were analyzed to assess the effect on the estimation of clinical scores of the duration of the window utilized to derive segments (to eventually compute data features) from the accelerometer data, the use of different SVM kernels and misclassification cost values, and the use of data features derived from different motor tasks. Results were also analyzed to assess which combinations of data features carried enough information to reliably assess the severity of symptoms and motor complications. Combinations of data features were compared taking into consideration the computational cost associated with estimating each data feature on the nodes of a body sensor network and the effect of using such data features on the reliability of SVM-based estimates of the severity of Parkinsonian symptoms and motor complications.",

    "abstract": "It is reasonably well established that prior to the motor phase of classical Parkinson's disease (PD) there is a prodromal period of several years duration. Once typical motor features appear, the disease continues up to 20 years depending on multiple variables. The clinical features of the prodromal and motor phases may be correlated with pathological changes in the central and autonomic nervous systems to allow a sequential plan of disease progression. We present a 'best guess' for a typical individual presenting with PD in their sixties and speculate that the disease will last approximately 40 years from the earliest non-motor features to death. Appreciation of this concept may allow better strategies for slowing or halting disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Linkage analysis in familial Parkinson's disease (PD) identified a locus in 2q36-37 (PARK11). Sequencing of GIGYF2 identified several variants only present amongst PD individuals.\nWe analyzed the presence of disease-associated GIGYF2 variants in familial and sporadic PD from Spanish origin by sequencing of 147 PD individuals. The entire GIGYF2 coding sequence was analyzed in 122 familial PD individuals and exons 2, 4, 8-11, 14 and 25-26 were sequenced in 25 sporadic PD to identify disease-associated variants.\nWe found no variants associated with PD and failed to identify any of previously PD-associated GIGYF2 variants in our sample. We identified four novel missense changes in GIGYF2. p.Met48Ile was found in a PD individual who also was a carrier of two PARKIN mutations. p.Q1244_Q1247del variant was present only in one PD individual but not found in 70 controls. However, its location in the highly polymorphic GIGYF2 glutamine/proline-rich region does not support a role in PD. Two variants (p.P1238insAGC and p.Q1249del) were present both in PD subjects and in controls. Additionally, the p.L1230_Q1237del variant, which was previously considered as a PD-associated change, was found in one control.\nOur findings suggest that GIGYF2 mutations are not a frequent cause of PD in the Spanish population, since we found no clearly segregating variants. We propose further analyses in PD subjects from different populations to define the role of GIGYF2.

However, its location in the highly polymorphic GIGYF2 glutamine/proline-rich region does not support a role in PD. Two variants (p.P1238insAGC and p.Q1249del) were present both in PD subjects and in controls. Additionally, the p.L1230_Q1237del variant, which was previously considered as a PD-associated change, was found in one control.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic atrial vulnerability is proposed as one of the mechanisms of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. In this study, we examined the early changes in atrial refractoriness and intra- and inter-atrial conduction times after radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation of accessory pathway (AP).\nTwenty-four consecutive patients with WPW syndrome and documented AV reciprocating tachycardia but without history of PAF (fourteen male, mean age 39 +/- 9.5 years) and 27 control subjects (six female, mean age 51.4 +/- 10.1 years) with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) who underwent ablation of the slow AV nodal pathways were enrolled into the study. Regional atrial effective refractory periods (AERPs), AERP dispersion, and intra- and inter-atrial conduction times were obtained before and 30 min after ablation and were compared between two groups. In the study group, patients with and without inducible AF were also compared regarding these parameters.\nIn the study group, AERPs in higher right atrium and right posterolateral atrium were significantly increased, and AERP dispersion, intra-atrial, and inter-atrial conduction times were significantly decreased after ablation; AERP in distal coronary sinus was unchanged. In control group, no significant difference was observed in these parameters. Inducibility of AF was significantly reduced following ablation of AP in the study group (from seven to zero of 24 patients, p = 0.016). Comparison between patients with (n = 7) and without (n = 17) AF revealed that left atrium diameter was larger, AERPs in the right posterolateral atrium before and after ablation, and ERP of AP were shorter in AF group.\nIn WPW syndrome patients, RF catheter ablation of AP results in an 'immediate' decrease in atrial vulnerability. Since inducibility of AF becomes more difficult in this less vulnerable atrium, the AP itself may play an important role in the development of AF.",

    "abstract": "The biochemical basis of major depression (MD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is largely unknown. To increase our understanding of MD in PD patients, the levels of monoamine metabolites (HVA, 5-HIAA and MHPG), BDNF, orexin-A, IL-6 and corticosterone were examined in cerebrospinal fluid. The analyses were performed in MD patients with (n = 11) and without (n = 12) PD at baseline and after 12 weeks' of treatment with the antidepressant citalopram, and in patients with solely PD (n = 14) at baseline and after 12 weeks. The major findings were that PD patients with MD had significantly lower baseline levels of MHPG, corticosterone and IL-6 when compared to patients with solely MD. In response to citalopram treatment, patients with solely MD exhibited an expected decrease in 5-HIAA and MHPG levels which was not found in PD patients with MD. Moreover, the levels of BDNF and IL-6 were lower in PD patients with MD compared with patients with solely MD after treatment with citalopram. Thus, the biochemical basis and the response to citalopram differ between PD patients with MD and patients with solely MD.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is an important risk factor in the development of Parkinson's disease. Numerous potential predictive markers of Parkinson's disease may present before motor symptoms emerge, but testing of these markers in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder has been performed only in small studies. There has been no comparison of markers between patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and Parkinson's disease, and between men and women. We evaluated an array of potential Parkinson's disease predictive markers in 159 patients; including 68 with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, 36 controls, 34 Parkinson's patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and 21 Parkinson's patients without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Compared with controls, patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder demonstrated substantial olfactory loss (P < 0.001). Olfaction was more impaired in Parkinson's disease than idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and did not differ between Parkinson's patients with, or without, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Numerous measures of motor function including the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale alternate tap, Purdue Peg Board and Timed 'Up and Go' were impaired in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder compared with controls (P < 0.01). All of these motor measures were worse with Parkinson's disease than with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, regardless of rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder status. Autonomic symptoms and systolic blood pressure drop were impaired in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder compared with controls (P = 0.003). Orthostatic abnormalities in Parkinson's disease were found in the group with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P < 0.001). However, Parkinson's patients without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder were not different than controls and had less impairment than those with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P = 0.004) and Parkinson's patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P < 0.001). Colour vision was impaired in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder compared with controls (P < 0.001). However, only Parkinson's patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder had abnormalities significantly different than controls (P < 0.001), and there were significant differences between Parkinson's patients with or without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P < 0.04). Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder patients had slightly increased harm avoidance scores on personality testing (P = 0.04). Other than slightly better performances among women in the Purdue Peg Board, there was no difference in any measure between men and women, suggesting similar pathogenic processes underlying rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder demonstrate abnormalities in numerous potential markers of neurodegenerative disease--these markers are heterogeneous, generally correlate with each other and occur equally in men and women. Although these abnormalities are usually intermediate between control values and Parkinson's patients, autonomic dysfunction and colour vision appear to be more linked to rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder status than Parkinson's disease, suggesting a unique pathophysiology of these abnormalities.",

A total of twelve participants (seven men and five women) with PD were recruited prior to and following participation in an MBCT course and interviewed with a semi-structured interview schedule. One participant who opted out of the course was also interviewed. The researcher also participated in another MBCT course to enhance their understanding of the participants' experience, keeping a detailed diary as a means of acknowledging bias in the analysis process. Themes were summarized from transcripts and later classified into superordinate themes, which were compared across all cases. Transcripts were also read and analysed by a second author and participants were given the opportunity to comment upon emerging themes.\nMajor themes included (1) changing patterns of coping; (2) the role of mindfulness in consolidating existing coping skills in the context of loss; (3) group support in the context of loss and society that stigmatizes difference; and (4) the dualism of experience between Parkinson's and mindful meditation.\nThis study has indicated that MBCT could benefit people with PD and was an acceptable form of group intervention.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), occurring in up to 42% of patients (2). There is no recognized treatment. This is a study of modafinil for Parkinson's disease related fatigue. Ethical approval was given. Patients with idiopathic PD were recruited from a Movement Disorders clinic. Those with depression, dementia, and other causes for fatigue were excluded. Patients were assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), self-rating of improvement, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and UPDRS. Modafinil was titrated up over 4 weeks to maximum of 400 mg/day. There followed a 5 week maintenance phase before reassessment. Thirteen patients participated. No significant change was seen in any safety measure. The FSS did not change significantly, however those on modafinil rated an improvement in their fatigue compared to placebo. The Modafinil group had a statistically significant improvement on ESS (p < 0.05). This is a small study of modafinil in selected PD patients. There is a suggestion of improvement on the global clinical impression scale for fatigue, but no significant change on FSS. A larger study is needed to further evaluate this drug in PD fatigue. This study highlights the problems with recruitment when trialing treatments of non-motor symptoms in PD. A significant improvement in EDS was seen.",

    "abstract": "Co-occurrence of Parkinson disease (PD) and melanoma has been reported in numerous studies. If this was due to common genetic mechanisms, a positive family history of melanoma would be associated with an excessive PD risk, independent of environmental risk factors for PD.\nWe prospectively examined associations between a family history of melanoma and PD among 157,036 men and women free of PD at baseline (1990 for men and 1982 for women) who participated in 2 ongoing US cohorts: the Health Professional Follow-up Study and the Nurses' Health Study. Information on family history of melanoma in parents or siblings was assessed via questionnaire. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models and pooled using a fixed-effects model.\nDuring 14-20 years follow-up, we identified 616 incident PD cases. A family history of melanoma in a first-degree relative was associated with a higher risk of PD (multivariate relative risk = 1.85; 95% confidence interval: 1.2, 2.8; p = 0.004), after adjusting for smoking, ethnicity, caffeine intake, and other covariates. In contrast, we did not observe significant associations between a family history of colorectal, lung, prostate, or breast cancer and PD risk. Interactions between melanoma family history and age, smoking, or caffeine intake were not significant and subgroup analyses according to these factors generated similar results.\nOur findings support the notion that melanoma and Parkinson disease (PD) share common genetic components. The genetic determinants of melanoma could therefore be explored as susceptibility candidate genes for PD.",

    "abstract": "Some 5 years ago, it was first discovered that mutations in the gene encoding LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat protein kinase 2) are tightly linked with a subset of familial PD (Parkinson's disease). Before this genetic association, LRRK2 had never been investigated biochemically. Now it is of utmost importance to establish whether LRRK2 is a bona fide kinase in vitro and in vivo and to understand how mutations of LRRK2 lead to the specific loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra to cause PD. In spite of tremendous efforts in the research community, there is no consensus with regard to the magnitude of the enzymatic activity of LRRK2 mutant forms that segregate with PD owing, in part, to the lack of a highly sensitive kinase assay system, and it is still unclear whether an abnormal increase in kinase activity is responsible for LRRK2-associated PD. As described in this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Nichols et al.. have developed an extensive set of molecular tools, including an optimized peptide substrate for determining in vitro kinase activity of LRRK2, a set of kinase inhibitors that can be used to explore LRRK2 substrate specificity and biology, a much-needed murine-specific antibody for immunoprecipation, and efficient gene-silencing approaches. In the present commentary, we discuss some of the components of this new LRRK2 biochemical toolbox and how they can be used to better understand this enigmatic kinase.",

    "abstract": "Cannabinoid-based medicines have been proposed as clinically promising therapies in Parkinson's disease (PD), given the prominent modulatory function played by the cannabinoid signaling system in the basal ganglia. Supporting this pharmacological potential, the cannabinoid signaling system experiences a biphasic pattern of changes during the progression of PD. Thus, early and presymptomatic stages, characterized by neuronal malfunctioning but little evidence of neuronal death, are associated with desensitization/downregulation of CB(1) receptors. It was proposed that these losses may be part of the pathogenesis itself, since they can aggravate different cytotoxic insults which are controlled in part by cannabinoid signals, mainly excitotoxicity but also oxidative stress and glial activation. By contrast, intermediate and, in particular, advanced stages of parkinsonism characterized by a profound nigral degeneration and occurrence of major parkinsonian symptoms (e.g. bradykinesia), are associated with upregulatory responses of CB(1) receptors, possibly CB(2) receptors too, and the endocannabinoid ligands for both receptor types. This would explain the motor inhibition typical of this disease and the potential proposed for CB(1) receptor antagonists in attenuating the bradykinesia typical of PD. In addition, certain cannabinoid agonists have been proposed to serve as neuroprotective molecules in PD, given their well-demonstrated capability to reduce excitotoxicity, calcium influx, glial activation and, in particular, oxidative injury that cooperatively contribute to the degeneration of nigral neurons. However, the potential of cannabinoid-based medicines in PD have been still scarcely studied at the clinical level despite the existence of solid and promising preclinical evidence. Considering the relevance of these preclinical data, the need for finding treatments for motor symptoms that may be alternative to classic dopaminergic replacement therapy, and the lack of efficient neuroprotective strategies in PD, we believe it is of major interest to develop further studies that allow the promising expectations generated for these molecules to progress from the present preclinical evidence towards a real clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) in WPW syndrome occurs earlier and is more common than in the general population.\nTo evaluate the predisposing factors for the first episode of AF in patients with WPW.\nWe analysed data on 930 patients (510 males, 420 females) with WPW treated in our centre during 1988-2007. AF was diagnosed in 236 patients (25% - 161 males, 75 females, aged 36 +/- 15 years). The AF group was divided into two subgroups - patients with AF and atrio-ventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), and patients with AF only. The analysis included subjects' age and gender, the presence of AVRT, the number and properties of accessory pathways, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and concomitant cardiovascular diseases.\nThe groups did not differ in terms of concomitant diseases and LVEF. In the whole group of patients with AF, arrhythmia occurred earlier in men than in women (34 +/- 14 vs. 40 +/- 15 years of age, p = 0.013). In the subgroup with AF and AVRT, AF was documented earlier compared to patients with AF only (34 +/- 15 vs. 41 +/- 15 years of age, p = 0.0072). AVRT was more common in patients with AF compared to those without AF (69 vs. 53%, p < 0.001). In the whole group of 930 patients, AF was observed more often in patients with overt pre-excitation compared to concealed WPW (29 vs. 12%, p < 0.001).\nIn patients with WPW syndrome, AF occurs earlier in patients with AVRT compared to patients with AF and without documented AVRT, earlier in men compared to women, and is more common in patients with overt WPW.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease develop motor disturbances often accompanied by peripheral autonomic dysfunctions, including gastrointestinal disorders, such as dysphagia, gastric stasis and constipation. While the mechanisms subserving enteric autonomic dysfunctions are not clearly understood, they may involve the enteric dopaminergic and/or nitrergic systems. In the present study, we demonstrate that rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons develop a marked inhibition of propulsive activity compared to sham-operated controls, as indicated by a 60% reduction of daily fecal output at the 4th week of observation. Immunohistochemical data revealed that 6-hydroxydopamine treatment did not affect the total number of HuC/D-positive myenteric neurons in both the proximal and distal segments of ileum and colon. Conversely, in the distal ileum and proximal colon the number of nitrergic neurons was significantly reduced. These results suggest that a disturbed distal gut transit, reminiscent of constipation in the clinical setting, may occur as a consequence of a reduced propulsive motility, likely due to an impairment of a nitric oxide-mediated descending inhibition during peristalsis.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the contribution of executive functions to arrangement problem-solving performance in Parkinson's disease (PD), with a particular focus on self-directed cognitive flexibility. PD patients and healthy age-matched adults completed a battery of neuropsychological measures of executive function and a series of anagram puzzles, some of which were modified to include graphemic cues designed to prime potential solutions. PD patients were less successful than healthy controls (HC) at resolving the anagram puzzles, but when a cue accompanied the anagram stimulus, PD patients performed normally. Anagram performance was associated with measures of verbal fluency and inhibition; no association emerged with working memory or set shifting ability. These data suggest that subjects with PD may have difficulty sufficiently inhibiting their automatic response to the experimental stimulus in order to generate the novel arrangements required to produce a successful response. Such deficits might be remediated through the use of environmental cues designed to support strategy generation.",

    "abstract": "PD is a neurodegenerative disorder triggered by genetic and/or environmental factors and the pathological processes begin many years before motor symptom manifestation. Several drugs are available to treat PD, but there are still many aspects of the disease that have not been well addressed. These include nonmotor symptoms, disease progression, and preventing levodopa-induced motor complications. Besides the concept of continuous dopaminergic stimulation, the benefit of which has not been proved in clinical settings (see the STRIDE-PD trial), the nondopaminergic drugs offer promising alternatives to dopaminergic medication. However, modification and further development of dopaminergic molecules may provide significant symptomatic improvement and improved quality of life. In this review, we summarized new treatments that are in the pipeline, with patients being recruited for clinical trials. Among the compounds being studied are well-known ones (e.g., folic acid or methylphenidate), which have been used in other diseases, and newly developed drugs with known mode of action (e.g., the dopamine agonist aplindore) or compounds with completely new mechanisms, which have not yet been used in clinical settings (e.g., levetiracetam or Neu 120). A major breakthrough in treating Parkinson's disease cannot be expected with molecules from the first two cases, whereas significant clinical benefits can be predicted with the drugs in the last group. However, without these large-scale, well-designed, multicenter trials, the promising preclinical results cannot be directly adopted in patient care. Hopefully, some of these trials will end soon with positive results, and certain drugs will become available with which to treat PD patients, although still many aspects (e.g., the most problematic one, the question of neuroprotection) still need to be addressed.",
