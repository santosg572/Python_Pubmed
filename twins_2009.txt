    "abstract": "Graves' disease in adolescents and adults usually presents with classic symptoms including weight loss, frequent stools, irritability, and heat intolerance. However, the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in young children are often subtle, unrecognized, and atypical. Here, we report a 6 year-old girl who presented for evaluation of increased. thirst. Review of systems was negative with respect to weight loss, irritability, palpitations, diarrhea, and school performance problems. Physical exam was unremarkable except for an enlarged thyroid gland. Her identical twin sister, who incidentally accompanied her to clinic, also had a previously unidentified goiter. Testing for diabetes was negative. Further laboratory investigation was consistent with Graves' disease in both girls. Polydipsia is a rare and unusual presenting feature of hyperthyroidism in children. The evolution of this case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for thyroid disease during childhood.",

    "abstract": "Objective. Conjoined twin is a rarely seen congenital anomaly together with severe mortality and morbidity. The more common types of conjoined twins include the thoracopagus type, where the fusion is anterior, at the chest, and involves the heart. We are reporting one case of conjoined thoracopagus twins diagnosed by ultrasonography at 11 weeks. Case Report. In a multigravid pregnant woman who has been admitted to our clinic with a diagnosis of conjoined twins, thoracopagus, by ultrasonography at an 11-week gestation, termination of the pregnancy was performed. Conclusion. Making an early diagnosis with ultrasonographic examination gives the parents a chance to elect pregnancy termination.",

    "abstract": "Valid causal inference is central to progress in theoretical and applied psychology. Although the randomized experiment is widely considered the gold standard for determining whether a given exposure increases the likelihood of some specified outcome, experiments are not always feasible and in some cases can result in biased estimates of causal effects. Alternatively, standard observational approaches are limited by the possibility of confounding, reverse causation, and the nonrandom distribution of exposure (i.e., selection). We describe the counterfactual model of causation and apply it to the challenges of causal inference in observational research, with a particular focus on aging. We argue that the study of twin pairs discordant on exposure, and in particular discordant monozygotic twins, provides a useful analog to the idealized counterfactual design. A review of discordant-twin studies in aging reveals that they are consistent with, but do not unambiguously establish, a causal effect of lifestyle factors on important late-life outcomes. Nonetheless, the existing studies are few in number and have clear limitations that have not always been considered in interpreting their results. It is concluded that twin researchers could make greater use of the discordant-twin design as one approach to strengthen causal inferences in observational research.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral genetic research has revealed that nonshared environments are associated with depression and depressive symptomatology. Research examining specific nonshared environments related to adolescent depression remains relatively limited. To address this gap in the published data, we analyzed a sample of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to examine the effects of nonshared environmental variables on adolescent depression.\nWe used the MZ-twin-difference-scores method on data from MZ twins (n = 289 twin pairs) drawn from the Add Health to examine the effect of specific nonshared environments on adolescent depression.\nFindings from the MZ-difference-scores analyses revealed that between-twin differences in maternal disengagement were significantly related to differences in adolescent depression. Additional analyses revealed that the association between adolescent depression and maternal disengagement was largely a child-driven effect.\nCompared with previous research that has implicated maternal socialization in the development of depression among adolescents, the results of the current study revealed that differences in maternal socialization were a response and not a cause of adolescent depression.",

    "abstract": "Malaria during first few months of life may be due to transplacental transfer of parasitized maternal erythrocytes. The most common clinical features of congenital malaria are fever, anaemia and splenomegaly. Other signs and symptoms include hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, regurgitation, loose stools, and poor feeding. A 28 year old woman (G2P1A), with 36 weeks gestation, reported to a health facility in Sunyani on 22(nd) February 2009 with history of labour pains, without fever. According to the mother, even though she did not sleep in insecticide treated bed net during her pregnancy, she took all the recommended drugs of sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine-intermittent preventive treatment for malaria. She delivered twins on the same day. The mother and the twins developed fever on the same day. A laboratory investigation on the three of them was positive for malaria parasites. The three were successfully treated with quinine. Congenital malaria is real and it is therefore recommended that babies born to mothers with malaria should be screened for congenital malaria.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the serum differentially expressed proteins in discordance of congenital esotropia phenotypes in monozygotic twins and non-strabismus ones.\nSELDI-TOF-MS technology was used to detect the changes of protein expression in a couple of twins with phenotype discordance esotropia (twins A is orthotropia and twins B is esotropia). In addition, two non-twins esotropia and 2 orthotropia children with the same age were chosen. The obtained serum differential expression proteome was validated in 12 non-twins esotropia and 18 orthotropia children and initial predication by proteinum database.\nThe result of SELDI-TOF-MS in 6 serums showed that four differential expression protein peaks, the molecular weight of these different proteins were 4146, 4801, 7786 and 5859, and the former 3 proteins were down-regulated and last one was up-regulated. Their features were fairly coincident with glucagons precursor, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP), cAMP dependent protein kinase inhibitor \u03b1 and anti-metastasis gene (antigen).\nThe expression of different proteins among the esotropic and orthotopic children was existed. The expression of different proteins was main down-regulated in the strabismus patients. Glucagons precursor, protein kinase A inhibitor \u03b1 and PACAP may be related with occurrence of congenital esotropia.",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in learning and memory, but its effects on the fiber architecture of the living brain are unknown. We genotyped 455 healthy adult twins and their non-twin siblings (188 males/267 females; age: 23.7\u00b12.1 years, mean\u00b1SD) and scanned them with high angular resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to assess how the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism affects white matter microstructure. By applying genetic association analysis to every 3D point in the brain images, we found that the Val-BDNF genetic variant was associated with lower white matter integrity in the splenium of the corpus callosum, left optic radiation, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and superior corona radiata. Normal BDNF variation influenced the association between subjects' performance intellectual ability (as measured by Object Assembly subtest) and fiber integrity (as measured by fractional anisotropy; FA) in the callosal splenium, and pons. BDNF gene may affect the intellectual performance by modulating the white matter development. This combination of genetic association analysis and large-scale diffusion imaging directly relates a specific gene to the fiber microstructure of the living brain and to human intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about paternal psychosocial factors and childhood asthma.\nWe sought to examine the link between maternal and paternal psychosocial stress and asthma outcomes in young children.\nParents of 339 pairs of Puerto Rican twins were interviewed individually about their own psychosocial stress and about asthma in their children at age 1 year and again about their child's asthma at age 3 years. Fathers were asked about symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and antisocial behavior. Mothers were asked about depressive symptoms. Outcomes assessed in children included recent asthma symptoms, oral steroid use and hospitalizations for asthma in the prior year, and asthma diagnosis. Generalized estimated equation models were used for the multivariate analysis of parental psychosocial stress and asthma morbidity in childhood.\nAfter multivariable adjustment, paternal PTSD symptoms, depression, and antisocial behavior were each associated with increased asthma symptoms at age 1 year (eg, odds ratio, 1.08 for each 1-point increase in PTSD score; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14). Maternal depressive symptoms were associated with an increased risk of asthma hospitalizations at age 1 year. At age 3 years, maternal depressive symptoms were associated with asthma diagnosis and hospitalizations for asthma (odds ratio for each 1-point increase in symptoms, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.00-1.36). In an analysis combining 1- and 3-year outcomes, paternal depression was associated with oral steroid use, maternal depressive symptoms were associated with asthma hospitalizations and asthma diagnosis, and parental depression was associated with hospitalizations for asthma.\nBoth paternal and maternal psychosocial factors can influence asthma morbidity in young Puerto Rican children.",

    "abstract": "Exercise behavior, cardiorespiratory fitness, and obesity are strongly influenced by genetic factors. By studying young adult twins, we examined to what extent these interrelated traits have shared genetic and environmental etiologies. We studied 304 twin individuals selected from the population-based FinnTwin16 study. Physical activity was assessed with the Baecke questionnaire, yielding three indexes: sport index, leisure-time index, and work index. In this study, we focused on sport index, which describes sports participation. Body composition was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and cardiorespiratory fitness using a bicycle ergometer exercise test with gas exchange analysis. The Baecke sport index was associated with high maximal oxygen uptake adjusted for lean body mass (Vo(2max)[adj]) (r = 0.40), with low body fat percentage (BF%) (r = -0.44) and low waist circumference (WC) (r = -0.29). Heritability estimates for the key traits were as follows: 56% for sport index, 71% for Vo(2max)[adj], 77% for body mass index, 66% for WC, and 68% for BF%. The association between sport index and Vo(2max) was mostly explained by genetic factors (70%), as were both the association between sport index and BF% (71%) and that between sport index and WC (59%). Our results suggest that genetic factors explain a considerable part of the associations between sports participation, cardiorespiratory fitness, and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Factor analysis of psychotic symptoms frequently results in positive, negative, and disorganized dimensions, but heritability estimates have not yet been reported. Symptom dimensions are usually only measured in individuals with psychotic disorders. Here, it is valuable to assess influences acting via liability to psychosis and independent modifying effects. We estimated heritability for psychotic symptom dimensions, taking account of these issues. Two-hundred-and-twenty-four probandwise twin pairs (106 monozygotic, 118 same-sex dizygotic), where probands had psychoses, were ascertained from the Maudsley Twin Register in London (1948-1993). Lifetime history of DSM-III-R psychotic disorder and psychotic symptom dimensions was assessed from clinical records and research interviews and rated using the Operational Criteria Checklist. Estimates of heritability and environmental components of variance in liability were made with structural equation modeling using a causal-contingent common pathway model adapted for ascertainment from a clinical register. Significant heritability was found for DSM-III-R psychotic disorder (h\u00b2\u2009=\u200990%, 95%CI 68-94%) and the disorganized symptom dimension (h\u00b2\u2009=\u200984%, 95%CI 18-93%). The heritability for the disorganized dimension remained significant when influences acting through liability to psychosis were set to zero, suggesting that some influences on disorganization are modifying factors independent of psychosis liability. However, the relative extent of modifying factors versus influences acting through psychosis liability could not be clearly determined. To our knowledge, this study provides the first formal evidence of substantive heritability for the disorganized symptom dimension, and suggests that genetic loci influencing disorganization in individuals with psychoses are in some cases different from loci that influence risk of psychotic disorders themselves.",

    "abstract": "We describe a pair of monozygotic twins with an attenuated form of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I). At age 24, they both developed cervical myelopathy as a cardinal manifestation. They each also had mild valve abnormalities and both inguinal and umbilical hernia, however, other characteristic features of MPS-I were absent or very mild. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the cervical cord compressed by pachymeningeal hypertrophy. Surgery with dural plasty and laminoplasty resulted in decompression of the cervical cord with clinical improvement, revealing marked thickening of the dura mater. Both patients showed a marked decrease of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) activity with c.252insC (p.P55fsX62; known) and c.1209C>A (p.T374N; novel) mutations of the IDUA gene (IDUA). Patients with MPS-I have been reported to present with various clinical phenotypes and severities even if they have identical mutations of IDUA. The quite similar, unique phenotype in monozygotic twins suggests that not only IDUA mutation but also other genetic factors than IDUA markedly influence the clinical manifestations of MPS-I.",

    "abstract": "IVF treatments carry a high risk of twin pregnancy which confers a higher risk to the mother and child than singletons. Increased use of elective single embryo transfer (eSET) can reduce this twin rate. We aimed to utilize a previously published data set and statistical model based on routinely collected clinical data to predict the outcomes of policies that increase the proportion of eSET.\nThe models allow simultaneous prediction of outcomes from double embryo transfer (DET) and SET. These models were used to predict outcomes for different scenarios using SET in both the initial (fresh) transfer and over a complete cycle (transfer of all embryos created, with cryopreservation). A total of 16 096 cycles (12 487 fresh and 3609 frozen) from 9040 couples treated between 2000 and 2005 were included in the final analyses.\nFor any transfer, SET has about a one-third lower live birth rate relative to DET: this can be partially mitigated by appropriate patient and treatment cycle selection, with several realistic policies performing similarly. However, if we consider complete cycles with embryo cryopreservation, it is possible for repeat SET to produce more live births per egg retrieval than repeat DET.\nAll patients receiving SET would have a higher chance of successful treatment in that cycle if they received DET. The selection of appropriate patients for SET can partially ameliorate the overall loss. For complete cycles, repeat SET could produce more live births per egg retrieval than repeat DET. All treatments involving SET will increase the number of treatments required to achieve a successful outcome and this extra treatment burden will be a significant barrier to the implementation of such treatments.",

We reviewed all the monozygotic twins with specific concordance in congenital heart lesions in the last 18 years. Two pairs were found. First, a pair of 13 years-old monozygotic female twins; a severe infundibular and pulmonary valve stenosis was discovered in both girls. In the second pair of twins (8 years-old boys), Tetralogy of Fallot was diagnosed by echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization and angicardiography. In fluorescence hybridization test in situ all patients were negative for microdeletion in chromosome 22q11. Anatomic differences between twins are not enough explained on genetic bases; it's necessary to consider the role of other factors, probably acquired during the first stages of embryonic development. These are the two first pairs of twins with specific concordance in congenital cardiac lesions reported in Mexico.",

    "abstract": "A population-based record linkage case cohort of 239,995 births, to 119,214 women, born in Western Australia from 1980 to 2001 inclusive, was used to measure the recording of selected indicators of maternal health (current and prior) during pregnancy. We compared records of women with singleton pregnancies with that in twin pregnancies Mothers of first- and second-born singletons (n = 117,647) were compared with women with a first-born singleton followed by twins (n = 1,567). Binary indicators were used to calculate population prevalence of medical conditions, pregnancy complications and birth outcomes. Infant outcomes included stillbirth, low birthweight, preterm birth and birth defects. Women with twins were significantly older and taller, with similar rates of medical conditions and pregnancy complications during first singleton pregnancies compared with women with two consecutive singletons. However, during their second pregnancy, women with twins had significantly higher rates of essential hypertension, pre-eclampsia, threatened abortion, premature rupture of the membranes and ante partum hemorrhage with abruption than women with singletons. For both groups, maternal conditions in the first pregnancy were underreported in the second pregnancy, including diabetes, epilepsy, asthma, chronic renal dysfunction and essential hypertension. At the second birth, twins were 3 times more likely to be stillborn, 17 times more likely to be low birthweight and 4 times more likely to be delivered preterm compared with singletons. This research demonstrates the importance for epidemiologists and others, of having access to a complete maternal medical history for analyses of risks associated with maternal, infant and childhood morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder caused by heterozygotic inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene at 17q11.2. The associated phenotypes are highly variable, and modifying genes have been proposed to explain at least in part the intriguing expressivity. Given that haploinsufficiency of the NF1 gene product neurofibromin is responsible for some of the clinical manifestations, variations in expression of the wildtype NF1 allele might modify the phenotype. We therefore investigated epigenetic molecular modifications that could result in variable expression of the normal NF1 allele. To exclude confounding by DNA sequence variations, we analyzed monozygotic twin pairs with NF1 who presented with several discordant features. We fine-mapped the methylation pattern of a nearly 1 kb NF1 promoter region in lymphocytes of 8 twin pairs. All twin pairs showed significant intra-pair differences in methylation, especially of specific promoter subregions such as 5'UTR, exon 1 and intron 1 (+7 to +622), transcription factor binding sites and promoter elements like NF1HCS. Furthermore, we detected significant intra-pair differences in cytosine methylation for the region from -249 to -234 with regard to discordance for optic glioma with a higher grade of methylation in glioma cases. In conclusion, our findings of epigenetic differences of the NF1 promoter in leukocytes within mono zygotic twin pairs may serve as a proof of principle for other tissues. The results point towards a role of methylation patterns of the normal NF1 allele for expression differences and for modification of the NF1 phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to quantify contributions of genetic and environmental factors to variation in timing of emergence of the primary teeth in a sample of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, using univariate model-fitting approaches. The sample comprised 94 pairs of monozygotic twins and 125 pairs of dizygous twins, all of European ancestry, aged from 2-6 years. Tooth emergence timing was based on parental report, with a subset of data validated by clinical assessment. Heritability estimates for tooth emergence timing were generally high, around 90%, however estimates for the lower right lateral incisor and the lower canines were around 50%. These findings confirm a strong genetic influence on observed variation in the timing of emergence of the human primary teeth.",

    "abstract": "Cytotoxic precipitation of free \u03b1-globin monomers and its production of reactive oxygen species cause red cell membrane damage that leads to anemia and eventually ineffective erythropoiesis in \u03b2-thalassemia. Alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) was found to bind only to free \u03b1-globin monomers creating a stable and inert complex which remains soluble in the cytoplasm thus preventing harmful precipitations. Alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein was shown to bind nascent \u03b1-globin monomers with transient strength before transferring \u03b1-globin to \u03b2-globin to form hemoglobin tetramer. A classical twin study would be beneficial to investigate the role of genetics and environment in the variation of alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein expression as this knowledge will enable us to determine further investigations with regards to therapeutic interventions if alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein is to be a therapeutic agent for \u03b2-thalassemia. This study investigates the heritability influence of alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein expression and factors that may contribute to this. Results indicated that a major proportion of alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein expression was influenced by genetic heritability (46%) with cis-acting factors accounting for 19% and trans-acting factors at 27%.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed depressive and psychosomatic symptoms in relation to co-twin dependence in 419 twins at the age of 22 to 30 years. Depressive symptoms were assessed, as previously, with Children's Depression Inventory modified to be suitable for this age and reported as a total score and three subscales (low self-confidence, anhedonia and sadness) based on factor analysis as reported in a previous epidemiological study conducted in Finland. Items assessing nervous complaints and somatic symptoms were adapted from Finnish studies of juvenile health habits. Inter-twin dependence decreased with increasing age in both genders. Monozygotic twins, especially monozygotic females, reported most often to be dependent on their co-twin. When the symptom reporting was evaluated in relation to co-twin dependence, no relation was found between co-twin dependence and depressive symptom reporting. However, dependence-independence imbalance within twin pair was associated with elevated levels of depressive and psychosomatic symptoms, especially in twins who perceived themselves as dependent and the co-twin as independent. We conclude that there was no relation found between co-twin dependence and depressive symptom reporting in male and female twins except for the few imbalance cases, where most symptoms were reported by those dependent twins who felt their co-twin as independent.",

    "abstract": "We examined whether externalizing problem behaviors (hyperactivity-impulsivity, aggressiveness, and inattention) predict illicit drug use independently, or whether their associations with drug use are mediated through cigarette smoking. We used a prospective longitudinal design within the FinnTwin12-17 study among Finnish adolescents with baseline at age 12 and follow-up surveys at ages 14 and 17. Path models were conducted with Mplus and included 1992 boys and 2123 girls. The outcome was self-reported ever use of cannabis or other illicit drugs at age 17. The predictors were: externalizing behaviors (hyperactivity-impulsivity, aggressiveness, and inattention) assessed by teachers and parents (age 12) and self-reported cigarette smoking (age 14). The findings differed across behavior studied. The association of hyperactivity-impulsivity with drug use was mostly mediated through earlier cigarette smoking. Concerning aggressiveness and inattention, the results were different among girls than boys. Among girls no significant mediation occurred, whereas among boys more consistent evidence on mediation was seen. Consistently in all models, the direct association of early cigarette smoking on drug use was strong and highly significant. We conclude that the associations of externalizing problem behaviors with illicit drug use are partially mediated through cigarette smoking. Although interventions targeting externalizing problem behaviors may protect adolescents from early onset smoking and subsequently experimenting with drugs, interventions to prevent cigarette smoking initiation are also important in reducing risk of later drug use.",

    "abstract": "Although popularly designated as \"identical\", monozygotic (MZ) twins are rarely identical. Much has been speculated on the origin of MZ twins and several theories have been proposed. Post-fertilization events, such as chromosomal mosaicism, skewed X-inactivation and imprinting mechanisms, as well as other epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for the differences between MZ twins. Numerous discordant MZ twins have been reported including discordance for lateral asymmetry, major malformation, growth and intrauterine death of the co-twin. This discrepancy may have long-term implications on complex diseases and their predisposition, organ transplantation and interpretation of twin-based studies. We reviewed the genotypic and phenotypic differences between MZ twins and discuss their main causes.",

Multifetal pregnancy reduction (MFPR) has been used to reduce the risks associated with these high-risk pregnancies. It is performed in the first trimester of pregnancy by transabdominal injection of potassium chloride into the fetal heart. The risk of miscarriage seems to be associated with the final number of fetuses. A review of the literature suggests that MFPR results in better pregnancy outcome, regardless of the initial number of fetuses. The reduction to a lower number of fetuses reduces fetal losses, prematurity, infant mortality and morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Heteropagus, or \"parasitic,\" twins are asymmetric conjoined twins in which the tissues of a severely defective twin (parasite) are dependent on the cardiovascular system of the other, largely intact twin (autosite) for survival. The estimated incidence of heteropagus twins is approximately 1 per 1 million live births. Isolated case reports comprise most of published work on this rare congenital anomaly. In the past, review articles have focused narrowly on one particular anatomical subtype of parasitic twin and/or on the anatomicopathology observed. Here, we present the epidemiology, proposed pathoembryogenic origins, anatomical abnormalities, management, and outcomes of the wide array of heteropagus twins described in the English language literature.",

    "abstract": "The patients were infant male twins born by cesarean delivery following a healthy pregnancy at 36 weeks' gestation to unrelated parents. At 4 months of age, twin 2 presented with hepatomegaly and a right suprarenal mass. Resection of an adrenal tumor and a liver tumor biopsy were performed. Twin 1 had no symptoms at 4 months of age. Screening by abdominal ultrasonography showed multiple masses in the liver but no adrenal mass. Metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy showed positive findings in multiple liver masses. A laparoscopic biopsy for a liver tumor was performed. All primary tumor and liver tumor specimens from twin 2 and the liver tumor of twin 1 had the same histologic classification of neuroblastoma and nearly identical genetic aberrations, including a chromosome gain or loss using array-comparative genomic hybridization. From these clinical and pathologic findings and genetic analyses, we strongly demonstrate the transplacental metastatic spread from twin 2 to twin 1. In the literature, 9 pairs of concordant twin neuroblastomas, including the current twin, have been presented; and the clinical findings of 5 twin pairs may represent placental metastases from one twin with congenital neuroblastoma to the other twin. This study is the first report presenting the possibility of twin-to-twin metastasis in monozygotic twins with neuroblastoma based on an analysis of the clinical features and genetic aberrations.",

Propionic acidemia is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder where the body is unable to process certain parts of proteins and lipids. Symptoms manifest few days after birth and sometimes progress to more serious medical problems, including heart abnormalities, coma and death.\nFour short tandem repeat markers closely linked to the PCCB gene were tested, in order to support the direct mutation detection diagnosis. Multiplex fluorescent heminested polymerase chain reaction followed by fragment analysis and minisequencing was used.\nFourteen single blastomeres from nine embryos were tested and two carrier embryos were transferred, resulting in the birth of two healthy boys.\nPreimplantation genetic diagnosis represents a valid reproductive option for couples affected of propionic acidemia, in order to avoid transmission to offspring.",

    "abstract": "Emerging as an important metabolic regulator, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has gained considerable interest in diabetes and obesity research. The circulating FGF21 concentration is fairly low in normal individuals, but elevated hormone levels may associate with obesity. The determining factors of FGF21 levels in humans are not clear.\nOur objective was to study the influence of genetic and acquired components to serum FGF21 variability in healthy young adult twins.\nFasting serum FGF21, lipids, body fat, and oral glucose tolerance test were investigated in 46 monozygotic (MZ) and 75 dizygotic twin pairs aged 22.8-33.1 yr. Subcutaneous, intraabdominal, and liver fat content were measured by magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy in a subsample of 24 MZ pairs.\nGenetic factors contributed moderately (heritability 40%) to circulating serum FGF21 levels. Subjects with high FGF21 concentrations (\u2265 250 pg/ml, n = 30) had higher fasting triglycerides, insulin, homeostasis model assessment index, and area under the curve glucose and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol but similar measures of overall adiposity (body mass index, body fat percent) than subjects with lower FGF21 (<100 pg/ml, n = 148). Importantly, in the MZ subsample, higher liver fat but not sc or intraabdominal fat content was found in subjects with high FGF21. Furthermore, in analyses controlling for genetic/familial effects in twin pairs, within-pair differences in liver fat (MZ) and triglycerides (dizygotic pairs) were the major acquired factors that correlated with differences in FGF21 concentrations.\nGenetic factors influence serum FGF21 levels. Of the acquired components, high liver fat and triglycerides rather than overall adiposity associate with high FGF21 levels.",

After 48 hours, the tocolysis was stopped and an uneventful Caesarean was performed under general anesthesia. As the patient was waking up, her SPO2 decreased to 32%, and she became cyanotic and tachypneic. Auscultation revealed rales in her lower lung lobes bilaterally. Her oxygen saturation did not increase in the hours that followed, and her cyanosis persisted, so we decided to admit her to the Intensive Care Unit. She was mechanically ventilated. Her chest X-ray showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and pulmonary infiltrates in the lower lobes. On the second postoperative day, transthoracic echocardiography was performed and revealed an EF of 45%, mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction and moderate mitral valve failure. Lisinopryl and furosemide were started. On postoperative day four, her symptoms and radiological signs had resolved. She was weaned from mechanical ventilation and discharged from the obstetric ward on postoperative day seven.\n\u0130kiz gebeli\u011fi olan ve postoperatif d\u00f6nemde kardiyomiyopatiye ba\u011fl\u0131 akut solunum yetmezli\u011fi geli\u015fen bir olgu sunulmu\u015ftur.

    "abstract": "Ectopic fat in muscle and liver is linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Recently, pancreatic lipid accumulation has also been associated with \u03b2-cell dysfunction and reduced insulin production, leading to the development of type 2 diabetes. Physical exercise training has been shown to attenuate \u03b2-cell dysfunction in patients, but little is known about its effects on pancreatic and hepatic fat accumulation. In this study, we validated in-vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) in pancreatic fat measurement with biochemical measurements in a pig model. Thereafter, the effects of increased physical activity on the amounts of pancreatic and liver fat were studied in eight monozygotic twin pairs who have discordant physical activity and fitness.\nPancreatic fat content was studied in 15 pigs using (1)H MRS and/or biochemical analyses. In addition, liver and pancreatic fat were assessed using (1)H MRS in eight monozygotic male twin pairs with 18% mean difference in VO(2max) between the twin brothers.\nTwins with higher physical fitness had 23% less liver fat (1.3\u00b11.3% vs. 2.1\u00b12.6%, p=0.022) but no such difference was observed in the pancreatic fat (8.2\u00b19.3% vs. 9.8\u00b18.5%, respectively, p=0.3). Hepatic fat content was inversely associated with VO(2max). A positive association was found between pancreatic and liver fat contents (\u03b2=5.18, p=0.012). Pancreatic fat content was also associated with insulin sensitivity indexes and plasma adiponectin and glutamyltransferase concentrations.\nPancreatic fat content is associated with insulin resistance and hepatic fat content. An active lifestyle seems to beneficially influence hepatic fat metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a disease of multifactorial etiology. Genetic and intrauterine mechanical factors influence the development of the hip joint and the incidence of DDH. Breech position is a risk factor for DDH. The aim of this study is to analyze whether in twins, the intrauterine mechanical factors, such as a breech position, limitation of fetal mobility, limitation of hip abduction, and increase the incidence of DDH may, therefore, be considered as risk factors.\nA pair of twins with either breech or cephalic presentation, and no family history of DDH or any other sicknesses were included in this study. During a 6-year period between 2002 and 2007, data were collected on 105 consecutively born twins (210 children with 420 hips) of whom 48 were a cephalic breech, 35 were a cephalic-cephalic, and 22 were a breech-breech presentation. The presentation was defined by regular prenatal ultrasounds and the obstetric records at birth. The average gestational age was 36.7 weeks and average weight at birth was 2290 g. Control group 1 consisted of 274 single gestation children, with a cephalic presentation at birth. The average gestational age was 39.1 weeks and average weight at birth was 3200 g. Control group 2 consisted of 48 single gestation children, with a breech presentation at birth. The average gestational age was 36.8 weeks and average weight at birth was 2870 g. Ultrasonography of the hips was done according to the Graf technique. Statistical analysis was done using a \u03c7\u00b2 test.\nThe \u03c7\u00b2 test was used and it showed no significant association between the presence or absence of pathologic hip types in the twins group and in the 2 control groups. A higher incidence of DDH (3.4%) was present in groups 1 and 2.\nThis comparison of a large series of twins with matched controls shows that there is no increased incidence of DDH in twins when compared with single birth infants with no family history of DDH. This study supports the idea that breech presentation in twins is not a risk factor, when knees are flexed.\nRetrospective study. Level 2 study.",

    "abstract": "Men outperform women in mental rotation by about one standard deviation. Prenatal exposure to testosterone has been suggested as one cause. In animals it has been shown that a female fetus located between two male ones is exposed to higher levels of testosterone. It is still unclear whether intra-uterine hormone transfer exists in humans. Therefore, the influence of an intra-uterine presence of a male co twin was studied in female fraternal twins (N=200). Women with a male co-twin outperformed women with a female co-twin by about a third standard deviation. In a no-twin control group (N=200), performance of women with a slightly older sibling did not depend upon the sibling's sex. These findings provide preliminary support for the theory of an influence of prenatal testosterone on mental rotation performance.",

    "abstract": "Craniorachischisis is a rare neural tube defect in which both acrania and a complete schisis of the vertebral column are present. Heterotaxy results from failure to establish normal left-right asymmetry during embryonic development and is characterized by a variable group of congenital anomalies that include complex cardiac malformations and situs inversus or situs ambiguous. We report a diamniotic twin pregnancy with two malformed fetuses affected one by craniorachischisis and the other by heterotaxya with paired right-sided viscera, asplenia, and complex congenital heart disease. The occurrence of severe congenital anomalies in both members of the twin pair implies a strong influence of genetic factors. At present, the genetic basis determining the different phenotypes observed in our twins is unknown. Our case with the simultaneous presence of both midline and laterality defects in twins supports the hypothesis that the midline plays a critical role in establishing left-right asymmetry in the body and that a mutation in a gene responsible for both heterotaxy and midline defects may be strongly supposed.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the maternal risk factors for small-for-gestational age (SGA) newborns in Japanese dichorionic (DC) twins.\nA retrospective study was conducted from 2003 to 2008 on 340 DC twin pregnancies resulting in two live births. Newborns were classified as SGA if their birth weight was below the 10th percentile according to Japanese singleton norms. Statistical differences were evaluated between pregnancies resulting in appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) pairs and those resulting in at least one SGA neonate.\nThe study population consisted of AGA/AGA (50.8%), AGA/SGA (37.0%) and SGA/SGA pairs (12.0%). Logistic regression analysis identified significant interrelations for SGA with maternal nulliparity (odds ratio [OR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30-0.91), smoking (OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.09-9.66), assisted reproductive technology (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.30-0.89), pregnancy-induced hypertension (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.01-4.31), pregravid weight (kg) (unitary OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.97) and monthly weight gain (kg/month) (unitary OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.44). Bivariable receiver operating characteristic curves were generated for monthly weight gain (area under the curve [AUC] 0.626, cutoff 1.41 kg/month, P<0.001) and total weight gain (AUC 0.615, cutoff 14.0 kg, P<0.001).\nCigarette smoking and weight gain control are relatively modifiable factors for which interventional management is necessary to avoid perinatal problems arising from SGA pregnancy. Further studies are needed to investigate optimal nutrition, health guidance and subsequent weight gain control that lead to concrete improvement in maternal and infant prognoses.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the possible correlation between smoking status and biomarkers of exposure (BoE) and biological effect (BoBE) in monozygotic twins discordant for smoking status (smoker and non-smoker pairs). By eliminating potential genetic variability in this manner, a clearer pattern of the effects of lifestyle and environmental exposures should become apparent.\nThis was a cross-sectional study on monozygotic healthy twins (44 subjects, 26 males and 18 females) with a mean age 31.5 years. BoE to cigarette smoke and BoBE were measured in body fluids (24 h urine and blood) after medical pre-screening.\nAll BoE were significantly higher in the smoker twins. Among BoBE, 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2) (11-dehydro TBX), 2,3-dinorthromboxane B(2) (2,3-dinor TBX), 8-epi-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-epiPGF), hydroxyproline (OH-P), fibrinogen, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and heart rate were statistically significantly increased in the smoker compared to the non-smoker twins. Moreover, statistically significant correlations between neutrophil count and 11-dehydro TBX (r=0.32), WBC and 8-epiPGF (r=0.33), OH-P and 8-epiPGF (r=0.49) and heart rate and fibrinogen (r=0.46) were observed.\nThe study results confirmed the reliability of the BoE for the evaluation of smoking status. Moreover, a subset of the BoBE, reported as being associated with inflammatory conditions and early stages of vascular disorders, has emerged as showing a consistent relationship with smoking status from the present and the previous studies. By using monozygotic twin pairs, genetic variability has been excluded as a possible source of variability in this study. These results should assist in the interpretation of other population studies using these biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to present a long-term follow-up of the growth of the face and the nasomaxillary complex in a pair of identical twins, one of whom had suffered severe midfacial trauma at age 2 years. Growth of the face and the nasomaxillary complex was longitudinally assessed and compared by means of facial photographs and cephalometric x-rays. Twin A suffered Le Fort II and III fractures with an associated frontal bone injury in early childhood and subsequently developed significant midface hypoplasia; twin B had no trauma and normal facial growth and development. Facial profile difference between the twins gradually became more pronounced until age 19. Twin A had obvious retrusion of the midfacial region, including the nasal bones on visual examination and radiographic study. At age 20, she underwent orthognathic surgical correction of the traumatic deformity. Her unaffected sibling, twin B, provided the genetic facial phenotype for the surgical orthognathic reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Associations between parental depression and offspring affective and disruptive disorders are well documented. Few genetically informed studies have explored the processes underlying intergenerational associations.\nA semi-structured interview assessing DSM-III-R psychiatric disorders was administered to twins (n=1296) from the Australian Twin Register (ATR), their spouses (n=1046) and offspring (n=2555). We used the Children of Twins (CoT) design to delineate the extent to which intergenerational associations were consistent with a causal influence or due to genetic confounds.\nIn between-family analyses, parental depression was associated significantly with offspring depression [hazard ratio (HR) 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.93] and conduct disorder (CD; HR 2.27, CI 1.31-3.93). Survival analysis indicated that the intergenerational transmission of depression is consistent with a causal (environmental) inference, with a significant intergenerational association in offspring of discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (HR 1.39, CI 1.00-1.94). Logistic regression analysis suggested that the parental depression-offspring CD association was due to shared genetic liability in the parents and offspring. No intergenerational association was found when comparing the offspring of discordant MZ twins [odds ratio (OR) 1.41, CI 0.63-3.14], but offspring of discordant dizygotic (DZ) twins differed in their rates of CD (OR 2.53, CI 0.95-6.76). All findings remained after controlling for several measured covariates, including history of depression and CD in the twins' spouses.\nThe mechanisms underlying associations between parental depression and offspring psychopathology seem to differ depending on the outcome. The results are consistent with a causal environmental role of parental depression in offspring depression whereas common genetic factors account for the association of parental depression and offspring CD.",

    "abstract": "We report two cases of mirror image anomalies in two different pairs of monozygotic twins. In case 1, the twins exhibited mirroring of strabismus and refractive errors. Twin 1 had 35 prism diopters (PD) right intermittent exotropia at distant fixation and myopic anisometropia that was spherical 2.00 diopters more myopic in the right eye. Twin 2 had 35 PD left intermittent exotropia at distant fixation and her left eye was more myopic by - spherical 1.00 diopters. In case 2, the twins were diagnosed with infantile nystagmus with upbeat jerk. Twin 1 exhibited a habitual head turn of 30\u00b0 to the left with dampening of her nystagmus in dextroversion. Twin 2 also exhibited abnormal head position, but in his case the habitual turn was 30\u00b0 to the right. We believe that this is the first report describing mirror imaged intermittent exotropia with anisometropia and infantile nystagmus with opposite abnormal head positions in pairs of monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "More education is associated with healthier smoking and drinking behaviors. Most analyses of effects of education focus on mean levels. Few studies have compared variance in health-related behaviors at different levels of education or analyzed how education impacts underlying genetic and environmental sources of health-related behaviors. This study explored these influences. In a 2002 postal questionnaire, 21,522 members of the Danish Twin Registry, born during 1931-1982, reported smoking and drinking habits. The authors used quantitative genetic models to examine how these behaviors' genetic and environmental variances differed with level of education, adjusting for birth-year effects. As expected, more education was associated with less smoking, and average drinking levels were highest among the most educated. At 2 standard deviations above the mean educational level, variance in smoking and drinking was about one-third that among those at 2 standard deviations below, because fewer highly educated people reported high levels of smoking or drinking. Because shared environmental variance was particularly restricted, one explanation is that education created a culture that discouraged smoking and heavy drinking. Correlations between shared environmental influences on education and the health behaviors were substantial among the well-educated for smoking in both sexes and drinking in males, reinforcing this notion.",

    "abstract": "Middle cerebral artery-peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) has been reported to predict fetal anemia with similar accuracy as amniotic \u0394OD450 assay. Alloimmunized dizygotic twin pregnancy allows us to compare anemic and non-anemic twins in the same intrauterine environment. We herein present a case of Rh (E)-incompatible dizygotic twin pregnancy, where MCA-PSV could precisely detect the anemia in one of the twins. A 36-year-old woman, whose previous child required exchange transfusion due to hemolytic anemia of newborn (HFDN), conceived twins after in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. At 24 weeks' gestation, MCA-PSV of twin A and twin B were 23.9 cm/s (0.8 multiples of median; MoM) and 30.7 cm/s (1.0 MoM), respectively. At 31 weeks' gestation, MCA-PSV values of both twins were sharply elevated to nearly 1.4 MoM. Thereafter, MCA-PSV of twin A fell to 1.0 MoM, whereas MCA-PSV of twin B exceeded 1.5 MoM at 34 weeks' gestation. Development of fetal anemia was suspected and emergency cesarean section was performed. Twin B showed moderate anemia with positive direct Coombs' test and was diagnosed as HFDN due to anti-E alloimmunization. Twin B required phototherapy and red cell transfusion, but exchange transfusion was safely obviated.",

    "abstract": "Jumping translocations (JTs) are rare constitutional or acquired rearrangements involving a donor and several receiver chromosomes. They may be inherited or de novo. JTs can be found as a cultural artifact, in normal individuals or in pathological conditions. The clinical consequences range from spontaneous abortion, loss of fetus, chromosome syndrome, congenital abnormalities, and infertility to malignancy. Considering the breakpoints of JTs, they are localized predominantly in repeat regions such as pericentromeric, centromeric, subtelomeric, telomeric, and occasionally interstitial regions that may be in a low copy repeats (LCR) or in a telomere like sequence. Differences between the constitutional and acquired JTs donor breakpoints suggest an independent mechanism in their formation. In this review, a new JT involving a donor chromosome 18p10qter and recipients 17q25qter or 1q25qter found by CVS of a twin pregnancy is described. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenges posed by JTs.In this study, our knowledge on JTs is consolidated to improve identification, management, and counseling.",

    "abstract": "This article discusses results of a questionnaire survey of 156 university students in Israel and Austria examining reactions towards the Belated Twins scenario, which entails the artificial twinning of embryos of which one is immediately carried to term while the other one is born later. The scenario resembles a case of human reproductive cloning in terms of result (the creation of genetically identical individuals in a time-delayed manner) but it involves gamete fusion like \"natural\" reproduction. By means of qualitative text analysis we discuss the core themes mobilized both in support and opposition to the scenario. While Israeli and Austrian respondents held similar general attitudes (about half were in favour of legalizing Belated Twins, while about a third opposed it), they drew partly on different arguments to arrive at their conclusions. In both groups, uncertainty stemming from \"novel\" elements in the scenario was regularly interpreted as negatively exacerbating existing issues.",

    "abstract": "Thirty same-sex twin pairs were identified in which both members were assessed at baseline and one twin subsequently developed dementia, at least 3 years subsequent to the baseline measurement, while the partner remained cognitively intact for at least three additional years. Eighteen of the 30 cases were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Baseline assessments, conducted when twins' average age was 70.6 (SD = 6.8), included a mailed questionnaire and in-person testing. Which twin would develop dementia was predicted by less favorable lipid values (higher apoB, ratio of apoB to apoA1, and total cholesterol), poorer grip strength, and-to a lesser extent-higher emotionality on the EAS Temperament Scale. Given the long preclinical period that characterizes Alzheimer's disease, these findings may suggest late life risk factors for dementia, or may reflect changes that are part of preclinical disease.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship of birth weight with ocular measures in a Caucasian twin population.\nCross-sectional study of 1498 twins (308 monozygotic and 441 dizygotic pairs) aged between 5 to 80 years participating in the Australian Twins Eye Study.\nAll participants underwent ophthalmic examination including bilateral cycloplegic autorefraction, keratometry, interpupillary distance (IPD), central corneal thickness, intraocular pressure (IOP), and retinal photography. Birth weight and gestation were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire. A subset of the twins also participated in the Tasmanian Infant Health Study (288) and the Childhood Blood Pressure Study (184), which collected data on birth parameters allowing for verification of data. Linear mixed models were used for the main analysis.\nBoth the within-pair (\u03b2(w) 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15, 0.38 mm per kg increase in birth weight, P < .001) and between-pair associations (\u03b2(B) 0.22, 95% CI 0.08, 0.35, P = .002) of birth weight with axial length were significant and of similar magnitude (difference in effect, P = .56), after adjusting for relevant confounders. In contrast, birth weight was negatively associated with corneal curvature (\u03b2(w) -0.82, 95% CI -1.09, -0.55 diopters per kg increase; \u03b2(B) -0.69, 95% CI -0.98, -0.41, both P < .001). These associations remained significant within dizygotic and monozygotic pairs. Refraction, anterior chamber depth, IPD, IOP, and optic disc parameters are unrelated to birth weight.\nConsistent with previous studies in singleton children, lower birth weight is associated with shorter axial length and more curved corneas in this twin study. This also adds new insights into the emmetropization process.",

    "abstract": "The study of enamel hypoplasia (EH) and opacity in twins provides insights into the contribution of genetic and environmental factors in the expression of enamel defects.\nThis study examined prevalence and site concordance of EH and opacity in the primary dentition of 2- to 4-year-old twins and singleton controls to assess the relative contribution of genetics and the environment to the aetiology of these defects.\nThe study sample consisted of 88 twin children and 40 singletons aged 2-4 years of age. Medical histories were obtained and the children examined for enamel defects.\nThe prevalence of EH by teeth was 21% in monozygotic twins (MZ), 22% in dizygotic twins (DZ), and 15% in singleton controls. Twins showed a higher prevalence of EH compared with singletons (P < 0.05). Factors contributing to increase EH in twins were neonatal complications including intubation. There were no significant differences in site concordance of EH within the MZ twin pairs compared with DZ twin pairs when only presence of EH was considered, whereas a greater concordance was noted between MZ twin pairs compared with DZ twin pairs when both presence and absence of EH were considered.\nThe results suggest that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to observed variation of EH, although it is likely that environmental factors exert a greater influence.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for adverse neonatal outcome in twins in order to provide a basis for the improvement of the survival and neonatal outcomes of twins.\nData from 254 twins admitted to Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University From January 2005 to December 2009 were retrospectively studied. Risk factors for adverse neonatal outcomes were assessed by logistic regression analysis.\nOf the 254 twins, 84 (33.1%) had an adverse outcome, including 10 (3.9%) neonatal deaths. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that gestational age (\u226434 weeks), cord abnormalities, meconium-stained amniotic fluid and 5-min Apgar scores (\u22647) were independent risk factors for adverse neonatal outcomes (OR=4.434, 4.731, 3.424, 18.958, respectively; P=0.021, 0.001, 0.037, 0.011, respectively).

    "abstract": "White matter microstructure is under strong genetic control, yet it is largely unknown how genetic influences change from childhood into adulthood. In one of the largest brain mapping studies ever performed, we determined whether the genetic control over white matter architecture depends on age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and intelligence quotient (IQ). We assessed white matter integrity voxelwise using diffusion tensor imaging at high magnetic field (4-Tesla), in 705 twins and their siblings (age range 12-29; 290 M/415 F). White matter integrity was quantified using a widely accepted measure, fractional anisotropy (FA). We fitted gene-environment interaction models pointwise, to visualize brain regions where age, sex, SES and IQ modulate heritability of fiber integrity. We hypothesized that environmental factors would start to outweigh genetic factors during late childhood and adolescence. Genetic influences were greater in adolescence versus adulthood, and greater in males than in females. Socioeconomic status significantly interacted with genes that affect fiber integrity: heritability was higher in those with higher SES. In people with above-average IQ, genetic factors explained over 80% of the observed FA variability in the thalamus, genu, posterior internal capsule, and superior corona radiata. In those with below-average IQ, however, only around 40% FA variability in the same regions was attributable to genetic factors. Genes affect fiber integrity, but their effects vary with age, sex, SES and IQ. Gene-environment interactions are vital to consider in the search for specific genetic polymorphisms that affect brain integrity and connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations can be affected by several environmental and individual factors. It is not clear to what extent genetic influences play a role in determining vitamin D status. Thus far, studies on the heritability of vitamin D have provided conflicting results.\nWe estimated the heritability of vitamin D concentrations and the effect of season on heritability estimates.\nWe measured serum 25(OH)D concentrations in 510 middle-aged, male twins (310 monozygotic and 200 dizygotic twins) selected from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Generalized estimating equations were used to test the association between 25(OH)D and other study factors. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the heritability of 25(OH)D.\nThe twins' mean (\u00b1SD) age was 55 \u00b1 2.8 y. The mean (\u00b1SD) 25(OH)D concentration was 38.4 \u00b1 23.3 ng/mL with a substantial seasonal variation (a 6.1-ng/mL lower value during the winter than during the summer, P = 0.003). Approximately 70% of the variation in 25(OH)D concentrations during the winter was explained by genetic factors. However, in the summer, 25(OH)D concentrations were not heritable. During the summer, 53% of the variation in 25(OH)D concentrations was due to shared environmental factors, and 47% of the variation in 25(OH)D concentrations was due to unique environmental factors.\nSerum 25(OH)D concentrations are highly heritable during the winter season only. In the summer, environmental conditions (eg, sun exposure) prevail over genetic backgrounds in determining serum 25(OH)D concentrations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00017836.",

    "abstract": "Given the adverse neurobiological effects of suboptimal nutrition on the developing brain, it is of social and medical importance to determine if the global prevalence of poor intrauterine growth causes lasting cognitive deficits. We examined whether suboptimal intrauterine growth relates to impaired cognitive outcome by comparing birth weight and cognition in monozygotic twins and considered whether children within-pair differences in birth weight were related to within-pair differences in IQ scores.\nA total of 71 monozygotic twin pairs (aged 7 years 11 months to 17 years 3 months) participated. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition, was administered, and verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ) scores were calculated. Regression was used to relate within-pair differences in birth weight to within-pair differences in IQ scores.\nVIQ but not PIQ score was affected by prenatal growth restriction. The results suggest that the mean advantage for heavier twins relative to their lighter co-twins can be as much as half an SD in VIQ points. In pairs with minimal discordance, heavier twins had lower VIQ scores than their lighter co-twins.\nOur study results suggest that lower birth weight in monozygotic twins can also have a negative long-term impact on cognition both in infants who are small at birth and also those with birth weights across the spectrum. Studying monozygotic twins enabled us to examine the effect of reduced intrauterine growth on cognition independently of confounding factors, including parental IQ and education and infant gender, age, genetic characteristics, and gestation.",

The occurrence of identical unerupted maxillary central incisors and mesiodentes in monozygotic twins suggests that genetic factors might influence the etiology of this problem.

    "abstract": "\"Core-rod myopathy\" is a rare congenital myopathy characterized by the presence of \"cores\" and \"rods\" in distinct locations in the same or different muscle fibres. This association is linked currently to mutations in RYR1, NEB and ACTA1 genes. We report identical twins who presented with polyhydramnios and loss of fetal motility during pregnancy; hypotonia, arthrogryposis and swallowing impairment at birth; need of immediate respiratory support and death at 27 and 50 days of life. Muscle biopsies, performed at 27 days of life in twin 1 and at 49 days in twin 2, showed the presence of separate cores and rods in the muscle fibres, both at light and electron microscopy. The molecular analysis showed a heterozygous de novo mutation (Ile4898Thr) of the RYR1 gene. The molecular study of ACTA1, TMP2 and TMP3 genes did not show abnormalities. This is the first report of a lethal form of congenital \"core-rod myopathy\". The mutation Ile4898Thr has been previously described in central core disease but not in core-rod myopathy. The report enlarges the phenotypic spectrum of \"core-rod myopathy\" and highlights the morphological variability associated to special RYR1 mutations.",

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by inexorable loss of muscle tissue. One of the underlying causes for this is the massive change in the hormonal milieu of the body. The role of a female sex steroid - estrogen - in these processes is frequently neglected, although the rapid decline in its production coincides with a steep deterioration in muscle performance. We recruited 54- to 62-year-old monozygotic female twin pairs discordant for postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT, n=11 pairs; HRT use 7.3 \u00b1 3.7 years) from the Finnish Twin Cohort to investigate the association of long-term, estrogen-based HRT with skeletal muscle transcriptome. Pathway analysis of muscle transcript profiles revealed significant HRT-induced up-regulation of a biological process related to regulation of cell structure and down-regulation of processes concerning, for example, cell-matrix interactions, energy metabolism and utilization of nutrients (false discovery rate < 0.15). Lending clinical relevance to the findings, these processes explained a significant fraction of the differences observed in relative proportion of muscle within thigh and in muscle performance (R(2) =0.180-0.257, P=0.001-0.023). Although energy metabolism was affected through down-regulation of the transcripts related to succinate dehydrogenase complex in mitochondria, no differences were observed in mtDNA copy number or oxidative capacity per muscle cross section. In conclusion, long-term use of HRT was associated with subtle, but significant, differences in muscle transcript profiles. The better muscle composition and performance among the HRT users appeared to be orchestrated by improved regulatory actions on cytoskeleton, preservation of muscle quality via regulation of intramuscular extracellular matrix and a switch from glucose-oriented metabolism to utilization of fatty acids.",

    "abstract": "To examine the association between diurnal type and smoking status and nicotine dependence (ND).\nA cohort study using random-effects model regressions for repeated longitudinal panel data was used to analyse smoking status by diurnal type. Regression analyses examined the association between diurnal type and ND.\nA total of 23, 289 same-sex adult twin individuals from Finnish Twin Cohort. Nicotine dependence was studied in a subsample of 676 twin individuals.\nSubjects were classified by self-report into four categories: morning type, somewhat morning type, somewhat evening type, evening type (in 1981). Smoking status was defined as current and ever smoking (in 1975, 1981 and 1990). ND was measured by DSM-IV and Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) (during 2001-05). Findings\u2003 Evening types of both genders were much more likely to be current (OR\u2003=\u20032.91, 95% CI 2.50, 3.38) and life-time smokers (OR\u2003=\u20032.67, 95% CI 2.96, 4.07) compared to morning types. Evening types were less likely to stop smoking. The risk of nicotine dependence assessed by DSM-IV criteria was higher among evening types (OR\u2003=\u20032.78, 95% CI 1.64, 4.72). Evening types scored 0.59 (95% CI 0.01, 1.17) points higher than morning types on the FTND. Adjustment for potential confounders did not change these associations.\nBeing an evening type is associated independently with a higher risk of being a current smoker, being more highly dependent upon cigarettes and a lower likelihood of stopping smoking. Understanding the cause of these associations could elucidate the causes of tobacco addiction.",

    "abstract": "The minor G-allele of FOXO3A rs2802292 has been associated with longevity. We aimed to investigate whether a phenotype related to healthy metabolic aging could be identified in individuals carrying the longevity-associated FOXO3A rs2802292 G-allele.\nrs2802292 was genotyped in a phenotypically well-characterized population of young and elderly twins (n = 190) and in the population-based Inter99 cohort (n = 5768). All participants underwent oral glucose tolerance tests, and the twin population was additionally examined with an iv glucose tolerance test and a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp. Basal and insulin-stimulated FOXO3A mRNA expression was assessed in skeletal muscle biopsies from the twin population.\nIn the twin sample, carriers of the minor G-allele of rs2802292 showed reduced fasting plasma insulin [per allele effect (\u03b2) = -13% (-24; -1) (95% confidence interval), P = 0.03] and lower incremental area under the curve 0-120 min for insulin after an oral glucose load [\u03b2 = -14% (-23; -5), P = 0.005]. The G-allele was associated with increased peripheral insulin action [glucose disposal rate clamp, \u03b2 = 0.85 mg \u00b7 kg(fat-free mass)(-1) \u00b7 min(-1)() (0.049; 1.64), P = 0.04] and lower hepatic insulin resistance index [\u03b2 = -13% (-25; -1), P = 0.03]. Furthermore, carriers of the G-allele had increased basal FOXO3A mRNA expression in skeletal muscle compared with T-allele carriers [\u03b2 = 16% (0; 33), P = 0.047]. In the Inter99 sample, we found an association with reduced incremental area under the curve 0-120 min for insulin after an oral glucose load [\u03b2 = -3% (-5; -0.07), P = 0.04], but this association was not significant after adjustment for body mass index.\nOur data indicate that the minor G-allele of FOXO3A rs2802292 is associated with enhanced peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity in our small twin cohort, which may be mediated through increased FOXO3A mRNA expression, although no major metabolic impact of rs2802292 was found in the large Inter99 cohort.",

    "abstract": "The common genetic and environmental effects on endophenotypes related to the metabolic syndrome have been investigated using bivariate and multivariate twin models. This paper extends the pairwise analysis approach by introducing independent and common pathway models to Chinese twin data. The aim was to explore the common genetic architecture in the development of these phenotypes in the Chinese population.\nThree multivariate models including the full saturated Cholesky decomposition model, the common factor independent pathway model and the common factor common pathway model were fitted to 695 pairs of Chinese twins representing six phenotypes including BMI, total cholesterol, total triacylglycerol, fasting glucose, HDL and LDL. Performances of the nested models were compared with that of the full Cholesky model.\nCross-phenotype correlation coefficients gave clear indication of common genetic or environmental backgrounds in the phenotypes. Decomposition of phenotypic correlation by the Cholesky model revealed that the observed phenotypic correlation among lipid phenotypes had genetic and unique environmental backgrounds. Both pathway models suggest a common genetic architecture for lipid phenotypes, which is distinct from that of the non-lipid phenotypes. The declining performance with model restriction indicates biological heterogeneity in development among some of these phenotypes.\nOur multivariate analyses revealed common genetic and environmental backgrounds for the studied lipid phenotypes in Chinese twins. Model performance showed that physiologically distinct endophenotypes may follow different genetic regulations.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the association between discordant crown-rump length (CRL) measurements in structurally normal euploid dichorionic twins and adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nThis retrospective cohort study included women with dichorionic twins who underwent chorionic villus sampling and delivered in our facility from January 2000 to September 2007. Only pregnancies with viable twin fetuses and normal karyotypes were included. The association between CRL discordance, defined as a CRL discrepancy of 9% or greater, and adverse pregnancy outcomes was evaluated.\nSeventy-eight women met inclusion criteria and included 24 discordant twins (group 1) and 54 concordant twins (group 2). Maternal ages were similar: mean \u00b1 SD, 38.2 \u00b1 3.1 years in group 1 versus 39.2 \u00b1 3.9 years in group 2 (P = not significant). The median gestational ages at delivery were 35.6 \u00b1 3.1 weeks in group 1 and 37.3 \u00b1 2.0 weeks in group 2 (P < .01). At least 1 major complication occurred in 19 women (79%) in group 1 and 25 (46%) in group 2 (P = .01). Group 1 had significantly more major complications overall (P = .0008). Preterm premature rupture of membranes occurred in 10 women (42%) in group 1 and 6 (11%) in group 2 (P = .005). Delivery before 37 weeks' gestation occurred in 19 of 24 women (79%) in group 1 and 24 of 54 (44%) in group 2 (P = .006). There was a significant difference for younger gestational age at delivery in the discordant group (P < .01).\nOur data suggest that there is an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in chromosomally normal dichorionic twins with first-trimester discordant CRL measurements. These results may be clinically useful for counseling, management, and antenatal surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Our aims were to assess the incidence of birthweight discordance of twins, to explore risk factors and its impact on perinatal mortality, and to quantify the risks at different severity of birthweight discordance in Japan, by using a nationwide obstetric database. There were 10,828 pairs of twins, born from 2001 to 2005 recorded in the database of the national Perinatal Health Care Project, fully enrolled. The overall incidence of birthweight discordance was 47.34%. The incidence of mild, severe and extremely severe discordance was 19.26%, 10.21% and 17.87%, respectively. The incidence of birthweight discordance in Japan is much higher than that in other countries, particularly at higher severity level. By linear regression model, our study added independent factors of primiparity (p < .001), sex composition (p < .001), chorionicity (p < .001), gestational age (p < .001), and delivery mode (p < .001) in determining birthweight discordance percentage. Maternal age and application of assisted reproduction technologies (ART) didn't significantly influence the birthweight discordance. The birthweight discordance is closely associated with gestational age and affected discharge mortality. From 25% of birthweight discordance, risk to discharge mortality tended to significantly increase, suggesting it should be added as a reference for clinical practices.",

    "abstract": "Health is a multidimensional and continual concept. Traditional latent analytic approaches have inherent deficits in capturing the complex nature of the concept; however, the Grade of Membership (GoM) model is well suited for this problem. We applied the GoM method to a set of 31 indicators to construct ideal profiles of health status based on physical, mental and social support items among 848 adult twins from Qingdao, China. Four profiles were identified: healthy individuals (pure type I), individuals with personality disorders (pure type II), individuals with mental impairments (pure type III) and individuals with physical impairments (pure type IV). The most frequently occurring combination in this population was profiles I, II, IV (14.74%), followed by profiles I, II, III, IV (13.44%), and then type I (11.08%). Only 13.56% of subjects fell completely into one single pure type, most individuals exhibited some of the characteristics of two or more pure types. Our results indicated that, compared to conventional statistical methods, the GoM model was more suited to capture the complex concept of health, reflecting its multidimensionality and continuity, while also exhibiting preferable reliability. This study also made an important contribution to research on GoM application in non-independent samples.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is unique in that its criteria are embedded with a presumed causal agent, viz, a traumatic event. This assumption has come under scrutiny as a number of recent studies have suggested that many symptoms of PTSD may not necessarily be the result of trauma and may merely represent general psychiatric symptoms that would have existed even in the absence of a trauma event but are subsequently misattributed to it. The current study tests this hypothesis.\nA case-control twin study conducted between 1996-2001 examined psychopathologic symptoms in a national convenience sample of 104 identical twin pairs discordant for combat exposure in Vietnam, with (n = 50) or without (n = 54) combat-related PTSD (DSM-IV-diagnosed) in the exposed twin. Psychometric measures used were the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, and the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD. If a psychopathologic feature represents a factor that would have existed even without traumatic exposure, then there is a high chance that it would also be found at elevated rates in the non-trauma-exposed, identical cotwins of trauma-exposed twins with PTSD. In contrast, if a psychopathologic feature is acquired as a result of an environmental factor unique to the exposed twin, eg, the traumatic event, their cotwins should not have an increased incidence of the feature.\nCombat veterans with PTSD demonstrated significantly higher scores (P < .0001) on the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised and other psychometric measures of psychopathology than their own combat-unexposed cotwins (and than combat veterans without PTSD and their cotwins).\nThese results support the conclusion that the majority of psychiatric symptoms reported by combat veterans with PTSD would not have been present were it not for their exposure to traumatic events.",

    "abstract": "Tibial hemimelia, a rare congenital anomaly, is characterized by deficiency of the tibia with relatively intact fibula. The incidence of congenital deficiency of the tibia is approximately 1 per 1 million live births. The percentage of monozygotic twins is 0.8% of all newborns. Therefore, the occurrence of tibial hemimelia in monozygotic twins is 1 case per 125 million. The purpose of this article is to present a case of identical twins, in which 1 had tibial hemimelia, a double metatarsal bone and preaxial polydactyly and the other had no alterations. The patient that was affected had an anomaly in the left leg and foot. She had 7 fingers in her left foot and a left duplicated great toe. Her legs had a 3-cm difference in length, rigid inversion, adduction of feet, and severe bowing. A roentgenogram showed right tibial hemimelia with intact fibula corresponding to Jones type 3 and the first metacarpo was duplicated with a proximal osseus synostosis. Karyotyping confirmed that the twins were monozygotic. Only 1 of the identical twins had tibial hemimelia, a double metatarsal bone, and preaxial polydactyly. Congenital defects may result from aberrations in the developmental stage, the growth stage, or both. Hemimelia may result from a primary failure to form an anlage, or a primary failure to chronologically synthesize collagen. This case shows that tibial hemimelia can have variable phenotypic manifestations.",

Antenatal diagnosis can delineate the cardiac anatomy and provide parental counseling on whether separation is possible after birth. In the majority of cases, thoracopagus twins have a complex cardiac anatomy and share a common pericardial sac. Separation and survival depend on the extent to which the cardiac chambers and conduction system are fused. When the twins share the atria, ventricles, or both, death is inevitable even if surgical separation is occasionally attempted.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies have indicated abnormalities in cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder compared with controls. However, there are inconsistencies between studies regarding the exact set of brain structures involved and the direction of anatomical and functional changes. These inconsistencies may reflect the differential impact of environmental and genetic risk factors for obsessive-compulsive disorder on different parts of the brain. To distinguish between functional brain changes underlying environmentally and genetically mediated obsessive-compulsive disorder, we compared task performance and brain activation during a Tower of London planning paradigm in monozygotic twins discordant (n=38) or concordant (n=100) for obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Twins who score high on obsessive-compulsive symptoms can be considered at high risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder. We found that subjects at high risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder did not differ from the low-risk subjects behaviourally, but we obtained evidence that the high-risk subjects differed from the low-risk subjects in the patterns of brain activation accompanying task execution. These regions can be separated into those that were affected by mainly environmental risk (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lingual cortex), genetic risk (frontopolar cortex, inferior frontal cortex, globus pallidus and caudate nucleus) and regions affected by both environmental and genetic risk factors (cingulate cortex, premotor cortex and parts of the parietal cortex). Our results suggest that neurobiological changes related to obsessive-compulsive symptoms induced by environmental factors involve primarily the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas neurobiological changes induced by genetic factors involve orbitofrontal-basal ganglia structures. Regions showing similar changes in high-risk twins from discordant and concordant pairs may be part of compensatory networks that keep planning performance intact, in spite of cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical deficits.",

    "abstract": "The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is thought to have an important role in the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Interindividual variation and an inability to detect less abundant bacteria have made it difficult to correlate specific bacteria with disease.\nWe used 454 pyrotag sequencing to determine the compositions of microbial communities in feces samples collected from a cohort of 40 twin pairs who were concordant or discordant for CD or UC, and in mucosal samples from a subset of the cohort. The cohort primarily comprised patients who were in remission, but also some with active disease.\nThe profiles of the microbial community differed with disease phenotypes; relative amounts of bacterial populations correlated with IBD phenotypes. The microbial compositions of individuals with CD differed from those of healthy individuals, but were similar between healthy individuals and individuals with UC. Profiles from individuals with CD that predominantly involved the ileum differed from those with CD that predominantly involved the colon; several bacterial populations increased or decreased with disease type. Changes specific to patients with ileal CD included the disappearance of core bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, and increased amounts of Enterobacteriaceae and Ruminococcus gnavus.\nBacterial populations differ in abundance among individuals with different phenotypes of CD. Specific species of bacteria are associated with ileal CD; further studies should investigate their role in pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to investigate the growth of monozygotic twins with discordant birth weights and the predictive value of birth-weight, birth-length, and cord-blood concentration of growth factors on their catch-up growth up to the age of 4 yr.\nTwenty-five monozygotic twin-pairs [14 with an intertwin birth-weight sd score (SDS) difference>1] were studied at birth and at 4 yr of age. In all pairs, several parameters including IGF-I were analyzed in cord blood, and in 20 pairs parameters were analyzed again at 4 yr of age. Intertwin differences (\u0394) in birth weight, birth length, and growth at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 months were correlated with \u0394 of the parameters analyzed.\nWe found a reduction of \u0394 height SDS from birth to 4 yr, with the main catch-up occurring during the first year, but only a slight, statistically insignificant reduction of \u0394 body mass index SDS during the observation period. Correlation coefficients were used to identify factors predicting postnatal catch-up growth. Both birth-weight difference (r=0.653; P=0.001) and \u0394 IGF-I in cord blood (r=0.613; P=0.007) were of similar predictive value. Variance analysis showed no significant difference in individual impact between these two parameters, although both correlated strongly with actual height.\nWe observed a gradual convergence in height but not body mass index up to the age of 4 yr between genetically identical twins with discordant birth weights. Both birth-weight and cord-blood IGF-I are predictive of subsequent catch-up growth.",

    "abstract": "In last years, owing to the widespread availability of assisted-reproduction technology, multiple pregnancy rates in Western countries have increased. In twin pregnancies, an increased rate of gestational complications, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth and severe perinatal conditions is present. These complications are more frequent in monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins as well as an increased relative risk of chromosomal abnormalities and congenital malformation. Monochorionic twins are at higher risk for complications, since they share a common placenta where an imbalance in unidirectional arteriovenous anastomoses can lead to twin&#x2013;twin transfusion syndrome. This extremely dangerous condition, if not early identified, can determine severe fetal complications with mortality rates that, in case of no treatment, reaches 90%. Laser photocoagulation is the treatment of choice in severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome with high survival rate. IUGR occurs more frequently in MC twins and along with prematurity and perinatal pathology is considered an important determinant of developmental delay.",

    "abstract": "Our objective in this Danish population-based cohort study was to estimate the recurrence risk of isolated oral cleft (OC) for offspring of the unaffected co-twins of OC discordant twin pairs and to compare this risk to the recurrence risk in the offspring of the affected co-twin as well as to the risk in the background population. During 1936-2004, 207 twin pairs were ascertained, among whom at least one twin had an OC. The index persons were twins discordant for OC who had children (N=117), and their offspring (N=239). The participants were ascertained by linkage between The Danish Facial Cleft Database, The Danish Twin Registry and The Danish Civil Registration System. In the study OC recurrence risk for offspring of the affected and unaffected twin and relative risk were compared to the background prevalence. We found that among 110 children of the 54 OC affected twins, two (1.8%) children had OC corresponding to a significantly increased relative risk (RR=10; 95% CI 1.2-35) when compared to the frequency in the background population. Among the 129 children of the 63 unaffected twins, three (2.3%) children were affected, corresponding to a significantly increased relative risk (RR=13; 95% CI 2.6-36) when compared the background prevalence. We concluded that in OC discordant twin pairs similar increased recurrence risks were found among offspring of both OC affected and OC unaffected twins. This provides further evidence for a genetic component in cleft etiology and is useful information for genetic counseling of twin pairs discordant for clefting.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of chimaerism occurs in the majority of cattle twin pregnancies. The objectives of this study were to develop a powerful diagnostic test for chimaerism in bovine male and female co-twins using X and Y chromosome-linked markers and to determine the extent of chimaerism in twins, triplets and quadruplets. We developed a multiplex PCR set of three polymorphic markers on chromosome X (DIK2865, DIK2283, AGLA257), where the presence of >1 and >2 alleles per marker is sufficient to prove chimaerism in males and females, respectively. In addition, a specific segment on chromosome Y (BOV97M) is included in the set to indicate chimaerism in females. Visualization of chimaeric alleles was best for DNA extracted from blood, fair for DNA from vaginal smears and failed for DNA extracted from hair. The power of chimaerism identification using this set of markers for DNA extracted from blood was calculated as 99% in males and virtually 100% in females. All females and males in heterosexual twins, triplets and quadruplets displayed evidence of a chimaeric allele in at least one and maximum of three of three X chromosome markers analysed. In addition, all females showed the presence of the BOV97M segment and were validated as chimaeric by the standard clinical diagnosis of impaired vaginal length. Quantitative PCR analysis of BOV97M copies in all twins vs. their sires showed a mean ratio of 45-68% in females and 39-49% in males, indicating a substantial symmetrical exchange of cells among all co-twins. The proposed analysis of X and Y chromosome-linked markers is advantageous to previous methods based on Y chromosome sequences only, because it detects chimaerism in both male and female co-twins.",

    "abstract": "Somatic genetic variation in health and disease is poorly explored. Monozygotic (MZ) twins are a suitable model for studies of somatic mosaicism since genetic differences in twins derived from the same zygote represent an irrefutable example of somatic variation. We report the analysis of a pair of generally healthy female MZ twins, discordant for somatic mosaicism for aneuploidy of chromosomes X and Y. Both twins are heterozygous carriers of sickle cell disease mutation. Genotyping of blood DNA from both twins using Illumina Human 610 SNP array revealed a copy number imbalance for chromosome X in a proportion of cells in one twin. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis confirmed monosomy X (45,X) in 7% of proband nucleated blood cells. Unexpectedly, FISH analysis of cells from the other twin revealed 45,X and 46,XY lineages, both present in 1% of cells. The mechanism behind formation of these aneuploidies suggests several aberrant chromosome segregation events in meiosis and mitoses following conception. Our report contributes to the delineation of the frequency of somatic structural genomic variation in normal MZ twins. These results also illustrate the plasticity of the human genome for tolerating large copy number changes in healthy subjects and show the sensitivity of the Illumina platform for detection of aberrations that are present in a minority of the studied cells.",

    "abstract": "The rate of twin pregnancies in the United States has stabilized at 32 per 1000 births in 2006. Aside from determining chorionicity, first-trimester screening and second-trimester ultrasound scanning should ascertain whether there are structural or chromosomal abnormalities. Compared with singleton births, genetic amniocentesis-related loss at <24 weeks of gestation for twin births is higher (0.9% vs 2.9%, respectively). Selective termination for an anomalous fetus is an option, although the pregnancy loss rate is 7% at experienced centers. For singleton and twin births for African American and white women, approximately 50% of preterm births are indicated; approximately one-third of these births are spontaneous, and 10% of the births occur after preterm premature rupture of membranes. From 1989-2000, the rate of preterm twin births increased, for African American and white women alike, although the perinatal mortality rate has actually decreased. As with singleton births, tocolytics should be used judiciously and only for a limited time (<48 hours) in twin births. Administration of antenatal corticosteroids is an evidence-based recommendation.",

    "abstract": "Mass screening for cervical cancer precursors has decreased the incidence of cervical cancer in several countries, including the Netherlands. Persistent infections of certain types of human papillomavirus are strongly associated with the development of cervical cancer. A number of factors may affect the liability to infection and subsequent progression to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer. This paper examines whether genetic factors are involved in explaining individual differences in liability. Data of 3178 women registered with the Netherlands Twin Register were successfully linked to the nationwide Dutch Pathology database that contains all results of mass screening for cervical cancer. The data from mono- and dizygotic twins and their female relatives were used to disentangle the influence of heritable and environmental factors on cervix smear abnormalities. Results showed that differences in cervix smear results clustered within families and resemblance was stronger in monozygotic twins (correlation 0.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.12-0.58) compared with other first-degree relatives (correlation 0.14, 95% confidence interval: -0.01-0.29). The familial clustering for an abnormal cervix smear is due to shared genetic factors that explain 37% of the variance in liability. The largest proportion of the variation in cervical smear abnormalities is due to unique environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "We examined the variation and heritability of DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal (NW) in adult and adolescent male and female twin cigarette smokers (who reported smoking 100 or more cigarettes lifetime). Telephone diagnostic interviews were completed with 3,112 Australian adult male and female smokers (53% women; age: 24-36) and 702 Missouri adolescent male and female smokers (59% girls; age: 15-21). No gender or cohort differences emerged in rates of meeting criteria for NW (44%). Latent class analyses found that NW symptoms were best conceptualized as a severity continuum (three levels in adults and two levels in adolescents). Across all groups, increasing NW severity was associated with difficulty quitting, impairment following cessation, heavy smoking, depression, anxiety, conduct disorder and problems with alcohol use. NW was also associated with seeking smoking cessation treatment and with smoking persistence in adults. The latent class structure of NW was equally heritable across adult and adolescent smokers with additive genetic influences accounting for 49% of the variance and the remaining 51% of variance accounted for by unique environmental influences. Overall, findings suggest remarkable similarity in the pattern and heritability of NW across adult and adolescent smokers, and highlight the important role of NW in psychiatric comorbidity and the process of smoking cessation across both age groups.",

    "abstract": "Optimism has a positive influence on mental and somatic health throughout lifetime and into old age. This association is mainly due to shared genetic influences, with some indication of sex differences in the heritability of these and related traits (e.g., depression and subjective wellbeing). Here we extend our initial study of Australian twins by combining with data available from Swedish twins, in order to increase the power to explore potential sex differences in the genetic architecture of optimism, mental and self-rated health and their covariation. Optimism, mental, and self-rated health were measured in 3053 Australian (501 identical female (MZf), 153 identical male (MZm), 274 non-identical female (DZf), 77 non-identical male (DZm), and 242 non-identical opposite-sex twin pairs, and 561 single twins; mean age 60.97 +/- 8.76), and 812 Swedish (71 MZf, 53 MZm, 93 DZf and 67 DZm twin pairs, and 244 single twins; mean age 60 +/- 14.3) twin individuals using the Life Orientation Test (LOT), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and a single-item self-rating of overall health, respectively. In females all three traits were moderately heritable (.27-.47), whereas in males heritability was substantially lower (.08-.19), but genetic modeling showed that sex differences were not significant. The absence of significant sex differences, despite the consistent trend across the two cohorts, is likely due to a lack of power, raising the importance for future studies, on the same or similar traits, to utilize large samples and to keep the possibility of sex differences in mind when conducting their analyses.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate whether baseline physical activity protects against the occurrence of type 2 diabetes during a 28 year follow-up, after controlling for childhood environment and genetic predisposition.\nAt baseline in 1975 same-sex twin pairs born in Finland before 1958 were sent a questionnaire including questions on physical activity. The participants (20,487 individuals, including 8,182 complete twin pairs) were divided into quintiles by leisure-time physical activity metabolic equivalent (MET) index (MET h/day). Type 2 diabetes was determined from nationwide registers for the follow-up period (1 January 1976-31 December 2004). Individual and pairwise Cox proportional hazard models were used.\nDuring follow-up, 1,082 type 2 diabetes cases were observed. Among all individuals, participants in MET quintiles (Q) III-V had significantly decreased risk for type 2 diabetes compared with sedentary individuals (QI). The pairwise analysis on pairs discordant for physical activity showed that participants in MET QII to V had significantly lower hazard ratios (0.61, 0.59, 0.61, 0.61) compared with sedentary participants. These findings from the pairwise analysis persisted after adjusting for BMI. In the pairwise analysis, the BMI-adjusted hazard ratio for type 2 diabetes was lower for physically active members of twin pairs (combined QII-V) than for inactive co-twins (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37-0.78). Similar results were obtained for both dizygotic and monozygotic pairs, as well as for the subgroup of twin pairs defined as free of co-morbidities in 1981 (HR 0.36; 95% CI 0.17-0.76).\nLeisure-time physical activity protects from type 2 diabetes after taking familial and genetic effects into account.",

There were no measurable differences in the incidence of the perinatal complications in relation to gestational age at delivery between singleton and dichorionic twin pregnancies. In singleton pregnancies, the incidence of RDS/TTN in late pre-term births are significantly higher than those at 37 weeks, while the incidence in births at 39-40 weeks are significantly lower than those at 37 weeks. In dichorionic twin pregnancies, the incidence of RDS/TTN in late pre-term births are significantly higher than those at 37 weeks, while there were no measurable differences in the incidence in births between 37 and 38-39 weeks' gestation. There were no cases of fetal demise in dichorionic twin pregnancies at 36-40 weeks' gestation. Although fetuses in dichorionic twin pregnancies may achieve maturity earlier than fetuses in singleton pregnancies at 37-40 weeks' gestation, the incidence of perinatal complications such as RDS/TTN of late pre-term births in dichorionic twin pregnancies was the same as that in singleton pregnancies. In the absence of maternal or fetal complications, it is advisable to deliver twins only at 37 completed weeks' gestation or later, to avoid neonatal complications.",

    "abstract": "Early neonatal biochemical values are generally considered to reflect maternal values. However, studies have been inconclusive due to the statistical methods used. We hypothesized that there would not be important differences in plasma biochemistry between newborn twins, suggesting a common mechanism of control, and that differences between unrelated infant pairs would be greater. All twins over a 5-year period who had plasma biochemistry measured within 6 hours of birth were identified retrospectively. An unrelated control infant was matched to one of each twin pair. The 95% limits of agreement for plasma urea, creatinine, and sodium were calculated for twin pairs and unrelated matched infant pairs. Fifty-three twin pairs were studied. For urea, creatinine, and sodium, 95% of differences between twins were less than or equal to 1.5 mmol/L (8.9 mg/dL), 9.2 \u03bcmol/L (0.1 mg/dL), and 5.1 mmol/L (11.7 mg/dL), respectively. In unrelated infant pairs, the corresponding values were 4.0 mmol/L (24.3 mg/dL), 33.9 \u03bcmol/L (0.4 mg/dL), and 8.2 mmol/L (18.9 mg/dL). Differences between unrelated infant pairs were significantly wider than differences between twins ( p < 0.001). This study has demonstrated a close and significant agreement in urea, sodium, and creatinine when measured soon after birth in twin pairs compared with unrelated infants, implying a common mechanism of control.",

Delivery on week 29 of gestation resulted in the birth of two females, a stillborn twin with karyotype 45,XX,-13[12]/46,XX,r(13)[3] and a healthy twin with normal karyotype.\nthe discordance in the twins' karyotypes originated from a mosaic embryo. Structural chromosomal abnormality of the affected twin could not be revealed using standard PGS investigation. Embryo splitting occurred probably due to apoptotic process in an early stage of embryo development. Apoptosis represents one of the possible mechanisms which can explain the embryo twinning process globally.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence from both animal and human studies suggests that the epigenome is in constant drift over the life course in response to stochastic and environmental factors. In humans, this has been highlighted by a small number of studies that have demonstrated discordant DNA methylation patterns in adolescent or adult monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs. However, to date, it remains unclear when such differences emerge, and how prevalent they are across different tissues. To address this, we examined the methylation of four differentially methylated regions associated with the IGF2/H19 locus in multiple birth tissues derived from 91 twin pairs: 56 MZ and 35 dizygotic (DZ). Tissues included cord blood-derived mononuclear cells and granulocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, buccal epithelial cells and placental tissue. Considerable variation in DNA methylation was observed between tissues and between unrelated individuals. Most interestingly, methylation discordance was also present within twin pairs, with DZ pairs showing greater discordance than MZ pairs. These data highlight the variable contribution of both intrauterine environmental exposures and underlying genetic factors to the establishment of the neonatal epigenome of different tissues and confirm the intrauterine period as a sensitive time for the establishment of epigenetic variability in humans. This has implications for the effects of maternal environment on the development of the newborn epigenome and supports an epigenetic mechanism for the previously described phenomenon of 'fetal programming' of disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Psychopathic personality is characterized by interpersonal dominance, impulsivity, sensation seeking, poor planning, and aggressiveness. Studies have shown that the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) can be used to estimate scores on the fearless-dominant (FD) and the impulsive-antisocial (IA) dimensions of the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI), the best validated self-report measure of psychopathic personality traits. Prior behavior genetic studies reported roughly equal genetic and nonshared environmental influences for both FD and IA, which remained stable from adolescence to young adulthood. However, no prior studies address genetic and environmental influences on these dimensions beyond early adulthood. We utilized the classic twin method to examine genetic and environmental influences on variance in FD and IA in a sample of middle-aged male twins. Biometric modeling indicated that the variance in both factors is best explained by additive genetic and nonshared environmental influences. FD showed roughly equal contributions from genetic and environmental factors, whereas IA showed greater contributions from environmental than genetic factors. Additionally, the small phenotypic correlation between FD and IA was explained entirely by nonshared environmental factors.",

Interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 belong to a new class of cytokines with predominant effects on epithelial cells. Thus, these cytokines are key molecules in several disease processes. IL-17 and IL-22 are released by leukocytes such as Th and natural killer cell populations. Both IL-17 and IL-22 induce an innate immune response in epithelial cells, but their functional spectra are generally distinct. IL-17 induces an inflammatory tissue response and is involved in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, whereas IL-22 is protective/regenerative. This review juxtaposes IL-17 and IL-22 and describes overlaps and differences regarding their cellular sources, biochemical structure, signaling cascades in target cells, and function.",

Indocyanine green angiography showed pathognomonic choroidal vascular networks with polypoidal structures uniocularly in one twin and binocularly in the other twin. Both twins were treated with photodynamic therapy, retinal photocoagulation, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, but both showed limited response to all the treatments, with recurrent exudative lesions with enlarged vascular network, and poor visual outcome. Genetic analyses showed that both sisters had homozygous risk alleles for ARMS2 A69S, and one risk allele each of CFH I62V and CFH Y402H.\nWe present the first findings in a set of monozygotic twins with typical PCV under long-term observation. The concordances in disease progression and response to treatment between the twins indicate that these genetic factors most likely played important roles in determining the clinical manifestations.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a common autosomal dominant disorder with full penetrance and variable expression. The condition predisposes individuals to the development of malignant nervous system tumours, most frequently Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumours (MPNSTs). Previous studies indicate that genetic factors other than mutations in NF1 may be responsible for the condition's variable expression.\nHere we present data from a pair of monozygotic twins affected by Neurofibromatosis type 1 resulting from a de novo mutation. Both twins developed a left sciatic plexiform neurofibroma that evolved into MPNST at a similar age and they also developed pulmonary metastasis at the same age. Other concordant traits between the twins were: macrocephaly, psychomotor delay, caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, retroperitoneal, pleural and paraspinal neurofibromas. The main discordant features observed were tibial pseudoarthrosis, pectus carinatum, osteoporosis and thymus hyperplasia.\nThis is the first report of monozygotic twins with Neurofibromatosis type 1 that develop MPNSTs, the localization and chronological evolution of which, and its metastasis, is concordant in both twins. These cases suggest that the events involved in the transformation of benign plexiform neurofibromas to MPNSTs in Neurofibromatosis type 1, follow a spatiotemporally programme that is influenced by heritable factors other than NF1 mutations.",

    "abstract": "Case 1 was a 22-year-old younger sister of identical twins who had smoked 10 cigarettes per day for 4 years since she was 18. She was admitted to our hospital due to dyspnea on exertion, dry cough and bilateral diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates on chest computed tomography (CT). Histological findings of transbronchial lung biopsy demonstrated nodular lesions consisting of spindle-shaped mononuclear cells. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the cytoplasm of these mononuclear cells showed positive reactions to CD1a. Based on these findings, she was given a diagnosis of pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). She reduced the number of cigarettes smoked to 1 cigarette per week. After 6 months, her respiratory symptoms and radiographic abnormalities had improved. Case 2 was the elder twin sister of case 1. She had smoked 5 cigarettes per day for 4 years since she was 18. She presented no respiratory symptoms. However, as the diagnosis in case 1 was LCH, a chest CT was taken which revealed 3 small nodular lesions. After six months, there were no significant changes on chest CT. At the time of writing, she is 23-years-old and continues to smoke, however, has no respiratory symptoms.",

The planning of the surgical separation procedure is detailed and involves imaging assessment, evaluation of cross-circulation and even other surgical preparation procedures, such as skin expansion.\nEleven-day-old female omphalopagus conjoined twins underwent emergency surgical separation due to the death of one twin caused by sepsis associated to cardiopathy. The liver was shared by the twins and was separated. The surviving twin died six days later.\nSurgical separation of conjoined twins in the neonatal period must be avoided due to the patients' organic system immaturity.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to find out whether persistent leisure-time physical activity, adjusted for genetic liability and childhood experiences, protect against occurrence of specific chronic diseases and all-cause mortality. Study design was a 24-year prospective follow-up after 6-year physical activity discordance in twin pairs. From 5,663 healthy adult twin pairs, 146 pairs (including 29 mozygotic) discordant for both intensity and volume of leisure physical activity at baseline in both 1975 and 1981 were systematically identified. Mortality and occurrence of chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease defined according to reimbursable medication status) were followed for the period 1.1.1983-31.12.2006 for mortality and 1.1.1983-31.12.2004 for diseases. By end of follow-up, 19 inactive and 10 active co-twins had died. In the whole sample, HR of death adjusted for social class was 2.08 (95% CI 1.06-4.09) for inactive vs. active co-twins, the HR being 2.67 (95% CI 1.15-6.20) among DZ pairs with no mortality difference among the smaller number of discordant MZ pairs. The reimbursable medication analyses showed a tendency of higher risk for inactive vs. active co-twins. Among DZ pairs, HR of diabetes medication adjusted for social class was 2.73 (95% CI 0.62-12.00) and HR of hypertension medication was 2.14 (95% CI 0.94-4.89). This study supports the earlier findings that physical activity is associated with reduced mortality. However the difference was seen only in DZ pairs and therefore some residual genetic confounding effects on mortality cannot be excluded.",

    "abstract": "Selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) in monochorionic twins is associated with a substantial increase in perinatal mortality and morbidity for both twins. Clinical evolution depends on the combination of the effects of placental insufficiency in the IUGR twin with inter-twin blood transfer through placental anastomoses. Classification of sIUGR into types according to the characteristics of umbilical artery diastolic flow in the IUGR twin permits the differentiation of clinical and prognostic groups. sIUGR type I has normal diastolic flow and relatively good outcome. Type II is defined by persistently absent/reverse end-diastolic flow and is associated with a high risk of intrauterine demise of the IUGR twin and/or very preterm delivery. Type III is defined by the presence of intermittent absent/reverse end-diastolic flow (iAREDF), and is associated with 10-20% risk of unexpected fetal demise of the smaller twin and 10-20% risk of neurological injury in the larger twin. The management strategy for sIUGR with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler (types II and III) remains a challenge, and may include elective fetal therapy or close surveillance with fetal therapy or elective delivery in the presence of severe fetal deterioration. Small clinical series reporting the use of cord occlusion or laser therapy in severe cases suggest that the outcome of the larger twin might be improved. There is probably no single optimal strategy, since decisions will ultimately be influenced by the severity of IUGR, gestational age, parents' wishes and technical issues.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the first case of internal root resorption in monozygotic twins. Genetic factors have been implicated in the development of root resorption lesions. The link between interleukin (IL)-1 gene polymorphism and root resorption had been reported. However, these studies have involved external root resorption. Twin healthy 17 year old Caucasian sisters were diagnosed with internal root resorption in their upper left central incisor. Neither had a history of orofacial trauma and neither had received orthodontic treatment. The presence of IL-1beta+C3953 allele is the sign of predisposed susceptibility to an exaggerated inflammatory response, including a limited feedback mechanism as a consequence of IL-1RN mutation. Most investigators agree that the listed polymorphism presents a significantly higher risk for development of pathological resorption. These were thought to be cases of true idiopathic resorption as none of the other factors related to root resorption was found.",

    "abstract": "It has been accepted practice to use yolk-sac number to predict amnionicity in twin pairs. Two yolk sacs in a single chorionic sac were thought to confirm diamniotic pregnancy, and a single yolk sac with two fetal poles was thought to indicate monoamniotic twins. Thus, basic ultrasonography could confirm amnionicity early in pregnancy and avoid invasive testing or the more difficult tasks of demonstrating the absence of a dividing membrane or presence of entwined cords later in the pregnancy.\nWe present a case of monoamniotic twin gestation in which early ultrasonography confirmed the presence of two yolk sacs. Doppler showed entwined umbilical cords. After elective cesarean delivery, the twins did well in the neonatal intensive care unit and continue to thrive.\nYolk-sac number does not predict amnionicity. The diagnosis of monoamniotic twins requires demonstration of entwined cords or an invasive procedure.",

    "abstract": "Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a monogenic channelopathy caused by mutations of the potassium channel gene KCNA1. Affected individuals carrying the same mutation can exhibit considerable variability in the severity of ataxia, neuromyotonia, and other associated features. We investigated the phenotypic heterogeneity of EA1 in 2 sets of identical twins to determine the contribution of environmental factors to disease severity. One of the mutations was also found in a distantly related family, providing evidence of the influence of genetic background on the EA1 phenotype.\nWe evaluated 3 families with an EA1 phenotype, 2 of which included monozygotic twins. We sequenced the KCNA1 gene and studied the biophysical consequences of the mutations in HEK cells.\nWe identified a new KCNA1 mutation in each pair of twins. Both pairs reported striking differences in the clinical severity of symptoms. The F414S mutation identified in one set of twins also occurred in a distantly related family in which seizures complicated the EA1 phenotype. The other twins had an R307C mutation, the first EA1 mutation to affect an arginine residue in the voltage-sensor domain. Both mutants when expressed exerted a dominant-negative effect on wild-type channels.\nThese results broaden the range of KCNA1 mutations and reveal an unexpectedly large contribution of nongenetic factors to phenotypic variability in EA1. The occurrence of epilepsy in 1 of 2 families with the F414S mutation suggests an interplay of KCNA1 with other genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the extent of concordance in the number of leucocytes and their cytokine secretion after ex vivo stimulation in a twin population discordant for the amount of periodontal breakdown.\nVenous blood was collected from 18 adult twin pairs (10 monozygotic and eight dizygotic twins). Each twin pair consisted of a diseased twin (proband) and his/her co-twin. In venous blood, leucocytes were counted. The cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12p40 were assessed after stimulation of monocytic cells, while IL-13 and interferon (IFN)-gamma were determined after lymphocytic stimulation.\nIn the study population as a whole, probands showed higher total numbers of leucocytes and lower IL-12p40 levels compared with their co-twins. In monozygotic twins, no difference was found in the leucocyte counts, but probands secreted more IL-6 than their co-twins; an opposite trend was found for IL-12p40.\nThe results suggest that the observed discordance in periodontal breakdown in the studied monozygotic twin population may be related to the relatively high levels of IL-6 and the low levels of IL-12p40 secretion after ex vivo stimulation of whole-blood cell cultures. This cytokine secretion profile may be regarded as a risk indicator of periodontitis.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess, in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs in whom the proband of the twin pair was suffering from moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, the contribution of genetics, periodontal pathogens and lifestyle factors towards the clinical phenotype.\nFor this study, 18 adult twin pairs were selected on the basis of interproximal attachment loss (AL) >or=5 mm in >or=2 non-adjacent teeth in one twin member. The study included 10 MZ and eight DZ twin pairs, in whom the periodontal condition, presence of periodontal pathogens, educational level, smoking behaviour and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated.\nBoth MZ and DZ twins were discordant regarding AL and alveolar bone loss. Discordance was greater in DZ compared with MZ twins. In MZ twins, the discordance could not be explained by education, smoking, BMI and periodontal pathogens. In DZ twins, 45.6% of the discordance could be explained by more pack-years of the probands.\nThe results confirm a possible role of genetic factors in periodontitis.

    "abstract": "Using a sample of 20,445 Dutch twins, this study examined the relationship between speech fluency and attentional regulation in children. A secondary objective was to identify etiological overlap between nonfluency and poor attention using fluency-discordant twin pairs.\nThree fluency groups were created at age 5 using a parent questionnaire: (a) probable stuttering (PS; N=826; 4.0%), highly nonfluent (HNF; N=547; 2.7%), and typically fluent (TF; N=19,072; 93%). Multiple scales assessing attention, primarily self-regulation/inhibition, were obtained from both parents when children were ages 5 and 7 and from teachers when children were age 7.\nWhen compared with the TF controls, both the PS and HNF children received higher (i.e., more problematic) scores on parental attention ratings at both ages (p<.002). Effect sizes were moderate for both groups. Teacher and parent ratings were generally comparable. The discordant co-twin analyses suggested that nonfluency and attention were influenced by potentially overlapping genetic and shared environmental factors.\nThe liability to express both high nonfluency and problems with self-regulation/inhibition may arise from a common set of pathogenic mechanisms. This supports emerging models of stuttering, which propose that poor fluency may be part of a broader network of impaired self-regulatory processes.",

    "abstract": "Studies comparing the outcome of spontaneous versus IVF twin pregnancies report heterogeneous results. This may depend on differences in the studied populations and/or in the management approach to twin pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to compare both maternal and perinatal outcomes in dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies who where spontaneously conceived or originated by successful homologous IVF. In order to get homogeneous observations, monochorionic twin pregnancies and triplet pregnancies were excluded. Moreover, to avoid any possible bias deriving from differences in the obstetric management, all pregnancies were managed by the same team applying fixed obstetric protocols. The study included 223 twin pregnancies, 84 conceived by IVF and 139 spontaneously conceived. Overall, maternal and perinatal outcomes were similar in the two groups: no significant differences were observed as far as gestational age at delivery, birthweight, perinatal morbidity and mortality, and rate of malformations were concerned. The rate of Caesarean section was slightly, but not significantly, higher in IVF pregnancies. In conclusion, the outcome of IVF twin pregnancies is comparable to that of spontaneously conceived twin pregnancies, provided that the same management criteria are applied.",

    "abstract": "To examine the role of heredity in determining flow-mediated dilation in young people by comparing conduit artery endothelial function in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. We also determined relationships between physical activity and fitness in each twin subset.\nFlow-mediated dilation was assessed with high-resolution ultrasonography of the brachial artery in 22 twin pairs (11 monozygotic pairs 13.3 \u00b1 1.6 years, 11 dizygotic pairs 13.6 \u00b1 1.6 years). Fitness was assessed as peak oxygen uptake during an incremental treadmill test. Physical activity was measured with accelerometry. Twin versus twin intraclass correlations were performed for both groups.\nFlow-mediated dilation was significantly correlated in monozygotic twins only (r = 0.60, P = .02). Heritability of flow-mediated dilation was estimated at 0.44. Total PA time (monozygotic r = 0.77, dizygotic r = 0.60, P < .05) and light physical activity time (monozygotic r = 0.67, dizygotic r = 0.63, P < .05) correlated significantly in both groups. The peak oxygen uptake (r = 0.84, P < .01) was correlated only in monozygotic twins.\nGenetic factors appear to be responsible for a modest portion of the flow-mediated dilation response, suggesting that flow-mediated dilation can be influenced by environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Cystic renal disorders generally comprise a heterogeneous group of conditions. The most common genetic form is a polycystic kidney disease. This nosologic entity can be inherited as either an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant trait. Among all cystic renal disorders, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is the most frequent heritable disease manifesting in infancy and childhood and is among those that come to clinical attention early. The characteristic pathologic changes occur in the kidneys and the liver, however, several other organ systems can be affected secondarily. Both kidneys are enlarged because of multiple progressive cystic dilatation of the renal tubules that results to renal failure. The liver is characterized by periportal fibrosis with bile ducts abnormalities. The renal and hepatic manifestations are more or less inversely proportional in individual patients. Therefore, the morphological features and clinical presentation of this disorder can vary substantially. Moreover, there is also a great variability in the severity and manifestations even between individuals from the same family who carry the identical mutations. The authors present a case report of a fatal clinical course of the perinatal congenital polycystic kidney disease in one of the twins (Fig. 4, Ref. 19).",

Age had a statistically significant effect on the factor mean for NPD. Sex had a statistically significant effect on the factor mean and variance. Controlling for these factor level effects, item-level analysis indicated that the criteria were functioning differently across age and sex. After correcting for measurement differences at the item level, the latent factor mean effect for age was no longer statistically significant. The mean difference for sex remained statistically significant after correcting for item threshold effects. The results indicate that DSM-IV NPD criteria perform differently in males and females and across age. Differences in diagnostic rates across groups may not be valid without correcting for measurement non-invariance.",

    "abstract": "Viral diversity and life cycles are poorly understood in the human gut and other body habitats. Phages and their encoded functions may provide informative signatures of a human microbiota and of microbial community responses to various disturbances, and may indicate whether community health or dysfunction is manifest after apparent recovery from a disease or therapeutic intervention. Here we report sequencing of the viromes (metagenomes) of virus-like particles isolated from faecal samples collected from healthy adult female monozygotic twins and their mothers at three time points over a one-year period. We compared these data sets with data sets of sequenced bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes and total-faecal-community DNA. Co-twins and their mothers share a significantly greater degree of similarity in their faecal bacterial communities than do unrelated individuals. In contrast, viromes are unique to individuals regardless of their degree of genetic relatedness. Despite remarkable interpersonal variations in viromes and their encoded functions, intrapersonal diversity is very low, with >95% of virotypes retained over the period surveyed, and with viromes dominated by a few temperate phages that exhibit remarkable genetic stability. These results indicate that a predatory viral-microbial dynamic, manifest in a number of other characterized environmental ecosystems, is notably absent in the very distal intestine.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the role of genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in brain volumes measured at 2 time points in normal elderly males from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin Study. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted 4 years apart on 33 monozygotic and 33 dizygotic male twin pairs, aged 68 to 77 years when first scanned. Volumetric measures of total brain and total cerebrospinal fluid were significantly heritable at baseline (over 70%). For both volumes genetic influences at follow-up were entirely accounted for by genetic influences at baseline, suggesting that the same genetic factors influence variability in brain volume at each time of assessment. Variability in 4-year volume change was due to shared and individual-specific environmental influences. There was little evidence for heritable influences on change measures. These results suggest that variation in longitudinal change of some brain volume measures may have different underlying genetic and environmental architecture from variation in repeat cross-sectional measures, which could have implications for intervention strategies for age-related illness associated with brain morphology. The results of this study are discussed in the context of the small sample size and associated limitations of statistical power.",

Quantitative genetic modelling showed that 83% (95% confidence interval, 77%-87%) of the variance in SE could be explained by heritable factors.\nAdditive genetic influences explained most of the individual differences in SE among older Finnish women.",

    "abstract": "We examined the association between extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (EMF) and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease using all 9,508 individuals from the Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins (HARMONY) with valid occupational and diagnostic data.\nDementia diagnoses were based on telephone screening followed by in-person clinical workup. Main lifetime occupation was coded according to an established EMF exposure matrix. Covariates were age, gender, education, vascular risk factors, and complexity of work. Based on previous research, data were also analyzed separately for cases with disease onset by age 75 years versus later, men versus women, and those with manual versus nonmanual main occupation. We used generalized estimating equations with the entire sample (to adjust for the inclusion of complete twin pairs) and conditional logistic regression with complete twin pairs only.\nLevel of EMF exposure was not significantly associated with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. However, in stratified analyses, medium and high levels of EMF exposure were associated with increased dementia risk compared with low level in cases with onset by age 75 years (odds ratio: 1.94, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-3.65 for medium, odds ratio: 2.01, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-3.65 for high) and in participants with manual occupations (odds ratio: 1.81, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-3.09 for medium, odds ratio: 1.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.00-3.05 for high). Results with 42 twin pairs discordant for dementia did not reach statistical significance.\nOccupational EMF exposure appears relevant primarily to dementia with an earlier onset and among former manual workers.",

    "abstract": "The clinical, electroencephalographic, and genetic findings are reported for three pairs of monozygotic twins who developed infantile spasms in their first year. In all three pairs, the spasms started on the same day in each member of the pair. Neither sequencing of the ARX and CDKL5 (alias STK9) genes nor array comparative genomic hybridization assessment revealed any abnormalities. The long-term outcome was poor in all twins, although with different severity in individual pairs. These findings suggest that genes other than those currently known likely play a role in predisposition to infantile spasms, and that genetic susceptibility is linked to a variable phenotypic expression, ranging from quite benign to very severe, in monozygotic twins with no other apparent risk factors.",

EH has not yet been described in discordant birth weight twins. We report the cases of two sets of discordant twins with normal neonatal course and normal neonatal brain ultrasound scans who developed an EH in the first months after birth and had a mild neurodevelopmental delay. Our findings suggest that EH may be part of neurologic morbidity in discordant birth weight twins and represents one of the potential complications to look for in the follow-up of these infants.",

    "abstract": "The appropriate time and the optimal mode of delivery of twins are still controversial. We assessed the effect of gestational age and the mode of elective delivery of twins on the occurrence of neonatal respiratory morbidity (NRM) and of maternal morbidity. This study included twins born beyond 35 weeks' gestation. NRM was defined as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). Additionally, maternal complications related to the different modes of delivery were taken into account. Of 711 twin pregnancies (1422 liveborn neonates) included, 74 (5.2%) experienced NRM. Maternal age > 25 years, delivery at an earlier gestational age, and delivery by emergency cesarean section maintained statistical significance with NRM. From the maternal point of view, increased length of hospitalization ( P = 0.045) and the need for postoperative antibiotics ( P = 0.0065) were significantly higher following an emergency cesarean section than after an elective cesarean birth. The risk of NRM in twins born beyond 37 weeks' gestation is rather low. We suggest considering elective cesarean delivery at completion of 37 weeks. This can be performed safely in regard to NRM, the trade-off being reduced maternal morbidity associated with elective cesarean delivery.",

    "abstract": "Sudden unexplained and unexpected death in twins has not been well studied, particularly in relation to the common practice of sleeping twin infants together in the same cot (cobedding). Postal surveys of 109 mothers of twins were undertaken when the infants were 6 weeks, 4 months, and 8 months of age to determine the prevalence of cobedding, infant care practices related to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and the mother's knowledge of SIDS risk factors. SIDS risk factor knowledge was similar to an earlier survey of singletons in 2005. At 6 weeks, 76% of infants usually slept on the back; this changed to 86% at 4 months and 73% at 8 months. At 6 weeks, 52% usually cobedded with their twin all or part of the time. At 4 and 8 months, this had reduced to 31% and 10%, respectively. Side-by-side cobedding configurations were predominant at 6 weeks, with feet-to-feet configurations increasing as the infants grew older. Breastfeeding was reported in 83%, 61% and 31% of infants at 6 weeks, 4 months and 8 months, respectively. Pacifier use was reported in 38%, 50% and 33% at the respective surveys. As the age of the twins increased, mothers were significantly more likely to be concerned about deformational plagiocephaly in Twin 1 than in Twin 2.\nDespite a lack of evidence of the risks or benefits of cobedding, this practice was very popular, especially in the younger infants. More research is needed to establish the safety of cobedding in relation to the risk of SIDS.",

Embryos were generated from the microinjection of pre-prepared sperms into vitrified oocytes. Twin male babies weighing 750 and 860 g were born by emergency cesarean section. Vitrification is one of the most promising options in cryopreservation and preservation of embryos and oocytes.",

    "abstract": "The understanding of the influence of smoking and sex on lung function and symptoms is important for understanding diseases such as COPD. The influence of both genes and environment on lung function, smoking behaviour and the presence of respiratory symptoms has previously been demonstrated for each of these separately. Hence, smoking can influence lung function by co-varying not only as an environmental factor, but also by shared genetic pathways. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate heritability for different aspects of lung function, and to investigate how the estimates are affected by adjustments for smoking and respiratory symptoms.\nThe current study is based on a selected sample of adult twins from the Swedish Twin Registry. Pairs were selected based on background data on smoking and respiratory symptoms collected by telephone interview. Lung function was measured as FEV1, VC and DLco. Pack years were quantified, and quantitative genetic analysis was performed on lung function data adjusting stepwise for sex, pack years and respiratory symptoms.\nFully adjusted heritability for VC was 59% and did not differ by sex, with smoking and symptoms explaining only a small part of the total variance. Heritabilities for FEV1 and DLco were sex specific. Fully adjusted estimates were 10 and 15% in men and 46% and 39% in women, respectively. Adjustment for smoking and respiratory symptoms altered the estimates differently in men and women. For FEV1 and DLco, the variance explained by smoking and symptoms was larger in men. Further, smoking and symptoms explained genetic variance in women, but was primarily associated with shared environmental effects in men.\nDifferences between men and women were found in how smoking and symptoms influence the variation in lung function. Pulmonary gas transfer variation related to the menstrual cycle has been shown before, and the findings regarding DLco in the present study indicates gender specific environmental susceptibility not shown before. As a consequence the results suggest that patients with lung diseases such as COPD could benefit from interventions that are sex specific.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the overall rate of preterm births has increased. The aim of the present study was to examine whether this trend is also seen for multiple gestations. More specifically, we examined if there has been a decrease in gestational age for live born monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins and if there has been a simultaneous change in birthweight. The contributions of fertility treatments and Caesarean sections were taken into consideration. All analyses were carried out in two large European twin cohorts.\nCross-sectional study of 6310 live born twin pairs, born between 1964-2007, from the Belgian East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey and 14,712 twin pairs, born between 1990-2006, from the Netherlands Twin Register. Multiple regression analyses were performed with gestational age as outcome variable, and multilevel analysis with birthweight as outcome variable. All analyses were performed with and without adjustment for zygosity, parity, maternal age, mode of conception and delivery and, for the analyses of birthweight, gestational age.\nGestational age decreased in a linear fashion from 1964 to 2007 with a decrease of 0.25 days per year in a similar way for MZ and DZ twins. Changes in birthweight depended on gestational age: up to 32 weeks, birthweight decreased and after 32 weeks birthweight increased. The frequency of infertility treatment and Caesarean sections, primiparity and advanced maternal age increased over the years, but none of these factors influenced the secular trends in gestational age and birthweight.\nThe decrease in gestational age and change in birthweight in twins are sources of concern, especially for very preterm twins, for whom birthweight decreased. For twins born after 32 weeks, an increase in birthweight was observed and this is very likely the explanation for the decrease in gestational age.",

    "abstract": "Lateralization for language, spatial judgment and face processing was assessed in 42 pairs of identical twins, 21 discordant and 21 concordant pairs for handedness, using fMRI. Individual laterality indices were calculated based on the observed activation patterns. All tasks showed expected asymmetry, favoring the left-hemisphere for language and the right-hemisphere for spatial judgment and face processing. The intra-class correlations on the laterality indices were significant only on the language task and only for the concordant group, but not the discordant group, suggesting a stronger genetic influence for language asymmetry in concordant twins. The expected asymmetry was greater for the concordant group only on the language task. The difference was not significant, but conformed quite well to Annett's genetic model, which assumes a right-shift (RS) gene with one allele (RS+) biasing toward right-handedness and left-cerebral language dominance, and the other (RS-) leaving both asymmetries to chance. The model also assumes that the genetic influence is additive for handedness but dominant-recessive for left-cerebral language dominance, which explains the high concordance for language dominance in twins discordant for handedness. Our data suggest that the same gene has no influence on right-hemisphere dominance for spatial judgment or face processing, and offer little support for mirror-imaging in MZ twins other than that due to chance.",

These include cross-circulation between the twins that results in induction of both the twins after the administration of i.v. induction agent to one twin and difficulty in mask ventilating both the twins simultaneously due to the angle between the heads; different arterial pressures in the two children complicate pharmacological management and underline the importance of physiological measures to control arterial pressure. Adequate preparation and teamwork is the keystone to the management of these patients.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the longitudinal causal relationship between self-perceived abilities (SPA) and academic achievement (Ach) while controlling for cognitive ability (CA). In all, 5957 UK school children were assessed on SPA, Ach and CA at ages 9 and 12. Results indicated that SPA and Ach at age 9 independently affected both SPA and Ach at age 12, even when CA was considered. Moreover the effects of previous Ach on subsequent SPA were of similar magnitude to the effects of prior SPA on subsequent Ach, suggesting that the link between SPA and Ach independent of CA is reflective of both \"insight\" (children's accounts of their previous performance) and self-efficacy (the self-fulfilling or motivational effects of self-beliefs). Practical and theoretical implications for the study of SPA are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The interceptive therapeutic approach of a functional type is indicated for the treatment of Class II Division 2 mandibular retrusion with deep bite, where improvement is required not only in occlusal relationships but also in skeletal and aesthetic parameters.\nThe aim of this study is to assess, in two identical twins suffering from the same malocclusion, the effectiveness and clinical stability of functional interceptive Class II division 2 treatment during puberty by mandibular retro-positioning associated with deep bite, and to compare skeletal changes and dental and dental-alveolar changes induced by the application of two different modified removable appliances: Clark's Twin block and Bergersen's Occlus-o-guide.\nThe results show that both devices allowed for circumvention of the pre-functional therapy phase aimed at correcting the upper labial segment, and for the conversion of the Class II division 1 incisor relationship, they were able to promote significant and obvious clinical effects.\nThe study shows that Class II Division 2 functional type interceptive treatment of mandibular retrusion with deep bite conducted in the puberal phase through clinical use of modified Bergersen's Occlus-o-guide(\u00ae) allowed for simultaneous resolution of the skeletal, dental-alveolar and dental problems in one step, while that using modified Clark's Twin-block still requires a second phase of treatment necessary to resolve the alignment, levelling, inter-cuspidation of the arches, optimization of the dental overjet and overbite parameters and to the stabilization of the basal Class I.\nL\u2019approccio terapeutico intercettivo di tipo funzionale trova indicazione nel trattamento della Classe II divisione 2 da retrusione mandibolare con morso profondo in cui \u00e8 richiesto il miglioramento non solo dei rapporti occlusali ma anche dei parametri scheletrici ed estetici.\nScopo del presente studio \u00e8 quello di valutare, in due gemelli omozigoti affetti dal medesimo quadro malocclusivo, l\u2019efficacia e la stabilit\u00e0 clinica del trattamento intercettivo funzionale della II Classe divisione 2 da retro-posizionamento mandibolare associata a morso profondo in et\u00e0 puberale e comparare i cambiamenti scheletrici e le modificazioni dentali e dento-alveolari indotte dall\u2019applicazione di due differenti dispositivi rimovibili modificati: il Twin block di Clark e l\u2019Occlus-o-guide di Bergesen.\nI risultati ottenuti dimostrano che entrambi i dispositivi hanno consentito di eludere la fase pre-funzionale di terapia volta alla correzione del segmento labiale superiore e alla conversione del rapporto incisale in Classe II divisione 1e sono stati in grado di promuovere rilevanti ed evidenti effetti clinici.\nLo studio dimostra che il trattamento intercettivo di tipo funzionale della Classe II divisione 2 da retrusione mandibolare con morso profondo condotto in fase puberale attraverso l\u2019utilizzo clinico dell\u2019Occlus-o-guide",

    "abstract": "The Vesicle Inducing Protein in Plastids 1 (Vipp1) was suggested to be involved in thylakoid membrane formation in both chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The protein shows sequence homology to the Phage Shock Protein A (PspA) from bacteria, and both proteins have similar secondary structures. 2D-structures of PspA and of Vipp1 have been determined by electron microscopy in the recent years. Both PspA and Vipp1 form large homooligomeric rings with high molecular masses but their ring dimensions differ significantly. Furthermore, Vipp1 forms rings with different rotational symmetries whereas PspA appears to form rings with singular rotational symmetry. In this article addendum we compare the structures of PspA and Vipp1. Furthermore, we suggest a spatial structural model of the observed Vipp1 rings.",

The likelihood of progressing from 24 weeks to 2 live births was 98.7% in uncomplicated pregnancies, 89.7% with twin-twin transfusion syndrome, and 100% with growth discordance, increasing at 32 weeks to 99.5%, 93.8%, and 100%, respectively. The relative risk (RR) of birth <32 weeks was significantly greater in twin-twin transfusion syndrome (RR, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-6.1) and growth discordant (RR, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-3.8) pregnancies than in uncomplicated pregnancies (P < .0001).\nThis represents one of the largest cohorts of MCDA twins. The risk of third-trimester fetal loss was low. The likelihood of both intrauterine fetal demise and preterm birth were greater in complicated pregnancies. In the absence of a clinical indication for delivery, these data do not support elective preterm delivery for prevention of intrauterine fetal demise in uncomplicated MCDA twins.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence for a cerebellar role in human cognition has accrued with respect to anatomically and functionally distinct lobules. Questions of laterality, however, have been largely overlooked. This study therefore introduced and applied a novel measurement protocol for comparatively bias-free analysis of cerebellar asymmetries. Volumetric measurements were performed on magnetic resonance images from a single pair of monozygotic handedness-discordant twins. Against a background of functional cortical asymmetry for verbal and visuo-spatial functional magnetic resonance imaging activation, which was mirrored in the left-handed twin (Lux et al. 2008), between-twin differences in cerebellar asymmetry are described. Interestingly, asymmetry measures for the whole cerebellum did not correspond to either the direction of hand preference or to the weaker (functional magnetic resonance imaging) lateralization of the left-handed twin. The twins both showed clockwise cerebellar torques. This mirrored a counter-clockwise cerebral torque in the right-handed twin only. Selected single cerebellar lobules V and VII displayed between-twin laterality differences that partially reflected their discrepant handedness. Whole cerebellum anatomical measures appeared to be unrelated to single functional cortical asymmetries. These analyses contribute further anatomical evidence pertaining to the existence of multiple structurally and functionally distinct cortico-cerebellar networks of the healthy human brain in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The authors report the first published case of premature twins whose adoptive mother induced lactation. Both infants are receiving exclusively human milk (adoptive mother's milk) at 2 months of age. This remarkable achievement reflects careful planning by the adoptive mother beginning in the prenatal period, her active role during the infants' hospital stay, and support from health care personnel and family members. Health care professionals are encouraged to support any adoptive mother who expresses interest in breastfeeding her infant(s).",

    "abstract": "Studies of singletons suggest that right-handed individuals may have higher levels of testosterone than do left-handed individuals. Prenatal testosterone levels are hypothesised to be especially related to handedness formation. In humans, female members from opposite-sex twin pairs may experience elevated level of prenatal exposure to testosterone in their intrauterine environment shared with a male. We tested for differences in rates of left-handedness/right-handedness in female twins from same-sex and opposite-sex twin pairs. Our sample consisted of 4736 subjects, about 70% of all Finnish twins born in 1983-1987, with information on measured pregnancy and birth related factors. Circulating testosterone and estradiol levels at age 14 were available on 771 and 744 of these twins, respectively. We found significantly (p=.006) lower prevalence of left-handedness in females from opposite-sex pairs (5.3%) compared to females from same-sex pairs (8.6%). The circulating levels of neither testosterone nor estradiol related to handedness in either females or males. Nor were there differences in circulating testosterone or estradiol levels between females from opposite-sex and same-sex twin pairs. Birth and pregnancy related factors for which we had information were unrelated to handedness. Our results are difficult to fully explain by postnatal factors, but they offer support to theory that relates testosterone to formation of handedness, and in a population-based sample, are suggestive of effects of prenatal testosterone transfer.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of fetal programming following in utero demise of a co-twin are poorly understood.\nThe authors examined fetal programming using a unique application of the change-point analysis method, and identified two types of fetal programming that occurred when a viable twin sibling died in utero, while the co-twin survived.\nIn one type, the initial twin fetal programming trajectory was maintained while in a subset of surviving co-twins a \"switch\" from a twin to a singleton fetal program (dual fetal programming exposure) was observed. The results suggest that the timing in utero of conversion from a twin to a singleton programming pattern occurred slightly earlier among opposite-sex than in same-sex surviving co-twins.\nFor the conversion from a twin to a singleton program to happen, the surviving co-twin must have attained a \"critical mass\" when the twin sibling died. Whereas, for same-sex surviving co-twins the critical mass for conversion was the 80th percentile of gestational-age specific birth weight, opposite-sex surviving co-twins converted at a lower critical mass (70th percentile). These novel findings warrant further study to confirm the new hithertofore unknown phenomenon of dual fetal programming sequence, and to determine the implications in terms of subsequent morbidity or mortality during infancy, childhood and adult life.",

    "abstract": "Frontostriatal networks mediating important cognitive and motor functions have been shown to be abnormal structurally and functionally in schizophrenia. However, the influence of genetic risk for schizophrenia on structural abnormalities in these areas is not well established. This study therefore aimed to investigate prefrontal and striatal volume alterations in schizophrenia and to define the extent to which they are dependent on genetic vulnerability for the condition. We employed structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) in monozygotic (MZ) twins with or without schizophrenia. A sample of 129 twins completed sMRI, consisting of 21 MZ twin pairs concordant for schizophrenia, 17 MZ schizophrenic twins and 18 MZ nonschizophrenic twins drawn from 19 pairs discordant for schizophrenia, and 26 MZ control twin pairs without schizophrenia. Groups did not significantly differ in age, gender, handedness, height, level of education, parental socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Using a region-of-interest approach, we measured the gray matter volumes (in cm(3)) of superior, middle, inferior, and orbital frontal cortices (SFC, MFC, IFC, and OFC, respectively); the caudate; and putamen. Covarying for whole-brain volume, age, and gender, we found that concordant but not discordant twins with schizophrenia had significantly lower volumes of MFC and OFC than control twins. In contrast, both patient groups had significantly lower SFC volumes than both groups of nonschizophrenic twins. There were no significant group differences in IFC and the striatum. We conclude that the prefrontal cortex shows a heterogeneous pattern of genetic influences on volumetric reductions in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Plasma levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) are associated with risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance (IR), and hypertension. Limited data exist on whether there is genetic covariance between plasma levels of GGT and NAFLD risk factors. Variants of beta2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2) have been associated with dyslipidemia, IR, and hypertension, but its effect on GGT secretion is not known. We estimated the heritability of GGT using a twin-study design and examined the genetic covariance between GGT levels, IR, hypertension, levels of low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides, and ADRB2 variants.\nWe studied phenotypes of 362 twins; the heritabilities of increased GGT activity and genetic covariance with NAFLD risk factors were estimated by variance-component methodology. ADRB2 genotype associations with plasma GGT activity were examined using generalized estimating equations to account for intra-twinship correlations.\nGGT activity was heritable at 49% +/- 8% of the twin cohort and had significant covariance with IR; insulin, triglyceride, and uric acid levels; and diastolic blood pressure. In generalized estimating equation models, the most common haplotype of ADRB2 was significantly associated with plasma GGT activity. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms in ADRB2 were associated with levels of GGT; ADRB2 haplotypes displayed pleiotropic effects on GGT and triglyceride levels.\nIn a twin study, GGT shared genetic codetermination with traits of metabolic syndrome. The ADRB2 gene had pleiotropic effects on plasma levels of GGT and triglycerides, indicating linked pathways (eg, adrenergic) between genetic susceptibility to NAFLD and metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Velamentous cord insertion and vasa previa occur more frequently in monochorionic twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies. Both have been linked with poor perinatal outcome due to the increased risk of rupture of the velamentous vessels. We present a case of acute fetal distress in 2 fetuses in a monochorionic twin pregnancy caused by ruptured vasa previa that was not detected antenatally. Both infants were severely anemic at birth. Acute blood loss in twin 1 through the ruptured vessels, led to an acute feto-fetal transfusion from the co-twin through the placental vascular anastomoses. In monochorionic twins, ruptured vasa previa and acute hemorrhage in one fetus can lead to acute feto-fetal transfusion and result in severe hypovolemic shock and acute anemia in both fetuses. Increased awareness for vasa previa and the characteristic placental angioarchitecture in monochorionic twinning is of paramount importance.",

    "abstract": "To assess the heritability of serum uric acid in adult, using the classic twin design.\nAdult Twins were recruited from the Qingdao Twin Registry. Uric acid, height, weight were measured. Zygosity in all the same-sex twin pairs was determined by 16 polymorphic markers. Heritability was assessed by structural equation models, with age, gender and body mass index (BMI) included as covariates.\nIn total, 687 twin pairs were available for data analyses, including 420 pairs of monozygotic and 267 pairs of dizygotic twins. After logarithm transformed, uric acid in males (17.47 +/- 1.91) was significantly higher than in females (15.22 +/- 1.70, P < 0.0001). After adjustment on age, sex and BMI, intraclass correlations for uric acid were 0.70 for monozygotic twins and 0.40 for dizygotic twins. The sex-limitation AE model, combining additive genetic and unique environmental factors, could produce the best fit for the data. Heritability estimate for uric acid was 70.5% (95%CI: 65.9 - 74.6), with the proportion of unique environmental effects as 29.5% (95%CI: 25.4 - 34.2).\nAdditive genetic effects appeared to be the major contributor to the variation of uric acid in this twins sample being studied.",

After adjustment on age, sex and BMI, intraclass correlations for uric acid were 0.70 for monozygotic twins and 0.40 for dizygotic twins. The sex-limitation AE model, combining additive genetic and unique environmental factors, could produce the best fit for the data.

    "abstract": "Formation of random as well as periodic planar defects can occur during vapor-liquid-solid growth of nanowires with the zinc-blende crystal structure. Here we investigate the formation of pairs of twin planes in GaP nanowires. In such pairs, the first twin plane is formed at a random position, rapidly followed by the formation of a second twin plane of which the position is directly related to that of the first one. We show that the triangular [112] morphology of the nanowire is a key element in the formation of these twin pairs. We have extended our previous kinetic nucleation model and show that this describes the development of the nanowire morphology and its relation with the formation of single and paired twin planes.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism involved in the developmental regulation of gene expression. Alterations in DNA methylation are established contributors to inter-individual phenotypic variation and have been associated with disease susceptibility. The degree to which changes in loci-specific DNA methylation are under the influence of heritable and environmental factors is largely unknown. In this study, we quantitatively measured DNA methylation across the promoter regions of the dopamine receptor 4 gene (DRD4), the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4/SERT) and the X-linked monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA) using DNA sampled at both ages 5 and 10 years in 46 MZ twin-pairs and 45 DZ twin-pairs (total n=182). Our data suggest that DNA methylation differences are apparent already in early childhood, even between genetically identical individuals, and that individual differences in methylation are not stable over time. Our longitudinal-developmental study suggests that environmental influences are important factors accounting for interindividual DNA methylation differences, and that these influences differ across the genome. The observation of dynamic changes in DNA methylation over time highlights the importance of longitudinal research designs for epigenetic research.",

    "abstract": "To date, studies on the contributions of genetic factors to oral health have been inconclusive. We hypothesized that major dental diseases show a significant genetic component. The study was based on self-reported oral health among young adult twins. The data were derived from the fourth wave of the longitudinal FinnTwin16 study, in which participants completed a questionnaire in 2000-2002 enquiring about the number of filled teeth and the prevalence of gingival bleeding. We used quantitative genetic modeling, based on the genetic similarity of identical and non-identical twins, to calculate the most probable model for both filled teeth and gingival bleeding. The models revealed a strong genetic component behind the number of filled teeth, differing between males (49%) and females (68%), and a weaker genetic component affecting gingival bleeding, being similar for males and females (32%). Genetic factors contribute to inter-individual differences in oral health among young adults.",

Amniocenteses demonstrated heterokaryotypia for trisomy 13 in monozygotic twins. The pregnancy was managed conservatively, resulting in the delivery of discordant twins at 32 weeks. The structurally normal twin survived without sequelae, but the abnormal twin died shortly after delivery.\nThis report adds to the literature the second known case of a spontaneously conceived monochorionic twin pregnancy discordant for trisomy 13 and highlights the necessity of sampling both fetuses in cases of monochorionic twins presenting with discordant structural anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Lamins are essential for nuclear shape and function. Polymorphisms in LMNA may associate with fat and muscle development and aging.\nOur aim was to determine the influence of LMNA rs4641 on lean body mass (LBM) and fat mass (FM), in vivo metabolism, and expression of LMNA transcripts in human skeletal muscle.\nWe genotyped LMNA rs4641 in 196 Danish twins who were extensively phenotypically characterized. We measured mRNA levels of LMNA transcripts, lamin A and C, in basal and insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle biopsies.\nThe rs4641 T-allele was associated with increased weight and body mass index (P=0.02), including increased FM (P=0.03) and LBM (P=0.004). Impact of rs4641 on FM was seen primarily among elderly twins. The T-allele was associated with elevated fasting plasma insulin levels (P=0.01) and homeostasis model of insulin resistance (P=0.02) in young twins. T-allele carriers did not exhibit consistent changes of first phase insulin secretion, nor did they exhibit significant peripheral or hepatic insulin resistance, and rs4641 did not influence muscle lamin A or C mRNA levels. The lamin A-to-C mRNA ratio was increased with acute insulin stimulation (P<0.0005), and the lamin A and C mRNA levels were diminished in young compared to elderly twins (P<0.001).\nThe LMNA rs4641 T-allele is associated with increased LBM and FM with more fat relative to muscle in elderly twins, which may impact risk of type 2 diabetes. Increased mRNA levels of lamins with age may counteract muscle wasting, and influence of insulin on lamin A-to-C ratio suggests a role in cytoskeletal muscle protein regulation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, variants of the hepatocanalicular cholesterol hemitransporters ABCG5/8 were linked to gallstone disease; ABCG8 D19H in Caucasians and ABCG5 Q604E in Chinese. We investigated these polymorphisms in Swedish twins by merging the Swedish Twin Registry with the Hospital Discharge and Causes of Death Registries for gallstone disease-related diagnoses.\nAll monozygotic (MZ) twins with gallstone disease alive in the Stockholm area were invited to participate. Gallstone disease was defined by entry in all above mentioned registries, questionnaire or abdominal ultrasound.\nABCG5 Q604E and ABCG8 D19H genotyping was performed in 24 unique MZ and eight dizygotic (DZ) twins from concordant pairs. Screening of the TwinGene database for gallstone disease resulted in an additional 20 concordant MZ and 54 twins from concordant DZ pairs. We included 109 concordantly stone-free MZ and 126 stone-free independent DZ twins as controls.\nAmongst the 341 twins, 20.8% carried at least one D19H allele as compared to 9.4% of stone-free controls. The association analysis showed that D19H positivity significantly increased the risk of gallstone disease [odds ratio (OR), 2.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.33-4.82; P = 0.004]. We also found a trend for a positive association between gallstone disease and the Q604E variant (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.00-2.16; P = 0.052).\nTwins carrying a heterozygous or homozygous ABCG8 D19H genotype have a significantly increased risk of gallstone disease. Our study confirms the ABCG8 D19H genotype as a major risk factor for gallstone disease.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies of genetic and environmental influences on adolescent substance use have been limited to Western samples.\nThis study assesses genetic and environmental contributions to cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and psychological variables (depression, anxiety, aggression, hostility) among 602 pairs of adolescent twins, 11 to 19 years old, in Qingdao, China.\nHeritable influences were more pronounced for alcohol use than cigarette smoking. In univariate analyses, no heritable effects were found for depression or aggression, and modest heritability was found for anxiety. Hostility was relatively more heritable in girls than boys. Bivariate associations between substance use and psychological measures could be attributed to a combination of common genetic and environmental factors.\nAmong Chinese adolescents, experimentation with tobacco is familial, and experimentation with alcohol is heritable. The genetic and environmental architecture of hostility differs by gender. Consistency of univariate results with Western adolescent samples appears limited to the alcohol use measures.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins show remarkable resemblance in many aspects of behavior, health, and disease. Until recently, MZ twins were usually called \"genetically identical\"; however, evidence for genetic and epigenetic differences within rare MZ twin pairs has accumulated. Here, we summarize the literature on MZ twins discordant for Mendelian inherited disorders and chromosomal abnormalities. A systematic literature search for English articles on discordant MZ twin pairs was performed in Web of Science and PubMed. A total number of 2,016 publications were retrieved and reviewed and 439 reports were retained. Discordant MZ twin pairs are informative in respect to variability of phenotypic expression, pathogenetic mechanisms, epigenetics, and post-zygotic mutagenesis and may serve as a model for research on genetic defects. The analysis of single discordant MZ twin pairs may represent an elegant approach to identify genes in inherited disorders.",

    "abstract": "alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA) is associated with a low risk of cardiovascular disease; however, the underlying mechanism is not completely known.\nThe objective was to examine whether habitual dietary ALA intake is associated with plasma concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers after control for shared genetic and common environmental factors.\nWe cross-sectionally studied 353 middle-aged male twins. Habitual diet was assessed with the Willett food-frequency questionnaire. Fasting plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its soluble receptor (sIL-6R), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured. Linear mixed-effect regression analysis was used to partition the overall association into within- and between-pair associations.\nA 1-g increment in habitual dietary ALA intake was associated with 11.0% lower concentrations of sIL-6R (P = 0.004) but not of IL-6 (P = 0.31), TNF-alpha (P = 0.16), or hsCRP (P = 0.36) after adjustment for energy intake, nutritional factors, known cardiovascular disease risk factors, and medications. After further control for shared genetic and common environmental factors by comparison of brothers within a twin pair, a twin with a 1-g higher ALA intake was likely to have 10.9% (95% CI: 3.7%, 17.6%; P = 0.004) lower sIL-6R concentrations than his co-twin with a low intake, whereas ALA intake was not significantly associated with plasma concentrations of IL-6, TNF-alpha, or hsCRP. These results were validated by using 1000 bootstrap samples.\nHabitual dietary ALA intake is inversely associated with plasma sIL-6R concentrations independent of shared genetic and common environmental influences. Lowering sIL-6R may be a mechanism underlying the cardioprotective properties of habitual dietary ALA. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00017836.",

    "abstract": "Maggie and Lily are 11 month-old twins who are brought by their parents to the Developmental-Behavioral Pediatric Clinic for a life-long history of feeding difficulties. The twins are this couple's first children. Their mother is tearful as she recounts a stressful pregnancy complicated by pre-term labor beginning at 24 weeks gestation with strict bed rest for the remainder of the pregnancy. The twins were delivered at 35 weeks gestation by Caesarian Section. Lily weighed 5 lbs 11 oz; Maggie was small-for-gestational age with a birth weight of 3 lbs 13 oz. Maggie required oxygen with nasal prongs for only a few hours after birth. She remained in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) with initial nasogastric tube feeding; she was advanced to bottle feeding prior to discharge. Both Maggie and Lily were slow to initiate and sustain formula feeding. They required over 1 hour to consume 2 ounces of formula and \"tire easily\". At 1 month of age, Maggie resisted feedings by crying and arching her back. By 5 months of age, both children cried at the sight of the bottle and tried to push it away. However, they never lost weight. Maggie was treated with intermittent naso-gastric tube feeding at 5-6 months of age in order to gain adequate weight. At 11 months of age, both girls continued to resist feeding, but their mother was able to \"get in\" 24 ounces each day of a 31-calorie/ounce formula \"with a lot of work\". Dad observed that his wife's entire day revolved around getting the twins to eat and that became a significant stress for her as well as on their relationship. The children had a gastroenterology evaluation including an upper gastrointestinal series, pH probe and gastro-duodenal endoscopy with biopsies. All studies were normal. Trials of omeprazole, metoclopramide and thickened feeds did not improve their feeding problem. They are currently not on any medications. They have not had a history of vomiting, diarrhea, or diaphoresis with feeds, and they have experienced only 1 mild upper respiratory infection. One or two soft bowel movements occur each day. Developmentally, they are on track for their age. The parents report that they can pull up to a stand and cruise, use a pincer grasps, and speak \"mama\" discriminately. A review of their growth charts reveal that their weight is consistently between the 10-25% percentiles; weight is currently at the 25% percentile. Head circumference and height are between the 25-50% percentiles.",

    "abstract": "Biometric studies have shown that happiness is strongly affected by genes. The findings are mainly based on twin data, however, and the full validity of the results has been debated. To overcome some limitations in classical twin research, we examined aetiological sources of subjective well-being (SWB), using two independent population-based samples, one including nuclear families (N = 54,540) and one including twins (N = 6,620). Biometric modelling using R was conducted to test for a data structure implying either non-additive genetic effects or higher environmental co-twin correlation in MZ than DZ pairs (violation of the EEA). We also estimated non-random mating, cultural transmission and shared environments specific for regular siblings and twins. Two sets of nested models were fitted and compared. The best explanatory model shows that family matters for happiness predominantly due to quantitative sex-specific genetic effects, a moderate spousal correlation and a shared twin environment. Upper limits for broad-sense heritability were estimated to be 0.33 (females) and 0.36 (males). Our study constitutes the most elaborate biometric study of SWB to date and illustrates the utility of including responses from multiple types of relatives in quantitative genetic analyses.",

    "abstract": "The lack of sex difference in left-handedness in Scandinavian countries reported by Papadatou-Pastou, Martin, Munaf\u00f2, and Jones (2008) is questioned. We investigated the sex difference in left-handedness in two Finnish, one Norwegian, and one Swedish population-based sample not included in the Papadatou-Pastou et al. (2008) meta-analysis. The male-to-female odds ratio across these samples was 1.34 (95% confidence interval = 1.18, 1.51), indicating that the sex difference in left-handedness also exists in Scandinavian countries. Studies show that a similar sex difference in left-handedness is evident in twins as well. Overall, we challenge the contentions of Papadatou-Pastou et al. (a) that a lack of sex differences in left-handedness actually exists in Scandinavia or (b) that any such lack of differences could relate to extremely low levels of cultural masculinity in Scandinavian societies.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis has been associated with later development of asthma, wheezing, abnormal pulmonary function, and sensitization. Our aim was to determine the differential effect within monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for severe RSV bronchiolitis in infancy on the subsequent development of asthma, pulmonary function, and allergy.\nThirty-seven MZ twin pairs discordant for RSV hospitalization in infancy (mean age 10.6 months) were compared at the mean age of 7.6 years for lung function, bronchial responsiveness, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (Feno), asthma diagnosis, use of asthma medication, and skin prick test to common inhalant allergens.\nThere were no differences within MZ twin pairs discordant for RSV hospitalization in infancy with respect to pulmonary function, Feno, asthma prevalence, asthma medication use, or sensitization (P > .1 for all comparisons).\nWe found no differential effect from severity of RSV infection on the development of asthma and allergy in MZ twin pairs discordant for RSV hospitalization in infancy. This argues against a specific effect of severe RSV infection in the development of asthma and allergy. Because of the small sample size, this study must be considered as a hypothesis-generating study.",

    "abstract": "Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a chronic pain condition with unclear underlying etiology. Our objectives were to determine whether psychological distress was higher in twins with urological symptoms commonly found in IC/PBS than in twins without, and if so, did familial influences contribute to this association.\nData from 1165 female twins in a community-based sample were used. Urological symptoms, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and perceived stress were assessed with standardized questionnaires. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models were used to examine the relationship between psychological distress and urological symptoms.\nCompared to unaffected twins, twins with urological symptoms were more likely to report PTSD symptoms (OR=3.9; 95% CI=2.6-5.8), depression (OR=3.1; 95% CI=2.0-5.0), anxiety (OR=3.4; 95% CI=2.3-5.2) and perceived stress (OR=3.2; 95% CI=2.1-4.9). After adjusting for familial influences, the within-pair effects remained significant for PTSD symptoms (OR=2.2; 95% CI=1.2-3.8) and perceived stress (OR=2.2; 95% CI=1.2-3.8).\nFamilial influences partially explained the relationship between indicators of psychological distress and urological symptoms. Future research should examine shared environmental and genetic mechanisms that may further explain this relationship and improve diagnosis and treatment of this unexplained clinical condition.",

    "abstract": "Brain asymmetry, or the structural and functional specialization of each brain hemisphere, has fascinated neuroscientists for over a century. Even so, genetic and environmental factors that influence brain asymmetry are largely unknown. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) now allows asymmetry to be studied at a microscopic scale by examining differences in fiber characteristics across hemispheres rather than differences in structure shapes and volumes. Here we analyzed 4Tesla DTI scans from 374 healthy adults, including 60 monozygotic twin pairs, 45 same-sex dizygotic pairs, and 164 mixed-sex DZ twins and their siblings; mean age: 24.4years+/-1.9 SD). All DTI scans were nonlinearly aligned to a geometrically-symmetric, population-based image template. We computed voxel-wise maps of significant asymmetries (left/right differences) for common diffusion measures that reflect fiber integrity (fractional and geodesic anisotropy; FA, GA and mean diffusivity, MD). In quantitative genetic models computed from all same-sex twin pairs (N=210 subjects), genetic factors accounted for 33% of the variance in asymmetry for the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, 37% for the anterior thalamic radiation, and 20% for the forceps major and uncinate fasciculus (all L>R). Shared environmental factors accounted for around 15% of the variance in asymmetry for the cortico-spinal tract (R>L) and about 10% for the forceps minor (L>R). Sex differences in asymmetry (men>women) were significant, and were greatest in regions with prominent FA asymmetries. These maps identify heritable DTI-derived features, and may empower genome-wide searches for genetic polymorphisms that influence brain asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic or 'identical' twins have been widely studied to dissect the relative contributions of genetics and environment in human diseases. In multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune demyelinating disease and common cause of neurodegeneration and disability in young adults, disease discordance in monozygotic twins has been interpreted to indicate environmental importance in its pathogenesis. However, genetic and epigenetic differences between monozygotic twins have been described, challenging the accepted experimental model in disambiguating the effects of nature and nurture. Here we report the genome sequences of one MS-discordant monozygotic twin pair, and messenger RNA transcriptome and epigenome sequences of CD4(+) lymphocytes from three MS-discordant, monozygotic twin pairs. No reproducible differences were detected between co-twins among approximately 3.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or approximately 0.2 million insertion-deletion polymorphisms. Nor were any reproducible differences observed between siblings of the three twin pairs in HLA haplotypes, confirmed MS-susceptibility SNPs, copy number variations, mRNA and genomic SNP and insertion-deletion genotypes, or the expression of approximately 19,000 genes in CD4(+) T cells. Only 2 to 176 differences in the methylation of approximately 2 million CpG dinucleotides were detected between siblings of the three twin pairs, in contrast to approximately 800 methylation differences between T cells of unrelated individuals and several thousand differences between tissues or between normal and cancerous tissues. In the first systematic effort to estimate sequence variation among monozygotic co-twins, we did not find evidence for genetic, epigenetic or transcriptome differences that explained disease discordance. These are the first, to our knowledge, female, twin and autoimmune disease individual genome sequences reported.",

    "abstract": "Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) usually develops within the first few weeks of life and resolves at a median age of 3 months. In most of the cases, TNDM is caused by the over-expression of a paternally expressed imprinted PLAGL1 locus on chromosome 6q24. The most frequent manifestation other than TNDM is intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and in some cases macroglossia. We investigated monozygotic twins who had macroglossia without IUGR. Both of the twins developed insulin-dependent hyperglycemia within the first week of life, which subsequently resolved. DNA profiling with polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed for polymorphic microsatellite markers of chromosome 6. The six informative markers, located between 6p24 and 6q15, showed normal biparental inheritance. However, the six distal informative markers, located between 6q23.2 and the 6q telomeric region, showed the absence of a maternal allele and the presence of a single paternal allele. The monosomy of the 6q telomeric region was not confirmed by chromosome banding showing 46, XX. These findings provide further evidence that partial paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 6 (pUPD6) causes TNDM. The phenotypes other than diabetes observed in patients with partial pUPD6 may differ from those observed in patients with complete pUPD6.",

    "abstract": "Twin and family studies of autistic traits and of cases diagnosed with autism suggest high heritability; however, the heritability of autistic traits in toddlers has not been investigated. Therefore, this study's goals were (1) to screen a statewide twin population using items similar to the six critical social and communication items widely used for autism screening in toddlers (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers); (2) to assess the endorsement rates of these items in a general population; and (3) to determine their heritability.\nParticipants composed a statewide, unselected twin population. Screening items were administered to mothers of 1,211 pairs of twins between 2 and 3 years of age. Twin similarity was calculated via concordance rates and tetrachoric and intraclass correlations, and the contribution of genetic and environmental factors was estimated with single-threshold ordinal models.\nThe population-based twin sample generated endorsement rates on the analogs of the six critical items similar to those reported by the scale's authors, which they used to determine an autism threshold. Current twin similarity and model-fitting analyses also used this threshold. Casewise concordance rates for monozygotic (43%) and dizygotic (20%) twins suggested moderate heritability of these early autism indicators in the general population. Variance component estimates from model-fitting also suggested moderate heritability of categorical scores.\nAutism screener scores are moderately heritable in 2- to 3-year-old twin children from a population-based twin panel. Inferences about sex differences are limited by the scarcity of females who scored above the threshold on the toddler-age screener.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate empirically how and in what way individuals with symptoms of functional somatic syndromes should be classified. We also aimed to look into genetic and environmental influences on the classification.\nA total of 28,531 twins aged 41-64 underwent screening interviews via a computer-assisted data collection system from 1998 to 2002. Nine functional somatic symptoms (abnormal tiredness, general muscular pain, recurrent abdominal discomfort, back pain, gastroesophageal reflux, recurrent headache, recurrent urinary problem, dizziness, breathlessness at rest) were assessed using structured questions in a blinded manner. Latent class analysis was applied to the data. Structural equation modeling was further performed in order to estimate the relative importance of genetic and environmental influences on class probability.\nLatent class analysis resulted in a five-class solution. Individuals in the first class did not show any health problems. Those assigned to the second, third, and fourth classes tended to have abnormal tiredness, gastrointestinal problems, and pain-related symptoms, respectively. Individuals in the fifth class had multiple symptoms to a greater extent than the other classes. All the five classes showed modest genetic influences (7-29% of the total variation) with gender differences except Class 3; however, the majority of influences on the class membership derived from unique environmental effects.\nThe findings suggested the necessity of redefining the existing classification criteria for functional somatic syndromes in terms of single (uncomplicated) or multiple (complicated) syndromes.

    "abstract": "To examine the extent to which genetic factors and shared and non-shared environmental factors are implicated in the development of gambling behaviors and to examine whether there are gender differences in the genetic and environmental contributors to gambling behaviors.\nA genetically informative analysis was performed by using DeFries-Fulker (DF) analysis.\nAnalysis of secondary data drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).\nA total of 324 monozygotic (MZ) twins and 278 same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twins were included in the analysis. Of these twins, there were 150 male MZ twins, 144 male DZ twins, 174 female MZ twins and 134 female DZ twins.\nGambling behavior was measured through eight self-reported questions that tapped a range of items designed to measure problems related to gambling. Self-reported measures of self-control and delinquent involvement were also included to examine the degree to which these factors covaried with gambling behavior.\nThe results of the DF analysis indicated that when male and female twin pairs were analyzed simultaneously, genetic factors explained approximately 70% of the variance in gambling and non-shared environmental factors explained the remaining variance. When gender-specific models were calculated, substantial gender differences emerged. For males, genetic factors explained approximately 85% of the variance in gambling, with the non-shared environment accounting for the remaining variance. For females, genetic factors explained none of the variance in gambling behaviors, while the shared environment explained 45% of the variance and the non-shared environment explained 55% of the variance.\nAnalysis of twins from the Add Health data suggests that there are significant gender differences in the genetic and environmental underpinnings to gambling behaviors.",

    "abstract": "We investigated whether BMI predicts type 2 diabetes in twins and to what extent that is explained by common genetic factors.\nThis was a population-based twin cohort study. Monozygotic (n = 4,076) and dizygotic (n = 9,109) non-diabetic twin pairs born before 1958 answered a questionnaire in 1975, from which BMI was obtained. Information on incident cases of diabetes was obtained by linkage to nationwide registers until 2005.\nAltogether, 1,332 twins (6.3% of men, 5.1% of women) developed type 2 diabetes. The HR for type 2 diabetes increased monotonically with a mean of 1.22 (95% CI 1.20-1.24) per BMI unit and of 1.97 (95% CI 1.87-2.08) per SD of BMI. The HRs for lean, overweight, obese and morbidly obese participants were 0.59, 2.96, 6.80 and 13.64 as compared with normal weight participants. Model heritability estimates for bivariate variance due to an additive genetic component and non-shared environmental component were 75% (men) and 71% (women) for BMI, and 73% and 64%, respectively for type 2 diabetes. The correlations between genetic variance components (r (g)) indicated that one fifth of the covariance of BMI and type 2 diabetes was due to shared genetic influences. Although the mean monozygotic concordance for type 2 diabetes was approximately twice the dizygotic one, age of onset of diabetes within twin pair members varied greatly, irrespective of zygosity.\nA 28-year follow-up of adult Finnish twins showed that despite high trait heritability estimates, only a fraction of covariation in BMI and incident type 2 diabetes was of genetic origin.",

    "abstract": "The main aim of this study was to develop and optimize a questionnaire-based zygosity determination method in Chinese adolescent twins. Participants were 471 pairs of same-sex twins (345 monozygotic, 126 dizygotic) with a mean age of 14.56 years (SD=2.62). A second sample was recruited for cross-validation, including 382 pairs of same-sex twins (261 monozygotic, 121 dizygotic) with a mean age of 12.53 years (SD=2.22). The questionnaire consisted of 12 questions dealing with co-twin similarity or frequency of confusion. Two means were put forward to improve the predictive accuracy of the questionnaire--adding parent-reports to the analysis, and using a 2-point rather than 3-point response format. DNA genotyping was performed on nine short tandem repeat loci, with an estimated zygosity classification accuracy very close to 100%. The validity of all questionnaires was assessed by being compared to the results of DNA analysis. Results of stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the predictive accuracy of the 3-point self-reported questionnaire is 83.8%. Using parent-reports and 2-point scale led to 3.9% and 4.6% increase in predictive accuracy, respectively. When using the parent-reports and children's self-reports jointly, the predictive accuracy was enhanced to 90.6%. For the cross-validation, the equations and cut-offs derived from the first sample led to an acceptable accuracy (91.3%) in the second sample. In conclusion, the method we developed can be used in future studies among Chinese adolescent twins. Multiple-rater and 2-point response format were suggested for all twin studies for enhancing the predictive accuracy of questionnaires.",

    "abstract": "Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and physical abuse (CPA) are well-established risk-factors for a wide of range of proximal and distal outcomes. The lack of availability of an optimal design for examining abuse and its consequences has resulted in the use of various approaches, each having its own limitations. We describe the Childhood Trauma Study, which ascertained families from a large young adult Australian twin cohort on the basis of twins' responses to screening questions assessing CSA and CPA. We report data from 3407 participants including twins, non-twin siblings, and their parents. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of using a comprehensive assessment to evaluate retrospective history of childhood abuse in an adult sample. We observed that risk for each form of abuse increased incrementally with the number of parents with alcohol problems. Psychometric properties of our measures of CSA and CPA including reasonable long-term stability, construct validity, and evidence of familial corroboration compare favorably with those of other reports in which samples were considerably younger and assessments were repeated over shorter intervals.",

    "abstract": "Monocytes in childhood-onset type 1 diabetes show distinct gene expression. We hypothesize that monocyte activation in monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for childhood-onset type 1 diabetes could reflect distinct stages of the disease process including diabetes susceptibility (differences between twins, both diabetic and nondiabetic, and control subjects) and/or disease progression (differences between diabetic and nondiabetic twins).\nWe studied patterns of inflammatory gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes of MZ twin pairs (n = 10 pairs) discordant for childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, normal control twin pairs (n = 10 pairs), and healthy control subjects (n = 51) using quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR). We tested the 24 genes previously observed by whole genome analyses and verified by Q-PCR in autoimmune diabetes and performed a hierarchical cluster analysis.\nOf 24 genes abnormally expressed in childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, we revalidated abnormal expression in 16 of them in diabetic twins including distinct sets of downregulated (P < 0.03) and upregulated (P < 0.02) genes. Of these 16 genes, 13 were abnormally expressed in nondiabetic twins, implicating these genes in diabetes susceptibility (P < 0.044 for all). Cluster analysis of monocyte gene-expression in nondiabetic twins identified two distinct, mutually exclusive clusters, while diabetic twins had a network of positively correlated genes.\nPatients with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes show abnormal monocyte gene-expression levels with an altered gene-expression network due to gene-environment interaction. Importantly, perturbed gene-expression clusters were also detected in nondiabetic twins, implicating monocyte abnormalities in susceptibility to diabetes.",

Of these 16 genes, 13 were abnormally expressed in nondiabetic twins, implicating these genes in diabetes susceptibility (P < 0.044 for all). Cluster analysis of monocyte gene-expression in nondiabetic twins identified two distinct, mutually exclusive clusters, while diabetic twins had a network of positively correlated genes.",

    "abstract": "Preterm birth contributes to a range of healthcare problems amongst infants surmounting to sizeable healthcare costs. Twin pregnancies are at particular risk of preterm birth. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of vaginal progesterone gel for the prevention of preterm birth in twin pregnancies.\nAn economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized placebo controlled trial (the STOPPIT trial) of vaginal progesterone gel for the prevention of preterm birth in twin pregnancies. Five hundred women were recruited from nine maternity hospitals in the United Kingdom. The outcomes of the economic evaluation were presented in terms of net benefit statistics, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, generated using the nonparametric bootstrap method, and the expected value of perfect information.\nMean health service costs between the period of randomization and discharge for mother and infant were 28,031 pound sterling in the progesterone group and 25,972 pound sterling in the placebo group, generating a mean nonsignificant cost difference of 2,059 pound sterling (bootstrap mean cost difference 2,334 pound sterling; 95 percent confidence interval: -5,023 pound sterling, 9,142 pound sterling; p = .33). The probability of progesterone being cost-effective was 20 percent at a willingness to pay threshold of 30,000 pound sterling per preterm birth prevented. There is little economic justification for conducting further research into the use of vaginal progesterone gel in twin pregnancies for the prevention of preterm birth.\nFurther studies of preventive interventions for preterm birth more generally are required given the scale of the clinical and economic burden of this condition. These studies should be sufficiently powered for economic endpoints and extend beyond hospital discharge.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the association between initial subjective effects from cigarettes and the rate of progression from first cigarette to regular smoking. Latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to subjective effects data from 573 offspring of twins ranging in age from 14 to 32 years. LCA revealed four classes: 1) High on both pleasurable and physiological responses, 2) Cough only response, 3) High on physiological, low on pleasurable responses, and 4) High on pleasurable, low on physiological responses. Classes of responses were then used to predict time from first cigarette to the onset of regular smoking in a Cox proportional hazards model. Time-varying covariates representing relevant psychiatric and psychosocial factors as well as dummy variables representing the offspring-of-twins design were included in the model. Members of classes 1 and 4 transitioned more rapidly to regular smoking than the classes characterized as low on the pleasurable response dimension. Our findings provide evidence that previously reported associations between pleasurable initial experiences and progression to regular smoking hold true as well for the rate at which that transition occurs. Furthermore, the fact that profiles of responses did not fall into global categories of exclusively pleasurable vs. exclusively negative (physiological) responses suggests the importance of considering both dimensions in combination to characterize risk for smoking-related outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The tendency to conceive dizygotic (DZ) twins is a complex trait influenced by genetic and environmental factors. To search for new candidate loci for twinning, we conducted a genome-wide linkage scan in 525 families using microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism marker panels.\nNon-parametric linkage analyses, including 523 families containing a total of 1115 mothers of DZ twins (MODZT) from Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) and The Netherlands (NL), produced four linkage peaks above the threshold for suggestive linkage, including a highly suggestive peak at the extreme telomeric end of chromosome 6 with an exponential logarithm of odds [(exp)LOD] score of 2.813 (P = 0.0002). Since the DZ twinning rate increases steeply with maternal age independent of genetic effects, we also investigated linkage including only families where at least one MODZT gave birth to her first set of twins before the age of 30. These analyses produced a maximum expLOD score of 2.718 (P = 0.0002), largely due to linkage signal from the ANZ cohort, however, ordered subset analyses indicated this result is most likely a chance finding in the combined dataset. Linkage analyses were also performed for two large DZ twinning families from the USA, one of which produced a peak on chromosome 2 in the region of two potential candidate genes. Sequencing of FSHR and FIGLA, along with INHBB in MODZTs from two large NL families with family specific linkage peaks directly over this gene, revealed a potentially functional variant in the 5' untranslated region of FSHR that segregated with the DZ twinning phenotype in the Utah family.\nOur data provide further evidence for complex inheritance of familial DZ twinning.",

    "abstract": "Genetic differences have been proposed to play a strong role in risk of death from infectious diseases. The study base of 44,005 included all same-sex twin pairs born in 1870-2001, with both twins alive on January 1, 1943, or those born thereafter. Cause of death was obtained from the Danish Cause of Death Register and was available for 18,359 deaths. The authors classified death due to infections by 3 definitions (narrow, broader, and broadest) and calculated concordance rates for same-sex monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. Heritability was estimated by using structural equation models. When the 3 definitions were applied, 211 (1.1%), 1,089 (5.9%), and 2,907 (15.8%) deaths, respectively, were due to infections. The probandwise concordance rates for monozygotic twin pairs were consistently higher than for dizygotic twin pairs regardless of the definition (9% vs. 0% (P = 0.04), 10% vs. 3% (P < 0.01), and 19% vs. 15% (P = 0.07), respectively). For the broader and broadest definitions, heritability was 40% (95% confidence interval: 12, 50) and 19% (95% confidence interval: 3, 35), respectively. The concordance rates were generally low, and, although a genetic influence on the risk of death from infectious diseases could be demonstrated, the absolute effect of the genetic component on mortality was small.",

    "abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia exhibit decreased neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in peripheral lymphoblasts. Here, we examined this peripheral marker in monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia and in healthy monozygotic twins without psychiatric disorders. B lymphoblasts were stimulated with NRG1a (65 amino-acid residue recombinant protein from the epidermal growth factor [EGF] domain) for 30min. The protein isolated from the cells was analysed by Western blotting. The dependent measure was the ratio of phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) and total AKT at baseline (without NRG1 stimulation) and after NRG1 stimulation (pAKT/AKT). The results revealed that in the case of the unaffected co-twins of patients with schizophrenia, NRG1-stimulated pAKT/AKT ratio was in between the values of their co-twins with schizophrenia and that of the healthy control twin pairs. When the affected twins with schizophrenia were compared with their unaffected co-twins using a Mann-Whitney U-test, we found significantly lower NRG1-induced pAKT/AKT ratios in the patients relative to their unaffected co-twins (p=0.004). However, using a more conservative analysis (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed tests for multiple comparisons), this difference was not significant. The unaffected co-twins of patients with schizophrenia did not differ significantly from the healthy control twins. In the baseline condition, the pAKT/AKT ratios were similar in all groups. These results indicate that impaired AKT-related intracellular signaling is partly related to the developed illness and cannot fully be explained by the genetic background of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this study were to examine the genetic and environmental influences on diurnal preference and sleep quality, the association between these phenotypes, the genetic and environmental influences on this association, and the magnitude of overlap between these influences. Using a twin design, data on diurnal preference (measured by the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire) and sleep quality (measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were collected from 420 monozygotic twins, 773 dizygotic twins, and 329 siblings (mode age = 20 yrs, range = 18-27 yrs) from a population-based twin registry across the UK. Univariate analyses indicated that dominance genetic influence accounted for 52% and non-shared environment 48% of variance in diurnal preference. For sleep quality, additive genetic influence explained 43% and non-shared environment 57% of the variance. The bivariate analysis indicated a significant association between greater eveningness preference and poorer sleep quality (r = .27). There was substantial overlap in the additive genetic influences on both phenotypes (rA = .57), and overlap in the dominance genetic influences common to both phenotypes was almost absolute (rD = .99). Overlap in non-shared environment was much smaller (rE = .02). Additive genetic influence accounted for 2% of the association, dominance genetic influence accounted for 94%, and non-shared environmental influences accounted for the remaining 4%. The substantial overlap in genetic influence between these phenotypes indicates that similar genes are important for diurnal preference and sleep quality. Therefore, those genes already known to influence one phenotype may be possible candidates to explore with regards to the other phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes confer a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer but the incomplete penetrance of these mutations suggests that other genetic and/or environmental factors may modify this risk. We present a family where all affected members carried a mutation in the BRCA1 gene and the index case had suffered from cancer twice in the last 27 years, whereas her monozygotic twin sister, also a carrier of the mutation, remained healthy. As copy number variants (CNVs) contribute to phenotypic diversity, a comparative genomic hybridization array (CGH) was performed to see whether the differences in the CNV profile were a modifier factor of the phenotype in our monozygotic twins. Our results show that differences in the CNVs profile were not the cause of the extremely variable penetrance observed in our MZ twin. The search for an explanation should not therefore be limited to genetic changes at the level of the DNA sequence.",

    "abstract": "We deeply sampled the organismal, genetic, and transcriptional diversity in fecal samples collected from a monozygotic (MZ) twin pair and compared the results to 1,095 communities from the gut and other body habitats of related and unrelated individuals. Using a new scheme for noise reduction in pyrosequencing data, we estimated the total diversity of species-level bacterial phylotypes in the 1.2-1.5 million bacterial 16S rRNA reads obtained from each deeply sampled cotwin to be approximately 800 (35.9%, 49.1% detected in both). A combined 1.1 million read 16S rRNA dataset representing 281 shallowly sequenced fecal samples from 54 twin pairs and their mothers contained an estimated 4,018 species-level phylotypes, with each sample having a unique species assemblage (53.4 +/- 0.6% and 50.3 +/- 0.5% overlap with the deeply sampled cotwins). Of the 134 phylotypes with a relative abundance of >0.1% in the combined dataset, only 37 appeared in >50% of the samples, with one phylotype in the Lachnospiraceae family present in 99%. Nongut communities had significantly reduced overlap with the deeply sequenced twins' fecal microbiota (18.3 +/- 0.3%, 15.3 +/- 0.3%). The MZ cotwins' fecal DNA was deeply sequenced (3.8-6.3 Gbp/sample) and assembled reads were assigned to 25 genus-level phylogenetic bins. Only 17% of the genes in these bins were shared between the cotwins. Bins exhibited differences in their degree of sequence variation, gene content including the repertoire of carbohydrate active enzymes present within and between twins (e.g., predicted cellulases, dockerins), and transcriptional activities. These results provide an expanded perspective about features that make each of us unique life forms and directions for future characterization of our gut ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Imaging genetics is a new field of neuroscience that blends methods from computational anatomy and quantitative genetics to identify genetic influences on brain structure and function. Here we analyzed brain MRI data from 372 young adult twins to identify cortical regions in which gray matter volume is influenced by genetic differences across subjects. Thickness maps, reconstructed from surface models of the cortical gray/white and gray/CSF interfaces, were smoothed with a 25 mm FWHM kernel and automatically parcellated into 34 regions of interest per hemisphere. In structural equation models fitted to volume values at each surface vertex, we computed components of variance due to additive genetic (A), shared (C) and unique (E) environmental factors, and tested their significance. Cortical regions in the vicinity of the perisylvian language cortex, and at the frontal and temporal poles, showed significant additive genetic variance, suggesting that volume measures from these regions may provide quantitative phenotypes to narrow the search for quantitative trait loci that influence brain structure.",

    "abstract": "Cephalothoracopagus is the less common type of conjoined twins (CTs) with an incidence estimated at one in three million births or one in 58 conjoined twins. Maternal gene Vg1, a member of the TGF-beta family of cell-signalling molecules which are implicated in dorsoanterior development, and specific actions of Hox and Pax genes that are implicated in very early embryogenesis may be identified as aetiologic factors.\nA prenatal diagnosis of cephalothoracopagus CTs diagnosed at 17 weeks in a woman undergoing amniocentesis for advanced maternal age is reported.\nAlthough first-trimester diagnosis of CTs is feasible and has been reported as early as 8 weeks's gestation, CTs may be misdiagnosed with monoamniotic twins, lymphangioma, teratoma, and/or neoplasm and may be undiagnosed until early second trimester. Three-dimensional and color Doppler ultrasound enabled precise prenatal visualization of the fusion site. Ultrafast MR imaging should be considered an adjunct to ultrasound for antenatal characterization of structural anomalies and for planning surgical separation in selected cases. Echocardiography is mandatory in all cases of CTs as congenital heart defects are seen in 20-30% and polyhydramnios in 50-75%. Neural tube and midline fusion defects, diaphragmatic hernia, and imperforate anus are the frequently associated abnormalities.

    "abstract": "Pediatric trigger thumb is an uncommon condition with a calculated incidence of 3 per 1000 live births or less. Some reports have suggested a congenital etiology while others could not find a single case of pediatric trigger thumb at birth. This article reports the occurrence of bilateral trigger thumbs in identical twins, age 3 years and 9 months, affecting their thumbs to similar extents, which may suggest a congenital etiology.Congenital etiology for trigger thumb has been proposed for many reasons: occurrence in infants, occurrence in twins, occasional bilaterality, possible presence of triggering at birth, and absence of history of trauma. The occurrence of pediatric trigger thumb in twins has been reported 3 times in the literature; all reported cases were bilateral, as in our case.The mean age at presentation of pediatric trigger thumb is 2 years. The thumb is usually held in a fixed flexion position (mimicking a fracture). Examination usually reveals a palpable nodule in the flexor pollicis longus tendon at the metacarpal joint. This is an important clinical sign. Triggering in children, however, is rare. Macroscopically, there is a nodular thickening of the tendon itself. Pathological changes can be found in the tendon, tendon sheath, or both. A specimen taken from one of the nodules in our case showed degenerative changes while those from both pulleys were normal.Pediatric trigger thumb responds predictably to A1 pulley release, preferably before age 4 years, although milder cases may resolve spontaneously.",

At ages 7-8, parents and teachers completed questionnaires on social and nonsocial autistic-like features and parents completed the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test. Correlations between prenatal and neonatal events and autistic-like features were weak, both in the whole sample (r = .00-.07) and at the 5% quantitative extreme (phenotypic group correlations = .01-.11), after controlling for socioeconomic status and cognitive ability. Neonatal problems showed modest heritability (13%-14%) and significant shared and nonshared environmental influences (55%-59% and 28%-31%, respectively). Differences in identical twins' neonatal problems correlated weakly with their difference scores on autistic-like features (r = .01-.06).",

    "abstract": "Surgical separation of conjoined twins that results in the death of one of the twins raises complex moral, ethical and legal issues. Of particular concern is the potential for homicide charges against doctors. In two recent cases, one in England and one in Queensland, judges declared the surgery to be lawful but the legal reasoning employed is problematical and may be difficult to apply to future conjoined twins cases, such as infant twins where one is not fully developed, or where it is proposed to separate adult twins. A determination of the threshold issue of whether there are two individual persons capable of being killed may require a reconsideration of existing legal definitions and statutory provisions. Similarly, the excuses and justifications for homicide may need to be clarified or reviewed in the context of separation of conjoined twins.",

The authors examined the contributions of internal resources (mother's attachment style, mental health, sociodemographic characteristics), external resources (perceived maternal grandmother's support, mother's marital adaptation), and features of the event itself (infant temperament, additional stressful life events, mother's feelings toward her baby or babies) in proximity to the birth, to personal growth 1 year following the birth. Although mothers of preterm twins reported the highest level of negative feelings toward their infants and the lowest level of mental health, they also experienced the greatest personal growth. Younger age and lower level of education, along with higher perceived support from maternal grandmothers contributed to higher personal growth. It seems that in the wake of stress, even mothers who display lower personal resources can rely on their environmental resources and experience personal growth.",

    "abstract": "to analyze the occurrence of conjoined twins at a tertiary perinatology reference university hospital over a period of 25 years (January 1982 to January 2007) and to describe the successful separation of one of the pairs.\nwe consulted retrospectively the database of the University Hospital of the Medical School of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, in order to determine the number of pairs of conjoined twins, their frequency, classification, gender, type of pregnancy resolution, attempted surgical separation, prenatal diagnosis and survival.\nwe detected 14 pairs of conjoined twins (1/22,284 live births and 1/90 pairs of twin live births) born during this period (six males, seven females and one of indeterminate sex). The prenatal diagnosis was performed in all twins and all births were accomplished by cesarean section. The separation was possible in only one pair, which survives in excellent health conditions after eight years. Of the remaining 13, ten died on the day of birth and three survived only a few months (less than one year).\nAlthough our study revealed an abnormally high number of conjoined twins, this is a rare phenomenon, with a poor perinatal prognosis depending on the organs shared by the twins and associated malformations, especially those related to the fetal heart. Due to the poor prognosis of these pairs and to the maternal reproductive impairment caused by the need to perform body cesareans, we suggest that, based on these numbers, early interruption of these pregnancies be legally granted, as in the case of other diseases incompatible with fetal survival outside the uterus. Thus, the confirmation of a diagnosis of conjoined twins and the resolution of pregnancy should be performed at a tertiary obstetric and perinatal care center, and an authorization for the interruption of pregnancy should be obtained by judicial means.",

It is evident that twin parenthood is the main factor impairing the mental health in parents with ART twins. This aspect should be taken into account when counseling the couples and deciding the number of embryos for transfer in ART. Well conducted prospective longitudinal studies are needed on both maternal and paternal mental health with twins conceived via ART from transition to parenthood to and beyond toddler age covering later life with school-aged and adolescent twins.",

The role of prenatal maternal expectations in the prediction of maternal stress was examined, as well as the mediating and moderating effect of coping resources on the association between pregnancy-type group and maternal stress.\nMothers of twins from various regions in Israel were included in this prospective and cross-sectional study in which 88 mothers of IVF-conceived twins and 98 mothers of spontaneously conceived twins were interviewed twice. First, at 33-36 weeks of their pregnancy they completed a socio-demographic questionnaire and the maternal expectations questionnaire; then at 6 months after birth they completed a questionnaire regarding the delivery and medical condition of the infants, and their coping resources and maternal stress.\nCompared with mothers who conceived spontaneously, IVF mothers had more positive prenatal maternal expectations, but poorer coping resources and higher levels of maternal stress 6 months after birth. Maternal expectations had no predictive power regarding maternal stress, although the mother's coping resources were significantly related to maternal stress and mediated the association between pregnancy type and maternal stress.\nIVF-pregnant women bearing twins should be considered a high-risk group. Early identification of these mothers is essential for timely psychosocial interventions in order to enhance their resources and decrease maternal stress. Further longitudinal studies are required to determine causality in more ethnically-diverse mothers of twins.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the ultimate causes of co-variation between symptoms of four common DSM-IV anxiety dimensions - Generalized Anxiety, Panic, Social Phobia and Separation Anxiety disorder - assessed with the Italian version of the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders questionnaire in a sample of 378 twin pairs aged 8-17 from the population-based Italian Twin Register. Genetic and environmental proportions of covariance between the targeted anxiety dimensions were estimated by multivariate twin analyses. Genetic influences (explaining from 58% to 99% of covariance) and unique environmental factors were the sole sources of co-variation for all phenotypes under study. Genetic influences associated with different anxiety dimensions coincide remarkably, as indicated by genetic correlations ranging from 0.40 to 0.61, while unique environmental overlap is less substantial. Thus, while additive genetic effects are important in explaining why children report symptoms from multiple anxiety disorders, environmental idiosyncratic factors seem to play a marginal role in shaping the co-occurrence of different anxiety dimensions in childhood.",

However, once efficacy has been demonstrated in relatively brief trials, it may not be possible to conduct long-term placebo-controlled trials, for ethical or practical reasons. This paper presents a method for estimating long-term effects of a treatment from a placebo-controlled trial in which some participants originally randomized to active-treatment volunteer to continue on treatment during an extension study, but follow-up of participants originally assigned to placebo ends with the trial, or they are crossed over to active treatment during the extension. We propose using data from the trial to project the outcomes for a 'virtual twin' for each active-treatment volunteer under the counterfactual placebo condition, and using bootstrap methods for inference. The proposed method is validated using simulation, and applied to data from the Fracture Intervention Trial and its extension, FLEX.",

    "abstract": "It is often assumed that differences in teacher characteristics are a major source of variability in children's educational achievements. We examine this assumption for early literacy achievement by calculating the correlations between pairs of twin children who either share or do not share a teacher in kindergarten, Grade 1, and Grade 2. Teacher effects, or more strictly classroom effects, would show up as higher correlations for same- than different-class twin pairs. Same-class correlations were generally higher than different-class correlations, though not significantly so on most occasions. On the basis of the results we estimate that the maximum variance accounted for by being assigned to same or different classrooms is 8%. This is an upper-bound figure for a teacher effect because factors other than teachers may contribute to variation attributable to classroom assignment. We discuss the limitations of the study and draw out some of its educational implications.",

The discordance between urine and meconium could be explained by the differences in detection window, threshold concentration and screening technology, and the discordance between dizygotic twin meconium samples could be explained by the differences in drug diffusion and placental and fetal biotransformation of drugs. The meconium sample of one twin screened negative for benzodiazepines was reported positive in the confirmation assay with higher sensitivity and a lower cut-off concentration. Negative screening results of drugs of abuse should be interpreted with caution, taking into account matrix type, reactivity of drugs in the assay and cut-off concentration. If screening results are inconsistent with each other or with the clinical scenario, confirmation testing using more sensitive and specific methods with lower cut-offs is warranted.",

Both maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity are increased in twin pregnancies when compared with singletons. A systematic and detailed first-trimester ultrasound can be a useful tool for detecting chorionicity, growth discordance, and congenital malformations.

The patients were examined clinically, biochemically and with imaging methods. The genetic and environmental contribution to their pathology was noted.

We report on monozygotic twins (MZTs) discordant for phacomatosis cesioflammea (PPV type II) providing evidence for the mechanism of twin spotting in the development of PPV. The affected twin had a nevus flammeus on the right arm and the right maxilla, and a pigmented area on the trunk in keeping with a persistent, aberrant Mongolian spot. The affected twin had bilateral ocular melanocytosis with abnormal scleral pigmentation, iris mamillations, increased pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork, and increased fundal pigmentation and secondary glaucoma. DNA testing confirmed monozygosity. This case of MZTs discordant for PPV supports the hypothesis that PPV results from mosaicism due to a post-zygotic mutational event and the concept of twin spotting.",

    "abstract": "We present monozygotic twins discordant for the autosomal dominant disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The affected twin was diagnosed with NF1 at age 12, based upon accepted clinical criteria for the disorder. Both twins were re-examined at ages 35 and 57, at which times the unaffected twin continued to show no clinical manifestations of NF1. Short tandem repeat marker (STR) genotyping at 10 loci on chromosome 17 and 10 additional loci dispersed across the genome revealed identical genotypes for the twins, confirming their monozygosity. The affected twin has three children, two of whom also have NF1, while the unaffected twin has two children, both unaffected. Using lymphoblastoid, fibroblast, and buccal cell samples collected from both twins and from other family members in three generations, we discovered a pathogenic nonsense mutation in exon 40 of the NF1 gene. This mutation was found in all cell samples from the affected twin and her affected daughter, and in lymphoblastoid and buccal cells but not fibroblasts from the unaffected twin. We also found a novel non-synonymous change in exon 16 of the NF1 gene that was transmitted from the unaffected mother to both twins and co-segregated with the pathogenic mutation in the ensuing generation. All cells from the twins were heterozygous for this apparent exon 16 polymorphism and for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 2.5 kb flanking the site of the exon 40 nonsense mutation. This suggests that the NF1 gene of the unaffected twin differed in the respective lymphoblastoid cells and fibroblasts only at the mutation site itself, making post-zygotic mutation leading to mosaicism the most likely mechanism of phenotypic discordance. Although the unaffected twin is a mosaic, the distribution of the mutant allele among different cells and tissues appears to be insufficient to cause overt clinical manifestations of NF1.",

The risk for preterm delivery before 32 weeks of gestation was significantly increased among dizygotic twin pairs born after IVF compared with non-IVF dizygotic twin pairs. No significant difference in low birthweight or birthweight difference within twin pairs was seen. There was an increased occurrence of twin pairs with respiratory problems or jaundice, but only the latter diagnosis occurred in a statistically significant excess.\nThe study confirms recent findings that IVF is associated with an increased risk for some neonatal complications, not only among singletons but also among twins.",

    "abstract": "The causes of correlation between parental treatment and offspring behavior are ambiguous since genetic and social factors are correlated in typical family studies. The problem is complicated by the need to characterize the effects of genes and environment on both juvenile and adult behavioral outcomes. A model is developed for the resemblance between juvenile and adult twins and their parents that allows some of these effects to be resolved. Data on childhood adversity, parental anti-social behavior, and longitudinal adult and juvenile anti-social behavior were obtained from 1,412 families of adolescent and young adult twins. A structural model is fitted that allows for the effects of genetic and social transmission of information from parents to children. Environmental effects of parents may be mediated through measured features of the home environment. Parameters were estimated by diagonal weighted least squares applied to the 33 distinct polychoric correlations between relatives and between variables within and between ages. Sub-hypotheses were tested. Results confirmed that effects of genes and environment were both highly significant. Genetic effects were large in juveniles and largely age and sex-specific. Approximately 30% of the variation due to the shared environment was due to the effect of childhood adversity. The remaining shared environmental effects are unexplained. Adversity is affected significantly by maternal anti-social behavior. The correlation between paternal ASP and adversity may be explained by antisocial fathers selecting (or creating) antisocial mothers. All significant environmental effects of parental ASP are mediated through the measure of adversity. Though transmission of ASP is both genetic and social, passive genotype-environment correlation is very small. Assortative mating for ASP has barely detectable consequence for the genetic correlation between siblings. The longitudinal study of twins and their parents makes it possible to demonstrate there is a direct causal effect of childhood adversity on child conduct disorder over and above any indirect genetic correlation.",

    "abstract": "Despite the increased risk of depression and conduct problems in children of depressed parents, the mechanism by which parental depression affects their children's behavioral and emotional functioning is not well understood. The present study was undertaken to determine whether parental depression represents a genuine environmental risk factor in children's psychopathology, or whether children's depression/conduct can be explained as a secondary consequence of the genetic liability transmitted from parents to their offspring.\nChildren of Twins (COT) data collected on 2,674 adult female and male twins, their spouses, and 2,940 of their children were used to address whether genetic and/or family environmental factors best account for the association between depression in parents and depression and conduct problems in their children. Data collected on juvenile twins from the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development (VTSABD) were also included to estimate child-specific genetic and environmental influences apart from those effects arising from the transmission of the parental depression itself. The fit of alternative Children of Twin models were evaluated using the statistical program Mx.\nThe most compelling model for the association between parental and juvenile depression was a model of direct environmental risk. Both family environmental and genetic factors accounted for the association between parental depression and child conduct disturbance.\nThese findings illustrate how a genetically mediated behavior such as parental depression can have both an environmental and genetic impact on children's behavior. We find developmentally specific genetic factors underlying risk to juvenile and adult depression. A shared genetic liability influences both parental depression and juvenile conduct disturbance, implicating child conduct disturbance (CD) as an early indicator of genetic risk for depression in adulthood. In summary, our analyses demonstrate differences in the impact of parental depression on different forms of child psychopathology, and at various stages of development.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined the phenotypic and genetic relationship between fluency and non-fluency-based measures of reading and mathematics performance. Participants were drawn from the Western Reserve Reading and Math Project, an ongoing longitudinal twin project of same-sex MZ and DZ twins from Ohio. The present analyses are based on tester-administered measures available from 228 twin pairs (age M=9.86 years). Measurement models suggested that four factors represent the data, namely Decoding, Fluency, Comprehension, and Math. Subsequent quantitative genetic analyses of these latent factors suggested that a single genetic factor accounted for the covariance among these four latent factors. However, there were also unique genetic effects on Fluency and Math, independent from the common genetic factor. Thus, although there is a significant genetic overlap among different reading and math skills, there may be independent genetic sources of variation related to measures of decoding fluency and mathematics.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the incidence of cerebral injury as detected by postnatal brain scan in monochorionic twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction. Having excluded cases complicated with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and one co-twin suffering intrauterine fetal death, a total of 73 monochorionic twin pregnancies divided into absence (group I, n = 46) or presence (group II, n = 27) of selective intrauterine growth restriction. Mild cerebral injury was defined as presenting one of the following abnormal cranial scan findings: intraventricular hemorrhage grade I, grade II, lenticulostiate vasculopathy and/or subependymal pseudocysts, while severe cerebral injury was defined as presenting intraventricular hemorrhage grade III, grade IV, cystic periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) grade II or higher, porencephalic cysts, and/or ventricular dilatation. The incidence of mild cerebral injury was not significantly different between these two groups (eight cases in group I and six cases in group II). Except for one case that later developed a seizure, the majority (13 out of 14) of cases with minor brain scan anomalies were only transient, without significant clinical impact. There was only one case diagnosed with a major brain scan anomaly (periventricular leukomalacia) in group II. One severe brain injury and three neonatal deaths all belonged to group II with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler in the growth restricted twin. In conclusion, the incidence of severe cerebral injury in monochorionic twin pregnancies with selective intrauterine growth restriction was low, at 3.7%.",

    "abstract": "This study reports on the inter- and intrarater reliability of physical features observation. Study subjects were 176 Chinese adult persons, consisting of 89 males and 87 females. Three trained research assistants responded simultaneously and respectively to 12 items regarding the subject's physical features including 'hair', 'Mongoloid folds', left and right 'ear lobes', 'earwax', 'nostril shape', 'tongue rolling', left and right 'hitchhiker's thumb', 'mid-digital hair' and left and right 'simian crease' at the moment of interview. And 14 days later, these subjects received the same observation once again. The results showed that the inter- and intra-observer agreements of 'hair', 'earwax', 'tongue rolling', 'mid-digital hair' and 'simian crease' were almost perfect with most kappa (kappa) coefficients >or= .80, while 'Mongoloid fold' and 'nostril shape' showed poor inter-observer agreement and 'nostril shape' showed poor intra-observer agreement (kappa < .40). Two other physical features, 'hitchhiker's thumb' and 'ear lobes' showed moderate inter-observer agreement and three features, 'hitchhiker's thumb', 'ear lobes' and 'Mongoloid fold', showed moderate intra-observer agreement (.40<or= kappa <.80). In conclusion, this study suggests that as far as reliability is concerned, the five features which were 'hair', 'earwax', 'tongue rolling', 'mid-digital hair' and 'simian crease' could be considered in zygosity determination of Chinese adult twins, while the two features, 'Mongoloid fold' and 'nostril shape', should be abandoned.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are associated with disturbed fetal growth and a higher risk of low birthweight (LBW), which is one of the most important determinants of perinatal morbidity and mortality in Africa. In this study, we compare anthropometric measurements in Sudanese twins and their mothers with singletons.\nIn 1000 Sudanese mothers with singleton births and 30 mothers with twins, maternal (weight, height, mid-arm circumference) and 11 newborn anthropometric measurements were taken within 24 hours of delivery. Maternal education and socio-economic status were additionally recorded.\nMothers of twins had a significantly higher body weight (p = .045) and lean body mass (p = .02) after delivery, and were from higher social classes in general (p = .014). In addition to gestational age, twins displayed a statistically significant reduction in all anthropometric data, compared to singletons, mainly in terms of birth-weight, chest and head circumference, whereas differences in triceps and subscapular skin fold thickness and ponderal index were distinctly lower. The LBW rate in twins was markedly higher than that in singletons (43.3% vs. 8.3%, p < .001). In 20 out of 30 twins (66.7%), Twin A weighed more than Twin B (difference (SD) of 443 (335) g), and in the remaining 10 cases (33.7%), the weight of Twin B was equal to or more than that of twin A (difference (SD) of 211 (240) g, p = .039). In unlike-sex pairs, the mean (SD) difference between Twins A and B in birthweight was 459 (481) g, which was distinctly higher, compared to same-sex pairs (boys, 180 (325) g and girls, 36 (413) g).\nSudanese twins displayed significantly reduced anthropometric measurements compared to singletons, but to different degrees. Gender had a higher impact on birthweight in twins than in singletons.",

    "abstract": "Depression and reduced heart rate variability (HRV) are predictors of coronary artery disease (CAD), and highly correlated with each other. However, little is known to what extend this correlation can be explained by common genetic components. We examined 198 middle-aged male twins (121 monozygotic and 77 dizygotic) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Current depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II and HRV was assessed on 24-hour electrocardiographic Holter recordings. Five frequency domain variables were used, including ultra low frequency (ULF), very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and total power (TPow). Structural equation modeling was used to estimate shared genetic effects for depressive symptoms and the HRV frequency domains. Both depressive symptoms (h(2)=.5) and all measurements of HRV showed high heritability (h(2)=.43-.63). A significant inverse correlation was found between depressive symptoms and all HRV indices except LF and HF, with the highest coefficient (r) for TPow (r = -.24, P = .01) and ULF (r = -.24, P = .01). Bivariate genetic modeling revealed significant genetic correlations between depressive symptoms and TPow (r(A) = -.21, P = .04), as well as ULF (r(A) = -.23, P = .02). Of the total covariance between depressive symptoms and these two HRV indices, over 80% was due to the same genetic factors. In conclusion, depressive symptoms are associated with decreased HRV and this association is due, in large part, to a shared genetic effect. These results suggest that a common neurobiological dysfunction links depression and autonomic dysregulation.",

    "abstract": "In a Children of Twins (COT) design, the environmental and genetic risk of a child is, in part, dependent upon the status of the father and the father's cotwin. The logic of the COT method breaks down if the zygosity of the twin pair is confounded with the environment provided to the child (a version of the Equal Environment Assumption, EEA). If MZ twin fathers see each other more often than DZ twin fathers, and a child's uncle is the affected twin in discordant pairs, this could increase the environmental risk of children of MZ over that of DZ discordant twins. The current study was designed to test the EEA in the COT design, specifically in children of alcohol and drug dependent fathers. Results indicated that MZ twins did have more contact than DZ twins. Regression analyses were conducted to predict child externalizing symptom counts from father's zygosity group status, level of contact with father's cotwin, and their interaction. Results found no significant interaction between father's zygosity and the higher level of cotwin contact (seen in MZ twins) in predicting several measures of offspring externalizing risk. The results of this study suggested that the COT design does not confound zygosity with differences in environmental risk exposure, findings that support the validity of the EEA within this research context.",

    "abstract": "A twin study is an excellent means of assessing the contribution of heritability to motor behaviour. We present a movement video-analysis of a monozygotic twins pair with a motor repertoire which is almost totally constituted by persistent and subcontinuous motor stereotypies.\nThe specific aim of this study is to verify the heritable quantum of motor behaviour and to determine which among the motor patterns we analysed are more likely to be conditioned by inheritance.\nStereotyped movements were videotaped in two standardized sessions: at rest and in relation to preordained sensory stimulations. We estimated the concordance index (CI) between the observers to evaluate the reliability of the observations. The validity was accepted as being CI>0.80.\nThe results showed a very high concordance rate (>90%) for all the stereotypies analysed. An almost superimposable trend of the stereotyped movements was found both at rest and in relation to the sensory stimulations.\nSuch strong data suggest that genetic factors have a primary influence on all the movement disorders analysed. This study contributes to a better understanding of the complex relationships between genes and functions.",

    "abstract": "We report an interesting case of a free peritoneal cyst in a woman pregnant with twins. As far as we know, a cyst with histologic properties similar to the metaplastic stratified squamous epithelium of the amnion has not been reported. A 20-year-old Japanese woman pregnant with twins underwent cesarean section at 29 weeks of gestation. A simple serous cyst 5 cm in diameter was found at excavatio vesicouterina. The cyst was not attached to the surrounding organs, and was located independent of any other tissues in the patient's abdominal cavity. Histologic examination revealed that the cyst wall was composed of three major layers (epithelium, mesenchyme and mesothelium) with no vessels. Immunohistochemical staining with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), cytokeratins, vimentin, placental alkaline phosphatase (PAP) and cluster of differentiation (CD) 31, showed that the cyst wall had characteristic features of the amniotic membrane. Alleles of the patient's husband were not identified when the cyst was genotyped. Some of the patient's loci were deleted and others showed a structurally heterogeneous pattern. These findings suggest that the cyst was derived not from the ovum parthenogenesis, but from the patient's somatic cells and could have been incubated by ascites.",

    "abstract": "Genetics in the post-genomic period is shifting from structural to functional genetics or genomics. Meanwhile, the use of twins is largely expanding from traditional heritability estimation for disease phenotypes to the study of both diseases and various molecular phenotypes, such as the regulatory phenotypes in functional genomics concerning gene expression and regulation, by engaging both classical twin design and marker-based gene mapping techniques in genetic epidemiology. New research designs have been proposed for making novel uses of twins in studying the molecular basis in the epigenetics of human diseases. Besides, twins not only serve as ideal samples for disease gene mapping using conventional genetic markers but also represent an excellent model for associating DNA copy number variations, a structural genetic marker, with human diseases. It is believed that, with the rapid development in biotechniques and new advances in bioinformatics, the unique samples of twins will make new contributions to our understanding of the nature and nurture in complex disease development and in human health. This paper aims at summarizing the new uses of twins in current genetic studies and suggesting novel proposes together with useful design and analytical strategies.",

    "abstract": "Monoamniotic twin pregnancies are necessarily monochorionic and are defined by the development of two fetuses in a single amniotic cavity. This pregnancy is the result of a division of the egg between the 8th and 13th day after fertilization. The diagnosis can and should be performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. Apart from the small risk of fetal transfusion syndrome, the specificities of these pregnancies are linked to greater risk of perinatal mortality, malformations, prematurity and the persistent risk of entanglement cords until birth. Intensified obstetrical monitoring eventually requiring hospitalization followed by a premature birth around 34 SA is recommended to improve perinatal outcomes with a reduction in prenatal mortality. Reorientation toward a neonatal Level III, the proposal of a systematic course of corticosteroids and elective delivery once lung maturation is achieved are recommended. There is not enough argument to recommend specific delivery mode, although cesarean section is performed by most authors to reduce the funicular risks.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the duration of breastfeeding and the impact of maternal factors for cessation of breastfeeding in twin infants, the authors undertook a population-based cohort study. Breastfeeding data obtained from Child Health Centres were matched with data on infant and maternal demographics from Swedish national registers. A total of 1.657 twins were included, of whom 695 were born preterm. Breastfeeding frequencies in preterm twins were 79% at 2 months, 58% at 4 months, 39% at 6 months, 14% at 9 months, and 6% at 12 months. In term twins, the corresponding frequencies were 84%, 63%, 45%, 18%, and 6%, respectively. In both preterm and term mothers, mothers who had a lower educational level or smoked at first antenatal care visit were subject to earlier cessation of breastfeeding by 6 months of age. In addition, in mothers of term infants, mothers who were < 23 years old or primiparous had a higher risk for cessation of breastfeeding before 6 months. Thus, mothers of twins have a good potential to breastfeed, but additional support is needed for those more susceptible to early cessation of breastfeeding.",

    "abstract": "Genetic predisposition to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has been linked to disorders such as von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. While twin research is a classic approach for elucidating genetic and environmental contributions to disease, no monozygotic twin-pair concordant for ccRCC in the absence of VHL syndrome has been previously reported in the literature or in major twin registries.\nWe describe a unique monozygotic twin-pair concordant for ccRCC, with discordant but early ages of onset of 25 and 38 respectively. Cytogenetic studies and direct sequencing for VHL gene mutations in the second twin proved unremarkable.\nThis is the fi rst reported case of monozygotic twins concordant for ccRCC in the absence of VHL gene mutation. The early yet discordant, age of onset of disease in both twins suggests both genetic and environmental contributions to ccRCC.",

    "abstract": "A human being born without heart and head, i.e., the acardius/acranius malformation, has been described since antiquity. Superstition and fear made it a mystical disorder, a sign of God's wrath. The inquisition ruled that acranic infants should not be baptized and located the soul in the brain. Acardia was not associated with twin gestation until the reports of Mery in 1720 and Winslow in 1740. In 1850, Meckel identified the pathogenetic mechanism as reversed perfusion due to large arterio-arterial and veno-venous anastomoses; he believed the heart would fail to develop or arrest during development, and the acardiac fetus would be maintained by arterial perfusion from the pump twin. In 1859, Claudius articulated that after normal initial development, the heart degenerates when reversed flow in the aorta leads to thrombosis. Today, it is assumed that both mechanisms may exist. With the advent of prenatal ultrasound diagnosis and radiofrequency ablation of the acardiac twin's circulation, it became possible to save the pump twin.",

    "abstract": "About 10% of twins are born before 32 weeks of gestation and very preterm birth rates are increasing. Preterm twins tend to have more favourable outcomes than singletons of the same gestational age, but fewer data are available for very preterm infants. This study aims to determine whether outcomes differ between very preterm twins and singletons.\nThis study was of a population-based cohort of very preterm babies in 10 European regions in 2003. Mortality and morbidity to discharge from hospital were compared for twins and singletons between 24 and 31 weeks of gestation, who were alive at the onset of labour and without lethal congenital anomalies. Clinical characteristics, pregnancy complications and healthcare factors were taken into consideration.\nBetween 28 and 31 weeks of gestation, mortality and oxygen dependency at 36 corrected weeks of gestation were lower for twins than singletons (3.9 versus 6.5% and 7.1 versus 10.4%, respectively), but this advantage disappeared after controlling for medical and healthcare factors. Hypertension, growth restriction and haemorrhaging were less frequent complications of twin birth and more twins received antenatal corticosteroids and were born in level III units. In contrast, between 24 and 27 weeks of gestation, twins had higher adjusted risks of mortality and Grade III/IV intraventricular haemorrhaging [adjusted ORs 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.2) and 1.5 (1.0-2.1)]. These adverse outcomes were concentrated among twins from same sex pairs with discordant birthweights.\nBetween 24 and 27 weeks of gestation, risks of mortality and severe cranial haemorrhaging were higher for twins than singletons if they were from same sex pairs with discordant birthweights.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the association of restrained eating with BMI and weight gain while controlling for the influence of genes and shared environment. Participants were 1,587 twins enrolled in the University of Washington Twin Registry (UWTR). Restrained eating was assessed by the Herman and Polivy Restraint Scale. Height and weight were self-reported on two occasions. Analyses used generalized estimating equations or multiple linear regression techniques. Restraint Scale scores were positively associated with both BMI (adjusted beta = 0.39 kg/m(2); 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.34-0.44; P < 0.001) and weight gain (adjusted beta = 0.33 pounds; 95% CI = 0.17-0.49; P < 0.001). High Restraint Scale scorers had an adjusted mean BMI of 27.9 kg/m(2) (95% CI = 27.4-28.4) as compared to intermediate (mean = 25.5 kg/m(2); 95% CI = 25.2-25.8) and low scorers (mean = 23.0 kg/m(2); 95% CI = 22.7-23.3). In within-pair analyses among 598 same-sex twin pairs, the adjusted association between Restraint Scale scores and BMI persisted even when genetic and shared environmental factors were controlled for (adjusted beta = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.12-0.24; P < 0.001), as did the association with weight gain (adjusted beta = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.13-0.61; P = 0.003). In stratified analyses, dizygotic (DZ) twins differed more in BMI for a given difference in the Restraint Scale score than monozygotic (MZ) twins, for whom genetics are 100% controlled (adjusted beta = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.20-0.44 vs. adjusted beta = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.04-0.16; P = 0.001 for test of interaction). These data demonstrate that observed relationships between BMI, weight gain, and restrained eating, as assessed by the Restraint Scale, have a strong environmental influence and are not solely due to shared genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Among Finnish adolescent twins, we compared (a) a model that describes a direct impact of liability to tobacco use on cannabis and other illicit drug use with (b) a model that included a shared underlying liability for these substances. Furthermore, the extent to which genetic and environmental influences contribute to the covariation between liabilities to use these substances was examined.\nTobacco and illicit drug use were assessed at age 17.5 years. Twin data on 3,744 individuals were analyzed using standard biometrical methods. Two alternative multivariate models were fi t and compared with Mx, a statistical program for genetic model fitting.\nThe multivariate model, including a direct impact of the initiation of tobacco use on illicit drug use, provided the best fit to the data. In this model, the total variation in the initiation of illicit drugs was decomposed to genetic factors (32%), common environmental factors (20%), unique environmental factors (8%), and a component due to initiation of smoking (40%). Most variation in the progression of illicit drug use was the result of initiation of smoking and illicit drug use (83%).\nLiability to initiate smoking directly affects illicit drug use in our best-fitting model. Our findings suggest that several common genetic influences may be related to tobacco use and illicit drugs but that a search for specific genes underlying illicit drug use is justifi ed as well. Such specific genes may hold a key to understanding biological vulnerabilities that lead to illicit drug use, which could aid in the development of targeted interventions.",

    "abstract": "The sonographic analysis of amniotic fluid in twin pregnancies can be complex and difficult, particularly when one twin has oligohydramnios or anhydramnios. This article describes a pitfall, the \"amniotic wrinkle,\" which can lead to the erroneous impression that both twins have adequate fluid when one actually has little or none.\nSonograms of twin pregnancies in which the sonographer's initial assessment was of adequate fluid for each twin but imaging by the author on the same day showed one twin to have oligohydramnios were analyzed to identify recurring image patterns related to the intertwin membrane that may create this misleading impression.\nWith oligohydramnios of one twin, the intertwin membrane may become redundant, folding on itself, creating an amniotic wrinkle: a short linear structure extending perpendicularly away from the twin with decreased amniotic fluid in toward the amniotic space of the other twin. A variation of this occurs when this fetus moves an extremity into the fold, with the two layers of the fold apposing each other between the limb and torso or between two limbs. An additional pattern is also described: an intrauterine sling or \"cocoon\" in which a fetus appears to be suspended within the amniotic space of the other twin.\nTo avoid pitfalls in assessing amniotic fluid for twins, the intertwin membrane should be shown in every image that is used to document fluid ascribed to each twin, and images at right angles to the initial image can help identify an amniotic wrinkle.",

    "abstract": "Twins provide a unique capacity to explore relative genetic and environmental contributions to brain development, but results are applicable to non-twin populations only to the extent that twin and singleton brains are alike. A reason to suspect differences is that as a group twins are more likely than singletons to experience adverse prenatal and perinatal events that may affect brain development. We sought to assess whether this increased risk leads to differences in child or adolescent brain anatomy in twins who do not experience behavioral or neurological sequelae during the perinatal period. Brain MRI scans of 185 healthy pediatric twins (mean age = 11.0, SD = 3.6) were compared to scans of 167 age- and sex-matched unrelated singletons on brain structures measured, which included gray and white matter lobar volumes, ventricular volume, and area of the corpus callosum. There were no significant differences between groups for any structure, despite sufficient power for low type II (i.e. false negative) error. The implications of these results are twofold: (1) within this age range and for these measures, it is appropriate to include healthy twins in studies of typical brain development, and (2) findings regarding heritability of brain structures obtained from twin studies can be generalized to non-twin populations.",

In our setting fetal outcome (weeks of gestation, birthweight, APGAR, umbilical arterial pH, admission to neonatal intensive care unit etc.) and other maternal data (maternal height, maternal weight, length of surgery etc.) were not significantly different. The prolonged time spent in hospital leads to a 250 Euro higher expense per patient.\nAdditional expenses of twin deliveries after assisted reproduction are due to a longer stay at the hospital. This prolonged stay of an average of 1.1 days was not obvious to medical reasons. Main delivery expenses for the substantial outcome-parameters are not significantly different between both groups.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins share a single placenta with inter-twin vascular anastomoses, allowing the transfer of blood from one fetus to the other and vice versa. These anastomoses are the essential anatomical substrate for the development of severe complications, including twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and twin-anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS). TTTS and TAPS are both chronic forms of feto-fetal transfusion. TTTS is characterized by the twin oligo-polyhydramnios sequence (TOPS), whereas TAPS is characterized by large inter-twin hemoglobin differences in the absence of amniotic fluid discordances. TAPS may occur spontaneously in a minority of monochorionic twins or in TTTS cases after laser treatment. This review focuses on the differences between TAPS and TTTS in terms of pathogenesis, incidence, diagnostic criteria, treatment modalities, perinatal outcome and long-term outcome.",

    "abstract": "Although the incidence and prevalence rates of IBD in Korea are still lower than Western populations, they have been increasing rapidly during the past decades. Crohn's disease (CD) tends to run in families because it is thought to be related to genetic susceptibility coupled with environmental factors. A large number of monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs with inflammatory bowel disease have been reported in western countries. The population relative risk in first-degree relatives is considered to be about equal in both Koreans and westerners. To our best knowledge, there is no report in monozygotic twins with CD in Korea. This case report is the first documented occurrence of concordant CD occurring in monozygotic twins in Korea.",

Pulmonary hypertension in neonates is associated with high morbidity and mortality and multiplies the challenge of caring for conjoined twins. BNP is a peptide hormone secreted by cardiac ventricles that have undergone stress related to ventricular filling, volume overload, and pressure. BNP is commonly used in adults to assess heart failure, but its utility is less established in infants receiving neonatal intensive care. In this case, BNP testing was used as an adjunct to standard assessments for rapid diagnosis which was critical to expediting appropriate treatment management for these high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in twins is an extremely rare event. Some believe these are natural deaths, whereas others suggest they are unnatural. We report monozygotic twins dying at 12 weeks of age. Extensive investigation concluded that the cause of death was natural. Our case fulfilled the criteria of simultaneous SIDS in twins. However, thermal stress due to excessive thermal insulation, use of a pillow and placing twins in the same cot all represent a potentially unsafe sleeping environment. We recommend the term \"simultaneous sudden unexpected death in infancy of twins\" to describe such cases.",

The absence of exon 16 was verified at the cDNA level. The twins manifested with microphallus, cryptorchidism, and deficient postnatal activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, findings consistent with IHH.\nOur report underlines that assisted reproductive techniques enable the inheritance of gene mutations causing infertility.

    "abstract": "Brown syndrome is a rare ocular movement abnormality. This syndrome is characterized by an inability to elevate the affected eye in adduction. Most cases are sporadic but the occurrence in Monozygotic twins has suggested the possible autosomal dominant inheritance in Brown syndrome.\nA 4-year-old girl (one pair of dizygotic twins) was referred to our pediatric ophthalmology clinic to assess her abnormal eye movement noticed by her mother. Visual acuity of both eyes was 20/20 with Snellen chart. Ocular motility showed mild exotropia in primary position with marked divergence in upward gaze (V pattern), mild hypotropia in adduction, and limitation of elevation in adduction of both eyes (Fig. 1A). We also examined her sister, all ocular evaluations including visual acuity, slit lamp examination, funduscopy and ocular motility (Ductions & Versions) were normal without any limitation. We also review the related articles that previously have reported Brown syndrome in twins.\nAlthough there are few case reports of Brown syndrome in twins, combination of these reports may elucidate the genetic basis of this disease.",

We examined heritabilities of these phenotypes and estimated their environmental and genetic overlap. We studied baseline lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV(1)/FVC), bronchial hyperresponsiveness, number of positive skin prick tests (SPT) to 11 allergens, serum total immunoglobulin (Ig)E, number of positive specific IgE tests to four allergens and eosinophil counts. 103 twin pairs were studied (46 monozygotic and 57 dizygotic; mean age: 22.5 yrs, range: 17.0-27.0 yrs). Univariate and bivariate genetic analyses were performed after adjustment for significant covariates. All intermediate asthma phenotypes showed significant heritabilities (47-83%). Most phenotypes were substantially correlated, which was mainly due to shared genetic factors. Pairs of phenotypes with the largest genetic correlations were specific IgE and SPT (0.98), and total IgE with specific IgE (0.87), with SPT (0.72), and with eosinophils (0.62). SPT showed significant environmental correlations with total IgE (0.65), specific IgE (0.70) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (0.44). Genetic effects explain the majority of the variation in objective intermediate asthma phenotypes. Additionally, correlations between pairs of these traits are also mainly explained by genetic rather than environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "It has been increasing rapidly interest in understanding genetic effects on brain structure and function in recent years. In this study, we examined the genetic and environmental influences on the variation in cortical thickness and specific tissue volumes in a large cohort of 8-year-old healthy twins. The present study can provide a better estimation of the genetic and environmental effects by virtue of the homogeneously aged pediatric twin pairs with a similar growing environment. We found that common environmental factors contributed significantly to the variations of the right lateral ventricle (36%) and corpus callosum (36%) volumes while genetic factors accounted for most of the phenotypic variance in other brain tissue volumes. In the case of cortical thickness, several regions in the left hemisphere showed statistically significant additive genetic factors, including the middle and inferior frontal gyri, lateral fronto-orbital and occipitotemporal gyri, pars opercularis, planum temporale, precentral and parahippocampal gyri and the medial region of the primary somatosensory cortex. Relatively high common environmental influence (>50%) was observed in the right anterior cingulate cortex and insula. Our findings indicate that the genetic and common environmental influences on individual human brain structural differences are lateralized, with the language-dominant left cerebral cortex under stronger genetic control than the right.",

    "abstract": "Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a multifactorial disorder that develops in 9-15% of diamniotic-monochorionic twin gestations. While the pathogenesis of TTTS remains poorly understood, unbalanced deep artery-to-vein (AV) anastomoses have traditionally been implicated in the gradual shift of blood from donor to recipient. The aim of this study was to define the placental markers of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, with special emphasis on the deep AV anastomoses. A prospective cohort of 284 consecutive diamniotic/monochorionic twin placentas was examined at Women and Infants Hospital between 2001 and 2008. Following exclusion of monoamniotic, multiple, disrupted and laser-treated placentas, 218 twin placentas (21 TTTS and 197 non-TTTS controls) formed the subject of this study. Placentas were injected with color-coded dyes. Anatomic characteristics and choriovascular anastomotic patterns of TTTS placentas were compared with non-TTTS controls. The TTTS placentas showed significantly higher frequencies of velamentous cord insertion, magistral vascular distribution patterns, uneven placental sharing, absence of AA anastomoses and presence of VV anastomoses. Deep AV anastomoses were identified in >or=95% of TTTS and non-TTTS placentas and were overall more abundant than previously reported. The total and net numbers of AV anastomoses were similar in both groups. However, the net cross-sectional area of AV anastomoses, which also takes into account the caliber of the vessels, was significantly smaller in TTTS placentas. There was no correlation between the direction of the AV imbalance and the twin donor/recipient status. In conclusion, TTTS has distinct placental characteristics, warranting their routine inclusion in the diamniotic-monochorionic placental pathology report. Our findings suggest imbalance of AV anastomoses is not required for the development for TTTS, although their presence, whether balanced or unbalanced, may contribute to the creation or perpetuation of the syndrome. Elucidation of the role of the various placental determinants in diamniotic-monochorionic twin gestations may lead to further refinement of therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric fusion genes are highly prevalent in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are mostly prenatal, early genetic events in the evolutionary trajectory of this cancer. ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL also has multiple ( approximately 6 per case) copy number alterations (CNAs) as revealed by genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Recurrent CNAs are probably \"driver\" events contributing critically to clonal diversification and selection, but at diagnosis, their developmental timing is \"buried\" in the leukemia's covert natural history. This conundrum can be resolved with twin pairs. We identified and compared CNAs in 5 pairs of monozygotic twins with concordant ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL and 1 pair discordant for ETV6-RUNX1 positive ALL. We compared, within each pair, CNAs classified as potential \"driver\" or \"passenger\" mutations based upon recurrency and, where known, gene function. An average of 5.1 (range 3-11) CNAs (excluding immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor alterations) were identified per case. All \"driver\" CNAs (total of 32) were distinct within each of the 5 twin pairs with concordant ALL. \"Driver\" CNAs in another twin with ALL were all absent in the shared ETV6-RUNX1-positive preleukemic clone of her healthy co-twin. These data place all \"driver\" CNAs secondary to the prenatal gene fusion event and most probably postnatal in the sequential, molecular pathogenesis of ALL.",

    "abstract": "Using twins assessed during adolescence (Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development: 8-17 years) and followed up in early adulthood (Young Adult Follow-Up, 18-27 years), we tested 13 genetically informative models of co-occurrence, adapted for the inclusion of covariates. Models were fit, in Mx, to data at both assessments allowing for a comparison of the mechanisms that underlie the lifetime co-occurrence of cannabis and tobacco use in adolescence and early adulthood. Both cannabis and tobacco use were influenced by additive genetic (38-81%) and non-shared environmental factors with the possible role of non-shared environment in the adolescent assessment only. Causation models, where liability to use cannabis exerted a causal influence on the liability to use tobacco fit the adolescent data best, while the reverse causation model (tobacco causes cannabis) fit the early adult data best. Both causation models (cannabis to tobacco and tobacco to cannabis) and the correlated liabilities model fit data from the adolescent and young adult assessments well. Genetic correlations (0.59-0.74) were moderate. Therefore, the relationship between cannabis and tobacco use is fairly similar during adolescence and early adulthood with reciprocal influences across the two psychoactive substances. However, our study could not exclude the possibility that 'gateways' and 'reverse gateways', particularly within a genetic context, exist, such that predisposition to using one substance (cannabis or tobacco) modifies predisposition to using the other. Given the high addictive potential of nicotine and the ubiquitous nature of cannabis use, this is a public health concern worthy of considerable attention.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether there is a relationship between the clinical occurrence of migraine and biliary tract disorders (BTD) and to study whether there is a genetic influence on such an association.\nThe near lifetime morbidity for migraine and BTD was examined in two Swedish twin-samples: OCTO-Twin (149 MZ and 202 DZ pairs; 234 men, 468 women; 80 years of age or older at inclusion), and the GENDER study (249 unlike-sex DZ-pairs; 70-80 years of age at inclusion). The diagnosis of BTD was established by perusal of medical records from the last twenty years. The diagnosis of migraine was based on iterated questionnaires and personal interviews.\nThe odds ratio (OR) of BTD among OCTO-Twin subjects suffering from migraine was 3.5 (1.9-6.7) in monozygotic pairs and 1.7 (1.0-2.9) in dizygotic pairs The corresponding figures among the GENDER unlike-sex DZ-pairs was 2.7 (1.6-4.5). Migraine was associated with female sex and waist circumference.\nThere is a relationship between the occurrence of migraine and BTD, also when controlling for the fact that both disorders are more frequent in women. The association appears to be partly attributable to genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "To assess the findings in conjoined twins diagnosed prenatally.\nBetween January 2002 and June 2009, we reviewed the database and medical records of 857 twin pregnancies, including 140 monochorionic twins. Nineteen monochorionic-monoamniotic twin pregnancies were detected, four of which were complicated by conjoined twins.\nOf these 4 cases, 2 were complicated by thoracopagus and one had thoraco-omphalopagus; these three cases underwent termination at 16, 11, and 19 weeks gestation, respectively.

The results of genetic analysis revealed all three extracted factors have significant proportion of additive genetic variance (93.5% to 72.9%). The main results of bivariate variance decomposition analysis appears significant correlation in residual variance between digital pattern size factor (Factor 1) versus finger pattern intensity factor (Factor 4), and palmar main lines factor (Factor 2) verses a-b ridge count (Factor 3), but there was no significant correlation in the genetic variance of factors.",

Umbilical cord entanglements and knots, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, congenital anomalies, prematurity and intertwin locking during labor are responsible for their high perinatal morbidity and mortality. We report here two cases of cord entanglements: One of them was associated with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome with gross vascular anastomoses and a massive cord entanglement. The other one was associated with cesarean section due to dystocia of cord entanglement of the second fetus after vaginal birth of the first one. There is still no consensus in literature for the management and the mode of delivery of these rarely encountered cases (Fig. 3, Ref. 13).",

In those with NT > 99(th) percentile and normal karyotype, we performed first- and second-trimester anomaly scans, fetal echocardiography at 14-16 and 20-22 weeks, maternal serology and, in monochorionic pregnancies, serial ultrasound examinations every other week. Perinatal outcome was recorded.\nThere were 10 (4.95%) pregnancies in which one of the fetuses had NT > 99(th) percentile and normal karyotype, including five fetuses (1.5%) in dichorionic and five (6.25%) in monochorionic pregnancies. During the same period the prevalence of NT > 99(th) percentile and normal karyotype in singleton pregnancies studied in our center was 2.6%. Among the 10 twins affected, six (60%) were diagnosed with structural abnormalities (three dichorionic and three monochorionic), and two intrauterine fetal demises occurred (one dichorionic and one monochorionic). Thus, the perinatal outcome was normal in only two of the pregnancies, one dichorionic and one monochorionic.\nThe prevalence of NT > 99(th) percentile in dichorionic twins with a normal karyotype is similar to that in singletons. In monochorionic twins we confirmed previous studies reporting an increased prevalence compared with singletons. NT > 99(th) percentile with a normal karyotype in twins was associated with a high rate of fetal abnormalities and/or fetal demise (overall 80%) irrespective of chorionicity.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral genetic studies of speech fluency have focused on participants who present with clinical stuttering. Knowledge about genetic influences on the development and regulation of normal speech fluency is limited. The primary aims of this study were to identify the heritability of stuttering and high nonfluency and to assess the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the correlation between these 2 fluency phenotypes.\nInformation on 6 specific speech fluency behaviors was obtained by maternal report for over 10,500 5-year-old Dutch twin pairs.\nGenetic analyses revealed that both fluency phenotypes were moderately heritable, with heritability estimates of 42% and 45% for probable stuttering and high nonfluency, respectively. Shared environmental factors were also significant, explaining 44% of the individual differences in probable stuttering and 32% in nonfluency. For both phenotypes, the magnitude of the genetic and environmental influences did not differ between boys and girls. The overlap between the 2 traits was substantial (tetrachoric correlation was .72). A bivariate genetic analysis showed that this overlap was due to both overlapping genetic and environmental influences.\nThese findings provide a foundation to justify further studies in normal fluency control, a scientific area that has received little cross-disciplinary attention.",

The survey was completed on a voluntary basis by sets of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. A total of 130 surveys taken by 65 complete twin pairs were analyzed.\nSkin aging was assessed using a validated photographic scale of photodamage, graded by such characteristics as wrinkling and pigmentation change.\nPhotodamage scores among twins of a pair, whether MZ or DZ, were highly correlated (P = .92). Factors found to predict higher photodamage include history of skin cancer (P < .001), zygosity status (MZ vs DZ) (P = .001), weight (P = .02), and cigarette smoking (P = .046). Alcohol consumption was significantly associated with lower photodamage scores (P = .003).\nThe study of twins provides a unique opportunity to control for genetic susceptibility in order to elucidate environmental influences on skin aging.

    "abstract": "Spontaneous antepartum rupture of the dividing membrane occurring in monochorionic diamniotic twins (MD twin) is an extremely rare complication and difficult to diagnose prenatally. We present a case of pseudo-monoamniotic twins derived from an MD twin gestation, which was suspected by ultrasound and was confirmed by antepartum fetoscopy. A 28-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1 at 24 weeks of gestation was referred because of suspected polyhydroamnios in an MD twin. Ultrasound suggested twin-twin transfusion syndrome stage III, spontaneous rupture of the dividing membranes and cord entanglement. Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP) was performed using the Nd:YAG laser on 12 placental vascular connections. Fetoscopy revealed the spontaneous rupture of the dividing membrane and cord entanglement. The remainder of the pregnancy was managed as a monoamniotic twin gestation. Elective cesarean section was performed at 32 weeks of gestation following antenatal steroids and concordantly grown healthy male infants were delivered.",

    "abstract": "Meningiomas in identical twins are extremely rare. To our knowledge, only one previous report of meningiomas in identical twins has been published. We present identical twin sisters with meningiomas. The tumors were located at a similar, but not a common, position (the cerebellopontine angle) in both twins. Histologically, both tumors were diagnosed as meningothelial meningiomas with an angiomatous component. Immunohistochemically, the Ki-67 indices in the two cases were 1.0 and 1.1, and the p53 positive rates were 0.2 and 0.9. The specimens in both cases were reactive to neurofibromin 2 (NF2). A comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) assay revealed an aberration in the long arm of chromosome X, but no aberrations in the long arm of chromosome 22 in either case. These results strongly suggest that genetic aberrations other than NF2 are associated with tumorigenesis in some types of sporadic meningiomas.",

    "abstract": "A returning dilemma for families with multiple births is whether twins should share the same, or a parallel classroom, or in other words, whether they should be separated at school or not. This study investigated the effects of sharing a classroom during primary school on cognitive achievement in twins.\nSubjects were 839 monozygotic and 1164 dizygotic twin pairs who were registered at birth at The Netherlands Twin Register. A prospective, longitudinal study design was used with educational achievement at age 12 years, measured with a standardised test (CITO test), as outcome measure.\nMost twin pairs (72%) shared a classroom during their schooling, 19% were in separate, but parallel, classes, and 9% \"partly\" shared a classroom. Twins who were in parallel classrooms had higher CITO scores (mean 539.51; SD 8.12), compared to twins who shared a classroom (537.99; SD 8.52). When controlling for socioeconomic status, and externalising problems before starting primary school (age 3), there was no significant difference in educational achievement between separated and non-separated twin pairs (p = 0.138). In addition, there was no interaction with sex or zygosity of the twins (p = 0.798).\nThere is no difference in educational achievement between twins who share a classroom and twins who do not share a classroom during their primary school time. The choice of separation should be made by teachers, parents and their twin children, based on individual characteristics of a twin pair.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in gray matter volume (GMV) are a robust feature of schizophrenia. However, it is not clear to what extent these abnormalities are correlates of the genetic liability to the disorder, as opposed to environmental factors and the disorder itself. We investigated the influence of genetic and environmental risk on GMV in monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs concordant and discordant for schizophrenia.\nTotal and regional GMVs were measured from magnetic resonance images of 80 twins: 14 MZ pairs concordant for schizophrenia, 9 pairs discordant for schizophrenia, and 17 healthy MZ twin pairs.\nTotal GMV was smaller in twins with schizophrenia (t = -3.17, p = .003) and nonpsychotic cotwins from discordant pairs (t = -2.66, p = .011) than in healthy control twins. Twin pairs concordant for schizophrenia displayed reduced regional GMV in the inferior frontal, medial frontal, and anterior cingulate gyri; the caudate; lingual gyrus; and cerebellum relative to healthy twins (p < .05, corrected). Within discordant pairs, twins with schizophrenia had less GMV than their nonpsychotic cotwins in the insula; superior/medial frontal, pre/postcentral, cingulate, and superior temporal gyri; and the paracentral lobule. There were no significant differences in regional GMV between nonpsychotic cotwins and healthy control subjects.\nThe presence of schizophrenia was specifically related to reduced GMV in frontal, insular, cingulate, medial parietal, and temporal cortex, over and above effects of genetic risk for the disorder. These changes could be related to the pathophysiology of the disorder itself or to unique environmental factors acting etiologically or because of the illness.",

We report the case of homozygous twins affected by CINCA syndrome. The diagnosis was evoked on the basis of multiple systemic symptoms (multiple episodes of fever of unknown origin, mental retardation, short stature, meningitis, hearing loss, bilateral papilledema) and confirmed by the presence of a CIAS1 mutation on genetic analysis. After few months of treatment by anakinra (an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) the children began to grow again and we noted regression of the biological inflammatory syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Co-bedding, a developmental care strategy, is the practice of caring for diaper clad twins in one incubator (versus separating and caring for each infant in separate incubators), thus creating the opportunity for skin-to-skin contact and touch between the twins. In studies of mothers and their infants, maternal skin-to-skin contact has been shown to decrease procedural pain response according to both behavioral and physiological indicators in very preterm neonates. It is uncertain if this comfort is derived solely from maternal presence or from stabilization of regulatory processes from direct skin contact. The intent of this study is to compare the comfort effect of co-bedding (between twin infants who are co-bedding and those who are not) on infant pain response and physiologic stability during a tissue breaking procedure (heelstick).\nMedically stable preterm twin infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit will be randomly assigned to a co-bedding group or a standard care group. Pain response will be measured by physiological and videotaped facial reaction using the Premature Infant Pain Profile scale (PIPP). Recovery from the tissue breaking procedure will be determined by the length of time for heart rate and oxygen saturation to return to baseline. Sixty four sets of twins (n = 128) will be recruited into the study. Analysis and inference will be based on the intention-to-treat principle.\nIf twin contact while co-bedding is determined to have a comforting effect for painful procedures, then changes in current neonatal care practices to include co-bedding may be an inexpensive, non invasive method to help maintain physiologic stability and decrease the long term psychological impact of procedural pain in this high risk population. Knowledge obtained from this study will also add to existing theoretical models with respect to the exact mechanism of comfort through touch.\nNCT00917631.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins pose a serious challenge to medical ethics because of the fact that most legally informed ethicists recognise the need to respect the sanctity of life principle for all children. This principle is not negated by impairments to a child nor by the fact that two children's fates may be so closely intertwined that what one does to one inevitably affects the other. Various mitigating factors enter clinical decisions such as the best interests of the child but these can appear rather strained in some of the more debated conjoined twins cases. We therefore need to evaluate the ethics of treatment for conjoined twins quite carefully so that significant ethical values and legal principles are not compromised or distorted beyond credibility. The idea of a potentiality principle that is close to but distinct from the substantial benefit principle as it is used in adult clinical decisions is mooted as one valuable tool in this area.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship between birth weight and risk of asthma in a population of twins.\nBirth weight of all live twins (8280 pairs) born in Denmark between 1994 and 2000 was linked to information on asthma obtained from parent-completed questionnaires at age 3-9 years. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the risk of asthma.\nSubjects with a history of asthma at age 3-9 years weighed on average 122 g (95% CI 85 to 160) less at birth than subjects who had not developed asthma, p<0.001. There was a linear increase in asthma risk with decreasing birth weight, OR (per 100 g) 1.04 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.05), p<0.001. Within twin pairs, the lower birthweight twin had a significantly increased risk of asthma compared with the heavier co-twin (11.3% vs 9.9%), OR 1.30 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.54), p=0.002. The result remained significant after adjusting for sex, birth length and Apgar score, OR 1.31 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.65), p=0.027. The risk tended to be higher in monozygotic co-twins compared with dizygotic co-twins, especially for high birth weight differences.\nLow birth weight is a risk factor for asthma independently of gestational age, sex, birth length and Apgar score, but this may be due, in part, to residual non-genetic confounding factors. This finding lends support to the \"fetal origins hypothesis\" suggesting undisclosed prenatal determinants for the risk of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are both predictors of coronary artery disease and correlate with each other. We examined whether these 2 phenotypes share a common genetic substrate and investigated the relations of the CRP gene polymorphisms with both CRP levels and HRV indexes. We examined 236 male twins free of symptomatic coronary artery disease, with a mean age +/- SD of 54 +/- 2.9 years. The plasma CRP levels were measured and the frequency domain measures of HRV were assessed using a 24-hour electrocardiographic recording, including ultra-low-, very-low-, low-, and high-frequency power. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CRP gene were genotyped. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between CRP and HRV, as well as the genotype-phenotype association. Bivariate structural equation modeling was performed to estimate the genetic and environmental correlations between CRP and HRV and the explanatory effect of CRP gene polymorphisms on the CRP-HRV association. Both CRP (h(2) = 0.76) and HRV indexes (h(2) = 0.56 to 0.64) showed high heritability. Greater CRP levels were significantly associated with lower HRV. A robust genetic correlation was found between CRP and ultra-low-frequency power (r(G) = -0.3, p = 0.001). One CRP single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1205) was significantly associated with both CRP (p = 0.003) and ultra-low-frequency power (p = 0.005) and explained 11% of the genetic covariance between them. In conclusion, reduced HRV correlates significantly with increased CRP plasma levels and this correlation is due, in large part, to common genetic influences. A polymorphism in the CRP gene contributes to both CRP levels and HRV.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether persistent leisure-time physical activity, adjusted for genetic liability and childhood experiences, protects against chronic diseases, early signs of disability, and loss of life satisfaction.\nFrom 5663 healthy adult twin pairs, we identified 146 pairs who were discordant for both intensity and volume of leisure physical activity in 1975 and 1981. Of them, both members of 95 pairs were alive and participated in our follow-up study in 2005 when chronic diseases (such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoarthritis), life satisfaction, and disability were assessed by a structured telephone interview. The mean age of the participants was 58 yr (range = 47-79 yr) in 2005. Paired tests were used in the analyses.\nAt the end of follow-up, the active cotwins had a decreased risk of reporting at least one chronic diseases, whereas active monozygotic (MZ) twins had two or more chronic diseases significantly less often than their inactive cotwins (odds ratio [OR] = 0.14, P = 0.031). Overall, the risk for type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance (OR = 0.09, P = 0.022) and elevated blood pressure (OR = 0.46, P = 0.039) was decreased among the active cotwins. These effects were seen clearly among dizygotic twins but not always among small number of monozygotic twins. The active cotwins reported greater life satisfaction (P = 0.047) and tended to be less likely to be hospitalized (P = 0.065), although active cotwins had somewhat more sports-related injuries (OR = 1.9, P = 0.051) than inactive cotwins. Studied disability variables did not differ between the active and the inactive cotwins.\nPhysical activity reduces the risk for chronic diseases and helps in maintaining life satisfaction. However, genetic factors may play a role in this association because some findings emerged more clearly among dizygotic than monozygotic twins discordant for physical activity.",

    "abstract": "The purpose was to compare the sella turcica morphology of individuals within pairs of monozygotic twins with normal karyotype and to analyze the similarity between the observed morphology and the morphology of non-twins at the same age with normal karyotype. Profile radiographs from 84 individuals of 42 twin pairs (18 male and 24 female pairs, aged 18-23 years) comprised the material. Sella turcica measurements from non-twins aged 6-21 years were used as normal reference. Length, depth and diameter of the sella turcica were measured and controlled by re-measurements. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for comparison of individuals within twin pairs. For comparison of twins and non-twins, normal standard values for length, depth and diameter were subtracted from the twin values. For the mean values of these differences, confidence limits p values and t values were calculated. The study showed that the size of the sella turcica may be partly similar and partly dissimilar within the pair of monozygotic twins. Statistical evaluation of the data showed correlations between length, depth and diameter of the sella turcica between the two twin individuals in the same twin pair. Differences in sizes are observed between individuals in the twin material and individuals in the non-twin material. As a conclusion, the twin males were more similar within the twin pair, but deviated more from the non-twin material than the females. Female twins had more discrepancy within the twin pair, but deviated less from the non-twin material than the males.",

    "abstract": "The Older Australian Twins Study (OATS) was recently initiated to investigate genetic and environmental factors and their associations and interactions in healthy brain ageing and ageing-related neurocognitive disorders. The study extends the classic MZ-DZ design to include one or two equivalently aged siblings for each twin pair and utilizes the rich resources of the Australian Twin Registry. The study has a number of distinguishing features including comprehensive psychiatric, neuropsychological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and neuroimaging assessments, a longitudinal design and links with a brain donor program. The study measures many behavioral and environmental factors, but in particular lifetime physical and mental activity, physical and psychological trauma, loss of parent early in life, later losses and life events, early-life socioeconomic environment, alcohol and drug use, occupational exposure, and nutrition. It also includes comprehensive cardiovascular assessment, blood biochemistry, genetics and proteomics. The socio-demographic and health data on the first 172 pairs of twins participating in this study are presented. Prevalence of mild cognitive impairment is 12.8% and of dementia 1.5% in the sample. The target sample size is 1000, with at least 400 pairs of twins aged 65-90 years. The cohort will be assessed every two years, with in-depth assessments being repeated. OATS offers an excellent opportunity for collaboration with other similar studies as well as researchers who share the same interests.",

    "abstract": "Although genetic basis of childhood temperament has been well documented in western populations, little is known about whether genes play an important role in childhood temperament in East Asians. The present study examined mother's ratings of Emotionality, Activity, and Sociability (EAS) in 894 pairs of 2- to 9-year-old South Korean twins. The best-fitting model indicated that 34 to 47% of the variances of the EAS were attributable to genetic factors, with the remaining variances being due to the effects of environmental experiences unique to each child. Common family environmental factors were negligible. Genetic variances for Activity and Sociability were primarily nonadditive, whereas those for Emotionality were additive. In spite of well known cultural differences in child rearing practices, social values, and the mean levels of temperament between East Asian and western populations, the pattern of additive vs. nonadditive gene actions and heritability estimates found in the present sample were remarkably similar to those reported in western twin samples. There were no significant age or sex differences in genetic or environmental influences. Overall, these results corroborate cross cultural generality of genetic influences on childhood temperament.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that certain health behaviours, such as smoking, may operate as mediators of the well-established inverse association between IQ and mortality risk. Previous research may be afflicted by unadjusted confounding by socioeconomic or psychosocial factors. Twin designs offer a unique possibility to take genetic and shared environmental factors into account. The aim of the present national twin study was to determine the interrelations between IQ at age 18, childhood and attained social factors and smoking status in young adulthood and mid-life. We studied the association between IQ at age 18 and smoking in later life in a population of 11 589 male Swedish twins. IQ was measured at military conscription, and data on smoking and zygosity was obtained from the Swedish Twin Register. Information on social factors was extracted from censuses. Data on smoking was self-reported by the twins at the age of 22-47 years. Logistic regression models estimated with generalised estimating equations were used to explore possible associations between IQ and smoking among the twins as individuals as well as between-and within twin-pairs. A strong inverse association between IQ and smoking status emerged in unmatched analyses over the entire range of IQ distribution. In within-pair and between-pair analyses it transpired that shared environmental factors explained most of the inverse IQ-smoking relationship. In addition, these analyses indicated that non-shared and genetic factors contributed only slightly (and non-significantly) to the IQ-smoking association. Analysis of twin pairs discordant for IQ and smoking status displayed no evidence that non-shared factors contribute substantially to the association. The question of which shared environmental factors might explain the IQ-smoking association is an intriguing one for future research.",

    "abstract": "A new mechanism modus of micro ultrasonic electroremoval (MUERM) using a precise nanostructure reclamation and a design twins-oval tool offering faster performance in removing the Indium-tin-oxide (In2O3SnO2) thin-films from the surface of the optical PET-diaphragm (PET) of digital paper is demonstrated. Through the ultra-precise etching of the nanostructure, the semiconductor industry can effectively reclaim defective products, thereby reducing production costs. For the removal-process, a faster feed rate of the PET combined with a higher electric current produces a faster removal rate. Using ultrasonic energy transmitted into the electrolyte to assist in the chemical reaction can improve the effect of dreg discharge and contributes to the achievement of a fast PET feed rate. The average removal effect of the ultrasonics is better than the pulsed current while the current rating needs not to be prolonged. The high rotational speed of the twins-oval tool increases the dreg discharge mobility and improves the removal effect. A small height of the anode and the cathode, or a large width of the cathode corresponds to a higher removal rate for the In2O3SnO2. A small arc edge radius of the anode and the cathode also corresponds to a higher removal rate for the In2O3SnO2.",

    "abstract": "Several cases of Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) have been reported in asthmatic patients treated with leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs). It is not clear whether LTRA is a causative factor in the development of vasculitis. We present the case of a 26-year-old patient, who developed severe central and peripheral neuropathy after a short-term treatment with LTRA, followed by gastrointestinal perforation and bleeding. The patient was successfully treated with high-dose glucocorticoids, immunoglobulins, and cyclophosphamide. His monozygotic twin brother treated for asthma does not meet classification criteria for Churg-Strauss syndrome at the moment, but his condition is being monitored. Both asthma and rheumatology specialists should consider the possibility of CSS development in patients treated with LTRAs.",

    "abstract": "Diet may be associated with risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD). The authors examined the association between fruit and vegetable consumption in midlife and risk for all types of dementia and AD.\nParticipants were 3,779 members of the Swedish Twin Registry who completed a diet questionnaire approximately 30 years before cognitive screening and full clinical evaluation for dementia as part of the study of dementia in Swedish Twins (HARMONY) study. Among the participants, 355 twins were diagnosed with dementia. Among these, 81 twin pairs were discordant for dementia (50 discordant for AD). Data were analyzed with logistic regression for the entire sample using generalized estimating equations to adjust for relatedness of twins and with conditional logistic regression for the co-twin control design.\nIn fully adjusted models, a medium or great proportion of fruits and vegetables in the diet, compared with no or small, was associated with a decreased risk of dementia and AD. This effect was observed among women and those with angina. Similar, but nonsignificant, odds ratios were found in the co-twin control analyses.\nThe findings suggest that higher fruit and vegetable consumption may reduce the risk of dementia, especially among women and those with angina pectoris in midlife.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to estimate the optimal time of delivery and investigated the residual risk of fetal death after viability in otherwise uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies.\nA database of 576 completed multiple pregnancies that were managed in our tertiary referral fetal medicine department between 1996 and 2007 was reviewed and the uncomplicated 111 monochorionic and the 290 dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies delivered after 24 weeks were selected. The rate of fetal death was derived for two-week periods starting at 24 weeks' gestation and the prospective risk of fetal death was calculated by determining the number of intrauterine fetal deaths that occurred within the two-week block divided by the number of continuing uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancies during that same time period.\nThe unexpected single intrauterine deaths rate was 2.7% versus 2.8% in previously uncomplicated monochorionic and dichorionic diamniotic pregnancies, respectively. The prospective risk of unexpected stillbirth after 32 weeks of gestation was 1.3% for monochorionic and 0.8% for dichorionic pregnancies.\nIn otherwise apparently uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies this prospective risk of fetal death after 32 weeks of gestation is lower than reported and similar to that of dichorionic pregnancies, so does not sustain the theory of elective preterm delivery.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides anatomical connectivity information by examining the directional organization of white matter microstructure. Anatomical connectivity and its abnormalities may be heritable traits associated with schizophrenia. To further examine this hypothesis, two studies were conducted to compare anatomical connectivity between (a) monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and random pairings among twins and (b) first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients and a healthy control group. Analyses focused on frontal regions of the brain following previous findings of anatomical connectivity abnormalities associated with schizophrenia. For Study 1, eighteen MZ twin pairs (11 female pairs, age: M = 25.44, SD = 5.69) were recruited. For Study 2, twenty-two first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients (14 females, age: M = 48.50, SD = 8.22), and 30 healthy controls (12 females, age: M = 43.83, SD = 11.39) were recruited. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a white matter directional organization metric, was measured with DTI. In Study 1, FA values were more strongly correlated between MZ twin pairs than between randomly generated pairs in genu of corpus callosum, anterior cingulum and forceps minor. In Study 2, relatives of schizophrenia patients showed reduced FA values in medial frontal white matter (p < 0.05, corrected). The present study suggested that anatomical connectivity in medial prefrontal cortex appeared significantly heritable within MZ twin pairs, an important criterion in the development of an endophenotype. In addition, altered medial frontal white matter integrity found in non-affected relatives of schizophrenia patients seems to suggest that reduced white matter integrity in medial frontal regions of the brain might be associated with the genetic liability to schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Educational opportunities for African-Americans expanded throughout the 20(th) century. Twin pairs are an informative population in which to examine changes in educational attainment because each twin has the same parents and childhood socioeconomic status. We hypothesized that correlation in educational attainment of older twin pairs would be higher compared to younger twin pairs reflecting changes in educational access over time and potentially reflecting a \"ceiling effect\" associated with Jim Crow laws and discrimination.\nWe used data from 211 same-sex twin pairs (98 identical, 113 fraternal) in the Carolina African-American Twin Study of Aging who were identified through birth records. Participants completed an in-person interview. The twins were predominantly female (61%), with a mean age of 50 years (SD = 0.5). We found that older age groups had a stronger intra-twin correlation of attained educational level. Further analysis across strata revealed a trend across zygosity, with identical twins demonstrating more similar educational attainment levels than did their fraternal twin counterparts, suggesting a genetic influence.\nThese findings suggest that as educational opportunities broadened in the 20th century, African-Americans gained access to educational opportunities that better matched their individual abilities.",

The conjoined fetuses were diagnosed as thoracopagus twins with a single beating heart shared between the thoraxes. Extensive ultrasound examination suggested an extremely poor prognosis, Therapeutic termination was performed at 11 weeks.\nGiven that single embryo transfers are able to shed light on the real incidence of conjoined twins developed on day 2/3 or on day 5/6, this is of interest mechanistically. Thus, it should be taken into account when trying to determine the true incidence of conjoined twins and ultimately trying to understand why these anomalies occur.

    "abstract": "Several studies suggest a link between increased activity of the inflammatory inhibitor-kappaB kinase/nuclear factor-kappaB (IKK/NF-kappaB) pathway in skeletal muscle and insulin resistance.\nWe aimed to study the regulation of skeletal muscle IKK/NF-kappaB pathway activity as well as the association with glucose metabolism and skeletal muscle insulin signaling.\nThe study population included a metabolically well-characterized cohort of young and elderly predominantly nondiabetic twins (n = 181). Inhibitor-kappaBbeta (IkappaBbeta) protein levels are negatively associated with IKK/NF-kappaB pathway activity and were used to evaluate pathway activity with p65 levels included as loading control. This indirect measure for IKK/NF-kappaB pathway activity was validated by a p65 binding assay.\nEvaluating the effects of heritability, age, sex, obesity, aerobic capacity, and several hormonal factors (eg insulin and TNF-alpha), only sex and age were significant predictors of IkappaBbeta to p65 ratio (28% decreased ratio in the elderly, P < 0.01, and 49% increased in males P < 0.01). IkappaBbeta to p65 ratio was unrelated to peripheral insulin sensitivity (P = 0.51) and in accordance with this also unrelated to proximal insulin signaling (P = 0.81). Although no association was seen with plasma glucose after oral glucose challenge, there was a tendency for lower IkappaBbeta to p65 ratio (adjusted for age and sex) in subjects with impaired as opposed to normal glucose tolerance (P = 0.055).\nAltogether the subtle elevated IKK/NF-kappaB pathway activity seen in glucose-intolerant subjects suggests that IKK/NF-kappaB pathway activation may be secondary to impaired glucose tolerance and that skeletal muscle IKK/NF-kappaB pathway activity is unlikely to play any major role in the control of skeletal muscle insulin action in nondiabetic subjects.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the prognosis of monochorionic twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR), classified according to the type of umbilical artery Doppler, under expectant management.\nThe outcome of 81 cases with isolated sIUGR was evaluated according to a classification based on umbilical artery (UA) Doppler diastolic flow in the IUGR twin (I: present, II: constantly absent/reverse, III: intermittently absent/reverse). Selective feticide was not considered due to legal constraints. Perinatal outcomes included perinatal death and neurological outcome at 6 months of age.\nFrom 81 cases with the diagnosis of sIUGR, twin-twin transfusion was diagnosed in 18 cases. This left 63 cases, of which 23 were classified as type I (36.5%), 27 as type II (42.9%) and 13 as type III (20.6%). Intrauterine death occurred in 4.3% (1), 29.6% (8) and 15.4% (2) among IUGR twins, and 4.3% (1), 22.2% (6) and 0.0% (0) among larger twins. Neonatal death occurred in 0.0% (0), 18.5% (5) and 0.0% (0) among IUGR twins, and 0.0% (0), 11.1% (3) and 23.0% (3) among larger twins. Neurological abnormalities at 6 months were found in 4.3% (1), 14.8% (4) and 23.1% (3) in smaller twins and 0.0% (0), 11.1% (3) and 38.5% (5) in larger twins, respectively. Intact survival at 6 months was recorded in 91% (21), 37% (10) and 61% (8) in smaller twins and 95% (22), 55% (15) and 38% (5) in larger twins, respectively.\nThe outcome in monochorionic twins with sIUGR and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler is poor under expectant management. Normal Doppler seems to be associated with a good prognosis.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that patients with schizophrenia and some of their relatives suffer from reduced neurocognitive efficiency, increasing their sensitivity to experimental task demands. The present study evaluated such a possibility during performance of a working memory task by schizophrenia patients and their co-twins along with a healthy control sample. Electrophysiological data were obtained from sets of nine twin pairs (monozygotic and dizygotic pairs collapsed) discordant for a diagnosis of schizophrenia and from nine matched healthy control twin pairs, during administration of a variable-load spatial working memory task. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured immediately after memory set onset and during a delay period. For correctly performed trials, slow-wave ERP activity measured during the late stimulus encoding and delay periods exhibited a significant Diagnostic Group-by-Memory Load interaction, with schizophrenia patients showing a differentially strong load effect. Patients' co-twins displayed an intermediate level of load sensitivity while healthy controls showed no significant load effect. These results support an inefficiency model of neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, a pattern that appears to be related to the pathogenesis and inheritance of the disorder. Furthermore, this inefficiency appeared during the late stimulus encoding stage of working memory functioning, possibly reflecting disruptions in stimulus representation consolidation.",

    "abstract": "Serum concentrations of some hormones are risk factors for certain cancers, but little is known about their familial associations especially for females.\nWe measured serum concentrations of estradiol (E(2)), testosterone (T), SHBG, prolactin, and IGF-I for 645 Australian female postmenopausal twins and their sisters [182 monozygotic (MZ) and 107 dizygotic (DZ) pairs and 67 nontwin sisters] using well-established immunoassays. After suitable transformation and adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), and time since menopause, familial correlations and proportions of variance attributed to genetic (h(2)) and nongenetic factors common to sisterships (c(2)) were estimated under the classic twin multivariate normal model using FISHER.\nFor all serum concentrations except prolactin, MZ, DZ, and sister pairs were correlated (P < 0.001). MZ correlations were in the range 0.5-0.7, and for all serum concentrations, there were no differences between DZ and sister correlations. MZ correlations were greater than DZ and sister correlations for log SHBG (P = 0.0001), IGF-I (P = 0.0002), and square-root T (P = 0.007) but not log E(2) (P = 0.3), and the respective h(2) estimates were 0.56 (SE = 0.14), 0.53 (0.17), 0.39 (0.14), and 0.14 (0.16). For log E(2) and square-root T, c(2) estimates were 0.39 (0.14) and 0.22 (0.12).\nThere are strong familial correlations in postmenopausal SHBG, IGF-I, and to a lesser extent T, which are consistent with a genetic etiology. For E(2), and to a lesser extent T, correlations are consistent with substantial nongenetic familial factors. The latter might include maternal effects.",

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is common but the aetiology is unclear. This study examined the heritability of acute appendicitis.\nThe study included twin pairs with known zygosity born between 1959 and 1985. Individuals with acute appendicitis were found by record linkage with the Swedish Inpatient Register. Comparing monodizygotic and dizygotic twins, the similarity and relative proportions of phenotypic variance resulting from genetic and environmental factors were analysed. Risks of acute appendicitis explained by heritability and environmental effects were estimated.\nSome 3441 monozygotic and 2429 dizygotic twins were identified. Almost no genetic effects were found in males (8 (95 per cent confidence interval 0 to 50) per cent), but shared (31 (0 to 49) per cent) and non-shared (61 (47 to 74) per cent) environmental factors accounted for this risk. In females, the heritability was estimated as 20 (0 to 36) per cent and the remaining variation was due to non-shared environmental factors (80 (64 to 98) per cent). For the sexes combined, genetic effects accounted for 30 (5 to 40) per cent and non-shared environmental effects for 70 (60 to 81) per cent of the risk.\nAcute appendicitis has a complex aetiology with sex differences in heritability and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Using data from the first four waves of the OCTO-Twin study (twins 80 + years), the present study investigated the stability and change of genetic and environmental contributions to pulmonary function. Using a genetic simplex model, variance in peak expiratory flow (PEF) at each wave was decomposed into additive genetic and nonshared (specific) environmental factors. Additionally, this analysis distinguished the source of these influences, either from previous waves (transmissions) or from novel influences at each wave (innovations). At each time point (except wave 1), the genetic variance was due to genetic transmissions from prior time points. Conversely, the specific environmental variance in PEF at each time point was mainly due to environmental innovations. These results imply that genetic factors contribute to the stability of pulmonary function over time whereas environmental factors contribute to its change.",

Physical and occupational therapists provide services for children who have the syndrome, whose genetic disorder is frequently not identified or diagnosed before 1 year of age. A comprehensive physical and occupational therapy evaluation was completed in nonidentical twins with one having SMS, using the Sensory Profile; Brief Assessment of Motor Function (BAMF); Peabody Developmental Motor Scales, Second Edition (PDMS-2); and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI).

Bibliographies of identified articles were reviewed.\nEnglish language studies of twins conceived by IVF or IVF/ICSI, compared with spontaneously twins, that matched or controlled for at least maternal age.\nTwo reviewers independently assessed titles, abstracts, articles and study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the Review Manager (RevMan 5.0) software using a random effects model. Dichotomous data were meta-analyzed using relative risks (RR) and continuous data with a weighted mean difference.\nTwelve studies were included which had a total of 4385 twins conceived after IVF or IVF/ICSI (one stillbirth was excluded) and 11,793 spontaneously-conceived twins. After matching or controlling for maternal age and often other factors, compared to spontaneously-conceived twins, IVF twins had increased risks of both our primary outcomes: PTB (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09, 1.41) and LBW (<2500 g, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.22). They were at increased risk for PTB <32-33 weeks (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.17, 2.27) although the risks of late PTB (32-36 weeks, RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.85, 1.47), very LBW (<1500 g, RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.73, 2.24), extremely LBW (<1000 g, RR 0.88, 0.04, 19.40), intrauterine growth restriction (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.72, 1.55) and the difference in the duration of gestation (-0.5 weeks, 95% CI -1.2 weeks, 0.2 weeks) were not statistically significantly increased compared to spontaneously-conceived twins. IVF twins had significantly lower mean birth weights (-105 g, 95% CI -204 g, -3 g).\nIVF twins have small but significantly increased risks of PTB, LBW, and lower mean birth weight compared to spontaneously-conceived twins after matching or controlling for at least maternal age.",

    "abstract": "Two metaphors are presented to highlight concepts that could lead to a paradigm shift in dental studies of twins. The first, derived from the Song of Solomon in the Bible, refers to teeth as being twins. This viewpoint emphasises that each tooth should be viewed as a paired structure, not only with its antimere (within the same arch) but also with its isomer (in the opposing arch). The other metaphor provided by Waddington in 1957 is visual and involves 'an epigenetic landscape' that represents the processes of decision-making by cells during development. It likens the different stages of cellular decision-making to a ball rolling down an undulating landscape of interconnecting hills and valleys. This viewpoint helps to explain how distinct differences in dental phenotypes may arise both within and between monozygotic (MZ) co-twins due to relatively minor temporospatial effects during development. Measurements of maximum mesiodistal diameters of teeth in a pair of MZ twins, using calipers and also 2D and 3D imaging systems, have demonstrated that differences in dental crown size occur between antimeric pairs and between corresponding teeth of MZ co-twins. By defining new dental phenotypes that provide more comprehensive descriptions of tooth size and shape, and by drawing on the metaphors described, we are confident of providing new insights into the reasons for observed similarities and differences within, and between, the dentitions of twins. Our approaches will focus on multivariate analyses that take into account the paired arrangement of teeth and also explore epigenetic, as well as genetic and environmental, sources of variation.",

    "abstract": "This study is part of a larger investigation of genetic and environmental influences on primary tooth emergence in Australian twins. Our aims were to describe patterns of emergence asymmetry, including directional and fluctuating components (DA, FA), and to test for a genetic basis to observed asymmetry.\nThe study sample consisted of 131 twin pairs. Using one randomly-selected twin from each pair, dental asymmetry was examined by analysing the number of days between emergence of antimeres (Delta), with dates of emergence provided through parental recording. Scatterplots were used for assessment of DA and FA, followed by paired t-tests to detect significant differences in mean Delta from zero (evidence of DA). FA was assessed by calculating means and variances of the absolute value of Delta. A range of intervals (0, 7, 14, 21, 28 days) was used to define symmetrical emergence of antimeres.\nAlthough a trend in left-side advancement for tooth emergence was detected, this was not statistically significant. Relatively low levels of FA were noted through -out the primary dentition, with maxillary and mandibular lateral inisors displaying the highest values, but no evidence of a genetic influence on FA was noted. Around 50% of all antimeric pairs of primary teeth were found to emerge within 14 days of each other, although time differences of more than 50 days were noted in some cases.\nStudies of dental asymmetry provide insights into the biological basis of lateralisation in humans and the results can also assist clinicians to discriminate between normal and abnormal developmental patterns.",

    "abstract": "Microchimerism is the presence of small populations of cells from one individual in another genetically distinct individual. This phenomenon can arise from pregnancy, blood transfusion, or bidirectional cell trafficking between twins in utero. Microchimerism has recently been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of thyroid autoimmunity. In that case, twins from opposite-sex pairs (OS) should have an increased risk of thyroid autoantibodies (TA).\nThe aim of the study was to compare the frequency of TA in twin individuals from OS and monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs.\nThis was a case-control study of 240 individuals (120 females and 120 males) from OS twin pairs (cases) and 568 control individuals from MZ pairs (284 females and 284 males).\nAntibodies toward thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb), thyroglobulin (TgAb), and the TSH receptor (TSHRAb) were measured and considered positive if greater than 60 U/ml, greater than 60 U/ml, and greater than 1.0 U/liter, respectively.\nThe frequency of TPOAb, TgAb, and TSHRAb among female cases was 15.0, 5.0, and 4.2%, respectively, which was higher than the corresponding prevalences in the female control population: 7.4% (P = 0.018), 1.1% (P = 0.023), and 0.7% (P = 0.026), respectively. However, when corrected for the number of phenotypes studied (TPOAb, TgAb, TSHRAb, and any thyroid antibody), the association remained significant only in the combined group, P(corrected) = 0.012. Essentially similar results were obtained in males.\nBoth female and male twins from OS pairs, as opposed to MZ pairs, have an increased frequency of TA, indicating a potential role of microchimerism in developing TA.",

    "abstract": "Heritability may play a role in nonfamilial atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that a monozygotic (MZ) twin whose co-twin was diagnosed with AF would have an increased risk of the disease compared with a dizygotic (DZ) twin in the same situation.\nA sample of 1137 same-sex twin pairs (356 MZ and 781 DZ pairs) in which one or both members were diagnosed with AF were identified in The Danish Twin Registry. Concordance rates were twice as high for MZ pairs than for DZ pairs regardless of sex (22.0% versus 11.6%, P<0.0001). In a Cox regression of event-free survival times, we compared the time span between occurrences of disease in MZ and DZ twins. The unaffected twin was included when his or her twin-sibling (the index twin) was diagnosed with AF. After adjustment for age at entry, MZ twins had a significantly shorter event-free survival time (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.0), thereby indicating a genetic component. Using biometric models, we estimated the heritability of AF to be 62% (55% to 68%), due to additive genetics. There were no significant differences across sexes.\nAll the analyses of twin similarities in the present study indicate that genetic factors play a substantial role in the risk of AF for both sexes. The recurrence risk for co-twins (12% to 22%) is clinically relevant and suggests that co-twins of AF-affected twins belong to a high-risk group for AF.",

Consequently, some bereaved twins have established a unique organization, Twinless Twins Support Group International, for the purpose of sharing this traumatic life experience with one another. The present article reviews events from the annual convention of Twinless Twins, held in July 2009, in Denver, Colorado. Selected findings from research on twin loss are also presented. Next, twin research concerned with the origins and implications of empathy, hormone replacement therapy and multiple birth conception will be reviewed.

    "abstract": "Recent studies in Asian populations have identified variants in the EDAR and FGFR2 genes that arose following the divergence of Asians and Europeans and are associated with thick straight hair. To date no genetic variants have been identified influencing hair texture in Europeans. In the current study we examined the heritability of hair curliness in three unselected samples of predominantly European ancestry (N(S1) = 2717; N(S2) = 3904; N(S3) = 5079). When rated using a three point scale (Straight/Wavy/Curly) males were approximately 5% more likely to report straight hair than females and there were suggestions in the data that curliness increased slightly with age. Across samples significant additive and dominant genetic influences were detected resulting in a broad sense heritability of 85-95%. Given the magnitude and the specificity of the EDAR effect on hair morphology in Asian populations we are hopeful that future association studies will detect similar genetic influences in European populations.",

    "abstract": "Ahigher frequency of skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is found in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) than in controls. Although goitre is often present in AITD, a recent study failed to show an association between XCI and clinically overt nontoxic goitre. However, the etiology of overt goitre is complex, and the mechanisms influencing thyroid volume may involve fewer factors than the mechanisms underlying overt goitre. In order to examine the impact of XCI on thyroid volume in euthyroid females, we studied whether within cohort (n = 138) and within twin pair (n = 69) differences in XCI are correlated with differences in thyroid volume. XCI was determined by PCR analysis of a polymorphic CAG repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene. Thyroid volume was determined by ultrasound. Neither in the within cohort nor in the within twin pair analysis could we demonstrate a statistically significant association between XCI and thyroid volume: Regression coefficient (beta) = 0.023 (95% confidence interval, -0.062-0.108), p = 0.592 and beta = 0.038 (-0.080-0.156), p = 0.521, respectively. Controlling for potential confounders such as zygosity, age, TSH, smoking habits and use of oral contraceptives did not change the findings. In conclusion, in a sample of euthyroid Danish female twins, we found no evidence of a relationship between XCI pattern and thyroid volume.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins offer the possibility of gene discovery through delineation of molecular abnormalities in one member of the twin pair. One proposed mechanism of discordance is postzygotically occurring genomic alterations resulting from mitotic recombination and other somatic changes. Detection of altered genomic fragments can reveal candidate gene loci that can be verified through additional analyses. We investigated this hypothesis using array comparative genomic hybridization; the 50K and 250K Affymetrix GeneChip(R) SNP arrays and an Illumina custom array consisting of 1,536 SNPs, to scan for genomic alterations in a sample of monozygotic twin pairs with discordant cleft lip and/or palate phenotypes. Paired analysis for deletions, amplifications and loss of heterozygosity, along with sequence verification of SNPs with discordant genotype calls did not reveal any genomic discordance between twin pairs in lymphocyte DNA samples. Our results demonstrate that postzygotic genomic alterations are not a common cause of monozygotic twin discordance for isolated cleft lip and/or palate. However, rare or balanced genomic alterations, tissue-specific events and small aberrations beyond the detection level of our experimental approach cannot be ruled out. The stability of genomes we observed in our study samples also suggests that detection of discordant events in other monozygotic twin pairs would be remarkable and of potential disease significance.",

    "abstract": "In this article we report on reading ability of twin children in kindergarten to Grade 2 as a function of whether members of the pairs are assigned to the same or different classrooms. All analyses were run using mixed model regressions to account for the interdependence between twin pairs. The samples, total N = 1505, are from Australia and the United States. We found a close-to-significant difference in favor of same-class children in kindergarten and Grade 1. However, when results were adjusted to take account of pre-existing differences in disruptive behavior and in preliteracy ability, the class assignment effects disappeared. We suggest that these pre-existing differences, particularly disruptive behavior, are influencing decisions about whether to separate twins or not and also affecting early reading performance, a conclusion supported by significant correlations between the behavioral measures, preliteracy, and school-based reading. We conclude that, on average, early literacy in twins is not directly affected by their assignment to the same or different classrooms.",

    "abstract": "Visual impairment is a leading cause of morbidity and poor quality of life in our community. Unravelling the mechanisms underpinning important blinding diseases could allow preventative or curative steps to be implemented. Twin siblings provide a unique opportunity in biology to discover genes associated with numerous eye diseases and ocular biometry. Twins are particularly useful for quantitative trait analysis through genome-wide association and linkage studies. Although many studies involving twins rely on twin registries, we present our approach to the Twins Eye Study in Tasmania to provide insight into possible recruitment strategies, expected participation rates and potential examination strategies that can be considered by other researchers for similar studies. Five separate avenues for cohort recruitment were adopted: (1) piggy-backing existing studies where twins had been recruited, (2) utilizing the national twin registry, (3) word-of-mouth and local media publicity, (4) directly approaching schools, and finally (5) collaborating with other research groups studying twins.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies exploring the heritability of cannabis initiation have been carried out in the United States, Australia and United Kingdom. In the present study we assess cannabis initiation in The Netherlands, where the use of cannabis in small amounts is permitted. The sample included 3115 twins with a mean age of 27.4 years (SD 4.7) who are registered with the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR). Individual differences in cannabis initiation showed moderate genetic influences (44%). The remaining variance was explained by environmental influences shared by twins (31%) and by unique environmental factors (24%). Compared to studies from other countries, these results suggest that the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors is not different in a country with a more liberal cannabis policy.",

    "abstract": "To assess the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to different definitions of spinal pain and consequences of spinal pain.\nThe Danish Twin Registry contains detailed survey information on spinal pain and its consequences in twins ages 20-71 years. A classic genetic epidemiologic analysis was performed in order to establish heritability for a number of phenotypes, including location of pain, radiation of pain in the extremities or chest, pain duration, and combinations of pain in >1 spinal area. Consequences included reduced physical activity, sick leave, care seeking, change of work, and disability pension. The analysis included a biometric analysis based on the effect of shared genetic and common environmental factors. Furthermore, a bivariate twin model was fitted to identify genetic and environmental correlations.\nAltogether, data on 15,328 twin individuals (44% monozygotic and 56% dizygotic) from complete twin pairs were included. Genetic susceptibility explained approximately 38% of lumbar pain, 32% of thoracic pain, and 39% of neck pain. For patterns of pain, estimates were 7% for lumbar/thoracic, 24% for lumbar/cervical, 0% for thoracic/cervical, and 35% for pain in all 3 areas. Moderate to high genetic correlations indicated a common genetic basis for many spinal pain syndromes. In general, heritability was higher for women, and only a minor age effect was seen.\nHeritability estimates for pain in different spinal regions are quite similar and there is a moderate to high genetic correlation between the phenotypes. This may indicate a common genetic basis for a high proportion of spinal pain.",

The heterokaryotype was an incidental finding from an amniocentesis performed for prenatal diagnosis of beta-thalassaemia major in a pair of dichorionic twins. Monozygocity was revealed by QF-PCR showing identical short tandem repeat markers on chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y. The twins were heterokaryotypic for duplication chromosome 2q13-q23.3, as shown by array comparative genomic hybridization. Selective foeticide was performed. This case demonstrates that heterokaryotypic monozygotic dichorionic twins are a genetic possibility that does occur.",

    "abstract": "Relationships between parenting distress, social support, and sense of competence and negative and positive maternal mood were assessed in 162 mothers with twins younger than 2 years. Women with lower satisfaction scores on the sense of competence scale reported higher negative mood (adjusted R(2) = 21.7%, p < .001). Women with lower parenting distress and higher efficacy scores on the sense of competence scale reported higher positive mood (adjusted R(2) = 39.4%, p < .001). Neither instrumental nor subjective social support contributed to variance in maternal mood. Interventions should be aimed at decreasing parenting distress and increasing sense of competence for mothers of twins.",

We studied the disposition of digoxin, a frequently used probe drug for P-glycoprotein function in humans, in monozygotic (MZ) twins and found that digoxin pharmacokinetics after oral and intravenous administration are highly correlated within MZ twins, supporting the hypothesis of a robust contribution from genetic variance. Our study suggests that studies involving twins could be more widely applied to elucidate pharmacogenetics.",

The long axes of the fetuses were not parallel and they moved independently. Bladder configurations were absent. A fetal membrane from the chorioidal plate was imaged.\nPostmortem pathological examination revealed that the twins were conjoined by way of fused cloacal exstrophy and omphalocele, and the separate amniotic cavities communicated via a fused allantoic cavity. The placenta was monochorionic and diamniotic. DNA analysis of the twins and the placenta confirmed the monozygotic origin.\nVisualization of the amniotic membrane does not rule out conjoined twins in rare cases of monochorionic twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Cytosine-5 methylation within CpG dinucleotides is a potentially important mechanism of epigenetic influence on human traits and disease. In addition to influences of age and gender, genetic control of DNA methylation levels has recently been described. We used whole blood genomic DNA in a twin set (23 MZ twin-pairs and 23 DZ twin-pairs, N = 92) as well as healthy controls (N = 96) to investigate heritability and relationship with age and gender of selected DNA methylation profiles using readily commercially available GoldenGate bead array technology. Despite the inability to detect meaningful methylation differences in the majority of CpG loci due to tissue type and locus selection issues, we found replicable significant associations of DNA methylation with age and gender. We identified associations of genetically heritable single nucleotide polymorphisms with large differences in DNA methylation levels near the polymorphism (cis effects) as well as associations with much smaller differences in DNA methylation levels elsewhere in the human genome (trans effects). Our results demonstrate the feasibility of array-based approaches in studies of DNA methylation and highlight the vast differences between individual loci. The identification of CpG loci of which DNA methylation levels are under genetic control or are related to age or gender will facilitate further studies into the role of DNA methylation and disease.",

We report the case of impairment of retinal function and diffuse pain in both legs often related to physical activity, as well as the presence of acanthocytosis on peripheral blood smear. Neurophysiological studies suggested dysfunction of the thin myelinated (A) and unmyelinated (C) fibers, in spite of preserved A fiber function, which has not been previously described in this condition. All clinical symptoms and the neurophysiological abnormalities improved after high-dose vitamin E and A supplementation. These findings suggest that this syndrome may have a wide spectrum of manifestations and an early appearance of symptoms in the pediatric age group.",

    "abstract": "Pretransplant screening in living donor kidney transplantation includes human leukocyte antigen matching, and panel reactive antibody analysis, whereas T cell mediated anti-donor reactivity is not assessed routinely. We investigated T cell reactivity after living related kidney transplantation between two monocygotic twins and in consequence correlated the withdrawal of individual immunosuppressive medication with immunological findings.\nImmunosuppression consisted of mycophenolate mofetil, glucocorticoid single shot, and induction therapy with antithymocyte immunoglobulin.\nFACS analysis of recipient peripheral blood cells revealed a normal haemogram after transplantation, showing non-activated CD4 and CD8 cells. Mixed lymphocyte reaction did not reveal donor-specific T cell activity. IFN-gamma and IL-10 ELISA of supernatants of recipient cells cocultivated with donor cells support the lack of Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation.\nBased on immunological findings on days 5 and 20 MMF-therapy was reduced and stopped. Immunological monitoring on day 90 confirmed the absence of immune reactions directed against donor tissue.",

    "abstract": "Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) carries a significant risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Serial amnioreduction and fetoscopic laser photocoagulation have decreased perinatal mortality, thereby shifting attention towards short-term and long-term morbidity. Most morbidity occurs within the central nervous system. Ischemic lesions, however, such as congenital skin loss and limb necrosis may occur anywhere in the vasculature of recipient twins. Ischemia may also occur during serial amnioreduction and fetoscopic laser photocoagulation. We report a case of ileal perforation in the donor twin of untreated TTTS. Histopathology showed a focal area of erosion, possibly from ischemia. We also discuss the clinical features of ischemic intestinal complications of TTTS and review the literature.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies offer the opportunity to determine the relative contribution of genes versus environment in traits of interest. Here, we investigate the extent to which variance in brain structure is reduced in monozygous twins with identical genetic make-up. We investigate whether using twins as compared to a control population reduces variability in a number of common magnetic resonance (MR) structural measures, and we investigate the location of areas under major genetic influences. This is fundamental to understanding the benefit of using twins in studies where structure is the phenotype of interest. Twenty-three pairs of healthy MZ twins were compared to matched control pairs. Volume, T2 and diffusion MR imaging were performed as well as spectroscopy (MRS). Images were compared using (i) global measures of standard deviation and effect size, (ii) voxel-based analysis of similarity and (iii) intra-pair correlation. Global measures indicated a consistent increase in structural similarity in twins. The voxel-based and correlation analyses indicated a widespread pattern of increased similarity in twin pairs, particularly in frontal and temporal regions. The areas of increased similarity were most widespread for the diffusion trace and least widespread for T2. MRS showed consistent reduction in metabolite variation that was significant in the temporal lobe N-acetylaspartate (NAA). This study has shown the distribution and magnitude of reduced variability in brain volume, diffusion, T2 and metabolites in twins. The data suggest that evaluation of twins discordant for disease is indeed a valid way to attribute genetic or environmental influences to observed abnormalities in patients since evidence is provided for the underlying assumption of decreased variability in twins.",

    "abstract": "This article examines relationships between reproductive onset and lifetime history of smoking, regular smoking, and nicotine dependence, and cannabis and other illicit drug use.\nData were drawn from a young adult cohort of 3,386 female and 2,751 male Australian twins born between 1964 and 1971. Survival analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression models predicting age at first childbirth from history of substance use or disorder separately by substance class. Other substance use or disorder, including alcohol dependence, as well as sociodemographic characteristics, history of psychopathology, and family and childhood risks, were included as control variables in adjusted models.\nRegular smoking and nicotine dependence were associated with earlier reproduction, with pronounced effects for women. For women, use of cannabis was associated with early reproduction before age 20, and with delayed reproduction among women who have not reproduced by age 20 or 25. Adjustment for control variables only partially explained these associations.\nConsistent with research linking adolescent use with sexual risk taking predictive of early childbearing, regular smokers and nicotine-dependent individuals show earlier reproductive onset. In contrast, delays in childbearing associated with use of cannabis are consistent with impairments in reproductive ability and/or opportunities for reproduction. Continued research on risks both upstream and downstream of substance-use initiation and onset of substance-use disorder is needed for causal mechanisms to be fully understood.",

    "abstract": "The generalist genes hypothesis implies that general cognitive ability (g) is an essential target for understanding how genetic polymorphisms influence the development of the human brain. Using 8,791 twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study, we examine genetic stability and change in the etiology of g assessed by diverse measures during the critical transition from early to middle childhood. The heritability of a latent g factor in early childhood is 23%, whereas shared environment accounts for 74% of the variance. In contrast, in middle childhood, heritability of a latent g factor is 62%, and shared environment accounts for 33%. Despite increasing importance of genetic influences and declining influence of shared environment, similar genetic and shared environmental factors affect g from early to middle childhood, as indicated by a cross-age genetic correlation of .57 and a shared environmental correlation of .65. These findings set constraints on how genetic and environmental variation affects the developing brain.",

    "abstract": "Associations between size at birth, postnatal weight gain, and potential risk for adult disease have been variably explained by in utero exposures or genetic risk that could affect both outcomes. We utilized a twin model to explore these hypotheses.\nOne hundred pairs of healthy twins aged 8.9 yr (range, 7.2-10.9 yr) had fasting blood samples collected, blood pressure (BP) measured, and anthropometry assessed. All measurements were converted to sd scores (SDS) to adjust for age and sex.\nMean birth weights in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins were -0.90 SDS lower than the UK reference. In postnatal life, 58% of monozygotic twins and 59% of dizygotic twins showed rapid weight gain (a change of more than +0.67 in weight SDS) from birth. Postnatal weight gain was positively associated with sum of skinfolds (r = 0.51; P < 0.0005), fasting insulin levels (r = 0.35; P < 0.0005), systolic BP (r = 0.30; P < 0.0005), and diastolic BP (r = 0.15; P < 0.05) at follow-up. Heritability estimates (additive genetic components) were calculated using variance components models for: birth weight, 44%; postnatal weight gain, 80%; childhood height, 89%; body mass index, 72%; sum of skinfolds, 89%; waist circumference, 74%; fasting insulin, 65%; systolic BP, 33%; and diastolic BP, 29%.\nPostnatal weight gain from birth, rather than birth weight, was associated with childhood risk markers for adult metabolic disease. Childhood weight gain was highly heritable, and genetic factors associated with postnatal weight gain are likely to also contribute to risks for adult disease.",

Besides the usual fcc phase of Ag, the heteronanostructures also contain a rare hcp (4H polytypic) phase, which favors asymmetrical growth. The rod-needle heteronanostructures (RNHSs) and plate-belt heteronanostructures (PBHSs) are formed through two different mechanisms. For RNHSs, the 4H and fcc phases coexist but have different densities in different segments, while for PBHSs, the fcc and 4H crystal structures exist in plate and belt segments, respectively. Condition-sensitive coexisting phase preferences can be applied as a new way of controlling the shape and thus the properties of Ag nanostructures.",

    "abstract": "There is a large group of disorders characterized by non-cranial vascular malformations and a dysregulated growth, of which the prototype may be Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS). The aetiology of KTS and vascular malformations-dysregulated growth (VM-DG) syndromes resembling KTS is obscure, but polygenic paradominant inheritance involving mutations or polymorphisms in two or more genes simultaneously, of which one (or more) are involved in (lymph)angiogenesis and the other(s) in growth regulation has been proposed for KTS and related VM-DG entities. This provides an explanation for the variability of the VM-DG syndromes through the numerous possible combinations of mutated genes involved. We report on three monozygotic female twins who are discordant for a VM-DG syndrome resembling KTS. We suggest that our observation is consistent with the concept of polygenic paradominant inheritance involving two or more genes. We discuss the published observations in twins discordant for other disorders associated with disturbed growth regulation such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Silver-Russell syndrome, and the occurrence in cousins with KTS and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which are best explained by an imprinting disturbance. We propose that, similarly, disturbed imprinting plays a role in the pathogenesis of VM-DG syndromes in general, and suggest the same may hold for KTS in sensu strictu or Proteus syndrome. Further studies to investigate imprinting status in VM-DG syndromes, including KTS and Proteus syndrome, are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) twins are at increased risk for perinatal mortality and serious morbidity due to the presence of placental vascular anastomoses. Cerebral injury can be secondary to haemodynamic and hematological disorders during pregnancy (especially twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) or intrauterine co-twin death) or from postnatal injury associated with prematurity and low birth weight, common complications in twin pregnancies. We investigated neurodevelopmental outcome in MC and dichorionic (DC) twins at the age of two years.\nThis was a prospective cohort study. Cerebral palsy (CP) was studied in 182 MC infants and 189 DC infants matched for weight and age at delivery, gender, ethnicity of the mother and study center. After losses to follow-up, 282 of the 366 infants without CP were available to be tested with the Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales at 22 months corrected age, all born between January 2005 and January 2006 in nine perinatal centers in The Netherlands. Due to phenotypic (un)alikeness in mono-or dizygosity, the principal investigator was not blinded to chorionic status; perinatal outcome, with exception of co-twin death, was not known to the examiner.\nFour out of 182 MC infants had CP (2.2%) - two of the four CP-cases were due to complications specific to MC twin pregnancies (TTTS and co-twin death) and the other two cases of CP were the result of cystic PVL after preterm birth - compared to one sibling of a DC twin (0.5%; OR 4.2, 95% CI 0.5-38.2) of unknown origin. Follow-up rate of neurodevelopmental outcome by Griffith's test was 76%. The majority of 2-year-old twins had normal developmental status. There were no significant differences between MC and DC twins. One MC infant (0.7%) had a developmental delay compared to 6 DC infants (4.2%; OR 0.2, 95% 0.0-1.4). Birth weight discordancy did not influence long-term outcome, though the smaller twin had slightly lower developmental scores than its larger co-twin.\nThere were no significant differences in occurrence of cerebral palsy as well as neurodevelopmental outcome between MC and DC twins. Outcome of MC twins seems favourable in the absence of TTTS or co-twin death.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the genetic and environmental influences on apolipoproteins have been conducted, but few have used data from Japanese twins. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare the genetic and environmental causes of individual differences in the serum concentrations of apolipoproteins in Japanese middle-aged twins.\nApo A-I, apo A-II, apo B, apo C-II, apo C-III, and apo E were studied. A total of 142 twin pairs, aged 45 through 65 years, were enrolled: 85 monozygotic pairs (59 male, 26 female) and 57 same-sexed dizygotic pairs (43 male, 14 female). The intraclass correlation coefficient and structural equation modeling were used to estimate the best-fitting model and heritability.\nSixteen percent to 75% of the total variances of apo A-I, apo C-II, and apo C-III were attributable to genetic influence; apo A-I and apo C-II were influenced by dominant genetic factors. Twenty percent to 73% of the total variances of apo A-II, apo B, and apo E were attributable to additive genetic influence; apo B was clearly influenced by common environmental factors. Furthermore, the heritability of all apolipoproteins was higher among females than among males.\nGenetic factors, including additive genetic effects (A) and dominant effects (D), influence apolipoprotein levels. However, a common environment does not influence the variances of these apolipoproteins, with the exception of apo B. Furthermore, the heritability of apolipoprotein phenotypes differs by sex.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic, which refers to heritable differences of genes without changing their DNA sequences, is one of the most important biology phenomena in multicellular eukaryotes. Its research contents involves DNA methylation, genomic imprinting, histone acetylation, histone methylation, chromatin remodeling, pseudogene, and microRNA etc. Monozygotic twins is developed from one single zygote and are genetically identical in genomic DNA sequence. From the view of classical genetics, traditional genetic markers such as short tandem repeat and single nucleotide polymorphism can not play important role in discriminating monozygotic twins. So it is very essential to find new genetic markers. Recent achievements made in epigenetics show that there exist striking differences in monozygotic twins and provide a new strategy to discriminate the monozygotic twins. In this paper, the concepts, research contents of epigenetics and its application perspective in discriminating monozygotic twins are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "We describe our experience with 22 conjoined twins managed from 1974 to 2006.\nRecords of 22 conjoined twins admitted from 1974 to 2006 were reviewed. Interviews with attending physicians were also conducted.\nThere were 11 thoracopagus, 5 omphalopagus, 3 ischiopagus, 2 craniopagus, and 1 pygopagus twins. Five thoracopagus twins were deemed inseparable due to severe cardiac anomalies. One ischiopagus refused separation, and one craniopagus was separated elsewhere. Six twins (three omphalopagus, one each of pygopagus, ischiopagus, and thoracopagus) were separated emergently as neonates; only one twin is a long-term survivor. Mortalities were due to intractable acidosis, sepsis, and hemorrhage. Nine twins (one craniopagus, one ischiopagus, two omphalopagus, five thoracopagus) were electively separated between 9 months and 2 years of age. One set of these thoracopagus twins died of respiratory failure and sepsis post-operatively. A hydrocephalic twin in another thoracopagus twin died intraoperatively. The rest are alive and well.\nEmergency separations yielded dismal results due to poor patient conditions; delay in separation allowed progressive deterioration and resultant poor outcome. Elective separation had more favorable results due to well-planned strategies, team preparedness, and better patient conditions. A multi-disciplinary approach, with parental participation, is integral in the holistic management of conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "Research into the genetic effects and specific genes associated with retinal vascular caliber, a risk marker of cardiovascular diseases, may provide new insights into the genetic contribution of early microvascular disease. A combined 374 monozygotic and 536 dizygotic twin pairs and 322 siblings from the Twins Eye Study in Tasmania and the Brisbane Adolescent Twin Study underwent complete ophthalmic examinations, including retinal photography, and bilateral retinal vascular caliber was measured. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the heritability. Genome-wide linkage analysis was conducted on 836 individuals from 381 Brisbane Adolescent Twin Study families, with adjustments for age, sex, and other covariates. The heritabilities for the retinal arteriolar caliber were 59.4% (95% CI: 53.2% to 64.7%) and 56.5% (95% CI: 50.1% to 61.9%) in the Twins Eye Study in Tasmania and the Brisbane Adolescent Twin Study, respectively, and for venular caliber they were 61.7% (95% CI: 55.6% to 67.0%) and 64.2% (95% CI: 58.7% to 68.8%), respectively, after adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index. Two multipoint peaks detected on chromosomes 3p12.3 and 8p23.1 for retinal arteriolar caliber had suggestive linkage, with the highest multipoint peak logarithm of odds score of 2.24 on chromosome 8p23.1 (genome-wide P=7.0 x 10(-4)). Two suggestive logarithm of odds scores for venular caliber were identified on chromosomes 2p14 and 9q21.13. The largest multipoint logarithm of odds score was 2.69 on chromosome 2p14 (genome-wide P=2.0 x 10(-4)). In this large twin population, genetic factors appear to play a significant role in the variation of retinal vascular caliber. Several putative loci were identified for the retinal vascular caliber.",

    "abstract": "Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) are widely used markers of liver disease. Several population-based cohort studies have found associations of these liver enzymes with all-cause mortality. None of these studies controlled for genetic variation as well as fetal and early life exposure, whether environmental or genetic.\nWe studied the associations of ALT and GGT with all-cause mortality using data for 686 twins (73-94 years old) included in the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins.\nAn increase in 1 logged U/L of GGT was associated with a 15% increase in the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99, 1.32] but there was no strong evidence of an association of ALT with all-cause mortality (HR=1.07, 95% CI 0.82, 1.40) when controlling for potential confounders. In this analysis, the study population was treated as individuals, with similarities between twins accounted for by using robust standard errors. However, an intrapair analysis in which the proportion of twin pairs in which the twin with the higher level of ALT or GGT died first was compared with 50% (expected under the null hypothesis), found no strong evidence that higher ALT or GGT was associated with earlier death within twin pairs; the results were consistent in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins.\ngamma-glutamyltransferase but not ALT predicts mortality among older Danish twins when using traditional methods for controlling for potential confounders and existing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Environmental developmental origins may explain the association, but larger twin studies are required to replicate our findings.",

We calculated genetic and environmental contributions to strabismus based upon a critical review and quantitative meta-analysis of previous strabismus twin studies (n=3418 twin pairs) and calculated contributions to phoria based upon a new twin study (n=307 twin pairs). Our results suggest that genetic liability is necessary to develop strabismus, whereas environmental factors are sufficient to cause most phorias. The different etiologies implied by this work suggest that strabismus and phoria should be carefully distinguished in epidemiological work.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is capable of modulating coordinate expression of large numbers of genes across many different pathways, and may therefore warrant investigation for their potential role between genes and disease phenotype. In a rare set of monozygotic twins discordant for Alzheimer's disease (AD), significantly reduced levels of DNA methylation were observed in temporal neocortex neuronal nuclei of the AD twin. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms may mediate at the molecular level the effects of life events on AD risk, and provide, for the first time, a potential explanation for AD discordance despite genetic similarities.",

    "abstract": "The protein complex AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is believed to play an important role in the regulation of skeletal muscle glucose and lipid metabolism. Defects in the AMPK system might therefore be an important factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to identify genetic and environmental mechanisms involved in the regulation of AMPK expression and activity and to examine the association between AMPK protein levels and activity on the one hand, and glucose and fat metabolism on the other. We investigated skeletal muscle biopsies from 100 young and 82 older mono- and dizygotic nondiabetic twins excised during the basal and insulin-stimulated states of a physiological hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. AMPKalpha1, -alpha2, and -gamma3 mRNA expression was investigated using real-time PCR, and Western blotting was employed to measure protein levels. Multiple regression analyses indicated that skeletal muscle AMPK mRNA and protein expression as well as activity were regulated by sex, age, obesity, and aerobic capacity. Comparison of intraclass correlations on AMPK measurements from mono- and dizygotic twins suggested that skeletal muscle AMPK expression was under minor genetic influence. AMPKgamma3 protein expression and activity were negatively related to whole body glucose uptake through the nonoxidative metabolic pathway and positively related to phosphorylation of glycogen synthase. Our results suggest that skeletal muscle AMPK expression is under minor genetic control but regulated by age and sex and associated with obesity and aerobic capacity. Furthermore, our results indicate a role for gamma3-containing AMPK complexes in downregulation of insulin-stimulated nonoxidative glucose metabolism possibly through inhibition of glycogen synthase activity.",

    "abstract": "To compare preterm birth rate and neonatal outcome in twin gestations randomized to either 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) or placebo.\nWomen with twin gestations between 20-30 weeks were randomized to receive weekly injections of either 250 mg 17P injection (Group I), or placebo (Group II). Maternal and neonatal outcome data was recorded.\nThirty twin intrauterine pregnancies were randomized; 16 received 17P and 14 received placebo. Demographic data as well as past history and gestational age at randomization were equivalent between groups (P = 0.286-0.847). All patients in both groups were Medicaid recipients. The incidence of preterm labor (P = 0.980), and premature rupture of the membranes (P = 0.525) were the same between groups.

    "abstract": "This case study examined case histories, diagnostic features, and treatment response in two 79-year-old male monozygotic (identical) twins with vocal fold bowing, exploring both genetic and environmental factors. DNA concordance was examined via cheek swab. Case histories, videostroboscopy, auditory- and visual-perceptual assessment, electromyography, acoustic measures, and Voice Handicap ratings were undertaken. Both twins underwent surgical intervention and subsequent voice therapy. Monozygosity was confirmed for DNA polymorphisms, with 10 of 10 concordance for STR DNA markers. For both twins, auditory- and visual-perceptual assessments indicated severe bowing, hoarseness, and breathiness, although Twin 1 was judged to be extremely severe. Differences in reference to root-mean-square amplitudes were observed for thyroarytenoid and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles, with smaller relative amplitudes observed for the Twin 1 versus Twin 2. No consistent voice improvement was observed after surgical intervention(s), despite improved mid-membranous vocal fold closure. Marked reductions in Voice Handicap Index total scores were observed after behavioral voice therapy, coinciding with increased mid-membranous and posterior laryngeal (interarytenoid) glottal closure. No substantive differences in acoustic measures were observed. Vocal fold bowing was more severe for Twin 1 versus Twin 2 despite identical heritability factors. Overall voice improvement with treatment was greater for Twin 2 than Twin 1. Environmental factors might partially account for the differences observed between the twins, including variability in their responsiveness to behavioral voice therapy. Voice therapy was useful in improving mid-membranous and posterior laryngeal closure, although dysphonia remained severe in both cases.",

    "abstract": "Osteochondritis dissecans is a lesion of subchondral bone with subsequent involvement of the overlying cartilage. Although the etiology of the disease is unknown, mechanical, traumatic, and ischemic etiologies have been suggested, in addition to developmental and genetic factors. There are several treatment options depending on the stage of the disease and surgeon preference. The use of a fresh osteochondral allograft for treatment of a lesion of the femoral condyle is relatively new, and we report its use in a unique situation involving identical twins who both presented with osteochondritis dissecans of the same anatomic location within 2 years of each other. Since these were identical lesions in identical twins, this commonality supports the suggestion that some genetic component may be present in the etiology, especially in this situation where a genetic connection existed. We recommend genetic studies to determine the extent of genetic influence on the disease.",

    "abstract": "The aims of the study were to compare performance of twins with bipolar disorder (BPD) and healthy co-twins in neuropsychological tests assessing various aspects of executive functioning and to examine the relationship of clinical factors with executive functions. Twenty-six euthymic BPD twins, 19 co-twins, and 114 control twins were examined using the Stroop test, the Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST), the trail making test (TMT), and semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tests. BPD twins and co-twins performed worse than controls in the Stroop test. BPD twins scored lower than controls in semantic fluency. Clinical factors correlated with scores in TMT, WCST, and semantic fluency. Our results suggest that the response inhibition impairment may associate with genetic risk of BPD and represent a potential endophenotype for BPD. The impaired performance in the semantic fluency test among the patients may result from semantic memory retrieval problems.",

    "abstract": "In three studies, a General Factor of Personality (GFP) was found to occupy the apex of the hierarchical structure. In Study 1, a GFP emerged independent of method variance and accounted for 54% of the reliable variance in a multitrait-multimethod assessment of 391 Italian high school students that used self-, teacher-, and parent-ratings on the Big Five Questionnaire - Children. In Study 2, a GFP was found in the seven dimensions of Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory as well as the Big Five of the NEO PI-R, with the GFPtci correlating r = .72 with the GFPneo. These results indicate that the GFP is practically the same in both test batteries, and its existence does not depend on being extracted using the Big Five model. The GFP accounted for 22% of the total variance in these trait measures, which were assessed in 651 pairs of 14- to 30-year-old Japanese twins. In Study 3, a GFP accounted for 32% of the total variance in nine scales derived from the NEO PI-R, the Humor Styles Questionnaire, and the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire assessed in 386 pairs of 18- to 74-year-old Canadian and U.S. twins. The GFP was found to be 50% heritable with high scores indicating openness, conscientiousness, sociability, agreeableness, emotional stability, good humor and emotional intelligence. The possible evolutionary origins of the GFP are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of genetic and environmental contributions to preterm birth is not straightforward in family studies, as etiology could involve both maternal and fetal genes. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are presented as a flexible approach for defining user-specified covariance structures to handle multiple random effects and hierarchical dependencies inherent in children of twin (COT) studies of pregnancy outcomes. The proposed method is easily modified to allow for the study of gestational age as a continuous trait and as a binary outcome reflecting the presence or absence of preterm birth. Estimation of fetal and maternal genetic factors and the effect of the environment are demonstrated using MCMC methods implemented in WinBUGS and maximum likelihood methods in a Virginia COT sample comprising 7,061 births. In summary, although the contribution of maternal and fetal genetic factors was supported using both outcomes, additional births and/or extended relationships are required to precisely estimate both genetic effects simultaneously. We anticipate the flexibility of MCMC methods to handle increasingly complex models to be of particular relevance for the study of birth outcomes.",

Although virtually identical from a genetic point of view, MZ twins show a variable degree of discordance with respect to different features including susceptibility to disease. Discordance has frequently been interpreted in terms of the impact of the environment with genetics. In this sense, accumulated evidence supports the notion that environmental factors can have a long-term effect on epigenetic profiles and influence the susceptibility to disease. In relation with autoimmune diseases, the identification of DNA methylation changes in individuals who develop the disease, and the influence of inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases and histone modification enzymes in the development of autoimmunity are attracting the attention of researchers in the epigenetics field. In this context, the study of discordant MZ twins constitutes an attractive model to further investigate the epigenetic mechanisms involved in their development as well as to dissect the contribution of environmental traits. The implications of novel strategies to map epigenetic profiles and how the use of MZ twins can contribute to dissect the epigenetic component of autoimmune disease are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The effect of breastfeeding on cognitive abilities is examined in the offspring of highly educated women and compared to the effects in women with low or middle educational attainment. All offspring consisted of 12-year old mono- or dizygotic twins and this made it possible to study the effect of breastfeeding on mean cognition scores as well as the moderating effects of breastfeeding on the heritability of variation in cognition. Information on breastfeeding and cognitive ability was available for 6,569 children. Breastfeeding status was prospectively assessed in the first years after birth of the children. Maternal education is positively associated with performance on a standardized test for cognitive ability in offspring. A significant effect of breastfeeding on cognition was also observed. The effect was similar for offspring with mothers with a high, middle, and low educational level. Breast-fed children of highly educated mothers score on average 7.6 point higher on a standardized test of cognitive abilities (CITO test; range 500\u2013550; effects size = .936) than formula-fed children of mothers with a low education. Individual differences in cognition scores are largely accounted for by additive genetic factors (80%) and breastfeeding does not modify the effect of genetic factors in any of the three strata of maternal education. Heritability was slightly lower in children with a mother with a middle-level education.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies suggest positive associations between poor oral health and cardiovascular disease. The authors undertook a prospective study among 15,273 Swedish twins (1963-2000) to examine whether genetic factors underlying the 2 diseases could explain previous associations. They estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals controlling for individual factors and stratifying on twin pairs to control for familial effects. Quantitative genetic analyses estimated genetic correlations between oral diseases and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Tooth loss (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 1.4) and periodontal disease (HR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.4) were associated with small excess risks of cardiovascular disease; periodontal disease was also associated with coronary heart disease (HR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.6). Adjustment for genetic factors in co-twin analyses did not appreciably change estimates. In contrast, tooth loss was more strongly associated with coronary heart disease in twin models (HR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.8) compared with adjusting for individual factors alone (HR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.4). There was evidence of shared genetic factors between cardiovascular disease and tooth loss (r(G) = 0.18) and periodontal disease (r(G) = 0.29). Oral disease was associated with excess cardiovascular disease risk, independent of genetic factors. There appear to be common pathogenetic mechanisms between poor oral health and cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The role of middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak systolic velocity (PSV) has become established in the management of fetal anemia. To date, singleton reference ranges have also been used in twin pregnancies. However, in monochorionic twin pregnancies, normal ranges for cerebral blood flow may differ from those in singletons owing to intertwin blood exchange. We aimed to establish gestational age-specific reference ranges for MCA-PSV in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies, to compare them with previously reported singleton reference ranges, and to establish terms for calculating conditional reference intervals appropriate for individual serial measurements.\nIn a prospective longitudinal study we examined 50 uncomplicated MCDA pregnancies that were recruited between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation. Fetal MCA Doppler waveforms were assessed biweekly from 15 weeks of gestation onwards. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate gestational age-specific reference ranges for MCA-PSV and terms for conditional reference intervals were established.\nBased on 824 observations in 100 fetuses, normative ranges from 15 to 37 weeks of gestation were constructed. Median MCA-PSV increased with advancing gestational age. Measurements between 18 and 37 weeks were comparable to those in singletons. However, before 18 weeks MCA-PSV values were higher in MCDA twin pregnancies compared with singleton references.\nBetween 18 and 37 weeks of gestation, reference ranges of singletons can be used to assess fetal anemia in MCDA twin pregnancies. Prior to 18 weeks the application of singleton references may lead to an increased number of false-positive diagnoses of presumed fetal anemia in MCDA twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Anencephaly occurs in 1.4-4.7 per 10,000 deliveries and is thought to result from failed closure of the anterior neuropore at 24-26 days post fertilization. Among twins, risk for congenital malformations is greatest among monozygotic twins. Several occurrences of twin pairs being discordant for neural tube defects have been reported: 1 twin affected with anencephaly and co-twin affected with holoprosencephaly, spina bifida or encephalocele, is consistent with a multifactorial pattern of inheritance. We present an instance of monochorionic diamniotic twins concordant for anencephaly.\nAn 18-year-old, gravida 1, para 0, Caucasian woman presented with monochorionic diamniotic twin gestation at 22 weeks. Prenatal ultrasound identified polyhydramnios, anencephaly, ventricular septal defect and suspected rocker-bottom feet in twin A. Twin B was identified as anencephalic, with left renal agenesis and spinal distortion visualized on ultrasound. Postnatal cytogenetic evaluations of placenta, umbilical cord blood and fetal skin samples from both twins revealed 46,XX karyotypes.\nA rare case of a monochorionic diamniotic gestation concordant for anencephaly is presented. Previously published reports of concordant twin anencephaly have postulated a possible autosomal recessive or multifactorial mode of inheritance. Subsequent pregnancies with anencephaly or other open neural tube defects would indicate a mendelian process.",

    "abstract": "Activity level (AL) is a highly salient feature of child behaviour that has been linked to developmental outcome. Twin studies of parent-rated, observer-rated and mechanically assessed AL in childhood find that AL is genetically influenced. Few studies, however, consider whether different methods of assessing AL have a shared genetic etiology. Those that do, confound methods and situations. The present study examined whether actigraph and rater-based (parent, observer) measures of AL tap the same genetic influences in a sample of 312 2-year-old twin pairs. Methods were studied within the same situation, thereby controlling for situational influences on AL. The genetic correlation between actigraph and parent-rated AL in the home was .38, indicating modest genetic overlap between the two methods. In contrast, the correlation of genetic effects on actigraph and observer-rated AL in the laboratory was .95, indicating that both laboratory-based measures of AL are influenced by the same genetic effects.",

After an extensive history of infertility with multiple unsuccessful treatments, a 42-year-old woman gave birth to healthy twins following transfer of three embryos from two different donor sources.

Optimism, mental, and self-rated health were measured in 3,053 twin individuals (501 MZF, 153 MZM, 274 DZF, 77 DZM, and 242 DZ opposite-sex twin pairs and 561 single twins) over 50 years using the life orientation test, the General Health Questionnaire and a single-item question for self-rated health. Additive genetic factors explained 36, 34, and 46% of the variation in optimism, mental, and self-rated health, respectively, with the remainder being due to non-shared environmental influences. Genetic influences accounted for most of the covariance between the variables (14-20% of the genetic variance) indicating that in older adults genes predisposing to high optimism also predispose to good mental health and self-rated health.",

    "abstract": "Smoking is the main risk factor for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) but genetic factors are of importance, since only a subset of smokers develops the disease. Sex differences have been suggested both in disease prevalence and response to environmental exposures. Furthermore, it has been shown that acquisition of 'addiction' to smoking is partly genetically mediated. Disease cases and smoking habits were identified in 44919 twins aged >40 years from the Swedish Twin Registry. Disease was defined as self-reported chronic bronchitis or emphysema, or recurrent cough with phlegm. The results showed that chronic bronchitis seems to be more prevalent among females, and that the heritability estimate for chronic bronchitis was a moderate 40% and only 14% of the genetic influences were shared by smoking. In addition, 392 twins have been invited to a clinical investigation to evaluate: (i) to what extent genetic factors contribute to individual differences (variation) in FEV(1) (forced expiratory volume in 1 s), vital capacity and DL(CO) (diffusion capacity), taking sex into consideration, and (ii) whether smoking behaviour and respiratory symptoms influence these estimates.",

    "abstract": "Investigating neuroanatomic differences in monozygotic twins who are discordant for autism can help unravel the relative contributions of genetics and environment to this pervasive developmental disorder. The authors used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate several brain regions of interest in monozygotic twins who varied in degree of phenotypic discordance for narrowly defined autism.\nThe subjects were 14 pairs of monozygotic twins between the ages of 5 and 14 years old and 14 singleton age- and gender-matched typically developing comparison subjects. The monozygotic twin group was a cohort of children with narrowly defined autistic deficits and their co-twins who presented with varying levels of autistic deficits. High-resolution MRIs were acquired and volumetric/area measurements obtained for the frontal lobe, amygdala, and hippocampus and subregions of the prefrontal cortex, corpus callosum, and cerebellar vermis.\nNo neurovolumetric/area differences were found between twin pairs. Relative to typically developing comparison subjects, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volumes and anterior areas of the corpus callosum were significantly altered in autistic twins, and volumes of the posterior vermis were altered in both autistic twins and co-twins. Intraclass correlation analysis of brain volumes between children with autism and their co-twins indicated that the degree of within-pair neuroanatomic concordance varied with brain region. In the group of subjects with narrowly defined autism only, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and posterior vermis volumes were significantly associated with the severity of autism based on scores from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic.\nThese findings support previous research demonstrating alterations in the prefrontal cortex, corpus callosum, and posterior vermis in children with autism and further suggest that alterations are associated with the severity of the autism phenotype. Continued research involving twins who are concordant and discordant for autism is essential to disentangle the genetic and environmental contributions to autism.",

    "abstract": "To explore the program of preoperative evaluation, preoperative preparation and separation operation of pygopagus conjoined twins.\nClinical data of one case of pygopagus (male, gestational age 37 weeks, uterine-incision delivery, 3.5 months old; twins of triplets; total body weight 8.0 kg. The twins have self-governed extremities, anus, penis. Four limbs can move independently). Separated successfully were analyzed. The auxiliary examination of X-rays, MRI, ultrasound, CT and 3D reconstruction, sensory evoked potential showed that there were process hypoplasia and lamina bifid of lumbosacral vertebrae below L3. Dural sac connected below L3 and conus medullaris located at L3. There were no conjunction of spinal cord and cauda equine. The decision of direct suture of dural sac was made by preoperative evaluation through measurement of circumference and area of conjoined dural sac. The separation surgery program was decided through team debate and sham operation. Separation operation was performed under the general anaesthesia. Crossing V-shaped skin flap was used to cover the wound surface. The dura of conjoined twins were sutured directly. The tension of skin flap was normal postoperative with continuing negative pressure drainage under the flap and pressure sterilized dressing.\nSuccessful separation of pygopagus conjoined twins was achieved. Lower extremities movements of separated twins were normal 6 h after operation. The drainage was removed 1 day postoperative, blood supplies of skin flap were normal. There were no complications of infection, cerebrospinal fluid leakage and neurological deficit. The healing of the skin flap was good. With 6 months follow-up, the growth and neurological function were normal.\nConsummate preoperative preparation, accurate preoperative investigations, meticulous operative management, careful postoperative administration and good team cooperation are the keys to successful separation of pygopagus conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "The association between abdominal obesity and atherogenic lipid profile emerges from complex interactions of genes and environment. We aimed to explore the heritability and effects of overweight on serum lipid profile (high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), HDL mean particle size, percentages of HDL(2b, 2a, 3a, 3b, and 3c,) low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), LDL peak particle size and triglycerides (TGs)) in healthy, young adults. HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG were measured in 52 monozygotic (MZ) and 89 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, aged 23-32 years, chosen to represent a wide range of BMIs (17.6-42.9 kg/m2). Of them, 24 MZ and 26 DZ pairs were chosen at random for measurements of HDL mean and LDL peak particle sizes and percentages of HDL subspecies. The heritabilities of the lipid parameters adjusted for BMI were HDL-C 73%, HDL mean particle size 56%, HDL subspecies 46-63%, LDL-C 79%, LDL peak particle size 49%, and TG 64%. Genetic and environmental correlations between BMI and HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG were modest (0.3-0.4). Abdominal overweight (waist circumference>or=94 cm for males and >or=80 cm for females) associated with decreased HDL-C, increased LDL-C, and TG concentrations, smaller HDL mean particle size, lower HDL2b, and higher HDL3c percentages in both genders. Within MZ twins, controlling for genetic influences, within-pair differences in HDL3c percentage were associated with those in waist (r=0.46, P=0.032) and BMI (r=0.51, P=0.013). In conclusion, serum lipid parameters, including LDL peak and HDL mean particle sizes and HDL subspecies distribution are under strong genetic control. Overweight associated with significant lipid profile changes, particularly, small HDL3c increased in overweight independent of genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "Pseudo-merohedral twins are frequently observed in crystals displaying pseudo-symmetry. In these crystals, many [u v w] zone axis electron diffraction patterns are very close and can only be distinguished from intensity considerations. On conventional diffraction patterns (selected-area electron diffraction or microdiffraction), a strong dynamical behaviour averages the diffracted intensities so that only the positions of the reflections on a pattern can be considered. On precession electron diffraction patterns, the diffracted beams display an integrated intensity and a \"few-beam\" or \"systematic row\" behaviour prevails which strongly reduces the dynamical interactions. Therefore the diffracted intensity can be taken into account. A procedure based on observation of the weak extra-reflections connected with the pseudo-symmetry is given to identify without ambiguity any zone axis. It is successfully applied to the identification and characterization of {1 2 1} reflection twins present in the LaGaO(3) perovskite.",

There were no complications of infection, cerebrospinal fluid leakage and neurological deficit. The healing of the skin flap was good. With 6 months follow-up, the growth and neurological function were normal.",

    "abstract": "Our previous investigation found that the same genes influence poor reading and mathematics performance in 10-year-olds. Here we assess whether this finding extends to language and general cognitive disabilities, as well as replicating the earlier finding for reading and mathematics in an older and larger sample.\nUsing a representative sample of 4000 pairs of 12-year-old twins from the UK Twins Early Development Study, we investigated the genetic and environmental overlap between internet-based batteries of language and general cognitive ability tests in addition to tests of reading and mathematics for the bottom 15% of the distribution using DeFries-Fulker extremes analysis. We compared these results to those for the entire distribution.\nAll four traits were highly correlated at the low extreme (average group phenotypic correlation = .58). and in the entire distribution (average phenotypic correlation = .59). Genetic correlations for the low extreme were consistently high (average = .67), and non-shared environmental correlations were modest (average = .23). These results are similar to those seen across the entire distribution (.68 and .23, respectively).\nThe 'Generalist Genes Hypothesis' holds for language and general cognitive disabilities, as well as reading and mathematics disabilities. Genetic correlations were high, indicating a strong degree of overlap in genetic influences on these diverse traits. In contrast, non-shared environmental influences were largely specific to each trait, causing phenotypic differentiation of traits.",

Furthermore, both twins were found to have blood chimerism. We also review the literature on dizygotic-monochorionic twins and blood-chimerism.

The contributions of genetic and environmental influences to individual EEG parameters were estimated using structural equation modeling.\nThe alpha rhythm parameters - both spectral amplitude and frequency - were influenced mainly by genetic factors. Theta spectral amplitude variance was presumably accounted for by both genetic and shared environmental factors. The difference in the nature of population variance between EEG alpha and theta band spectral amplitudes was reproduced for two identical functional loads: Closed eyes and Darkness.\nThe majority of EEG spectral parameters in preschool children are determined by genetic factors. Tentative finding on systematic environmental influences on theta spectral amplitude under the condition of reduced visual input may point to the role of experience in the individual differences in the functioning of theta response system.\nThe findings contribute to the scanty knowledge about the heritability of EEG rhythms in preschool children.",

    "abstract": "Selective resuscitation refers to the practice of providing resuscitative efforts to one or some (but not all) infants born in the setting of multiple gestation. When one fetus is known to have a severe anomaly or severe growth restriction, parents are sometimes offered this option. In the setting of extreme prematurity, in the absence of an anomaly or severe growth restriction, parents are generally expected to make one unified decision for all the infants involved. The introduction of the Outcome Estimator, a tool that provides the ability to make individual outcome predictions for each fetus in a multiple gestation at borderline gestational age, based on contributing variables such as weight and gender, has led to the ethical dilemma of whether parents in this setting should also be offered the option of selective resuscitation. No convincing ethical argument for denying the parents the right to decide for each individual infant is apparent.",

    "abstract": "A relation between birth weight and adult body composition has been reported in singleton populations, especially when more accurate measures of body composition, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were used. It remains uncertain whether this is mediated by a direct effect of fetal nutrition, through factors in the shared environment, or through genetic factors.\nThe objective was to investigate the relation between birth weight and body composition with the use of a co-twin design.\nDXA measurements and birth weights were available for 2228 dizygotic and 842 monozygotic female twins aged between 18 and 80 y. Multivariate regression models were used to identify both individual specific relations and those mediated through the shared environment.\nSignificant relations were found between birth weight and DXA measures for individuals. A 1-kg increase in birth weight was associated with a 1.72-kg increase in lean mass, a 0.25-kg increase in fat mass, and a 0.05-unit increase in the lean:fat mass ratio. Within twin pairs, the analysis showed that associations between birth weight and absolute levels of lean and fat mass were mediated through individual-specific effects, whereas the relation between birth weight and the proportion of lean to fat mass was mediated purely through factors common to twin pairs.\nA higher birth weight is associated with a higher proportion of lean to fat mass as adults. However, these analyses suggest that this association is not determined by individual specific factors in utero (eg, fetal nutrition) but through factors in the shared common environment of the twins.",

In males (47.4% of subjects), the mean (SD) 25(OH)D level was 12.1 (4.2) ng/ml in non-summer and 27.4 (8.8) ng/ml in summer; in females, it was 10.1 (4.1) ng/ml in non-summer and 19.5 (6.3) ng/ml in summer. A multivariate model that included gender, age, season, physical activity, and student status demonstrated that male gender, summer season, and high physical activity significantly increased 25(OH)D levels. Summer season and male gender also significantly decreased the risk of being in the lowest 25(OH)D tertile. Overall, 68.9% of the variability in 25(OH)D level was attributable to additive genetic influence. Stratification by gender found that in males, 85.9% of the variability in 25(OH)D level was attributable to such influence, but in females, it was only 17%.\nIn this sample of rural Chinese adolescents, 25(OH)D level was influenced by gender, season, and physical activity level. There was a strong genetic influence on 25(OH)D level in males only.",

A multivariate model that included gender, age, season, physical activity, and student status demonstrated that male gender, summer season, and high physical activity significantly increased 25(OH)D levels. Summer season and male gender also significantly decreased the risk of being in the lowest 25(OH)D tertile. Overall, 68.9% of the variability in 25(OH)D level was attributable to additive genetic influence. Stratification by gender found that in males, 85.9% of the variability in 25(OH)D level was attributable to such influence, but in females, it was only 17%.",

    "abstract": "The ages of onset in multiple sclerosis cases span more than 7 decades. Data are presented for affected relative pairs from a Canadian population base of 30,000 multiple sclerosis index cases (1993-2008). The effects of genetic sharing, parent of origin, intergenerational versus collinear differences, and gender on the ages of onset were evaluated in the following concordant pairs: monozygotic twins (n = 29), dizygotic twins (n = 10), siblings (n = 614), first cousins (n = 405), half siblings (n = 29), parent/child (n = 285), and aunt/uncle/niece/nephew (avunculars) (n = 289). Fisher's z test assessed intraclass correlation (r) for ages of onset. Correlations for monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, full siblings, and first cousins were 0.60, 0.54, 0.20, and 0.10, respectively. Dizygotic twins resembled monozygotic twins more than siblings. The age-of-onset correlation for maternal half siblings (r = 0.37) was higher than that for paternal half siblings (r = 0.26), consistent with other observations suggesting an intrauterine environmental effect on multiple sclerosis risk. Intergenerational comparisons are complicated by substantial increases of multiple sclerosis incidence over time. Genetic loading (familial vs. sporadic cases) did not generally influence the age of onset, but correlation of age of onset in multiple sclerosis relative pairs was proportional to genetic sharing. A maternal parent-of-origin effect on the age of onset in collinear generations was suggested.",

    "abstract": "One known genetic mechanism for transient neonatal diabetes is loss of methylation at 6q24. The etiology of prune belly sequence is unknown but a genetic defect, affecting the mesoderm from which the triad abdominal muscle hypoplasia, urinary tract abnormalities, and cryptorchidism develop, has been suggested. We investigated a family, including one twin, with transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence. Autoantibody tests excluded type 1 diabetes. Microsatellite marker analysis confirmed the twins being monozygotic. We identified no mutations in ZFP57, KCNJ11, ABCC8, GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF3B, IPF1, PAX4, or ZIC3. The proband had loss of methylation at the 6q24 locus TNDM and also at the loci IGF2R, DIRAS3, and PEG1, while the other family members, including the healthy monozygotic twin, had normal findings. The loss of methylation on chromosome 6q24 and elsewhere may indicate a generalized maternal hypomethylation syndrome, which accounts for both transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twin pregnancies (MC) are associated with a higher risk of complications than their bichorionic equivalents. When two fetuses share the same placenta, the two fetal circulations are closely bound by omnipresent vascular anastomoses. The determination of the chorionicity is essential for an adequate management of these particular pregnancies. The twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is one of the. possible complications and must be considered as an obstetrical emergency. Severe growth restriction of one twin occurs in 11% of MC pregnancies. Before the limit of viability, in some of the cases, selective foeticide using particular methods are mandatory to preserve the wellbeing of the healthy twin. The invasive procedures carried out at the time these complications occur proved their effectiveness, under the condition of being applied by experienced experts. Laser coagulation, TTTS gold standard treatment, is associated with a fetal survival rate equal or higher than 75%. Among MC twins, selective foeticide with bipolar cord coagulation allows an intact survival rate of the other twin in more than 75 to 80% of the cases.",

    "abstract": "The physiological serum levels of steroids and pituitary hormones in older men and women have been sparsely reported in the literature.\nThe aims of this study were to investigate the normal variation and sex differences in steroids and pituitary hormones in those aged >70 years, and to study the interrelation between these hormones and indicators of the metabolic syndrome, inflammatory activity, and renal function.\nThe investigation comprised a population-based sample of pairs of white opposite-sex twins from the Swedish Twin Registry. At baseline in 1996 and at the 8-year follow-uup in 2004, serum levels of progesterone, cortisol, testosterone, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), and urea were analyzed. Serum levels of insulin and cystatin were analyzed only at the follow-up.\nThe study sample included 219 men and 183 women aged 71 to 80 years (mean [SD], 74.5 [2.5] years) at baseline in 1996, and 127 men and 135 women at follow-uup in 2004. At baseline, in both men and women, the variation of progesterone in serum was positively correlated with that of estradiol (men: r = 0.226, P < 0.01; women: r = 0.115, P = NS), testosterone (men: r = 0.178, P < 0.01; women: r = 0.315, P < 0.001), and cortisol (men: r = 0.314, P < 0.001; women: r = 0.296, P < 0.001). The values of progesterone and other steroid hormones were associated with markers of insulin resistance (iie, insulin, waist circumference), inflammatory activity (ie, CRP) for progesterone (men: r = 0.267, P < 0.001; women: r = 0.150, P < 0.05), and renal function (ie, creatinine) for progesterone (men: r = 0.424, P < 0.001; women: r = 0.212, P < 0.01). Estradiol and prolactin were associated with insulin resistance, inflammation, and renal function. Furthermore, progesterone was associated with prolactin (men: r = 0.275, P < 0.001; women: r = 0.172, P < 0.05).. Among both men and women, there was a strong correlation between testosterone and estradiol (men: r = 0.753, P < 0.001; women: r = 0.526, P < 0.001); in women, there was also a link between testosterone and cortisol at follow-up (r = 0.340, P < 0.01). For progesterone, there was a significant correlation between the values of the co-twins (in 1996: r = 0.16, P < 0.05; in 2004: r = 0.45, P < 0.001). Higher serum levels of progesterone (2.0 [0.7] nmol/L in men and 1.7 [0.8] nmol/L in women) and prolactin (6 [5] microg/L in men and 8 [10] microg/L in women) were found among those who were deceased at follow-up compared with survivors (progesterone: 1.8 [0.5] nmol/L in men and 1.4 [0.6] nmol/L in women, P < 0.01; prolactin: 4 [3] microg/L in men and 5 [2] microg/L in women, P < 0.001).\nIn this study of opposite-sex Swedish twins aged >70 years, there was a sex difference in the serum levels of steroids and pituitary hormones between men and women. Progesterone and other steroid hormones were associated with markers of insulin resistance, inflammatory activity, and renal function. Progesterone and prolactin levels were associated with increased risk of mortality in this sample.",

    "abstract": "The Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a growth disorder for which an increased frequency of monozygotic (MZ) twinning has been reported. With few exceptions, these twins are discordant for BWS and for females. Here, we describe the molecular and phenotypic analysis of 12 BWS twins and a triplet; seven twins are MZ, monochorionic and diamniotic, three twins are MZ, dichorionic and diamniotic and three twins are dizygotic. Twelve twins are female. In the majority of the twin pairs (11 of 13), the defect on chromosome 11p15 was hypomethylation of the paternal allele of DMR2. In 5 of 10 twins, there was additional hypomethylation of imprinted loci; in most cases, the loci affected were maternally methylated, but in two cases, hypomethylation of the paternally methylated DLK1 and H19 DMRs was detected, a novel finding in BWS. In buccal swabs of the MZ twins who share a placenta, the defect was present only in the affected twin; comparable hypomethylation in lymphocytes was detected in both the twins. The level of hypomethylation reached levels below 25%. The exchange of blood cells through vascular connections cannot fully explain the degree of hypomethylation found in the blood cell of the non-affected twin. We propose an additional mechanism through which sharing of aberrant methylation patterns in discordant twins, limited to blood cells, might occur. In a BWS-discordant MZ triplet, an intermediate level of demethylation was found in one of the non-affected sibs; this child showed mild signs of BWS. This finding supports the theory that a methylation error proceeds and possibly triggers the twinning process.",

    "abstract": "Chronic fatiguing illness remains a poorly understood syndrome of unknown pathogenesis. We attempted to identify biomarkers for chronic fatiguing illness using microarrays to query the transcriptome in peripheral blood leukocytes.\nCases were 44 individuals who were clinically evaluated and found to meet standard international criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome or idiopathic chronic fatigue, and controls were their monozygotic co-twins who were clinically evaluated and never had even one month of impairing fatigue. Biological sampling conditions were standardized and RNA stabilizing media were used. These methodological features provide rigorous control for bias resulting from case-control mismatched ancestry and experimental error. Individual gene expression profiles were assessed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.\nThere were no significant differences in gene expression for any transcript.\nContrary to our expectations, we were unable to identify a biomarker for chronic fatiguing illness in the transcriptome of peripheral blood leukocytes suggesting that positive findings in prior studies may have resulted from experimental bias.",

    "abstract": "Males and females often have different requirements during early development, leading to sex-specific interactions between developing offspring. In polytocous mammals, competition for limited resources in utero may be asymmetrical between the sexes, and androgens produced by male foetuses could have adverse effects on the development of females, with potentially long-lasting consequences. We show here, in an unmanaged population of Soay sheep, that female lambs with a male co-twin have reduced birth weight relative to those with a female co-twin, while there was no such effect in male twins. In addition, females with a male co-twin had lower lifetime breeding success, which appeared to be mainly driven by differences in first-year survival. These results show that sex-specific sibling interactions can have long-term consequences for survival and reproduction, with potentially important implications for optimal sex allocation.",

    "abstract": "This study tested whether history of depression is associated with an increased likelihood of dementia, and whether a first depressive episode earlier in life is associated with increased dementia risk, or whether only depressive episodes close in time to dementia onset are related to dementia. Depression information came from national hospital discharge registries, medical history, and medical records. Dementia was diagnosed clinically. In case-control results, individuals with recent registry-identified depression were 3.9 times more likely than those with no registry-identified depression history to have dementia, whereas registry-identified depression earlier in life was not associated with dementia risk. Each 1-year increase in time between depression onset and dementia onset or equivalent age decreased the likelihood of dementia by 8.4%. In co-twin control analyses, twins with prior depression were 3.0 times more likely to have dementia than their nondepressed twin partners, with a similar age of depression gradient. These findings suggest that after partially controlling for genetic influences, late-life depression for many individuals may be a prodrome rather than a risk factor for dementia.",

    "abstract": "Studies of cerebral asymmetry can open doors to understanding the functional specialization of each brain hemisphere, and how this is altered in disease. Here we examined hemispheric asymmetries in fiber architecture using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 100 subjects, using high-dimensional fluid warping to disentangle shape differences from measures sensitive to myelination. Confounding effects of purely structural asymmetries were reduced by using co-registered structural images to fluidly warp 3D maps of fiber characteristics (fractional and geodesic anisotropy) to a structurally symmetric minimal deformation template (MDT). We performed a quantitative genetic analysis on 100 subjects to determine whether the sources of the remaining signal asymmetries were primarily genetic or environmental. A twin design was used to identify the heritable features of fiber asymmetry in various regions of interest, to further assist in the discovery of genes influencing brain micro-architecture and brain lateralization. Genetic influences and left/right asymmetries were detected in the fiber architecture of the frontal lobes, with minor differences depending on the choice of registration template.",

    "abstract": "The chiral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ritodrine in patients pregnant with singletons and twins were investigated to determine the optimal use of ritodrine.\nEight and 20 patients with threatened preterm delivery of singletons and twins, respectively, were infused with ritodrine diastereomers. Serum concentrations of the drug were then measured using a newly developed method of chiral high-performance liquid chromatography.\nAlmost double the dosage of racemic ritodrine was required to prolong pregnancies with twins compared with those of singletons (2.20 +/- 1.06 vs. 1.24 +/- 0.36 microg/min per kilogram; p < 0.0001). The mean ratios of (-)-ritodrine to (+)-ritodrine in singleton and twin pregnancies were 1.17 +/- 0.10 and 1.16 +/- 0.10, respectively. However, the serum concentration and dosage ratio (C/D ratio) of (-)-ritodrine as significantly higher than that of (+)-ritodrine (p < 0.0001), whereas the clearance of (-)-ritodrine was significantly lower than that of (+)-ritodrine (p < 0.0001). A comparison of the gestation period (weeks) and diastereomer clearance did not reveal significant regression in the total analysis of the data obtained from singleton and twin pregnancies.\nThese results indicate that the clinical effectiveness of ritodrine diastereomers should be evaluated and that administration guidelines should be established based upon serum concentrations so that ritodrine can be more effectively administered to pregnant patients carrying either singletons or twins.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the association between normative repetitive routines of childhood and paediatric obsessive compulsive symptom syndrome (OCSS) and the extent to which it is genetically mediated.\nIn a two-phase design a community sample of 4,662 6-year-old twin-pairs were sampled and 854 pairs were assessed in the second phase for normative repetitive routines using the Childhood Routines Inventory (CRI) and for OCSS by maternal-informant diagnostic interview. The OCSS phenotype was defined using standard diagnostic criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, though regardless of impairment.\nIn the bivariate model, correlation between the CRI defined phenotype and the OCSS phenotype was estimated to be .40 (95% CI .27-.50), and this correlation was attributable wholly to additive genetic effects. The bivariate model also provided estimates of heritability of the two phenotypes separately: 55% (95% CI 80-89%) for the OCSS phenotype, with the remaining variance attributable mainly to non-shared environment, and 50% (95% CI 39-62%) for CRI assessed normative repetitive routines of childhood, with 36% of the remaining variance attributable to shared environment and 14% to non-shared.\nThe moderate correlation between normative childhood repetitive routines and obsessive compulsive symptomatology, attributable to genetic factors, is consistent with the hypothesis that high levels of this trait in young children constitute a risk factor for the development of obsessive compulsive symptoms.",

    "abstract": "In twin studies of cardiovascular disease biomarkers the dizygotic correlations are often estimated to be less than half of monozygotic correlations indicating a potential influence of nonadditive genetic factors. Using a large and homogenous sample, we estimated the additive and dominance genetic influences on levels of high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, hemoglobin Alc and c-reactive protein, all of which are biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease. The blood biomarkers were measured on 12,000 Swedish twins born between 1911 and 1958. The large sample allowed us to obtain heritability estimates with considerable precision and provided adequate statistical power for estimation of dominance genetic components. Our study showed complete absence of the shared environment component for the investigated traits. Dominant genetic component was shown to be significant for low density lipoprotein (0.18), glucose (0.31), Hemoglobin Alc (0.55), and c-reactive protein (0.27). To our knowledge, this is the first statistically significant evidence for dominance genetic variance found for low density lipoprotein, glucose, hemoglobin Alc, and c-reactive protein in a population based twin sample. The study highlights the importance of acknowledging nonadditive genes underlying the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "A pair of 2-year-old female monozygotic twins presented with short and brittle hair. There was marked reduction in hair density, and excessive curving of the eyelashes. Onychodystrophy was also evident. They also had developmental delay in verbal and motor skills. Neither their parents nor other relatives were known to be affected, and there was no history of consanguinity. Examination of the hair shaft under light microscopy showed trichoschisis, which was more evident under electron microscopy. Under polarized light, the hair shafts showed the pathognomonic 'tiger-tail' pattern. The level of sulphur in the hair was low. Both patients were negative for TTDN1 mutation. Clinical correlation was performed and the diagnosis of Sabinas syndrome was made. Sabinas syndrome is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder first described in a group of patients from a small community in north-eastern Mexico. It is diagnosable at birth, and its major symptoms include brittle hair, mental retardation and nail dysplasia. Structural hair abnormalities are seen by both light and electron microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) are applied in technical processes for the synthesis of chiral cyanohydrins. Here we describe the thorough characterization of the recently discovered R-hydroxynitrile lyase from Arabidopsis thaliana and its S-selective counterpart from Manihot esculenta (MeHNL) concerning their properties relevant for technical applications. The results are compared to available data of the structurally related S-HNL from Hevea brasiliensis (HbHNL), which is frequently applied in technical processes. Whereas substrate ranges are highly similar for all three enzymes, the stability of MeHNL with respect to higher temperature and low pH-values is superior to the other HNLs with alpha/beta-hydrolase fold. This enhanced stability is supposed to be due to the ability of MeHNL to form tetramers in solution, while HbHNL and AtHNL are dimers. The different inactivation pathways, deduced by means of circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence and static light scattering further support these results. Our data suggest different possibilities to stabilize MeHNL and AtHNL for technical applications: whereas the application of crude cell extracts is appropriate for MeHNL, AtHNL is stabilized by addition of polyols. In addition, the molecular reason for the inhibition of MeHNL and HbHNL by acetate could be elucidated, whereas no such inhibition was observed with AtHNL.",

    "abstract": "Both genetic factors and environmental factors are suggested to play a role in the aetiology of inhibitor development in patients with severe haemophilia A. Monozygotic twins are ideal candidates to study the influence of environmental factors. We describe a pair of 3-year-old monozygotic twin brothers with severe haemophilia A. Prenatal diagnosis confirmed the presence of an intron 22 inversion. Other patient-related factors such as birth weight, vaccinations and the duration of breastfeeding were similar. At the age of 7 months, one boy suffered from a spontaneous subdural haematoma, which needed complete correction of haemostasis with continuous infusion of a third-generation recombinant factor VIII. A persistent high-titre inhibitor with severe clinical symptoms developed, that could only be eradicated with high-dose immune tolerance induction (ITI) for 36 months in combination with rituximab therapy. His twin brother first received treatment at 9 months of age with the same FVIII product. After treatment on nine exposure days, he developed a low-titre inhibitor at the age of 14.5 months. Unlike his brother, he was tolerized without difficulties with low-dose ITI within 2 months. The discordant antibody responses were underlined by dissimilar IgG1 and IgG4 levels in their plasma. The discordant immune response to FVIII in this pair of monozygotic twin brothers seemed to be related to intensity of treatment and severity of bleeds. This confirms that these environmental factors play an additional role in the development of inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Sulcus vocalis is the presence of a groove extending along the vibratory surface of a vocal fold and may result in dysphonia. Depending on the level of severity, this condition may require treatment involving complicated surgical techniques. Cases of sulcus vocalis are classified as physiological, vergeture, or pouch type. A clear explanation of the etiology has not been established, and the currently proposed congenital origin, as described in the literature, remains controversial. This paper presents findings from monozygotic twin sisters with bilateral sulcus vocalis; these patients had similar morphologies, vibratory characteristics, and vocal quality measurements, which support the theory of a congenital etiology.",

    "abstract": "There is significant attention to the growing elderly African American population and estimating who and how many within this population will be affected by cognitive impairment.\nThe etiology of cognitive impairment has not been well studied in African Americans and the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to cognitive impairment is not clear.\nWe calculated concordance rates and heritability for cognitive impairment in 95 same-sexed pairs of African American twins from the Carolina African American Twin Study on Aging (CAATSA). The sample had an average age of 59.6 years (SD = 8.6 years, range 50-88 years) and 60% were female. The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) was used to assess cognitive impairment with a lower cutoff based on our previous research with African Americans.\nThirteen of the monozygotic (MZ) twins (30.2%) and 9 of the dizygotic (DZ) twins (17.3%) were cognitively impaired. The concordance rate was 72% for MZ and 45% for DZ. We found the heritability for cognitive impairment to be 54%.\nThe study findings indicate that cognitive impairment is highly heritable, suggesting that genetics may play a relatively large role in the development of cognitive impairment in African American twins.",

    "abstract": "It is assumed that attention problems (AP) are related to impaired executive functioning. We investigated the association between AP and inhibitory control and tested to what extent the association was due to genetic factors shared with IQ. Data were available from 3 independent samples of 9-, 12-, and 18-year-old twins and their siblings (1,209 participants). AP were assessed with checklists completed by multiple informants. Inhibitory control was measured with the Stroop Color Word Task (Stroop, 1935), and IQ with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Wechsler et al., 2002) or Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Wechsler, 1997). AP and inhibitory control were only correlated in the 12-year-old cohort (r = .18), but appeared non-significant after controlling for IQ. Significant correlations existed between AP and IQ in 9- and 12-year olds (r = -.26/-.34). Inhibitory control and IQ were correlated in all cohorts (r = -.16, -.24 and -.35, respectively). Genetic factors that influenced IQ also influenced inhibitory control. We conclude that the association between AP and inhibitory control as reported in the literature may largely derive from genetic factors that are shared with IQ.",

    "abstract": "Concordance of MLL-rearranged acute leukemia in infant monozygotic twins is thought to be 100% with a very short latency period, suggesting that either the MLL fusion itself is sufficient to cause leukemia or that it promotes the rapid acquisition of additional oncogenic events that result in overt disease. We report the first case of discordance in an infant monozygotic twin pair. Twin A presented at age 9 months with MLL-ENL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia and twin B remains healthy 3 years later. The presence and eventual clearance of a clonal population of MLL-ENL(+) cells was shown in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of twin B. Clearance of this clone was temporally associated with viral-induced cytopenias, suggesting an immune-mediated clearance of the clone before the development of leukemia. Thus, concordance of MLL-rearranged acute leukemia in infant monozygotic twins is not universal. The implications of this case for MLL-rearranged leukemogenesis are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is to a large extent influenced by genetic factors, but environmental influences are considered important as well. To distinguish between functional brain changes underlying primarily genetically and environmentally mediated ADHD, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare response interference in monozygotic twins highly concordant or discordant for attention problems (AP). AP scores were assessed longitudinally with the Child Behavior Check List attention problem scale (CBCL-AP). Response interference was measured during two executive function paradigms; a color-word Stroop and a flanker task. The neuroimaging results indicated that, across the entire sample, children with high CBCL-AP scores, relative to children with low CBCL-AP scores, showed decreased activation to response interference in dorsolateral prefrontal, parietal and temporal brain regions. Increased activation was noted in the premotor cortex and regions associated with visual selective attention processing, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms to maintain task performance. Specific comparisons of high and low scoring concordant twin pairs suggest that AP of genetic origin was characterized by decreased activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the Stroop task and right parietal lobe during the flanker task. In contrast, comparison of twins from discordant monozygotic pairs, suggests that AP of environmental origin was characterized by decreased activation in left and right temporal lobe areas, but only during Stroop interference. The finding of distinct brain activation changes to response interference in inattention/hyperactivity of \"genetic\" versus \"environmental\" origin, indicates that genetic and environmental risk factors for attention/hyperactivity problems affect the brain in different ways.",
