    "abstract": "The \"replication crisis\" in neuroscientific research has led to calls for improving reproducibility. In traditional neuroscience analyses, irreproducibility may occur as a result of issues across various stages of the methodological process. For example, different operating systems, different software packages, and even different versions of the same package can lead to variable results. Nipype, an open-source Python project, integrates different neuroimaging software packages uniformly to improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging analyses. Nipype has the advantage over traditional software packages (e.g., FSL, ANFI, SPM, etc.) by (1) providing comprehensive software development frameworks and usage information, (2) improving computational efficiency, (3) facilitating reproducibility through sufficient details, and (4) easing the steep learning curve. Despite the rich tutorials it has provided, the Nipype community lacks a standard three-level GLM tutorial for FSL. Using the classical Flanker task dataset, we first precisely reproduce a three-level GLM analysis with FSL ",

    "abstract": "There is a pressing need to identify biological indicators of major depression to help guide proper diagnosis and optimize treatment. Animal models mimicking aspects of depression constitute essential tools for early-stage exploration of relevant pathways. In this study, we used the Flinders Sensitive and Resistant Line (FSL/FRL) to explore central and peripheral transcriptional changes in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway genes and their temporal regulation after a single dose of S-ketamine (15\u00a0mg/kg). We found that S-ketamine induced both rapid (1\u00a0hour) and sustained (2 and 14 days) antidepressant-like effects in the FSL rats. Analysis of mRNA expression revealed significant strain effects of Vegf, Vegf164, Vegfr-1, Nrp1, Nrp2, Rictor, and Raptor in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and of Vegf164, GbetaL, and Tsc1 in the hippocampus (HIP), which indicates suppression of VEGF signaling in the FSL rats compared to FRL rats. This notion was further substantiated by reduced expression of Vegf and Mtor in plasma from FSL rats. In the brain, S-ketamine induced transcriptional changes in the acute phase, not the sustained phase. There were significant treatment effects of S-ketamine on Vegfr-2 in both PFC and HIP and on Vegf and Vegfr-1 in HIP. Moreover, we found that S-ketamine specifically restored reduced levels of Nrp2 and Mtor in the PFC of the FSL rats. In conclusion, this study substantiates the use of the FRL/FSL rats to explore the depressive-like behavior at the transcriptional level of the VEGF pathway genes and study their regulation in response to various treatment paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Integrin \u03b26 (ITGB6), an epithelial-specific receptor, is downregulated in the gingival epithelium of periodontitis and is associated with inflammation response and periodontitis development. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of ITGB6 downregulation in the human gingival epithelium remains unclear. Fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 (FSL-1), an oral biofilm component, promotes an epithelial cell-driven proinflammatory response in periodontitis partially by suppressing ITGB6 expression. The aim of the current study was to investigate the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of ITGB6 inhibition by FSL-1 in human epithelial cells (HaCaT and primary human gingival epithelial cells), and to delineate the transcriptional mechanism of ITGB6 suppression in periodontitis. We found that FSL-1 inhibited ITGB6 transcription through increasing forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) expression and inhibiting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation. Furthermore, FOXO1 bound to STAT3 directly, leading to decreased STAT3 phosphorylation induced by FSL-1. Consequently, the binding of phosphorylated STAT3 to the ITGB6 promoter was decreased, and ITGB6 transcription was therefore downregulated following FSL-1 stimulation. The reciprocal action of STAT3 and FOXO1 on ITGB6 downregulation was also confirmed by the immunostaining of the inflammatory epithelium associated with periodontitis. Our findings suggest that the interaction of FOXO1-STAT3 may be a useful signal target for the treatment of periodontitis.",

    "abstract": "Exposure of Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats to post-weaning social isolation rearing (SIR) causes depressive- and social anxiety-like symptoms resistant to, or worsened by, fluoxetine. SIR typically presents with psychotic-like symptoms, while the paradoxical response to fluoxetine suggests unaddressed psychotic-like manifestations. Psychotic depression (MDpsy) is invariably treatment resistant. To further explore the mood-psychosis continuum in fluoxetine resistant FSL-SIR rats (Mncube et al., 2021), mood-, psychotic-, anxiety-, and social-related behaviour and biomarker response to antidepressant/antipsychotic treatment was studied in FSL-SIR rats. Methods: Sprague Dawley (SD) and FSL pups were subjected to social rearing or SIR from postnatal day (PND) 21. Thereafter FSL-SIR rats received olanzapine (5\u00a0mg/kg x 14 days) or olanzapine+fluoxetine (OLZ+FLX; 5\u00a0mg/kg + 10\u00a0mg/kg for 14 days) from PND 63. Psychotic-like, depressive, anxiety, and social behaviour were assessed from PND 72, versus saline-treated FSL-SIR rats, using the prepulse inhibition (PPI), forced swim, open field and social interaction tests. Post-mortem cortico-hippocampal norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), and dopamine (DA), as well as plasma corticosterone and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase levels were evaluated. Results: SD-SIR and FSL-SIR rats present with significant depressive-like behaviour (\nSIR-exposed FSL rats display worsened anxiety, as well as depressive and psychotic-like symptoms, variably responsive to olanzapine or OLZ+FLX. Depleted monoamines are reversed by OLZ+FLX, less so by olanzapine. FSL-SIR rats show promising face and construct but limited predictive validity for MDpsy, perhaps more relevant for bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "Developing accurate subcortical volumetric quantification tools is crucial for neurodevelopmental studies, as they could reduce the need for challenging and time-consuming manual segmentation. In this study, the accuracy of two automated segmentation tools, FSL-FIRST (with three different boundary correction settings) and FreeSurfer, were compared against manual segmentation of the hippocampus and subcortical nuclei, including the amygdala, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate and nucleus accumbens, using volumetric and correlation analyses in 80 5-year-olds. Both FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer overestimated the volume on all structures except the caudate, and the accuracy varied depending on the structure. Small structures such as the amygdala and nucleus accumbens, which are visually difficult to distinguish, produced significant overestimations and weaker correlations with all automated methods. Larger and more readily distinguishable structures such as the caudate and putamen produced notably lower overestimations and stronger correlations. Overall, the segmentations performed by FSL-FIRST's default pipeline were the most accurate, whereas FreeSurfer's results were weaker across the structures. In line with prior studies, the accuracy of automated segmentation tools was imperfect with respect to manually defined structures. However, apart from amygdala and nucleus accumbens, FSL-FIRST's agreement could be considered satisfactory (Pearson correlation\u2009>\u20090.74, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)\u2009>\u20090.68 and Dice score coefficient (DSC)\u2009>\u20090.87) with highest values for the striatal structures (putamen, globus pallidus, caudate) (Pearson correlation\u2009>\u20090.77, ICC\u2009>\u20090.87 and DSC\u2009>\u20090.88, respectively). Overall, automated segmentation tools do not always provide satisfactory results, and careful visual inspection of the automated segmentations is strongly advised.",

    "abstract": "FSL's FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FSL-FIRST) is a widely used and well-validated tool. Automated thalamic segmentation is a common application and an important longitudinal measure for multiple sclerosis (MS). However, FSL-FIRST's algorithm is based on shape models derived from non-MS groups. As such, the present study sought to systematically assess common thalamic segmentation errors made by FSL-FIRST on MRIs from people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).\nFSL-FIRST was applied to generate thalamic segmentation masks for 890 MR images in PwMS. Images and masks were reviewed systematically to classify and quantify errors, as well as associated anatomical variations and MRI abnormalities. For cases with overt errors (n = 362), thalamic masks were corrected and quantitative volumetric differences were calculated.\nIn the entire quantitative volumetric group, the mean volumetric error of FSL-FIRST was 2.74% (0.360 ml): among only corrected cases, the mean volumetric error was 6.79% (0.894 ml). The average percent volumetric error associated with seven error types, two anatomical variants, and motions artifacts are reported. Additional analyses showed that the presence of motion artifacts or anatomical variations significantly increased the probability of error (\u03c7\nIn PwMS, FSL-FIRST thalamic segmentation miscalculates thalamic volumetry in a predictable fashion, and may be biased to overestimate highly atrophic thalami. As such, it is recommended that segmentations be reviewed and corrected manually when appropriate for specific studies.",

    "abstract": "As a novel lactate-derived post-translational modification (PTM), lysine lactylation (Kla) is involved in diverse biological processes, and participates in human tumorigenesis. Identification of Kla substrates with their exact sites is crucial for revealing the molecular mechanisms of lactylation. In contrast with labor-intensive and time-consuming experimental approaches, computational prediction of Kla could provide convenience and increased speed, but is still lacking. In this work, although current identified Kla sites are limited, we constructed the first Kla benchmark dataset and developed a few-shot learning-based architecture approach to leverage the power of small datasets and reduce the impact of imbalance and overfitting. A maximum 11.7% (0.745 versus 0.667) increase of area under the curve (AUC) value was achieved in contrast to conventional machine learning methods. We conducted a comprehensive survey of the performance by combining 8 sequence-based features and 3 structure-based features and tailored a multi-feature hybrid system for synergistic combination. This system achieved >16.2% improvement of the AUC value (0.889 versus 0.765) compared with single feature-based models for the prediction of Kla sites ",

    "abstract": "We introduce FSL-MRS, an end-to-end, modular, open-source MRS analysis toolbox. It provides spectroscopic data conversion, preprocessing, spectral simulation, fitting, quantitation, and visualization.\nThe FSL-MRS package is modular. Its programs operate on data in a standard format (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative [NIfTI]) capable of storing single-voxel and multivoxel spectroscopy, including spatial orientation information. The FSL-MRS toolbox includes tools for preprocessing of raw spectroscopy data, including coil combination, frequency and phase alignment, and filtering. A density matrix simulation program is supplied for generation of basis spectra from simple text-based descriptions of pulse sequences. Fitting is based on linear combination of basis spectra and implements Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization for the estimation of the full posterior distribution of metabolite concentrations. Validation of the fitting is carried out on independently created simulated data, phantom data, and three in vivo human data sets (257 single-voxel spectroscopy and 8 MRSI data sets) at 3 T and 7 T. Interactive HTML reports are automatically generated by processing and fitting stages of the toolbox. The FSL-MRS package can be used on the command line or interactively in the Python language.\nValidation of the fitting shows low error in simulation (median error of 11.9%) and in phantom (3.4%). Average correlation between a third-party toolbox (LCModel) and FSL-MRS was high (0.53-0.81) in all three in vivo data sets.\nThe FSL-MRS toolbox is designed to be flexible and extensible to new forms of spectroscopic acquisitions. Custom fitting models can be specified within the framework for dynamic or multivoxel spectroscopy. It is available as part of the FMRIB Software Library.",

    "abstract": "There are instances in which an estimate of the brain volume should be obtained from MRI in clinical practice. Our objective is to calculate cross-sectional robustness of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based software (Entelai Pic) for brain volume estimation and compare it to traditional software such as FreeSurfer, CAT12 and FSL in healthy controls (HC).\nSixteen HC were scanned four times, two different days on two different MRI scanners (1.5\u202fT and 3\u202fT). Volumetric T1-weighted images were acquired and post-processed with FreeSurfer v6.0.0, Entelai Pic v2, CAT12 v12.5 and FSL v5.0.9. Whole-brain, grey matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes were calculated. Correlation and agreement between methods was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland Altman plots. Robustness was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV).\nWhole-brain volume estimation had better correlation between FreeSurfer and Entelai Pic (ICC (95% CI) 0.96 (0.94-0.97)) than FreeSurfer and CAT12 (0.92 (0.88-0.96)) and FSL (0.87 (0.79-0.91)). WM, GM and CSF showed a similar trend. Compared to FreeSurfer, Entelai Pic provided similarly robust segmentations of brain volumes both on same-scanner (mean CV 1.07, range 0.20-3.13% vs. mean CV 1.05, range 0.21-3.20%, p\u202f=\u202f0.86) and on different-scanner variables (mean CV 3.84, range 2.49-5.91% vs. mean CV 3.84, range 2.62-5.13%, p\u202f=\u202f0.96). Mean post-processing times were 480, 5, 40 and 5\u202fmin for FreeSurfer, Entelai Pic, CAT12 and FSL respectively.\nBased on robustness and processing times, our CNN-based model is suitable for cross-sectional volumetry on clinical practice.",
