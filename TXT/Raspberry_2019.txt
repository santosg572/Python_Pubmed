    "abstract": "Raspberry-like (RB) nanoparticles hold potential for diverse applications due to their hierarchical morphology. Here we developed a novel tandem synthetic approach of nonsynchronous growth based on photo-mediated reversible-deactivation radical polymerization, enabling simple, efficient and bottom-up synthesis of RB nanoparticles of uniform sizes at quantitative conversions of fluorinated monomers. Chain transfer agents of different chain lengths, concentrations and chemical compositions were varied to tune the diameter of RB particles. Importantly, fluorinated RB nanoparticles obtained with this method allow facile post modifications ",

    "abstract": "Whole red raspberry polyphenols (RRW), including ellagic acid, and their gut-derived metabolite, urolithin A (UroA), attenuate inflammation and confer health benefits. Although results from recent studies indicate that polyphenols and UroA also provide neuroprotective effects, these compounds differ in their bioavailability and may, therefore, have unique effects on limiting neuroinflammation. Accordingly, we aimed to compare the neuroprotective effects of RRW and UroA on BV-2 microglia under both 3 h and 12 and 24 h inflammatory conditions. In inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP stimulation after 3 h, RRW and UroA suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and regulated the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway. UroA also reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression and promoted M2 microglial polarization. During inflammatory conditions induced by either 12 or 24 h stimulation with LPS, UroA-but not RRW-dampened pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and suppressed JNK/c-Jun signaling. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RRW and its gut-derived metabolite UroA differentially regulate neuroprotective responses in microglia during 3 h versus 12 and 24 h inflammatory conditions.",

    "abstract": "Consumption of red raspberries has been reported to exert acute beneficial effects on postprandial glycemia, insulinemia, triglyceridemia, and cytokine levels in metabolically disturbed subjects. In a two-arm parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial, 59 subjects with overweight or abdominal obesity and with slight hyperinsulinemia or hypertriglyceridemia were randomized to consume 280 g/day of frozen raspberries or to maintain their usual diet for 8 weeks. Primary analyses measured metabolic differences between the groups. Secondary analyses performed with omics tools in the intervention group assessed blood gene expression and plasma metabolomic changes following the raspberry supplementation. The intervention did not significantly affect plasma insulin, glucose, inflammatory marker concentrations, nor blood pressure. Following the supplementation, 43 genes were differentially expressed, and several functional pathways were enriched, a major portion of which were involved in the regulation of cytotoxicity, immune cell trafficking, protein signal transduction, and interleukin production. In addition, 10 serum metabolites were found significantly altered, among which \u03b2-alanine, trimethylamine N-oxide, and bioactive lipids. Although the supplementation had no meaningful metabolic effects, these results highlight the impact of a diet rich in raspberry on the immune function and phospholipid metabolism, thus providing novel insights into potential immune-metabolic pathways influenced by regular raspberry consumption.",

    "abstract": "Gastric adenocarcinoma of foveolar type (GA-FV) is a raspberry-shaped gastric cancer (RSGC) and garners much attention as H. pylori (Hp)-uninfected gastric cancer. However, the classification and clinicopathological and endoscopic features of RSGCs in Hp-uninfected patients are poorly defined. We designed a new histopathological classification of RSGC and compared them via endoscopic and clinicopathological characteristics.\nFrom 996 patients with early gastric cancers resected by endoscopy in our hospital, we studied 24 RSGC lesions from 21 (2.4%) Hp-uninfected patients. RSGCs were classified into 3 histological types as follows: GA-FV (n = 19), gastric adenocarcinoma of fundic gland type (GA-FG, n = 2), and gastric adenocarcinoma of fundic gland mucosa type (GA-FGM, n = 3). Most of the lesions were found at the greater curvature of the upper or middle third of the stomach. GA-FV lesions were homogeneously reddish and frequently accompanied with a whitish area around the tumor and an irregular microvascular (MV) pattern; these features were confirmed histopathologically by the presence of homogeneous neoplastic foveolar epithelium with foveolar hyperplasia around the tumors. GA-FG lesions might be heterogeneously reddish with a submucosal tumor shape and regular MV pattern; these were confirmed by the presence of covered or mixed nonneoplastic epithelium on deeper regions of tumors. GA-FGM lesions might be homogeneously reddish and occasionally had a submucosal tumor shape and irregular MV pattern; these were confirmed by the presence of homogeneous neoplastic foveolar epithelium on deeper regions of the tumors. Key Messages: RSGCs in Hp-uninfected patients are classified into 3 histopathological types. For accurate diagnosis of RSGCs, it may be necessary to fully understand endoscopic features of these lesions based on these histological characteristics and to take a precise biopsy.",

    "abstract": "The morphology of surfaces critically influences their interaction with the surrounding phase. Herein, we report a modular approach for the synthesis of organic-inorganic raspberry-, strawberry-, and seedpod-like particles to template the porosity of superficially porous particles. Divinylbenzene (DVB) microspheres were employed as core particles, which were modified with polar and nonpolar polymer shells. Subsequently, silica nanoparticle templates were covalently tethered to said particles. Further grafting of polymer shells and subsequent template removal yielded superficially porous core-shell particles. In addition, we introduce a facile procedure for the synthesis of superficially porous particles without distinguishable core-shell morphology. Organic seedpod-like particles were prepared from DVB and silica templates, yielding superficially porous particles after template removal. The surface morphology of the templated particles was investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to prove the chemical modification of the particle surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Binary transition metals can facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through the synergistic integration of different electrochemical properties. To determine binary transition metals that are highly active, Greely et al. conducted a simulation of 256 different binary transition metals. They demonstrated that BiPt, PtRu, AsPt, SbPt, BiRh, RhRe, PtRe, AsRu, IrRu, RhRu, IrRe, and PtRh could be used as efficient electrocatalysts for HER. However, only few of them are synthesized and used as electrocatalysts. In this work, we report the synthesis of the raspberry-like antimony-platinum (SbPt) nanoparticles (NPs) via a colloidal nanocrystal synthesis. These NPs exhibited efficient activity with a low overpotential of 27\u00a0mV to reach 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm",

    "abstract": "Cyclophosphamide (CP) was found to have a potential toxic effect on lung tissues. Raspberry ketones (RKs) are natural antioxidant chemicals isolated from red raspberries (Rubus ideaus). They are commonly used for weight loss and obesity. The current study aimed to evaluate the possible protective effects of RKs against lung toxicity induced by CP. Mice were allocated into six groups: (1) control group; (2) CP group: received a single intraperitoneal dose of CP (150\u2009mg/kg, i.p.); and (3-6) mice were pre-treated orally with different doses of RKs (25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days, respectively, before the administration of an intraperitoneal dose of CP (150 mg/kg, i.p.). Mice were then sacrificed under anesthesia, then lungs were removed for histopathological and biochemical investigations. A single dose of CP markedly altered the levels of some oxidative stress biomarkers and resulted in the fragmentation of DNA in lung homogenates. Histological examination of CP-treated mice demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage that involved apparent hyalinization of membranes, thickening of inter alveolar septa, and proliferation of type II pneumocytes. The immunohistochemical results of CP-treated mice revealed strongly positive Bax and weakly positive proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining reactivity of the nuclei of the lining epithelium of the bronchioles and alveoli. CP activated the cyclooxygenase-2/nuclear factor-kappa B pathway. However, pre-treatment with RKs significantly attenuated CP-evoked alterations in the previously mentioned parameters, highlighting their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic potential. RKs may be suggested to be a potential candidate to ameliorate CP-induced pulmonary toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Video acquisition and analysis have become integral parts of scientific research. Two major components of a video acquisition system are the choice of camera and the acquisition software. A vast variety of cameras are available on the market. Turnkey multi-camera synchronous acquisition software, however, is not as widely available. For prototyping applications, the Raspberry Pi (RPi) has been widely utilized due to many factors, including cost. There are implementations for video acquisition and preview from a single RPi camera, including one implementation released by the RPi organization itself. However, there are no multi-camera acquisition solutions for the RPi. This paper presents an open-source digital video recorder (DVR) system for the popular RPi camera. The DVR is simple to setup and use for acquisition with a single camera or multiple cameras. In the case of multiple cameras, the acquisition is synchronized between cameras. The DVR comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow previewing the camera streams, setting recording parameters, and associating \"names\" to cameras. The acquisition code as well as the DVR GUI are written in Python. The open-source software also includes a GUI for playback of recorded video. The versatility of the DVR is demonstrated with a life science research application involving high-throughput monitoring of fruit-flies.",

    "abstract": "In the field of functional nanomaterials, core-satellite nanoclusters have recently elicited great interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, core-satellite synthetic routes to date are hampered by delicate and multistep reaction conditions and no practical method has been reported for the ordering of these structures onto a surface monolayer. Herein we show a reproducible and simplified thin film process to fabricate bimetallic raspberry nanoclusters using block copolymer (BCP) lithography. The fabricated inorganic raspberry nanoclusters consisted of a \u223c36 nm alumina core decorated with \u223c15 nm Au satellites after infusing multilayer BCP nanopatterns. A series of cylindrical BCPs with different molecular weights allowed us to dial in specific nanodot periodicities (from 30 to 80 nm). Highly ordered BCP nanopatterns were then selectively infiltrated with alumina and Au species to develop multi-level bimetallic raspberry features. Microscopy and X-ray reflectivity analysis were used at each fabrication step to gain further mechanistic insights and understand the infiltration process. Furthermore, grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering studies of infiltrated films confirmed the excellent order and vertical orientation over wafer scale areas of Al",

    "abstract": "The sterile insect technique (SIT) and male annihilation technique (MAT) are important tools for the control of Queensland fruit fly (Q-fly), Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae), a major insect pest of horticultural crops in Australia. In MAT, mature Q-fly males are attracted to a toxic bait using Cuelure, a synthetic analog of raspberry ketone (RK). Substantial improvements in control could be achieved by simultaneous use of SIT and MAT, but this requires suppression of the Cuelure response in released sterile flies. Recent studies report that prerelease feeding with RK during the first 48 h after emergence can reduce the response of mature Q-fly males to Cuelure, but the mechanism underpinning this is unknown. Here, to test whether reduced sensory sensitivity to Cuelure is involved, we evaluated the effects of RK supplements, adult diet (yeast-supplemented diet throughout adult stage vs yeast-supplemented diet only for 48 h), and age on electroantennogram (EAG) and electropalpogram (EPG) responses of Q-flies to Cuelure stimuli. EAG responses did not vary with RK supplements, sex, or age of Q-flies fed yeast-supplemented diet throughout the adult stage, but the responses of Q-flies fed other diet regime decreased with age. EPG responses of both sexes of Q-flies were affected by RK supplements, age, and their interaction, but without patterns that might indicate reduced maxillary palp response of RK supplemented flies to Cuelure. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that reduced Cuelure response of male Q-flies fed RK supplements is explained by reduced electrophysiological response in antennae or maxillary palps.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberries (RRB) are high in anthocyanin- and ellagitannin- type (poly)phenols. This study aimed to investigate the effect of 4-week RRB supplementation on (poly)phenolic metabolism in adults with prediabetes and insulin-resistance (PreDM-IR); and whether adding fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), prebiotics, would augment the microbial metabolites of RRB (poly)phenols. In a randomized crossover clinical trial, subjects (n = 35: PreDM-IR, n = 25; healthy Reference group, n = 10) consumed 1 cup RRB (fresh weight equivalence) per day and RRB with 8 g FOS per day each for 4 weeks in random order separated by 4-week washout. Plasma and urinary (poly)phenolic metabolites were characterized after (0-24h) consuming a RRB-based test drink (2 cups RRB) at baseline/week 0 and again after 4-week supplementations. A total of 123 (poly)phenolic metabolites were quantified. After 4-week RRB supplementation, several metabolite groups were significantly increased (",

    "abstract": "Chronic neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative disorders has been reported to be prevented by dietary components. Particularly, dietary (poly)phenols have been identified as having anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions, and their ingestion is considered a major preventive factor for such disorders. To assess the relation between (poly)phenol classes and their bioactivity, we used five different raspberry genotypes, which were markedly different in their (poly)phenol profiles within a similar matrix. In addition, gastro-intestinal bio-accessible fractions were produced, which simulate the (poly)phenol metabolites that may be absorbed after digestion, and evaluated for anti-inflammatory potential using LPS-stimulated microglia. Interestingly, the fraction from genotype 2J19 enriched in ellagitannins, their degradation products and ellagic acid, attenuated pro-inflammatory markers and mediators CD40, NO, TNF-\u03b1, and intracellular superoxide via NF-\u03baB, MAPK and NFAT pathways. Importantly, it also increased the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These effects contrasted with fractions richer in anthocyanins, suggesting that ellagitannins and its derivatives are major anti-inflammatory (poly)phenols and promising compounds to alleviate neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaf mottle virus (RLMV) in Europe has been associated with raspberry mosaic disease (Martin et al. 2013) and crumbly fruit disease (Quito-Avila et al. 2014) in red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) beside Rubus yellow net virus (RYNV) and Black raspberry necrosis virus (BRNV). RLMV has also been reported infecting blackberry (Jones and McGavin 1998; Thekke-Veetil et al. 2016). A survey of virus diseases was conducted from 2016 to 2018 in 34 raspberry commercial plantations in Central and southeastern Poland. Some of the plants showed chlorotic spots, vein yellows, mosaic patterns and deformation of leaves and fruits. Leaf samples from 146 plants were tested using RT-PCR for RLMV, RYNV, BRNV, Raspberry vein chlorosis virus (RVCV), Raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV), and Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV). The pairs of primers CPhF and CPhR (Tzanetakis et al. 2007) as well as 1436F and 1437R (McGavin and MacFarlane 2010) were used to amplify a 452-bp fragment of the coat protein homologue (CPh) gene and a 681-bp of the 1 a helicase gene, respectively. RT-PCR products were obtained for five samples from cultivars: Malling Promise (MPrOK1 and MPrOk2; plantation A), Canby (CanKop; plantation B), Polka (PolKop; plantation B) and Malling Seedling (MSeWa; plantation C) grown in southeastern Poland. MPrOK1 and MSeWa were co-infected with RYNV while the other three samples were mixed infected with RBDV. Each of these plants showed chlorotic spots and mosaic symptoms of different intensity, leaf deformation and reduced growth. The RLMV-specific amplicons obtained for all five positive samples were directly sequenced at Genomed company, Warsaw, Poland. The obtained sequences were aligned using ClustalW of the Lasergene 7.1 software (DNASTAR Inc., USA) and were compared with sequences available in GenBank using the BLASTn algorithm. The identity of nucleotide (nt) sequences of Cph gene of RLMV isolates found in Poland was revealed. They shared 97.7% and 99% nt sequence similarity with 'HCRL Glen Clova' from USA (DQ357218) and 'SCRI stock' isolate from United Kingdom (FN391551) strains respectively The nucleotide sequence of isolates from Poland indicates a closer relationship with the strain found in UK. However, the amino acid (aa) sequence of both reference strains was identical and shared 99.2% identity with the corresponding fragment of the isolates from Poland. The representative sequence of PolKop isolate was deposited in GenBank under accession No. MT241265. The similarity of nucleotide sequence of the 1 a helicase gene ranged from 98.5% (between MseWa and four other isolates) to 100% (between MPrOk1 and MPrOk2). The amino acids sequences of MPrOk1, MPrOk2 and MSeWa isolates were identical whereas they shared 99.5% similarity with CanKop and PolKop isolates. The nt and aa sequences within this region of all five isolates were in 98% homologous with the sequences of 'HCRL Glen Clova' strain. Nucleotide sequences of the 1 a helicase gene of the CanKop, PolKop, MseWa, MPrOk1, MPrOk2 isolates were deposited in GenBank (acc. Nos. MT847633-MT8347637). Considering the low incidence of RLMV (five out of 146 positively tested), it can be assumed that there is no emergency of the RLMV large-scale occurrence in Poland. However, as RLMV is transmitted by Amphorophora idaei aphids found in our country, infected plants near raspberry plantations may play an important role in virus spread. This is the first report of RLMV infecting red raspberry in Poland.

    "abstract": "Raspberries have been reported to contain abundant anthocyanins and other active compounds. To extract anthocyanins from raspberries more efficiently, a novel procedure of ultrasound-assisted deep eutectic solvent extraction (UADESE) was proposed in this paper. The extraction process was optimized by response surface methodology coupled with a genetic algorithm. The optimum extraction parameters to achieve the highest yield of anthocyanins 1.378 \u00b1 0.009 mg/g from raspberry powder via UADESE were obtained at a water content of 29%, ultrasonic power of 210 W, extraction temperature of 51 \u00b0C and extraction time of 32 min. The AB-8 macroporous resin combined with the high-speed counter current chromatography (HSCCC) method were further used to isolate and purify the anthocyanins extracts obtained under optimum extraction conditions, and the structure of purified anthocyanins components were identified by UV-Visible spectrophotometer (UV-Vis), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS), ",

The absence of protection at the interface makes it easy for the attackers to take control of the IMDs. Thus, protection of wireless interface has become mandatory in IMDs during key agreement schemes. To secure the key agreement scheme, the most practical light weight bio-cryptosystem schemes popularly known as fuzzy vault (FV) is implemented. The most computationally intensive task in the FV scheme is the chaff point generation process, used for hiding the secret key and valid point inside the vault. Thus, a Raspberry Pi implemented with MATLAB simulation and communication of physiological signal based fast chaff point generation (RPSC) algorithm for WBAN. RPSC algorithm reduced the number of candidate chaff points in the chaff point generation and reduced the overall execution time. The RPSC algorithm has an algorithm complexity of O(n",

    "abstract": "In this study, we carried out a comparative evaluation of antiaging and anti-melanogenesis activities of raspberry extracts (Rubus occidentalis L.) according to their stage of ripening (uRo: unripe raspberry, Ro: ripe raspberry), and analyzed the active component (ellagic acid) present in these extracts. Our results showed higher inhibitory effects of the uRo extract in terms of elastase and collagenase activities than Ro extract. In the CCD-986sk cells, uRo extract significantly inhibited MMP-1 activity by 18% and increased the rate of type 1 pro-collagen synthesis by 25%. Besides, treatment with uRo extract significantly inhibited \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-induced melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. Overall, uRo was a more potent mediator of antiaging and anti-melanogenesis effects than Ro extract. Further analysis showed that the functional effects of uRo could be attributed to its 18.5 times higher ellagic acid content than that in Ro extract. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study reported the differential effect of the raspberry extracts depending on their stage of ripening. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study to report the antiaging, anti-wrinkle, and anti-pigmentation effects of the uRo extracts. We showed that the extracts from the uRo have an overall better antiaging and skin-whitening effect than ripe ones. The effects were attributed to high ellagic acid content in uRo. We believed that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because the outcome of the study has both, cosmetic as well as therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the design and implementation of a home automation system that focuses on the use of ordinary electrical appliances for remote control using Raspberry Pi and relay circuits and does not use expensive IP-based devices. Common Lights, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), fans, and other electronic devices are among the appliances that can be used in this system. A smartphone app is designed that helps the user to design the smart home to his actual home via easy and interactive drag & drop option. The system provides control over the appliances via both the local network and remote access. Data logging over the Microsoft Azure cloud database ensures system recovery in case of gateway failure and data record for lateral use. Periodical notifications also help the user to optimize the usage of home appliances. Moreover, the user can set his preferences and the appliances are auto turned off and on to meet user-specific requirements. Raspberry Pi acting as the server maintains the database of each appliance. HTTP web interface and apache server are used for communication between the android app and raspberry pi. With a 5v relay circuit and micro-processor Raspberry Pi, the proposed system is low-cost, energy-efficient, easy to operate, and affordable for low-income houses.",

    "abstract": "Lignins of non-woody fast-growing plants cause high interest in recent time as a potential source of raw materials for biorefining. Studying of the lignin structure in shrubs will allow obtaining the information about processes of biosynthesis of these plants and developing methods of their delignification for bioprocessing industry. We studied the structure of raspberry dioxane lignin (Rubus idaeus L.) using various spectroscopic methods, including FT-IR and NMR (1D and 2D) for various nuclei. Also, we used gel permeation chromatography and elemental analysis. It is obtained that raspberry dioxane lignin has relatively wide polydispersity, with Mw/Mn\u00a0=\u00a02.6, and a relatively lower molecular weight (Mw\u00a0=\u00a05111\u00a0g/mol) due to low molecular weight oligolignols.

    "abstract": "Monitoring blood coagulation in response to an anticoagulant (heparin) and its reversal agent (protamine) is essential during and after surgery, especially with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A current clinical standard is the use of activated clotting time (ACT), where the mechanical movement of a plunger through a whole blood-filled channel is monitored to evaluate the endpoint time of coagulation. As a rapid, simple, low-volume, and cost-effective alternative, we have developed a paper microfluidic assay and Raspberry Pi-based device with the aim of quantifying the extent of blood coagulation in response to varying doses of heparin and protamine. The flow rate of blood through the paper microfluidic channel is automatically monitored using Python-coded edge detection algorithm. For each set of assay, 8 ",

    "abstract": "The major aroma-active compounds in clear red raspberry juice were identified by molecular sensory science approaches. Thirty-one aroma-active compounds were identified using detection frequency analysis and aroma extract dilution analysis. Among them, 18 volatiles with aroma activity in red raspberry were identified for the first time, while 14 volatiles with odor activity values (OAVs)\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 were confirmed as the major aroma-active compounds. Three C6 aldehydes showed the highest detection frequencies of 8, and \u03b2-ionone exhibited the highest OAV of 9507 and flavor dilution factor of 512, which indicated that the floral and grassy note could be dominant in overall aroma. Quantitative descriptive analysis suggested that the grassy, floral, woody, and caramel-like notes can be simulated using aroma recombination model 1. Electronic nose analysis also demonstrated that model 1 had closer similarity to the original juice than others. The combination strategy used here would help improve the knowledge of red raspberry aroma.",

    "abstract": "Heterocrossa rubophaga, the raspberry bud moth, is a pest of commercial Rubus berry crops and wild Rubus species. Its pheromone was initially identified as a single component, (7Z)-nonadecen-11-one. Here we report further investigation of this carposinid pheromone including volatile collection, gland extraction, mass spectrometry, microchemical analysis, electrophysiology and field testing. The alkene (7Z)-tricosene was identified from female gland extracts and the synthetic compound gave antennal responses from the male moth. Field testing of (7Z)-tricosene showed that it was unattractive alone but in combination with (7Z)-nonadecen-11-one it more than doubled male moth trap catch for all doses tested compared to that of (7Z)-nonadecen-11-one alone. We recommend a blend of 300\u00a0\u00b5g of (7Z)-nonadecen-11-one and 300\u00a0\u00b5g of (7Z)-tricosene as an improved monitoring tool for raspberry bud moth for use by berry growers. This is the second report of the Z-alkene as a pheromone component in the Carposinidae family among the three carposisnid pheromones identified to date.",

    "abstract": "Rubus yellow net virus (RYNV) infects Rubus spp., causing a severe decline when present in mixed infections with other viruses. RYNV belongs to the family Caulimoviridae, also known as plant pararetroviruses, which can exist as episomal or integrated elements (endogenous). Most of integrated pararetroviruses are noninfectious; however, a few cases have been reported where they excised from the plant genome and formed infectious particles. Graft transmission onto indicator plants R. occidentalis \"Munger\" has been the standard test method for RYNV detection in certification programs. Previously, it was noticed that some RYNV PCR-positive plants did not induce symptoms on \"Munger\", suggesting an integration event. In this study, bio-indexing and different molecular techniques were employed to differentiate between integrated and episomal RYNV sequences. Reverse transcription-PCR using RYNV-specific oligonucleotides after DNase treatment generated positive results for the virus in graft transmissible isolates (episomal) only. To confirm these results, rolling circle amplification on DNA preparations from the same samples resulted in amplicons identified as RYNV only from plants with graft transmissible RYNV. High-throughput sequencing was used to identify the RYNV-like sequences present in the host DNA. These results indicate the integration of RYNV into the red raspberry genome and highlight the necessity to recognize this phenomenon (integration) in future Rubus quarantine and certification programs.",

    "abstract": "It is important to develop novel sensors for the simple, rapid, and quantitative detection of residual antibiotics in food, considering their potential threats to human health. Herein, we report the successful fabrication of raspberry-like nanogold (R-like Au) structures with rough surfaces and partially hollow structures for the rapid and sensitive detection of antibiotics in duck meats on a portable Raman spectrometer. The R-like Au with tunable plasmonic wavelengths was fabricated by a two-step method. Ag particles as seeds were substituted by Au particles through a replacement reaction; moreover, the surface plasmon resonances (SPRs) of R-like Au red-shifted with the increase in the Au ion concentration. The R-like Au with a diameter of about 120 nm that matched well with the 785 nm laser on the portable Raman spectrometer was used as an excellent surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) active platform for detecting two kinds of antibiotics, namely, nitrofurantoin (NFT) and nitrofurazone (NFZ), in spiked duck meats. Both of them have sufficient sensitivity (0.05-10 mg L-1), good linear relationship (R2 > 0.99) and high recovery in quantitative SERS analysis. The platform is simple without the need for complex pretreatment of the food samples or use of large scale Raman spectrometers, promising easy implementation for the on-site analysis of residuals of antibiotics in food.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural selection programmes are, today, working hard to obtain novel raspberry cultivars with higher nutritional and commercial quality. One of those cultivars is \"Adelita\". This study aims to provide novel tools for raspberry cultivar identification-more specifically, the differentiation of \"Adelita\" from other raspberry cultivars. To perform this study, five \"Adelita\" samples were analysed-four cultivated in Spain and one, in Morocco-and they were compared to seven samples from six raspberry cultivars (\"P04\", \"Lupita\", \"Enrosadira\", \"P10\", \"Quanza\" and \"Versalles\"). The physical parameters (mass, length, equatorial diameter and firmness) combined with the Total Phenolic Content (TPC); the antioxidant capacity according to the antioxidant activity tested with the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) methods; and the main target volatile compounds were used as independent variables. Principal component and cluster analysis showed that the target volatiles and physical parameters together with the TPC and DPPH values could be useful to classify Adelita cultivars separately from the rest of the cultivars included in the work. Those results proved that the developed methodology could be proposed as a reliable approach for the identification of cultivar fraud in the supply chain.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK; [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone]) is used by the food and cosmetic industry as a flavoring agent. RK is also marketed as a dietary supplement for weight maintenance and appetite control. The purpose of the study was to characterize the acute feeding suppression with RK (64-640\u00a0mg/kg) by oral gavage in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Cumulative 24\u00a0h food intake was reduced at 200\u00a0mg/kg (24% feeding suppression) in males and reliably reduced at 640\u00a0mg/kg (49-77% feeding suppression). Feeding suppression was not associated with pica behavior over the range of doses or conditioned taste aversion. In a separate experiment, a single oral gavage of RK (640\u00a0mg/kg) resulted in approximate 43% mortality rate (6 out 14 male mice) within 2 days. Atrophy of white adipose tissue, splenic abnormalities, and thymus involution were noted after 2-4 days after oral gavage RK. Total white blood cell count, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils were significantly lower, while mean red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were significantly higher with RK treatment. Our findings indicated a dose-dependent feeding suppression with acute RK, but doses that reliable suppress food intake are associated with pathological changes.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK; [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone]) is a popular nutraceutical used for weight management and appetite control. We sought to determine the physiological benefits of RK on the meal patterns and cardiovascular changes associated with an obesogenic diet. In addition, we explored whether the physiological benefits of RK promoted anxiety-related behaviors. Male and female C57BL/6J mice were administered a daily oral gavage of RK 200 mg/kg, RK 400 mg/kg, or vehicle for 14 days. Commencing with dosing, mice were placed on a high-fat diet (45% fat) or low-fat diet (10% fat). Our results indicated that RK 200 mg/kg had a differential influence on meal patterns in males and females. In contrast, RK 400 mg/kg reduced body weight gain, open-field total distance travelled, hemodynamic measures (i.e., reduced systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP and mean BP), and increased nocturnal satiety ratios in males and females. In addition, RK 400 mg/kg increased neural activation in the nucleus of the solitary tract, compared with vehicle. RK actions were not influenced by diet, nor resulted in an anxiety-like phenotype. Our findings suggest that RK has dose-differential feeding and cardiovascular actions, which needs consideration as it is used as a nutraceutical for weight control for obesity.",

    "abstract": "Alcoholic fermentation (AF) and malolactic fermentation (MLF) both have significant influence on the production of black raspberry wine. In this study, three microbes associated with AF and MLF including S. cerevisiae, T. delbrueckii and O. oeni were used to investigate their combined effect on basic compositional, volatile and sensory property of black raspberry wine, and four fermentation trials including single S. cerevisiae inoculation plus spontaneous MLF (BSU) and controlled MLF with O. oeni (BSO), sequential culture of T. delbrueckii and S. cerevisiae plus spontaneous MLF (BTSU) and controlled MLF (BTSO) were tested and compared. Fermentation results showed MLF in BSU, BSO and BTSO were successful, with respective period of 40, 25 and 23 days, whereas a stuck MLF occurred in BTSU. Volatile compounds were determined by HS-GC-IMS method, with a total of 45 aromas identified. BTSO was distinguished by a significant higher signal intensity of many fruity esters and a lower production of several alcohols and terpenes, which was in agreement with its perception result of strong 'fruity' and slight note of 'solvent' and 'herbaceous' during quantitative descriptive analysis. On the contrary, BSU was found to reinforce the synthesis of most detected volatiles, resulting in the enhancement of both beneficial and off-flavour compounds, therefore scoring lower in the 'global aroma' descriptor. Principal component analysis showed BSU and BSO were similar in the volatile composition, whereas BTSO was quite different. Overall, BTSO had greater potential to be used in the production of black raspberry wine.",

    "abstract": "Formulation of delivery systems for active ingredients is of increasing importance for the food industry. For that purpose, we selected cellulose as a carrier polymer of raspberry volatiles. Freeze-dried cellulose/raspberry complexes were prepared by complexation of raspberry juice (constant amount) and cellulose (2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10%). In our study, cellulose was shown as a good carrier of raspberry juice volatiles. Thirty-nine volatiles were detected in raspberry juice while 11 of them were lost during preparation of the complexes. Berry flavor note was the dominant one in raspberry juice (40% of overall flavor), followed by citrus and woody notes (each around 18% of overall flavor) and floral, fruity, and green (each around 8% of overall flavor). Cellulose/raspberry complexes had different flavor profiles, but a berry flavor note was still the dominant one in all complexes. These results suggest an efficient plant-based approach to produce value-added cellulose/volatile dry complexes with possible utility as food flavoring ingredients.",

    "abstract": "The male fruit fly attractants, cue-lure (CL) and raspberry ketone (RK), are important in pest management. These volatile phenylbutanoids occur in daciniphilous Bulbophyllum Thouar (Orchidaceae: Asparagales) orchids, along with zingerone (ZN) and anisyl acetone (AA). While these four compounds attract a similar range of species, their relative attractiveness to multiple species is unknown. We field tested these compounds in two fruit fly speciose locations in north Queensland, Australia (Lockhart and Cairns) for 8 wk. Of 16 species trapped in significant numbers, 14 were trapped with CL and RK, all in significantly greater numbers with CL traps than RK traps (at least in higher population locations). This included the pest species Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae) (CL catches ca. 5\u00d7 > RK), Bactrocera neohumeralis (Hardy) (Diptera: Tephritidae) and Bactrocera bryoniae (Tryon) (Diptera: Tephritidae) (CL catches ca. 3\u00d7 > RK), and Bactrocera frauenfeldi (Schiner) (Diptera: Tephritidae) (in Cairns-CL catches ca. 1.6\u00d7 > RK). Seven species were trapped with AA, and all were also caught in CL and RK traps in significantly greater numbers, with the exception of B. frauenfeldi. For this species, catches were not statistically different with CL, RK, and AA in Lockhart, and RK and AA in Cairns. Seven species were trapped with ZN, two at this lure only, and the remainder also with CL or RK but in significantly greater numbers. This is the first quantitative comparison of the relative attractiveness of CL, RK, AA, and ZN against multiple species, and supports the long-held but untested assumption that CL is broadly more attractive lure than RK.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV) is the putative agent of the homonymous disease and even though Bosnia and Herzegovina is a major producer worldwide there is no report of the virus presence in the country. We studied the virus population structure and assessed its ability to move systemically. RLBV is widespread in production areas and has a homogeneous population structure; leading to the hypothesis that the primary mode of dissemination is propagation material. The ability of the virus to move systemically eliminates propagation of root cuttings as a viable option to obtain RLBV-free plants, leaving RT-PCR screening as the better option to propagate RLBV- free plants in the absence of clean-up facilities or certification programs in the country.",

    "abstract": "We built a low-cost and hand-held device to image and analyze microfluidic droplets mainly for educational/teaching purposes in laboratory settings of universities. The device was assembled based on a Raspberry Pi with a camera attached on the back and an LCD screen on the top. We evaluated the performance of this device to capture images and videos to visualize high-throughput droplet generation in a microfluidic device. The qualities of imaging resolution and speed were sufficient for us to perform subsequent droplet analysis quantitatively through automatic image possessing. Droplet characteristics including droplet size, volume, and dispersity, as well as droplet intensity, have been measured, showing the potential of this device to analyze droplet-based assays. Most importantly, in addition to learning the knowledge and principles from classroom lectures, students can thus gain practice of using an advanced, state-of-the-art technology in a laboratory course. It will also open up opportunities to train students with skills of interdisciplinary thinking and learning.",

Sixty adult male rats were divided randomly into group (I) control; group (II) rats received RK with dose (6\u2009mg/kg/day); Group III: rats received 5\u2009ml of WT extract/kg/day; Group IV rats received AA (5\u2009mg/kg/day); Group V: rats administrated with both AA (5\u2009mg/kg/day) and RK (6\u2009mg/kg/day) and Group VI: rats administrated AA (5\u2009mg/kg/day) and 5\u2009ml of WT extract/kg/day. The biochemical assays exhibited a significant increase in serum levels of Adiponectin, AST, ALT, ALP of the group treated with acrylamide if compared to the control group and an improvement in their levels of groups V and VI. The histopathological and immunohistochemical findings confirm the biochemical observations. In conclusion, the present investigation proved that the supplementation of WT and RK enhanced the liver histology, immunohistochemistry and biochemistry against the oxidative stress induced by acrylamide.",

    "abstract": "Rodents have been used for decades to probe neural circuits involved in behavior. Increasingly, attempts have been developed to standardize training paradigms across labs; and to use visual/auditory paradigms that can be also tested in humans. Commercially available systems are expensive and thus do not scale easily, and are not optimized for electrophysiology.\nUsing the rich open-source technology built around Raspberry Pi, we were able to develop an inexpensive (<$1000) visual-screen based operant chamber with electrophysiological and optogenetic compatibility. The chamber is operated within MATLAB/Simulink, a commonly used scientific programming language allowing for rapid customization.\nHere, we describe and provide all relevant details needed to develop and produce these chambers, and show examples of behavior and electrophysiology data collected using these chambers. We also include all of the tools needed to allow readers to build and develop their own boxes (CAD models for 3D printing and laser-cutting; PCB-board design; all bill of materials for required parts and supplies, and some examples of Simulink models to operate the boxes).\nThe new boxes are far more cost-effective than commercially available environments and allow for the combination of automated behavioral testing with electrophysiological read-outs with high temporal precision.\nThese open-source boxes can be used for labs interested in developing high-throughput visual/auditory behavioral assays for \u223c 10th the cost of commercial systems.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK) (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone) is the major compound responsible for the characteristic aroma of red raspberries, and has long been used commercially as a flavoring agent and recently as a weight loss supplement. A targeted UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS method was developed and validated for analysis of RK and 25 associated metabolites in mouse plasma and brain. Dispersion and projection analysis and central composite design were used for method optimization. Random effect analysis of variance was applied for validation inference and variation partition. Within this framework, repeatability, a broader sense of precision, was calculated as fraction of accuracy variance, reflecting instrumental imprecision, compound degradation and carry-over effects. Multivariate correlation analysis and principle component analysis were conducted, revealing underlying association among the manifold of method traits. R programming was engaged in streamlined statistical analysis and data visualization. Two particular phenomena, the analytes' background existence in the enzyme solution used for phase II metabolites deconjugation, and the noted lability of analytes in pure solvent at 4 \u2103 vs. elevated stability in biomatrices, were found critical to method development and validation. The approach for the method development and validation provided a foundation for experiments that examine RK metabolism and bioavailability.",

    "abstract": "Herein, we report a novel lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) system for detecting cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in serum using the time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) technique and the fusion 5 membrane. The fusion 5 membrane is used as a strip for LFIA, and it is constructed without additional matrices (such as a sample or conjugation pad). Although this strategy for constructing the LFIA strip is quite simple and cost-effective, LFIA is still not suitable for the analysis of biomarkers that require high sensitivity, such as cTnI. Therefore, the highly sensitive TR-FRET technique is integrated with a fusion 5 membrane-based LFIA strip. To accomplish this, a microparticle covered with europium chelate-contained silica nanoparticles is synthesized as a raspberry-type particle and used as a fluorescence donor. A gold nanorod (GNR) is used as a fluorescence acceptor particle. In the TR-FRET-based LFIA system, the competitive immunoassay should be performed to satisfy the condition required for the FRET phenomenon to occur. Therefore, the fluorescence signal is proportional to the cTnI concentration, ensuring a quantitative analysis of cTnI can be accomplished by measuring the fluorescence signal between the raspberry-type europium particles and GNR. Using the developed TR-FRET-based LFIA system, sensitive detection of cTnI is successfully achieved with a limit of detection of 97\u00a0pg/mL in human serum. Moreover, because the result can be obtained using one matrix (the fusion 5 membrane), the developed LFIA system can be employed in cTnI diagnosis with a simple manufacturing process.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to authenticate five types of Romanian honey (raspberry, rape, thyme, sunflower and mint) using a voltammetric tongue (VE tongue) technique. For the electronic tongue system, six electrodes (silver, gold, platinum, glass, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) were used. The results of the melissopalynological analysis were supplemented by the data obtained with the electronic voltammetric tongue system. The results were interpreted by means of principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In this way, the usefulness of the working electrodes was compared for determining the botanical origin of the honey samples. The electrodes of titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and silver were more useful, as the results obtained with these electrodes showed that it was achieved a better classification of honey according to its botanical origin. The comparison of the results of the electronic voltammetric tongue technique with those obtained by melissopalynological analysis showed that the technique was able to accurately classify 92.7% of the original grouped cases. The similarity of results confirmed the ability of the electronic voltammetric tongue technique to perform a rapid characterization of honey samples, which complements its advantages of being an easy-to-use and cheap method of analysis.",

    "abstract": "The phenylbutanoid 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one, commonly known as raspberry ketone, is responsible for the typical scent and flavor of ripe raspberries. Chemical production of nature-identical raspberry ketone is well established as this compound is frequently used to flavor food, beverages and perfumes. However, high demand for natural raspberry ketone, but low natural abundance in raspberries, render raspberry ketone one of the most expensive natural flavoring components.\nIn this study, Corynebacterium glutamicum was engineered for the microbial synthesis of the character impact compound raspberry ketone from supplemented p-coumaric acid. In this context, the NADPH-dependent curcumin/dihydrocurcumin reductase CurA from Escherichia coli was employed to catalyze the final step of raspberry ketone synthesis as it provides a hitherto unknown benzalacetone reductase activity. In combination with a 4-coumarate: CoA ligase from parsley (Petroselinum crispum) and a monofunctional benzalacetone synthase from Chinese rhubarb (Rheum palmatum), CurA constitutes the synthetic pathway for raspberry ketone synthesis in C. glutamicum. The resulting strain accumulated up to 99.8\u00a0mg/L (0.61\u00a0mM) raspberry ketone. In addition, supplementation of other phenylpropanoids allowed for the synthesis of two other naturally-occurring and flavoring phenylbutanoids, zingerone (70\u00a0mg/L, 0.36\u00a0mM) and benzylacetone (10.5\u00a0mg/L, 0.07\u00a0mM).\nThe aromatic product portfolio of C. glutamicum was extended towards the synthesis of the flavoring phenylbutanoids raspberry ketone, zingerone and benzylacetone. Key to success was the identification of CurA from E. coli having a benzalacetone reductase activity. We believe, that the constructed C. glutamicum strain represents a versatile platform for the production of natural flavoring phenylbutanoids at larger scale.",

    "abstract": "Considering a growing demand for medicinal/cosmetic products with natural actives, this study focuses on the low-energy nanoemulsions (LE-NEs) prepared via the Phase inversion composition (PIC) method at room temperature as potential carriers for natural oil. Four different red raspberry seed oils (ROs) were tested, as follows: cold-pressed vs. CO2-extracted, organic vs. non-organic, refined vs. unrefined. The oil phase was optimized with Tocopheryl acetate and Isostearyl isostearate, while water phase was adjusted with either glycerol or an antioxidant hydro-glycolic extract. This study has used a combined approach to formulation development, employing both conventional methods (pseudo-ternary phase diagram - PTPD, electrical conductivity, particle size measurements, microscopical analysis, and rheological measurements) and the methods novel to this area, such as textural analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy has detected fine differences in chemical composition among ROs, and it detected the interactions within nanoemulsions. It was shown that the cold-pressed, unrefined, organic grade oil (RO2) with 6.62% saturated fatty acids and 92.25% unsaturated fatty acids, was optimal for the LE-NEs. Textural analysis confirmed the existence of cubic gel-like phase as a crucial step in the formation of stable RO2-loaded LE-NEs, with droplets in the narrow nano-range (125 to 135 nm; PDI \u2264 0.1). The DPPH test in methanol and ABTS in aqueous medium have revealed a synergistic free radical scavenging effect between lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidants in LE-NEs. The nanoemulsion carrier has improved the biological effect of raw materials on HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells, while exhibiting good safety profile, as confirmed on MRC-5 normal human lung fibroblasts. Overall, this study has shown that low-energy nanoemulsions present very promising carriers for topical delivery of natural bioactives. Raman spectroscopy and textural analysis have proven to be a useful addition to the arsenal of methods used in the formulation and characterization of nanoemulsion systems.",

    "abstract": "Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of age-related functional decline and chronic diseases, which is primarily attributed to phytochemicals. Raspberries are rich in phytochemicals with a wide range of biological activities and health benefits. However, little is known about their effects on aging. The objective of this study was to determine whether raspberry extract (RE) could promote lifespan and stress resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), and to explore the underlying mechanisms of action. The results showed that the mean lifespan of C. elegans treated with RE at 20, 40 and 80 mg mL-1 was significantly increased by 13.6%, 22.9% and 29.7%, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. Supplementation with RE decreased the accumulation of lipofuscin and extended the healthspan of animals by improving motility and enhancing resistance to heat stress and UV-B radiation in C. elegans. Meanwhile, treatment with RE could regulate the expression of anti-aging related genes, including daf-2, age-1, akt-2, sir-2.1, daf-16, skn-1, jnk-1 and hsp-16.2, and promote the migration of DAF-16 into the nucleus. In addition, administration with RE abolished the extension of the lifespan of daf-2(e1370) mutants and RNAi (daf-16) C. elegans, and inhibited the expression of daf-16 downstream genes, including sod-3, ctl-2, dod17 and clk-1. In conclusion, RE could prolong the lifespan, improve the healthspan and enhance stress resistance in C. elegans by the insulin/IGF signaling pathway and DAF-16, providing a theoretical basis to fully exploit raspberry in the prevention of aging and healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Food allergies are a very serious problem among consumers. The most common food allergies involve animal products, but they can also involve fruits such as berries. We aimed to determine whether organic farming is useful for the production of high-quality and safe fruits. Three varieties of raspberries 'Laszka', 'Glen Ample' and 'Polka' from organic and conventional production (neighboring farms) were collected over the two years of the experiment. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of phenolic compounds was carried out, and the content of Bet v1 and profilin was determined. The organic raspberries contained a lower level of phenolic compounds, especially anthocyanins. Conventional fruits were characterized by a higher allergenic potency than organic ones. We found a strong link between their anthocyanin content and the allergy status of conventional raspberry fruits. Therefore, organically produced raspberries are safer for consumers.",

    "abstract": "We report a facile method for preparation of polystyrene (PS) particles with spherical, raspberry-like, and hollow flower-like structures by single-step non-surfactant self-templating polymerization of styrene in ethanol-water mixtures. PS particles with diverse morphologies could be easily obtained by simply adjusting the volume ratios of the styrene/water/ethanol mixture and initiator-ethanol-water mixture. By decreasing this ratio, the particles with spherical, raspberry-like, and hollow flower-like structures were obtained in sequence. The wettability of the coatings changing from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity was easily tuned by the PS particles with different roughnesses. A competitive mechanism of interfacial polymerization and exudation was proposed to interpret the formation of PS particles with diverse morphologies.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberry (BRB) phytochemicals demonstrate anti-carcinogenic properties in experimental models, including prostate cancer. Two BRB foods, a confection and nectar, providing a consistent and reproducible product for human clinical studies are designed and characterized.\nMen with clinically localized prostate cancer are sequentially enrolled to a control group or one of four intervention groups (confection or nectar, 10 or 20 g dose; n = 8 per group) for 4 weeks prior to prostatectomy. Primary outcomes include: safety, adherence, and ellagitannin metabolism. Adherence to the intervention is >96%. No significant (\u2265grade II) toxicities are detected. Urinary urolithins (A, B, C, and D) and dimethyl ellagic acid (DMEA) quantified by Ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS/MS) indicate a dose-dependent excretion yet heterogeneous patterns among men. Men in the BRB confection groups have greater urinary excretion of the microbial urinary metabolites urolithin A and DMEA, suggesting that this food matrix provides greater colonic microflora exposure.\nFully characterized BRB confections and nectar are ideal for food-based large phase III human clinical studies. BRB products provide a bioavailable source of BRB phytochemicals, however large inter individual variation in polyphenol metabolism suggests that host genetics, microflora, and other factors are critical to understanding bioactivity and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the incidence of lifestyle diseases is increasing due to inappropriate nutrition and environmental pollution. To prevent these diseases, various groups of bioactive compounds are needed with a broad spectrum of action and without adverse side effects. Polyphenolic compounds are the most widely studied group of this type of compounds. They occur widely in plants, but their content depends on many factors, including the type of plant, climatic conditions, and the date of harvest. The spectrum of bioactivity of phenolic compounds is determined by their chemical structure, concentration, and interaction with other compounds. Traditional recipes have been studied to search for active plant ingredients. Leaves of shrubs and fruit trees were used in folk medicine as a panacea for many diseases and have been forgotten with time, but their benefits are now being rediscovered. In recent years, much new information about biological activity of phenolic compounds from berry bushes (black currant, raspberry, and aronia) was published. This was reviewed and discussed in this article. The mineral content of their leaves was also summarized because minerals constitute a significant component of plant infusions. It has been shown that high antioxidant and biological activity of leaf extracts results from the presence of active phenolic compounds, which occur in definitely higher amounts than in fruits. Therefore, the leaves of berry bushes seem to be a promising source of substances that can be used as replacements for synthetic agents in the treatment and prevention of lifestyle diseases.",

High processing temperature reduced ascorbic acid, total monomeric anthocyanins (TMA) and total phenolics (TP) in strawberries (p<0.05), but not in raspberries. Processing temperature had minor effect on bioactive compounds in the jams during storage (<10% explained variance), but influenced color (L*, \u00b0Hue, Chroma), especially L* of the strawberry jams (73.3%). Storage period explained most of the variance in ascorbic acid (>90%), TMA (>42%) and TP (>69%). Storage temperature affected stability of anthocyanins, but had minor effect on ascorbic acid, which declined rapidly independent of storage temperature. Storage temperature also explained most of the variance (>40%) in Chroma of the jams and L* of raspberry jams (53%).

    "abstract": "Knowledge about the interior and exterior camera orientation parameters is required to establish the relationship between 2D image content and 3D object data. Camera calibration is used to determine the interior orientation parameters, which are valid as long as the camera remains stable. However, information about the temporal stability of low-cost cameras due to the physical impact of temperature changes, such as those in smartphones, is still missing. This study investigates on the one hand the influence of heat dissipating smartphone components at the geometric integrity of implemented cameras and on the other hand the impact of ambient temperature changes at the geometry of uncoupled low-cost cameras considering a Raspberry Pi camera module that is exposed to controlled thermal radiation changes. If these impacts are neglected, transferring image measurements into object space will lead to wrong measurements due to high correlations between temperature and camera's geometric stability. Monte-Carlo simulation is used to simulate temperature-related variations of the interior orientation parameters to assess the extent of potential errors in the 3D data ranging from a few millimetres up to five centimetres on a target in X- and Y- direction. The target is positioned at a distance of 10 m to the camera and the Z-axis is aligned with camera's depth direction.",

    "abstract": "Skin aging has many manifestations such as wrinkles, uneven skin tone, and dryness. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, especially ultraviolet light-induced oxidative radicals, contribute to the etiology of aging. Human skin requires both water- and lipid-soluble nutrient components, including hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. Vitamins C and E have important protective effects in the aging process and require exogenous supply. Raspberry leaf extracts contain botanical actives that have the potential to hydrating and moisturizing skin. Topical products with these ingredients may therefore combine to provide improved anti-aging effects over single ingredients.\nTo evaluate the anti-aging and brightening effects of an encapsulated serum containing vitamin C (20% w/w), vitamin E, and European raspberry (Rubus idaeus) leaf cell culture extract.\nFifty female volunteers aged 30-65\u00a0years were allocated one capsule of serum for topical application on one side of the face for 2\u00a0months, in addition to self-use of facial skin products. Both test (treated) and contralateral (untreated) sides were dermatologically assessed after 4 and 8\u00a0weeks. Skin color (melanin index), elasticity, radiance, moisture, and water evaporation were measured by Mexameter MX18\nSkin color, elasticity, and radiance were significantly improved. The smoothness, scaliness, and wrinkles were also revealed significant improvement. Mild adverse reactions were tingling and tightness.\nThe vitamin C, vitamin E, and raspberry leaf cell culture extract serum has anti-aging and brightening effects of skin.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ringspot virus (RpRSV) is an important virus that infects horticultural crops including grapevine, cherry, berry fruit and rose. The genome sequences of RpRSV are highly diverse between isolates and this makes the design of a PCR-based detection method difficult. In this study, a TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay was developed for the rapid and sensitive detection of RpRSV. Primers and probes targeting the most conserved region of the movement protein gene were designed to amplify a 229 bp fragment of RpRSV RNA-2. The assay was able to amplify all RpRSV isolates tested. The detection limit of the RpRSV target region was estimated to be 61-98 copies, depending on the RpRSV strain. The sensitivity was about 100 times greater than the conventional RT-PCR assay using the same primers as the real-time RT-PCR assay. A comparison with published conventional RT-PCR assays indicated that both published assays lacked reliability and sensitivity, as neither were able to amplify all RpRSV isolates tested, and both were at least 1000 times less sensitive than the novel TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay. The assay can also be run as a duplex reaction with the nad5 plant internal control primers and probe to simultaneously verify the PCR competency of the samples. The amplicon obtained with the real-time RT-PCR assay is suitable for direct sequencing if it is necessary to further confirm the RpRSV identity or determine the RpRSV strain.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal pollen transmission by the raspberry bushy dwarf virus 1b deletion mutant (RB\u03941bstop), which is defective in virus virulence, was significantly decreased compared to wild-type raspberry bushy dwarf virus (wtRBDV). We assessed accumulation of viral genomic (g) RNAs in pollen grains from RB\u03941bstop-infected plants and found that the pollen grains had less viral gRNA than those from wtRBDV-infected plants. In addition, pollen grains from 1b-expressing transgenic plants (1b-plants) infected with RB\u03941bstop were more efficient in horizontal virus transmission to healthy plants after pollination than pollen from RB\u03941bstop-infected wild type plants. Moreover, viral gRNA accumulation in pollen grains from RB\u03941bstop-infected 1b-plants was higher than in pollen from RB\u03941bstop-infected wild type plants. We suggest that 1b increases the amount of viral gRNAs released from elongating pollen grains.",

    "abstract": "Torulaspora delbrueckii is a widely studied non-Saccharomyces yeast, described as having a positive impact on the organoleptic quality of wines, however, little is known about its impact on the production of raspberry wine. In this study, we compared combined use of S. cerevisiae/T. delbrueckii pair, i.e., in sequential inoculation (RT) and co-fermentation (RC) modes, with spontaneous fermentation (RU) and single S. cerevisiae inoculation (RS), on various properties of raspberry wine including fermentation behaviors (using yeast counts and next-generation sequencing method), basic composition (by OIV, 2019), volatile profile (using headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry), sensory property (by quantitative descriptive analyses) and biogenic amine levels. All the alcoholic fermentations were completed within 9\u00a0days; T. delbrueckii was inhibited by S. cerevisiae in the co-culture; and Saccharomyces and Mrakia were the most abundant species in RU. A total of 40 aromas was identified, with RT abundant in volatile esters, ketones and terpenes and others showing relatively lower intensities. During sensory evaluation, RT was characterized by 'fruity' and 'sweet' notes; RC was notable for a high 'floral' attribute; RU scored the highest in 'pungent' and RS showed intermedium intensities for most descriptors. Partial least squares regression showed the relationship between aromas and sensory descriptors. As for biogenic amine, RU contained the highest total amount and RS had the least. Overall, RT had greater potential to be used in the production of raspberry wine.",

    "abstract": "This study involves microencapsulation of anthocyanin extract (AC) from red raspberry using a freeze drying technique involving ultrasonication of soy protein isolate (SPI), gum arabic (AG), and their combination. Analyses included microcapsule properties, encapsulation efficiency, antioxidant capacity using the DPPH assay, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), color, thermal stability, stability during storage, morphology, and simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Encapsulation efficiency (EE) ranged from 93.05% to 98.87% for all microcapsules. The morphology of microcapsules by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated a broken glass shape, with mean size of microcapsules ranging from 21.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.71\u00a0\u03bcm to 48.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.33\u00a0\u03bcm using Mastersizer analyzer. A good relationship obtained between zeta potential (ZP) and FTIR spectrum indicated that there is a chemical cross linking interaction between wall material and core material. All microcapsules enhanced the thermal stability of AC in the temperature range 80-114\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, AC retention (up to 48%) during storage at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0days revealed that treatment H combination of SPI and AG was best. In addition, SPI and AG combination presented good release behavior under simulated gastrointestinal conditions compared with unencapsulated anthocyanin.",

    "abstract": "Automatic decision support systems have gained importance in health sector in recent years. In parallel with recent developments in the fields of artificial intelligence and image processing, embedded systems are also used in decision support systems for tumor diagnosis. Extreme learning machine (ELM), is a recently developed, quick and efficient algorithm which can quickly and flawlessly diagnose tumors using machine learning techniques. Similarly, significantly fast and robust fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FRFCM) is a novel and fast algorithm which can display a high performance. In the present study, a brain tumor segmentation approach is proposed based on extreme learning machine and significantly fast and robust fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms (BTS-ELM-FRFCM) running on Raspberry Pi (PRI) hardware. The present study mainly aims to introduce a new segmentation system hardware containing new algorithms and offering a high level of accuracy the health sector. PRI's are useful mobile devices due to their cost-effectiveness and satisfying hardware. 3200 training images were used to train ELM in the present study. 20 pieces of MRI images were used for testing process. Figure of merid (FOM), Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC) and Dice indexes were used in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. In addition, the proposed method was compared with brain tumor segmentation based on support vector machine (BTS-SVM), brain tumor segmentation based on fuzzy C-means (BTS-FCM) and brain tumor segmentation based on self-organizing maps and k-means (BTS-SOM). The statistical analysis on FOM, JSC and Dice results obtained using four different approaches indicated that BTS-ELM-FRFCM displayed the highest performance. Thus, it can be concluded that the embedded system designed in the present study can perform brain tumor segmentation with a high accuracy rate.",

    "abstract": "The authors aim to investigate the mechanisms by which red raspberry (RR) polyphenolic fractions regulate obesity and inflammation with an emphasis on the crosstalk between adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) and adipocyte progenitors.\nC57BL/6 male mice are fed either a high-fat (HF) diet or an HF diet supplemented with a RR polyphenolic fraction from whole fruit, pulp, or seed. Supplementation with pulp significantly increases energy expenditure and reduces HF-diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. The pulp, and to a lesser extent, whole polyphenols, decreases the recruitment of ATM, activation of the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and adipocyte hypertrophy, which is associated with epigenetic modulation of adipogenesis (e.g., H3K27Ac, H3K9Ac). Results from an IL-1\u03b2 reporter assay in J774 macrophages recapitulate the inhibitory role of RR polyphenols on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Using conditioned media from macrophages, it is demonstrated that RR polyphenols reverse the IL-1\u03b2-mediated epigenetic suppression of H3K27Ac in adipocyte progenitor cells.\nRR polyphenols from pulp and whole fruit serve as an inhibitor for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and an epigenetic modifier to regulate adipogenesis, which confers resistance against diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "It is reported that black raspberry (BRB) anthocyanins could act as a potential chemopreventive agent for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying mechanism by which BRB anthocyanins inhibits the carcinogenesis of CRC cells has not been elucidated. The abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) that target important tumor suppressor genes is usually associated with CRC development. In this study, we explored whether BRB anthocyanins could affect the expression of certain miRNAs in an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced CRC mouse model and human CRC cell lines. miRNA microarray analysis was used to determine the differences in miRNA expression between AOM/DSS-induced mice fed with a diet supplemented without or with BRB anthocyanins. The expression of one particular miRNA, miR-483-3p, was found to decrease dramatically in AOM/DSS-induced mice that were fed with a diet supplemented with BRB anthocyanins. Subsequent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses showed that the reduced expression of miR-483-3p was accompanied by an increased expression of Dickkopf 3 (DKK3), a potential target of miR-483-3p as predicted by bioinformatic analysis. The protein and messenger RNA levels of DKK3 were significantly upregulated when the miR-483-3p level was reduced by a miR-483-3p-specific inhibitor, suggesting that DKK3 might be the target gene of miR-483-3p. In addition, the downstream factors of the DKK3 signaling pathway, which included Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, also played a role in the miR-483-3p-mediated anticancer effect of BRB anthocyanins. Thus, miR-483-3p might be a potential target in BRB anthocyanin-mediated prevention of CRC.",

    "abstract": "Being delicious and containing strong disease-fighting agents, berries represent an increasing proportion of fruits consumed nowadays in our diet. However, berries are highly perishable as fresh and, therefore, they are usually processed into various products to extend their shelf-life and availability throughout the year. Among the fruit-containing products, jam is one of the most common due to its nourishing properties, its low production costs, and its accessibility for a lengthy period. Rather than home preparation, consumers nowadays increasingly prefer to purchase commercial jams from markets due to its convenience. Although fresh berries have been extensively studied for their phenolic compounds, a limited number of studies investigating commercially manufactured jams have been conducted so far. Considering this, the objective of this study was to assess the total phenolic, flavonoid, and anthocyanin content and the antioxidant activity of five commonly consumed commercial berry jams (blueberry (",

    "abstract": "In this work, an efficient method for the rapid extraction and separation of antioxidant phenols was developed and optimized. The method was then applied to extract and separate nine phenols from 37 varieties of raspberry, in which their antioxidant activities were further investigated. First, the extraction was conducted using ultra-sonication, which was then further separated using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/ultraviolet (RP-HPLC/UV) analysis. In this step, several key parameters (volume of the extraction reagent, time of extraction, and the temperature of extraction) affecting its efficiency were investigated and optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM) combined with the Box-Behnken design (BBD) so that the optimal conditions were obtained. According to the overall results of the optimization study, the optimal conditions were chosen as follows: volume of extraction reagent = 2.0 mL, time of extraction = 50.0 min, and temperature of extraction = 50 \u00b0C. The optimal conditions were then applied to extract nine phenols, including gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, cumaric acid, ferulic acid, rosemary acid, and quercetin from 37 raspberry varieties. The extracted phenols were characterized and their antioxidant activities, including DPPH",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone is a primary aroma component of the red raspberry. The glycosylation of this compound is a potential approach used to improve its pharmaceutical properties. In this work, raspberry ketone glycosides are produced in bacteria for the first time. Bacillus licheniformis PI15, an organic solvent-tolerant glycosyltransferase-producing strain, was isolated from chemically polluted soil. The cloning and heterologous expression of a glycosyltransferase, which was designated PI-GT1, in Escherichia coli BL21 resulted in the expression of an active and soluble protein that accounted for 15% of the total cell protein content. Purified PI-GT1 was highly active and stable over a broad pH range (6.0-10.0) and showed excellent pH stability. PI-GT1 maintained almost 60% of its maximal activity after 3\u00a0H of incubation at 20-40\u00a0\u00b0C and demonstrated optimal activity at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Additionally, PI-GT1 displayed high stability and activity in the presence of hydrophilic solvents with log P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0-0.2 and retained more than 80% of its activity after 3\u00a0H of treatment. Supplementation with 10% DMSO markedly improved the glycosylation of raspberry ketone, resulting in a value 26 times higher than that in aqueous solution. The organic solvent-tolerant PI-GT1 may have potential uses in industrial chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis applications.",

    "abstract": "In 2018, an outbreak of leptospirosis was identified among raspberry workers from a mixed-berry farm in New South Wales, Australia. Initial testing had not revealed a cause, but eventually leptospirosis was detected via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Further serological testing detected Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Arborea, of which rodents are the predominant reservoir. Leptospirosis is rare in Australia, with outbreaks usually related to flooding. We conducted an investigation to identify risk factors for infection, to inform control measures.\nCases were detected through laboratory notifications, hospital-based syndromic surveillance, awareness-raising among farm employees and clinician alerts. Confirmed cases had a four-fold rise in antibody titre or single titre \u2265400 on microscopic agglutination test, and a positive IgM. Probable cases had a positive Leptospira PCR or IgM, and possible cases had a clinically compatible illness. We conducted a case-control study among raspberry workers on the farm and compared reported exposures between cases and seronegative controls. We assessed environmental risks on-site and tested rodents for leptospirosis.\nWe identified 84 cases over a 5-month period (50 confirmed, 19 probable and 15 possible). Compared with controls, cases were less likely to wear gloves and more recently employed. Cases also more commonly reported always having scratched hands, likely from the thorns on raspberry plants. We observed evidence of rodent activity around raspberry plants and three of thirteen trapped mice tested positive for Leptospira Arborea. Control measures included enhanced glove use, doxycycline prophylaxis and rodent control.\nThis is the largest known outbreak of leptospirosis in Australia. Workers were likely exposed through scratches inflicted during harvesting, which became contaminated with environmental leptospires from mice. Leptospirosis should be considered an occupational risk for raspberry workers, requiring protective measures. Chemoprophylaxis may assist in controlling outbreaks. PCR assists in the early diagnosis and detection of leptospirosis and should be included in surveillance case definitions.",

    "abstract": "Predictive maintenance techniques can determine the conditions of equipment in order to evaluate when maintenance should be performed. Thus, it minimizes the unexpected device downtime, lowers the maintenance costs, extends equipment lifecycle, etc. Therefore, this article developed a predictive maintenance mechanism with the construction of a test platform and data analysis along with machine learning. The information transmission of sensors was based on Raspberry Pi via the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) communication protocol. The sensors used for environmental sensing were implemented on the programmable interface controller and the data were stored in time sequence. A statistical analysis software platform was adopted for data preprocessing, modelling, and prediction to provide necessary maintenance decision. Using multivariate analysis users can obtain more information about the equipment's status, and the administrator can also determine the operational situation before unexpected device anomalies. The developed modules are decisively helpful in preventing unpredictable losses, thus improving the quality of services.",

    "abstract": "Automated weeding is an important research area in agrorobotics. Weeds can be removed mechanically or with the precise usage of herbicides. Deep Learning techniques achieved state of the art results in many computer vision tasks, however their deployment on low-cost mobile computers is still challenging. The described system contains several novelties, compared both with its previous version and related work. It is a part of a project of the automatic weeding machine, developed by the Warsaw University of Technology and MCMS Warka Ltd. Obtained models reach satisfying accuracy (detecting 47-67% of weed area, misclasifing as weed 0.1-0.9% of crop area) at over 10 FPS on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ computer. It was tested for four different plant species at different growth stadiums and lighting conditions. The system performing semantic segmentation is based on Convolutional Neural Networks. Its custom architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet and ResNet concepts. Amount of needed manual ground truth labels was significantly decreased by the usage of the knowledge distillation process, learning final model which mimics an ensemble of complex models on a large database of unlabeled data. Further decrease of the inference time was obtained by two custom modifications: in the usage of separable convolutions in DenseNet block and in the number of channels in each layer. In the authors' opinion, the described novelties can be easily transferred to other agrorobotics tasks.",

    "abstract": "Effects of red raspberry extract (RRE) intake on hyperlipidemia mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD) were investigated in this study. After intragastric gavage of RRE for 8 weeks, the body weight and the adipose tissue mass of mice in RRE administration groups significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) decreased compared to the group without RRE treatment. RRE treatment significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) lowered triglyceride and total cholesterol levels of hyperlipidemia mice. Ppar\u03b1, Hmgcr, Ldlr, Cyp7a1, Acsl3, Pnpla2 and Pin4 were confirmed as the regulatory genes by transcriptome analysis and qRCR validation. According to KEGG pathway analysis, target genes such as Cyp7a1 and Pin4 were further regulated by the activation of PPAR\u03b1 resulting from RRE supplementation. Meanwhile, liver cholesterol synthesis and conversion were inhibited by the expressions of Hmgcr and Cyp7a1 genes regulated by RRE intake, and Ldlr gene was down-regulated to limit the transport of cholesterol. In addition, RRE treatment could accelerate the conversion from triglyceride to fatty acid. To conclusion, RRE intake would be a protection against diet-induced hypertriglyceridemia.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry-like hollow-spheres-on-sphere (HSOS) particles with reactive surfaces, uniform sizes and monodisperse properties were rational designed and fabricated to immobilize gold nanoparticles for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol. HSOS polysilsesquioxane (PSQ) particles were constructed by an organic alkali catalyzed sol-gel process from trialkoxysilane precursors with stabilized polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles as both a sacrifice template and a Pickering emulsifier. The PSQ particles were fabricated in an ice bath with methyltrimethoxysilane and mercaptopropyltrimethoxysiane as a co-precursor, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) as a catalyst, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and sodium lignosulfonat as co-stabilizers and PS latex as a hard template. The formation mechanism of the hierarchical particles was investigated in detail by the time study through imaging the particles at regular time intervals during the reaction process. Various effect factors on the morphology were studied systematically which showed that the precursor composition, the content of PS, TMAH and PVP are the most important factors. The hierarchical structure combined with the mercaptopropyl groups on both the surface and the skeleton to make it possible to adsorb guest molecules. Au nanoparticles were immobilized on the particles for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. The unique PSQ colloids with hollow-spheres-on-sphere extended the family of the hierarchical structures and has shown the potential applications in separations, drug delivery and heterogeneous catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Ethanol consumption is one of the common causative agents implicated in gastric ulcer development. Oxidative stress plays a major role in the induction and development of gastric ulceration. NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) are key players in ethanol-induced ulcers. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a ubiquitous nuclear protein, mediates various inflammation functions. However, the role of HMGB1 in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer is not yet elucidated. Raspberry Ketone (RK) is a natural phenolic compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, absolute ethanol (7.5 ml/kg) was used to induce gastric ulceration in rats. Raspberry Ketone (RK) (50 mg/kg) was given orally one hour before the administration of absolute ethanol. Interestingly, ethanol-induced gastric ulcer was associated with Nrf2 downregulation, which was correlated with NOX-1, 2 NOX-4, and HMGB1 upregulation, and was significantly reversed by RK pre-treatment. RK pre-treatment provided 80% gastroprotection. Gastroprotective properties of RK were mediated via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory (suppression of NF-kB and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), and antiapoptotic activities (reduction of Bax/Bcl2 ratio). Gastroprotective properties of RK were confirmed by histopathological examination. In conclusion, this study is the first to provide evidence to the role of HMGB1 in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer, and the crosstalk of Nrf2, NOXs and HMGB1. It also demonstrates that RK represents a promising gastroprotective activity comparable to omeprazole.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry fruits are a perfect source of polyphenols, including flavonols, anthocyanins. Some experiments have indicated that organic fruits contain more bioactive compounds than conventional fruits. The aim of this study was therefore to analyse and compare the concentration of bioactive compounds in organic vs. conventional raspberries and to determine the effects of harvest time and cultivar. Three cultivars of raspberry ('Laszka', 'Glen Ample' and 'Glen Fine') that were harvested in summer and one 'Polka' cv. that was harvested in autumn time from organic and conventional cultivation methods were used in the experiment. The contents of dry matter and polyphenols in the fruits were determined. The organic samples contained significantly more dry matter, phenolic acid and flavonoids, including myrycetin, quercetin, luteolin and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside. Harvest time was an important factor in raspberry fruit quality.",

    "abstract": "Oral cancer is a public health problem with an incidence of almost 50,000 and a mortality of 10,000 each year in the USA alone. Black raspberries (BRBs) have been shown to inhibit oral carcinogenesis in several preclinical models, but our understanding of how BRB phytochemicals affect the metabolic pathways during oral carcinogenesis remains incomplete. We used a well-established rat oral cancer model to determine potential metabolic pathways impacted by BRBs during oral carcinogenesis. F344 rats were exposed to the oral carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in drinking water for 14 weeks, then regular drinking water for six weeks. Carcinogen exposed rats were fed a 5% or 10% BRB supplemented diet or control diet for six weeks after carcinogen exposure. RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis on rat tongue, and mass spectrometry and NMR metabolomics analysis on rat urine were performed. We tentatively identified 57 differentially or uniquely expressed metabolites and over 662 modulated genes in rats being fed with BRB. Glycolysis and AMPK pathways were modulated during BRB-mediated oral cancer chemoprevention. Glycolytic enzymes ",

    "abstract": "Research has shown that berries may have the ability to reverse, reduce, or slow the progression of behavioral dysfunction associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease. In contrast, high-energy and high-fat diets (HFD) may result in behavioral deficits like those seen in aging animals. This research examined whether red raspberry (\nEight-week-old mice consumed a HFD (60% calories from fat) or a control diet (CD) with and without 4% freeze-dried red raspberry (RB). Behavioral tests and biochemical assays of brain tissue and serum were conducted.\nAfter 12 weeks on the diets, mice fed CD and HFD had impaired novel object recognition, but mice on the RB-supplemented diets did not. After approximately 20 weeks on the diets, mice fed HFD\u2009+\u2009RB had shorter latencies to find the escape hole in the Barnes maze than the HFD-fed mice. Interleukin (IL)-6 was significantly elevated in the cortex of mice fed HFD; while mice fed the CD, CD\u2009+\u2009RB, and HFD\u2009+\u2009RB did not show a similar elevation. There was also evidence of increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brains of mice fed RB diets. This reduction in IL-6 and increase in BDNF may contribute to the preservation of learning and memory in HFD\u2009+\u2009RB mice.\nThis study demonstrates that RB may protect against the effects HFD has on brain and behavior; however, further research with human subjects is needed to confirm these benefits.",

After approximately 20 weeks on the diets, mice fed HFD\u2009+\u2009RB had shorter latencies to find the escape hole in the Barnes maze than the HFD-fed mice. Interleukin (IL)-6 was significantly elevated in the cortex of mice fed HFD; while mice fed the CD, CD\u2009+\u2009RB, and HFD\u2009+\u2009RB did not show a similar elevation. There was also evidence of increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brains of mice fed RB diets. This reduction in IL-6 and increase in BDNF may contribute to the preservation of learning and memory in HFD\u2009+\u2009RB mice.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK) is the characteristic aromatic compound in raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) with wide applications as food additive and anti-obesity agent. However, quantification of RK has presented difficulties in MS detection and reliable LC-MS method for RK analysis in literature is in limit to date. In order to facilitate quality control of raspberry derived products and RK metabolomics study, this study aimed to develop a validated and sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method. Strong in-source fragmentation was noted and the fragmental ion of 107\u00a0m/z produced was selected as the precursor ion for MRM detection, and as such the electrospray ionization performance was optimized by fractional factorial design to accommodate such ion-source dissociation behavior as well as its moderate volatility. A pathway involving the formation of quinone-like structure with strong conjugation was proposed to explain the intense in-source fragmentation. The MRM transition was optimized with product ion of 77\u00a0m/z selected as the quantifier ion. The method featured low limit of quantification of \u223c2\u00a0ng/mL and allowed for rapid detection of RK in fresh raspberries following direct sample preparation. RK contents were found to be higher from locally grown and harvested farm sources compared to commercial products shipped into the state, and higher in those at late-stage compared with early-stage maturity. No correlations in RK content between organic and non-organic labels were noted.",

The samples were submitted to an ohmic system and conventional pasteurization (65\u202f\u00b0C-30\u202fmin). Both processing led to increases in the color parameters (C*, h* and \u2206E*) in the first 30\u202fmin. For the treatments, 10\u202fHz-25\u202fV and 1000\u202fHz-25\u202fV, more viscous, and consequently increased D[4,3] and D[3,2] values were observed, and similar results were obtained for the DSC behavior. The microstructure confirmed aggregation of cell structure in those configurations (10\u202fHz and 1000\u202fHz-25\u202fV). OH, parameters for both ohmic configurations have an impact in all the evaluated parameters for raspberry-flavored whey drink, which can be interesting for the dairy industry.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberries (Rubus idaeus) contain numerous phenolic compounds with purported health benefits. Raspberry ketone (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone) is a primary raspberry flavor phenolic found in raspberries and is designated as a synthetic flavoring agent by the Food and Drug Administration. Synthetic raspberry ketone has been demonstrated to result in weight loss in rodents. We tested whether phenolic-enriched raspberry extracts, compared with raspberry ketone, would be more resilient to the metabolic alterations caused by an obesogenic diet. Male C57BL/6J mice (8\u202fweeks old) received a daily oral dose of vehicle (VEH; 50% propylene glycol, 40% water, and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide), raspberry extract low (REL; 0.2\u202fg/kg), raspberry extract high (REH; 2\u202fg/kg), or raspberry ketone (RK; 0.2\u202fg/kg). Coincident with daily dosing, mice were placed on a high-fat diet (45% fat). After 4\u202fweeks, REH and RK reduced body weight gain (approximately 5%-9%) and white adipose mass (approximately 20%) compared with VEH. Hepatic gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 and lipoprotein lipase was upregulated in REH compared with VEH. Indirect calorimetry indicated that respiratory exchange ratio (CO",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States and the fourth globally with a rising incidence. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic immunologically mediated disease that imposes a significant associated health burden, including the increased risk for colonic dysplasia and CRC. Carcinogenesis has been attributed to chronic inflammation and associated with oxidative stress, genomic instability, and immune effectors as well as the cytokine dysregulation and activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) signaling pathway. Current anti-inflammation therapies used for IBD treatment have shown limited effects on CRC chemoprevention, and their long-term toxicity has limited their clinical application. However, natural food-based prevention approaches may offer significant cancer prevention effects with very low toxicity profiles. In particular, in preclinical and clinical pilot studies, strawberry and black raspberry have been widely selected as food-based interventions because of their potent preventive activities. In this review, we summarize the roles of strawberry, black raspberry, and their polyphenol components on CRC chemoprevention in IBD.",

    "abstract": "Industrial processing of raspberries into juice and jam results in the production of with high content of lipophilic and hydrophilic phytochemicals. Usually considered as waste, raspberry pomace is occasionally cold-pressed to recover specialty oil. However, the resulting pomace press-cake (PPC) still contains 30% to 35% of lipophilic compounds, such as essential fatty acids, tocols, phytosterols, and ellagitannins initially present in pomace. In a perspective of sustainable development, we investigate an eco-friendly process using an aqueous enzyme-assisted extraction (AEAE) to simultaneously and effectively recover lipophilic compounds and polyphenols from the PPC. The performance of different combinations of carbohydrases and proteases was compared. After selecting the best enzymatic system, a definitive screening design involving six factors was then implemented to optimize the process. Under optimized conditions, 1.2 units of thermostable alkaline protease/100 g PPC, pH 9, 60 \u00b0C, and 2 hr hydrolysis, more than 38% of total PPC lipophilic content were recovered in the aqueous medium. The recovery of polyphenols and antioxidant activity was, respectively, 48% and 25% higher than obtained by extraction with methanol/acetone/water mixture. Such an AEAE extract might prove useful in food and nutraceutical applications. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Raspberry pomace, a food industrial by-product, is often considered as waste. However, it is a rich source of phytochemicals, such as tocols, polyphenols, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. To overcome the drawbacks of organic solvent use, an enzyme-assisted extraction process was developed as an eco-friendly alternative to recover these bioactive compounds. Definitive screening design experimental design was used to enhance polyphenols and lipophilics extraction yields while reducing process costs. This extract is an oil-in-water emulsion, with high content in antioxidant phytochemicals, which might have potential for use in nutraceutical applications. Therefore, this green process developed for the valorization of raspberry pomace is considered as a perspective of sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "After almost a century of use and development, operant chambers remain a significant financial investment for scientists. Small powerful single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi\u2122 offer researchers a low-cost alternative to expensive operant chambers. In this paper, we describe two new operant chambers, one using nose-poke ports as operanda and another using a touchscreen. To validate the chamber designs, rats learned to perform both visual discrimination and delayed alternation tasks in each chamber. Designs and codes are open source and serve as a starting point for researchers to develop behavioral experiments or educational demonstrations.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the effect of raspberry pomace and its grinding level on microbial activity in the gastrointestinal tract as well as on the parameters involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism in Wistar rats. The nutritional experiment was performed using 24 male Wistar rats, which were divided into 3 groups of 8 animals each. The animals were fed a standard diet (C) or a modified diet containing 7% raspberry pomace subjected to standard (SG) or fine (FG) grinding. Finer grinding increased the concentration of polyphenols and altered the composition of the dietary fibre, thereby affecting the intestinal microbial activity and related mechanisms that regulate systemic parameters. The FG diet considerably increased the level of total ellagitannin metabolites in the colon (23.56\u202f\u03bcg/g for SG and 79.54\u202f\u03bcg/g for FG) and plasma (0.029\u202f\u03bcg/mL for SG and 0.041\u202f\u03bcg/mL for FG) and reduced \u03b2-glucuronidase and \u03b1-glucosidase activity (19.2 and 19.7 for SG and 13.3 and 8.7\u202f\u03bcmol/h/g for FG, respectively) and short-chain fatty acid production (55.84\u202f\u03bcmol/g for SG and 48.60\u202f\u03bcmol/g for FG) in the caecum. Compared to the SG, the FG diet improved the antioxidant capacity of water-soluble substances in plasma (4.34\u202f\u03bcg/mL for SG and 4.92\u202f\u03bcg/mL for FG). Both diets with raspberry pomaces increased the plasma HDL cholesterol (0.48\u202fmmol/L for C, 0.56\u202fmmol/L for SG, 0.57\u202fmmol/L for FG) and decreased the atherogenic index (AI\u202f=\u202f(TC-HDL)/HDL: 2.57 for C, 1.98 for SG, 2.00 for FG). The FG diet resulted in the lowest plasma glucose level (10.8\u202fmmol/L for C, 8.2\u202fmmol/L for SG, 7.3\u202fmmol/L for FG). In conclusion, both diets with raspberry pomaces modulated intestinal microbial activity and related systemic parameters; however, FG pomace exhibited greater inhibitory effects than SG pomace in the lower gut environment and glucose metabolism.",

    "abstract": "In this experiment,the antioxidant capacity of raspberry extract and the protective effect on liver injury induced by ConA in mice were investigated. Balb/C male mice were randomly divided into six groups: normal group,model group,bicyclol control group( 200 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)),low-dose raspberry extract group( 200 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)),middle-dose raspberry extract group( 400 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)),and highdose raspberry extract group( 800 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)). Each group was intragastrically administered with drugs according to the body weight once a day. Seven days later,all of the groups except for the normal group were treated with ConA( 20 mg\u00b7kg~(-1)) through tail vein injection to establish the acute liver injury model. The mice were put to death 8 hours later. The organ indexes were calculated. These rum levels of ALT,AST and LDH and the activities of SOD,CAT,GSH and MDA in liver tissue were detected. HE staining was used to observe the pathological changes of liver tissue in mice. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of Bax,Bcl-2,Nrf2 and Keap-1. The antioxidant capacity of raspberry extract was measured by CAA assay. The results showed that,raspberry extract had a strong antioxidant capacity. Simultaneously,compared with the model group,raspberry extract can significantly improve the pathological conditions of liver,and significantly reduce ALT,AST and LDH activities in serum of liver injury mice( P<0. 01). The activities of SOD,CAT in liver homogenate supernatant were significantly increased in the high-dose group,the content of GSH increased,while the content of MDA was sharply declined in the high-dose group( P<0. 01). Meanwhile,raspberry extract down-regulated the expressions of Bax and Keap-1 and up-regulated the expressions of Bcl-2 and Nrf2. CAA showed that the compound raspberry extract had a strong antioxidant capacity. Therefore,raspberry extract has an obvious protective effect on acute liver injury induced by ConA in mice.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a major effector of various diseases; accordingly, antioxidants are frequently ingested in order to prevent or alleviate disease symptoms. Kimchi contains various natural antioxidants, and it is known that the functional activity varies depending on the ingredients and fermentation state. Black raspberries (BR) contain various bioactive compounds with antioxidant effects. This study investigated the antioxidant and liver-protection effects of kimchi supplemented with black raspberry juice powder (BJP).\nBJP-added kimchi (BAK; at 0.5%, 1%, and 2% concentrations of BJP) and control (without BJP) were prepared and fermented at 4\u2103 for 4 weeks. Changes in the antioxidant effects of BAK during fermentation were investigated. In addition, the protective activity of BAK against oxidative stress was investigated in a liver cirrhosis-induced animal model \nBAK groups showed the acidity and pH of optimally ripened (OR) kimchi at 2 weeks of fermentation along with the highest lactic acid bacterial counts. Additionally, BAK groups displayed a higher content of phenolic compounds and elevated antioxidant activities relative to the control, with the highest antioxidant effect observed at 2 weeks of fermentation of OR 1% BAK. After feeding the OR 1% BAK to thioacetamide-induced liver cirrhosis rats, we observed decreased glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase activities and elevated superoxide dismutase activity.\nThese findings showed that the antioxidant effects of OR BAK and feeding of OR 1% BAK resulted in liver-protective effects against oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "One of the most critical aspects of chromatographic analysis is effective data acquisition and processing. Typical approaches include software platforms designed for specific instruments or commercial data acquisition hardware boards, both of which require expensive licenses to use and operate. To increase the access and affordability of chromatographic data acquisition, especially for systems in which software control has become obsolete or must be written in-house, an open-source digital stripchart recorder has been developed. This system is built upon a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and a plug-in printed circuit board with the necessary integrated circuits for data acquisition. Using an open-source software called Processing, a complete user interface to control the system was developed that enables the acquisition, filtering, and processing of chromatographic data. The system performs comparably to more expensive platforms, with calculated values for peak area, retention time, and plate count all within 3% of the values calculated by a widely used commercial chromatography data software package.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone is an important ingredient in the flavor and fragrance industries. Due to its low content in fruits and vegetables, the production of natural raspberry ketone using heterologous synthesis in microbial strains is recently attracting increased attention. In this work, a heterologous pathway to produce raspberry ketone from p-coumaric acid, including 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL), benzalacetone synthase (BAS), and raspberry ketone/zingerone synthase (RZS1) from plants, was successfully assembled in Escherichia coli. When the RZS1 gene was introduced into E. coli and co-expressed with two other genes, the intermediate 4-hydroxybenzylidene acetone in the pathway was almost completely transformed into a raspberry ketone. Substituting TB medium for M9 medium increased raspberry ketone titers by 3-4 times. Furthermore, the heterologous pathway was partitioned into two modules; module one produced p-coumaroyl-CoA from p-coumaric acid by 4CL, and module two produced raspberry ketone from coumaroyl-CoA by the action of BAS and RZS1. Optimizing the balanced expression of the two modules, it was shown that moderate expression of module one and high expression of module two was the best combination to enhance raspberry ketone production. The engineered strain CZ-8 reached 90.97\u00a0mg/l of raspberry ketone, which was 12 times higher than previously reported. In addition, the preferred approach of the heterologous pathway was related to the heterologous genes from different sources; for example, 4CL from Arabidopsis thaliana seemed to be more suitable for raspberry ketone production than that from Petroselinum crispum. This work paves an alternative way for future economic production of natural raspberry ketone.",

    "abstract": "Berry fruits are well known to contain large amounts of polyphenol compounds. Among them, flavan-3-ol derivatives are a group of secondary metabolism compounds currently attracting a great deal of attention owing to their health benefits. Not only the fruits, but also the leaves of raspberry plants, are highly esteemed for tea making around the world and are largely used for food. In this report, we discuss the results of our study on the effect of light and temperature on polyphenol accumulation in raspberry leaves. When raspberry was cultivated in a plant factory unit and light intensity, wavelength, and temperature were varied, the amount of total polyphenol increased under blue light. Quantitative determination of (+)-catechin, (\u207b)-epicatechin, procyanidin B4, flavan-3-ol trimer, which are flavan-3-ol derivatives, was carried out using HPLC, whereby we confirmed their increase under blue light. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed correlation between chalcone synthase (CHS) gene expression and the amounts of the compounds measured in the leaves.",

    "abstract": "Biogenic amines (BAs) are widely present in nearly all fermented foods and beverages, and excess consumption can cause adverse health effects. To prepare BA-free Korean black raspberry wine (BRW), four autochthonous starter yeast strains without hazardous BA synthesis activity were selected and their physiological and biochemical properties were examined. The selected strains were identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on 26S rDNA sequencing and microsatellite analysis. Molecular fingerprinting revealed that isolates were quite different from commercial wine yeast S. cerevisiae (52.4% similarity), but genetically relevant to commercial beer yeasts. The four S. cerevisiae strains produced over 10% ethanol during BRW fermentation. In addition, the fermented BRW with these strains showed higher levels of total flavonoids and similar antioxidant activity compared to the control sample. Potentially hazardous BAs that commonly occur in black raspberry extract (BRE) such as cadaverine, histamine, and spermidine were also not detected in the fermented BRW. Thus, we suggest that our strains are promising fermentation tools to ensure high quality and enhanced functionality in the production of BA-free BRW.",

    "abstract": "Extensive exposure to UVB (280-320\u2009nm) is the major risk responsible for various skin injuries. Numerous reports have shown that natural products could demonstrate photochemopreventive efficacy against UVB damage. We investigated the preventive effects and associated molecular mechanisms of red raspberry extract upon UVB-caused damage in human epidermal keratinocytes and a nude mouse model. The protein profiles and immunohistological study on a nude mouse skin indicated that red raspberry extract could prevent UVB-caused cell death and protect the skin against UVB-exposed injury manifested by wrinkling, scaling, tanning, and water loss as well as epidermal thickening. In addition, red raspberry extract application effectively abolished oxidative damage in DNA and attenuated the carbonylation level of proteins, which attributed to the activation of SOD, Nrf2 and its target genes, and HO-1. Red raspberry extract also altered the cells' apoptotic signaling pathways including caspase-3 as well as the inflammatory cascade such as c-jun and attenuated UVB-induced activation of NF-",

    "abstract": "Melon fly, Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett), is a serious pest of tropical horticulture, causing damage to cucurbits, other fruiting vegetables, and certain tree fruits. The deployment of male lures comprises an important component of several detection and control strategies for this pest, with the main male attractant currently in use being cuelure (CL). A novel fluorinated analog of CL, raspberry ketone trifluoroacetate (RKTA), has been developed for the control of Bactrocera tryoni, a related pest; here, we test this compound for attraction to Z. cucurbitae. In outdoor screen cage testing, observations showed both more flies on filter papers, and a higher percentage of flies feeding, on papers treated with RKTA than on those with CL or melolure (ML). Field trapping with both yellow sticky traps and bucket traps found that RKTA captured more flies during the first 6 h of trapping than CL, while trap captures in the subsequent 18 h did not differ between the two lures. When comparing combined 24 h trap captures, yellow sticky traps containing RKTA captured more flies than those with CL, while bucket trap captures did not vary by lure. Analysis of lures weathered on filter paper found that nearly all applied RKTA hydrolyzed to RK within 6 h. Fine-scale melon fly behaviors digitally recorded in the field showed median resting distances from the lure of responding flies were shorter for RKTA than for CL. This study demonstrates the inherent attractiveness of RKTA while also highlighting the instability of this compound due to hydrolysis.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has led to an intense interest in developing its inhibitors as anti-diabetes, anti-obesity and anti-cancer agents. The fruits of Rubus chingii (Chinese raspberry) were used as a kind of dietary traditional Chinese medicine. The methanolic extract of R. chingii fruits exhibited significant PTP1B inhibitory activity. Further bioactivity-guided fractionation resulted in the isolation of three PTP1B inhibitory ursane-type triterpenes: ursolic acid (1), 2-oxopomolic acid (2), and 2\u03b1, 19\u03b1-dihydroxy-3-oxo-urs-12-en-28-oic acid (3). Kinetics analyses revealed that 1 was a non-competitive PTP1B inhibitor, and 2 and 3 were mixed type PTP1B inhibitors. Compounds 1-3 and structurally related triterpenes (4-8) were further analyzed the structure-activity relationship, and were evaluated the inhibitory selectivity against four homologous protein tyrosine phosphatases (TCPTP, VHR, SHP-1 and SHP-2). Molecular docking simulations were also carried out, and the result indicated that 1, 3-acetoxy-urs-12-ene-28-oic acid (5), and pomolic acid-3\u03b2-acetate (6) bound at the allosteric site including \u03b13, \u03b16, and \u03b17 helix of PTP1B.",

    "abstract": "Tephritid fruit flies are recognized as the most economically important insect pest group, causing significant losses to horticultural crops globally. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is used to suppress or eradicate pest fruit flies in many countries. The provisioning of adult dietary or olfactory supplementation pre-release is commonly used to improve the mating performance of sterile male flies in SIT. This study on a major pest species, Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt), focused on improving mating performance by providing a semiochemical, raspberry ketone (RK), in the pre-release adult diet.\nSurvival was numerically higher for RK-supplemented males. Sexual maturity occurred 1\u2009day earlier (from 7 to 6\u2009days) in RK-supplemented sterile males. The mating latency period decreased with maturation age and was lower for RK-fed males. RK-supplemented sterile males increasingly mated with fertile females as they aged (10-19\u2009days). The mating competitiveness of both RK-supplemented sterile males and RK-denied sterile males was greater than that of wild males.\nThe early sexual maturity and increased mating performance of RK-supplemented sterile males indicate that the effectiveness of SIT programmes can be increased through dietary supplementation with RK during the pre-release period. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.",

In vitro solar protection factor was 54.57 to blackberry and 37.32 to raspberry. When incorporated in O/W emulsions, final formulations showed light pink color, creamy aspect, and typical fruity odor. Formulations submitted to indirect light and stove showed odor and color alterations.\nBased on the results, formulations containing extracts should be kept under refrigeration in opaque package to ensure stability due to the presence of flavonoids. In addition, blackberry and raspberry extracts are potential natural alternatives to be used as sunscreen and to prevent skin aging.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a continually growing pandemic leading to many diseases that affect the overall quality of life. The widely marketed Garcinia cambogia (GC) and Raspberry ketone (RK) were used in this study. Despite their known dietetic effect, however, the metabolomic/signaling pathways involved in this effect are not fully elucidated. Hence, our study comprehends the possible trajectories of their combination against obesity and insulin resistance in addition to exploring their combination merit.\nAdult male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups; viz., normal diet (ND), high fat fructose diet (HFFD), HFFD+GC (600mg/kg), HFFD+RK (55mg/kg) and HFFD+GC+RK. To assess our aim, we determined their effect on body weight, IPGTT, glucose homeostasis (glucose, insulin, HOMA IR), lipid profile parameters and SREBP-1c, oxidative stress markers, insulin and leptin signaling pathways (p-IRS-1/p-AKT/GLUT-4, and leptin/STAT-3), as well as liver and adipose tissue histopathology.\nGC/RK combinationcaused weight loss, corrected the disturbed glucose and insulin homeostasis, raised serum levels of HDL anddecreased all other lipid profile parameters. They also increased Nrf-2 expression, ad GSH, as well as p-IRS-1/p-Akt/GLUT-4 cue, while they decreased MDA, leptin/STAT-3 and SREBP-1c content compared to the HFFD group. Furthermore, the GC/RK combination abolished apoptosis, fatty changes and inflammation in hepatocytes and decreased sclerotic blood vessels and congestion in adipose tissue.\nOur study highlights the involvement ofp-IRS-1/p-Akt/GLUT-4, leptin/STAT-3 and SREBP-1c signaling trajectories in the beneficial combination of GC and RK, besides, the efficient rebalance of the redox status, insulin resistance and tissue fat deposition confirmed histopathologically.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry and strawberry are high value-added food products that can contribute to human health due to the abundance of polyphenols that they contain. Polyphenols are secondary metabolites and therefore devoted to improve plant adaptation, these polyphenol profile can be induced applying different stimuli, such as certain bacteria. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to evaluate the ability of two bacterial strains to modulate secondary metabolisms in strawberry and raspberry, and (ii) to explore the ability of plant extracts to modify enzyme activities related to metabolic syndrome.\nTotal phenolic and anthocyanin content was higher in strawberries than in raspberries, despite similar antioxidant capacities. Strawberry extracts performed better on the tested enzymes, except on \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition capacity. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens stabilized the effects of extracts at different points in time, and Pseudomonas fluorescens modified plant metabolism after more inoculations (spring) in both species, improving the effects of raspberry extracts on \u03b1-glucosidase, COX1, and COX2, and of strawberry on \u03b1-amylase and COX1.\nIt is good to include these two fruits in the diet because they improve the activity of metabolic syndrome-related enzymes. Applying either strain during plant growth modifies the bioactive profile of the plants, improving the effects of the fruit extracts on human health. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "A product translated from the 1b gene of raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) was specifically detected in RBDV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants by immunoblot analysis. To analyze the effects of the 1b gene on virus infection in host plants, an RBDV deletion mutant virus (RB\u22061bstop), which is unable to express the 1b gene, was constructed and inoculated to N. benthamiana plants. The results showed that accumulation of the virus genomic (g) RNAs 1 and 2 decreased in inoculated leaves, and that systemic virus spread was delayed compared with wild-type RBDV. In contrast, accumulation of the viral gRNAs 1 and 2 was elevated in RB\u22061bstop-infected leaf tissues during ectopic expression of the 1b gene. Furthermore, we found that the 1b has weak RNA silencing suppressor activity.",

    "abstract": "The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1) controls the lipid and glucose metabolism and also affects inflammation, cell proliferation and apoptosis during cardiovascular disease. Raspberry ketone (RK) is a red raspberry (Rubusidaeus, Family-Rosaceae) plant constituent, which activates PPAR-\u03b1. This study was conducted to assess the cardioprotective action of RK against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiotoxicity. Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (six rats/group). Rats were orally administered with RK (50, 100 and 200\u202fmg/kg, respectively) and fenofibrate (standard, 80\u202fmg/kg) for 28 days and ISO was administered (85\u202fmg/kg, subcutaneously) on 27th and 28th day. Administration of ISO in rats significantly altered hemodynamic and electrocardiogram patterns, total antioxidant capacity, PPAR-\u03b1, and apolipoprotein C-III levels. These myocardial aberrations were further confirmed during infarct size, heart weight to body weight ratio and immunohistochemical assessments (caspase-3 and nuclear factor-\u03baB). RK pretreatment (100 and 200\u202fmg/kg) significantly protected rats against oxidative stress, inflammation, and dyslipidemia caused by ISO as demonstrated by change in hemodynamic, biochemical and histological parameters. The results so obtained were quite comparable with fenofibrate. Moreover, RK was found to have binding affinity with PPAR-\u03b1, as confirmed by docking analysis. PPAR-\u03b1 expression and concentration was also found increased in presence of RK which gave impression that RK probably showed cardioprotection via PPAR-\u03b1 activation, however direct binding study of RK with PPAR-\u03b1 is needed to confirm this assumption.",

    "abstract": "As important epigenetic regulators, microRNA regulate protein expression by triggering the degradation of target mRNA and/or by inhibiting their translation. Dysregulation of microRNA expression has been reported in several cancers, including colorectal cancer. In this study, microRNA-array differential analysis revealed strongly enhanced expression of miR-24-1-5p in the colon tissue of azoxymethane/dextran sulphate sodium-induced mice that were fed with black raspberry anthocyanins for 9 weeks. Overexpression of miR-24-1-5p in human colorectal cancer cells significantly repressed \u03b2-catenin expression, and simultaneously decreased cell proliferation, migration and survival. Furthermore, miR-24-1-5p could target \u03b2-catenin and trigger a negative regulatory loop for \u03b2-catenin and its downstream target genes. \u03b2-Catenin signalling is vital to the formation and progression of human colorectal cancer. The current findings therefore identified miR-24-1-5p as a potent regulator of \u03b2-catenin, and this may provide a novel chemopreventive and therapeutic strategy for \u03b2-catenin signalling-driven colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and laboratory studies have implicated black raspberries (BRBs) and their associated phytochemicals in the modulation of several chronic diseases. Most research on the health benefits of BRBs is conducted using freeze-dried or otherwise minimally processed products, yet BRBs are typically consumed as thermally processed goods like jams and syrups. The objective of this work was to profile the chemical changes that result from thermal processing of BRB powder into a nectar beverage. Using an untargeted UHPLC-QTOF-MS metabolomics approach, key degradation products of anthocyanins were identified along with several other proposed phenolic degradants. The effects of processing on other key BRB compound groups, including ellagitannins, are also discussed. This work demonstrates the utility of an untargeted metabolomics approach in describing the chemistry of complex food systems and provides a foundation for future research on the impact of processing on BRB product bioactivity.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry and blueberry pomace, by-products from fruit juice industry, were dehydrated to obtain fruit fiber concentrates and valorized as ingredients in gluten-free (GF) cookies formulation. The aim was to evaluate the effect of substituting 30% (w/w) of GF flour mixture with different ratios of blueberry/raspberry fiber concentrates (0/30, 15/15, and 30/0) on rheological properties of cookie dough and cookie baking quality. Generally, the incorporation of the fiber concentrates increased the elastic and the viscous moduli thus producing harder doughs and consequently firmer cookies in comparison to the control. Although having similar total, soluble and insoluble fiber content, blueberry fiber concentrates were characterized with higher water absorption capacity and consequently yielded cookies with more rigid dough structure, higher water loss during baking, lower cookie thickness, higher spread ratio, more dense inner structure, and increased cookie hardness than those containing raspberry fiber concentrates. Enrichment of GF cookies with raspberry and blueberry fiber concentrates resulted in products with dietary fiber content higher than 6 g per 100\u2009g, thus making them candidates for bearing \"high fiber\" nutrition claim. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Currently available GF bakery products mostly lack dietary fibers (DFs) and other important nutrients, because they are usually manufactured from refined flour and/or starches. As the products with long shelf-life, very popular in daily diet of almost all consumer profiles, cookies could represent good matrices for the addition of functional ingredients, such as DFs. In this paper, GF cookies were enriched with the fiber concentrates recovered from blueberry and raspberry pomace. Application of these fiber sources enabled recycling of fruit processing industry by-products into novel, \"high fiber\" GF product with improved nutritive profile.",
