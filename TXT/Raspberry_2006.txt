    "abstract": "ABSTRACT A serious disease was observed in black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) in Oregon in the last decade. Plants showing mosaic symptoms declined rapidly and, in many cases, died after several years. Double-stranded RNA extraction from symptomatic black raspberry revealed the presence of two high molecular weight bands which were cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis disclosed the presence of a novel virus that was tentatively named Black raspberry decline-associated virus (BRDaV). The complete sequences of the two genomic RNAs, excluding the 3' poly-adenosine tails, were 7,581 and 6,364 nucleotides, respectively. The genome organization was identical to that of Strawberry mottle virus, a member of the genus Sadwavirus. The C terminus of the RNA 1 poly-protein is unique within the genus Sadwavirus, with homology to AlkB-like domains, suggesting a role in repair of alkylation damage. A reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test was designed for the detection of BRDaV from Rubus tissue, and tests revealed that BRDaV was associated consistently with the observed decline symptoms. While this publication was under review, it came to our attention that scientists at the Scottish Crop Research Institute had molecular data on Black raspberry necrosis virus (BRNV), a virus that shared many biological properties with BRDaV. After exchange of data, we concluded that BRDaV is a strain of BRNV, a previously described yet unsequenced virus. The North American strain was vectored nonpersistently by the large raspberry aphid and the green peach aphid. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that BRNV belongs to the genus Sadwavirus.",

    "abstract": "Two new members of the polyketide synthase (PKS) gene family (RiPKS4 and RiPKS5) were cloned from raspberry fruits (Rubus idaeus L., cv Royalty) and expressed in Escherichia coli. Characterization of the recombinant enzyme products indicated that RiPKS4 is a bifunctional polyketide synthase producing both 4-hydroxybenzalacetone and naringenin chalcone. The recombinant RiPKS4 protein, like the native protein from raspberry fruits [W. Borejsza-Wysocki, G. Hrazdina, Plant Physiol. 1996;110: 791-799] accepted p-coumaryl-CoA and ferulyl-CoA as starter substrates and catalyzed the formation of both naringenin chalcone, 4-hydroxy-benzalacetone and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-benzalacetone. Although activity of RiPKS4 was higher with ferulyl-CoA than with p-coumaryl-CoA, the corresponding product, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy phenylbutanone could not be detected in raspberries to date. Sequence analysis of the genes and proteins suggested that this feature of RiPKS4 was created by variation in the C-terminus due to DNA recombination at the 3' region of its coding sequence. RiPKS5 is a typical chalcone synthase (CHS) that uses p-coumaryl-CoA only as starter substrate and produces naringenin chalcone exclusively as the reaction product.",

The volatile compounds were extracted by stirbar sorptive extraction and analyzed using thermal desorption-multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-enantio-MDGC-MS). The feeding experiments demonstrate that (-)-alpha-pinene and (S)-linalool are exclusively synthesized via the cytosolic mevalonic acid pathway. In contrast, (2)H-labeled (R)-(E)-alpha-ionone and (2)H-labeled (E)-beta-ionone are detectable after application of d2-1-deoxy-D-xylulose and d2-mevalonic acid lactone, respectively. However, (R)-linalool reveals no incorporation of either one of the fed precursors, even though this enantiomer is detectable in the fruit tissue.",

All tests were compared with the standard melon fly attractant 4-(4-acetoxyphenyl) -2-butanone (cuelure [CL]), which is the attractant of choice for detection programs aimed at melon fly and other cuelure-responding Bactrocera fruit flies. Results of these tests over a range of doses on cotton wicks showed that at a 1-g dose raspberry ketone formate was 1.5-2 times more attractive compared with cuelure for up to 11 wk in the field. Lower doses applied on cotton wicks were less active, presumably due to hydrolysis of RKF to raspberry ketone. Raspberry ketone formate embedded in a plastic plug formulation also was field tested, and it was shown to be more attractive to male melon fly compared with cuelure. The use of this new attractant in control and detection programs is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone is an important compound for the flavour industry. It is frequently used in products such as soft drinks, sweets, puddings and ice creams. The compound can be produced by organic synthesis. Demand for \"natural\" raspberry ketone is growing considerably. However, this product is extremely expensive. Consequently, there is a remaining desire to better understand how raspberry ketone is synthesized in vivo, and which genes and enzymes are involved. With this information we will then be in a better position to design alternative production strategies such as microbial fermentation. This article focuses on the identification and application of genes potentially linked to raspberry ketone synthesis. We have isolated candidate genes from both raspberry and other plants, and these have been introduced into bacterial and yeast expression systems. Conditions have been determined that result in significant levels of raspberry ketone, up to 5 mg/L. These results therefore lay a strong foundation for a potentially renewable source of \"natural\" flavour compounds making use of plant genes.",

Of the micro-organisms tested, only bacteria were able to synthesize significant amounts of 4-hydroxybenzylidene acetone, ranging from 15 to 160 mg l(-1) after 21 h of bioconversion, as a function of the bacteria tested.\nThe biological production of 4-hydroxybenzylidene acetone has been described with bacteria possessing 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA, EC 4.1.2.4). This result suggests that DERA is involved in the catalytic aldolization of precursors for the production of 4-hydroxybenzylidene acetone.\nRaspberry ketone or frambinone represents a total market value of between euro6 million and euro10 million.

    "abstract": "Classical and molecular methodologies were used to determine the inheritance of Phytophthora root rot (PRR) resistance in red raspberry. The varieties 'Latham' and 'Titan,' resistant and susceptible, respectively, were used to create F(1), F(2), B(1), B(2), and S(1) populations for analysis. Generational means analysis was used to calculate the components of genetic variation and estimates of narrow and broad sense heritability for the plant disease index and the incidence of petiole lesions. The plant disease index showed additive genetic variation with additional significant interactions, but the incidence of petiole lesions was non-additive. A dominant, two-gene model was shown to be the best fit for the observed segregation ratios when classification for resistance was based on a combination of all criteria measured. Molecular linkage maps were generated from the segregating B(2) population. Linkage maps of both parents were constructed from amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and uncharacterized resistant gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) markers with seven linkage groups each totaling 440 and 370 cM of genetic distance, respectively. An analysis of the distributional extremes of the B(2) population identified several RAPD markers clustered on two linkage groups associated with PRR resistance. QTL analysis identified two similar genomic regions on each map that explained significant percentages of phenotypic variation observed for the disease assessment criteria. Genetic mapping supports the dominant two-gene model developed from generational means analysis. The results reconcile conflicting reports on inheritance of PRR resistance, provide a basis for further investigation of durable resistance to Phytophthora caused diseases, and indicates that recurrent selection is the appropriate approach for the development of new resistant cultivars.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry-like silica nanospheres were prepared by electrostatic self-assembly of polyelectrolytes and monodisperse silica nanoparticles of two different sizes, and their coatings were fabricated via layer-by-layer assembly with polyelectrolytes and following calcination. The morphology of the raspberry-like silica nanospheres and their coatings were observed by scanning and transmission electron microscopies. The surface properties of these coatings were investigated by measuring their water contact angles, and the results showed that such hierarchically structured coatings had unique superhydrophilic and antifogging properties. Finally, the formation mechanism and the property-structure relationship were discussed in details.",

    "abstract": "The fate of anthocyanins and ellagitannins in rats was monitored following ingestion of raspberry juice. After 1 h low nM concentrations of unmetabolised anthocyanins were present in plasma but these declined by 2 h and after 4 h they were no longer detectable. For the first 2 h there was an almost full recovery of anthocyanins as they passed from the stomach through the duodenum/jejunum and into the ileum. After 3 h less than 50% were recovered, and the levels declined rapidly thereafter. Excretion of raspberry anthocyanins in urine over a 24 h period was equivalent to 1.2% of the amount ingested. Trace quantities of anthocyanins were detected in the caecum, colon and faeces and they were absent in extracts of liver, kidneys and brain. Urine also contained a number of phenolic acids but most were present in quantities well in excess of the 918 nmol of anthocyanins present in the ingested juice. These findings indicate that raspberry anthocyanins per se are poorly absorbed, probably prior to reaching the ileum, and that substantial amounts pass from the small to the large intestine where they are degraded by colonic bacteria. Ellagitannins disappeared in the stomach without accumulation of ellagic acid.",

    "abstract": "This study explored the biology of raspberry crown borer, Pennisetia marginata (Harris) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae), in Arkansas and the optimum timing for insecticide and nematode applications. The duration of P. marginata's life cycle was observed to be 1 yr in Arkansas. Insecticide trials revealed that bifenthrin, chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, metaflumizone, and metofluthrin efficacy were comparable with that of azinphosmethyl, the only labeled insecticide for P. marginata in brambles until 2005. Applications on 23 October 2003 for plots treated with bifenthrin, chlorpyrifos, and azinphosmethyl resulted in >88% reduction in larvae per crown. Applications on 3 November 2004 of metaflumizone, metofluthrin, and bifenthrin resulted in >89% reduction in larvae per crown. Applications on 7 April 2005 for metofluthrin, imidacloprid, bifenthrin, metaflumizone, and benzoylphenyl urea resulted in >64% reduction in the number of larvae per crown. Applications on 6 May 2004 did not reduce larval numbers. The optimum timing for treatments was found to be between October and early April, before the larvae tunneled into the crowns of plants. Applying bifenthrin with as little as 468 liters water/ha (50 gal/acre) was found to be as effective against larvae as higher volumes of spray. Nematode applications were less successful than insecticides. Nematode applications of Steinernemafeltiae, Steinernema carpocapsae, and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora reduced larvae counts per plant by 46, 53, and 33%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry mosaic is one of the most important viral diseases of raspberry. Four virus and virus-like agents, two of which are poorly characterized, have been implicated in the disease complex based on symptom development in Rubus indicators. Three novel viruses were identified in a red raspberry plant that caused typical raspberry mosaic symptoms when grafted onto indicators. This communication focuses on one of these viruses, Raspberry mottle virus (RMoV), a new member of the family Closteroviridae. The complete nucleotide sequence of RMoV has been determined and exceeds 17 kilobases encoding 10 genes. The genome organization of RMoV is similar to that of Beet yellows virus, the type member of the Closterovirus genus, and phylogenetic analysis using the polymerase conserved motifs and the heat shock protein 70 homolog revealed a close relationship of RMoV with Strawberry chlorotic fleck associated virus and Citrus tristeza virus, which suggests the possibility of an aphid vector. The virus was detected in symptomatic raspberry plants in production areas in mixed infections with several other viruses, indicating that RMoV may impact raspberry production.",

    "abstract": "There is a probable association between consumption of fruit and vegetables and reduced risk of cancer, particularly cancer of the digestive tract. This anti-cancer activity has been attributed in part to anti-oxidants present in these foods. Raspberries in particular are a rich source of the anti-oxidant compounds, such as polyphenols, anthocyanins and ellagitannins.\nA \"colon-available\" raspberry extract (CARE) was prepared that contained phytochemicals surviving a digestion procedure that mimicked the physiochemical conditions of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The polyphenolic-rich extract was assessed for anti-cancer properties in a series of in vitro systems that model important stages of colon carcinogenesis, initiation, promotion and invasion.\nThe phytochemical composition of CARE was monitored using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The colon-available raspberry extract was reduced in anthocyanins and ellagitannins compared to the original raspberry juice but enriched in other polyphenols and polyphenol breakdown products that were more stable to gastrointestinal digestion. Initiation--CARE caused significant protective effects against DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide in HT29 colon cancer cells measured using single cell microgelelectrophoresis. Promotion--CARE significantly decreased the population of HT29 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, effectively reducing the number of cells entering the cell cycle. However, CARE had no effect on epithelial integrity (barrier function) assessed by recording the trans-epithelial resistance (TER) of CACO-2 cell monolayers. Invasion--CARE caused significant inhibition of HT115 colon cancer cell invasion using the matrigel invasion assay.\nThe results indicate that raspberry phytochemicals likely to reach the colon are capable of inhibiting several important stages in colon carcinogenesis in vitro.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was comparatively to examine herbal traits of the cultivars such as Rubin, Summit, Holland Dwarf, Heritage, Tulameen, Aksu Red, Nuburg, Canby and Willamette red raspberries cultivated at Ankara Condition, in the capital of Turkey between 2002 and 2005. According to Repeated Random Complete Design (RRCD) (which was composed of four random plot design experiments) used in the experiment, the effects of cultivar, year and cultivar by year interaction on herbal traits such as the height of shoot, diameter of shoot, number of shoot, fruitfulness of shoot and weight of fruit were further more significant (p < 0.0001). Besides, determination coefficients of RRCD for traits ranged from 95.60 to 99.94% (very-high). As a result, we concluded in Ankara condition that as to herbal traits such as the height of shoot, diameter of shoot, number of shoot, fruitfulness of shoot and weight of fruit, Willamette cultivar were more superior to others. In addition, we can suggest that researchers should analyze using RRCD because Determination Coefficients of RRCD for all traits were much more found.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry fruits were harvested at five developmental stages, from green to red ripe, and the changes in cell wall composition, pectin and hemicellulose solubilization, and depolymerization were analyzed. Fruit softening at intermediate stages of ripening was associated with increased pectin solubilization, which occurred without depolymerization. Arabinose was found to be the most abundant noncellulosic neutral sugar in the cell wall and showed dramatic solubilization late in ripening. No changes in pectin molecular size were observed even at the 100% red stage. Subsequently, as fruit became fully ripe a dramatic depolymerization occurred. In contrast, the hemicellulosic fractions showed no significant changes in content or polymer size during ripening. The paper discusses the sequence of events leading to cell wall disassembly in raspberry fruit.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry breeding programmes worldwide aim to produce improved cultivars to satisfy market demands and within these programmes there are many targets, including increased fruit quality, yield and season, and improved pest and disease resistance and plant habit. The large raspberry aphid, Amphorophora idaei, transmits four viruses and vector resistance is an objective in raspberry breeding. The development of molecular tools that discriminate between aphid resistance genes from different sources will allow the pyramiding of such genes and the development of raspberry varieties with superior pest resistance. We have raised a red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) F1 progeny from the cross 'Malling Jewel' x 'Malling Orion' (MJ x MO), which segregates for resistance to biotype 1 of the aphid Amphorophora idaei and for a second phenotypic trait, dwarf habit. These traits are controlled by single genes, denoted (A1) and (dw) respectively.\nThe progeny of 94 seedlings was scored for the segregation of 95 AFLP and 22 SSR markers and a linkage map was constructed that covers a total genetic distance of 505 cM over seven linkage groups. The average linkage group length was 72.2 cM and there was an average of 17 markers per linkage group, of which at least two were codominant SSRs, allowing comparisons with previously published maps of raspberry. The two phenotypic traits, A1 and dw, mapped to linkage groups 3 and 6 respectively.\nThe mapping of A1 will facilitate the discrimination of resistance genes from different sources and the pyramiding of aphid resistance genes in new raspberry cultivars; the mapping of dw will allow further investigations into the genetics of dwarfing habit in Rubus.",

    "abstract": "Bud break in raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is often poor and uneven, with many of the subapical buds remaining in a dormant state. In order to determine the dormancy status of raspberry buds, an empirical measure of bud burst in a growth-permissive environment following exposure to chilling (4 degrees C cold storage) was developed. For cv. Glen Ample, percentage bud burst in intact canes and isolated nodes was recorded after 14 d. Isolated nodes (a measure of endodormancy) achieved 100% bud burst after approximately 1500 h chilling whereas buds on intact plants (combined endo- and paradormancy) required an additional 1000 h chilling. A microarray approach was used to follow changes in gene expression that occurred during dormancy transition. The probes for the microarrays were obtained from endodormant and paradormant raspberry bud cDNA libraries. The expression profiles of 5300 clones from these libraries were subjected to principal component analysis to determine the most significant expression patterns. Sequence analysis of these clones, in many cases, enabled their functional categorization and the development of hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of bud dormancy release. Thus a set of novel candidates for key dormancy-related genes from raspberry buds have been identified. Bud dormancy is fundamental to the study of plant developmental processes and, in addition, its regulation is of significant economic importance to fruit and horticultural industries.",

    "abstract": "Berry fruits are widely consumed in our diet and have attracted much attention due to their potential human health benefits. Berries contain a diverse range of phytochemicals with biological properties such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-neurodegerative, and anti-inflammatory activities. In the current study, extracts of six popularly consumed berries--blackberry, black raspberry, blueberry, cranberry, red raspberry and strawberry--were evaluated for their phenolic constituents using high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) detection. The major classes of berry phenolics were anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanols, ellagitannins, gallotannins, proanthocyanidins, and phenolic acids. The berry extracts were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of human oral (KB, CAL-27), breast (MCF-7), colon (HT-29, HCT116), and prostate (LNCaP) tumor cell lines at concentrations ranging from 25 to 200 micro g/mL. With increasing concentration of berry extract, increasing inhibition of cell proliferation in all of the cell lines were observed, with different degrees of potency between cell lines. The berry extracts were also evaluated for their ability to stimulate apoptosis of the COX-2 expressing colon cancer cell line, HT-29. Black raspberry and strawberry extracts showed the most significant pro-apoptotic effects against this cell line. The data provided by the current study and from other laboratories warrants further investigation into the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects of berries using in vivo models.",

Even more interesting results are the proposal of the 'cyanidin volumetric index', by which it is possible to compare different red raspberry varieties with higher meaningfulness.

    "abstract": "Raspberry extracts enriched in polyphenols, but devoid of organic acids, sugars and vitamin C, were prepared by sorption to C18 solid phase extraction matrices and tested for their ability to inhibit the proliferation of human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells in vitro. The raspberry extract reduced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner whether this was judged by cell number or measurements of cell viability. However, measurements based on cell viability were more accurate and gave an EC(50) value of 17.5 microg/ml gallic acid equivalents (GAE) at day 4 of culture. Raspberry extracts were fractionated by sorption to Sephadex LH-20 into an unbound fraction, which was obviously enriched in anthocyanins, and a bound fraction. The unbound anthocyanin-enriched fraction was much less effective in reducing proliferation then the original extract and gave an EC(50) value estimated at 67 microg/ml. The LH-20 bound fraction was more effective than the original raspberry extract (EC(50)=13 microg/ml) suggesting that the main anti-proliferative agents were retained in the bound fraction. Analysis of the original extract, the unbound and the LH20 bound fractions by LC-MS confirmed that the unbound fraction was enriched in anthocyanins and the bound fraction primarily contained ellagitannins. The ellagitannin-rich bound fraction had the highest antioxidant capacity as measured by the ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) assay. The mechanism by which the ellagitannins inhibit proliferation of cancer cells is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The raspberry cane midge Resseliella theobaldi (Barnes) is one of the most important pests of cultivated red raspberry Rubus idaeus L. throughout Europe. For the last 50 years several studies have been made on the biology, life cycle and control of the pest. Some data can also be found on its natural enemies, but among these species only the chalcidoid Tetrastichus inunctus Nees turned out to be important in controlling raspberry cane midge populations. However, this species name is now ambiguous as the type is lost. In the present study, Aprostocetus epicharmus Walker was the chalcidoid species that parasitized the larvae of the raspberry cane midge, and its biology seems to be very similar to that of T. inunctus. It is therefore probable that the eulophid species earlier referred to as T. inunctus in the literature is A. epicharmus. Besides discussing this problem, particular consideration and detailed data are given on the biology and life cycle of A. epicharmus in relation to R. theobaldi. Different factors having effect on the population dynamics of both species are also discussed as results of a survey on several red raspberry cultivars, carried out in Hungary between 2002 and 2005.",

    "abstract": "Berries have attracted attention for their chemopreventive activities in last a few years. Dietary freeze-dried blackberries have been shown to reduce esophagus and colon cancer development induced by chemical carcinogen in rodents. To elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in chemoprevention by berry extracts, we employed mouse epidermal Cl 41 cell line, a well-characterized in vitro model in tumor promotion studies. Pretreatment of Cl 41 cells with methanol-extracted blackberry fraction RO-ME resulted in a dramatical inhibition of B(a)PDE-induced activation of AP-1 and NFkB, and expression of VEGF and COX-2. The inhibitory effects of RO-ME on B(a)PDE-induced activation of AP-1 and NFkappaB appear to be mediated via inhibition of MAPKs and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, respectively. In view of the important roles of AP-1, NFkappaB, VEGF and COX-2 in tumor promotion/progression, and VEGF and COX-2 are target of AP-1 and NFkappaB, we anticipate that the ability of black raspberries to inhibit tumor development may be mediated by impairing signal transduction pathways leading to activation of AP-1 and NFkappaB, subsequently resulting in down-regulation of VEGF and COX-2 expression. The RO-ME fraction appears to be the major fraction responsible for the inhibitory activity of black raspberries.",

    "abstract": "Encapsulation-dehydration and PVS2-vitrification cryopreservation protocols were evaluated for the long-term conservation of a diverse group of Rubus germplasm. Cold acclimation for a 4-week period prior to cryopreservation was necessary for regrowth of shoot apices from blackberry and raspberry genotypes. For the encapsulation-dehydration protocol, encapsulated apices were pretreated in 0.75 M sucrose for 20 h, desiccated 6-h under laminar flow to c. 20 percent moisture content, then plunged in liquid nitrogen (LN) and rapidly warmed. The PVS2-vitrification protocol included pretreating shoot tips on 5 percent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) medium for 48 h, exposure to loading solution (LS) and PVS2 for 20 min each at 25 degree C , followed by immersion in LN and rapid warming. Shoot tips of 25 genotypes in 9 Rubus species and 9 Rubus hybrids were successfully cryopreserved with recovery of 60 to 100 percent using the encapsulation-dehydration protocol. Four genotypes of 3 species were tested using the vitrification protocol with 71 percent average regrowth. The present results indicate that both of these improved cryopreservation protocols can be applied to a diverse range of Rubus genetic resources.",

    "abstract": "Disease resistance is increasing in importance, as consumers require high-quality raspberry fruit at a time when chemical disease control is undesirable. Breeders have limited resources and rarely include a primary screen for each fungal disease. Marker-assisted breeding would facilitate the introduction of resistance into elite germplasm and breeding lines. An additional 20 simple sequence repeats have been added to the existing raspberry linkage map. Gene H, which determines cane pubescence (genotype HH or Hh), the recessive allele of which gives glabrous canes (genotype hh), has been mapped on to linkage group 2 and shown to be closely associated with resistance to cane botrytis and spur blight but not rust or cane spot. Other map regions on linkage groups 3, 5 and 6 associated with disease resistance are reported here.",

Ten healthy men consumed 45 g of freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 1 week. Urine samples were collected over a 12 h period in 4 h intervals at day 1 and day 7. Urinary anthocyanins were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a photodiode array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer using precursor ion and product ion analyses. Anthocyanins were excreted in intact forms and metabolized into methylated derivatives in human urine. The urinary excretion of anthocyanins reached a maximum concentration (1091.8 +/- 1081.3 pmol/L, n = 10) during the 4-8 h period after black raspberry ingestion. As compared to the anthocyanin distribution in black raspberries, urinary cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside was detected at a higher concentration than that of cyanidin-3-rutinoside.",

    "abstract": "Many fruits are rich in anthocyanins (ACNs). ACNs have high antioxidant capacity, but because of their apparent low bioavailability, their possible roles in health promotion in vivo are still in question. The objectives of these studies were to determine the fate of ACNs within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the effect on the bioavailability and subsequent metabolism of ACNs. Five weanling pigs were fed freeze-dried black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.) powder by oral administration, which provided 1146.1 +/- 44.6 micromol TE of oxygen radical absorbance capacity with fluorescein as a fluorescent probe (ORAC(FL)) per kg and 50.5 +/- 3.7 mg per kg total ACNs. After 4 h, the pigs were sacrificed and the contents of five GI segments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon) were collected and analyzed for their total antioxidant capacity (TAC, measured as ORAC(FL)) and ACNs. The recoveries of TAC and total ACNs were 46.5 +/- 3.5 and 41.7 +/- 4.9%, respectively. Both total ACNs and TAC were recovered primarily in the ileum, cecum, and colon at 4 h after a meal. Cyanidin aglycone with different sugar moieties showed significant differences in their recovery within the GI tract with sambubiose > sambubiose-rhamnose = rutinose >> glucose. Recovery of ACNs within the GI tract was positively and linearly associated with urinary ACN recovery, which suggests that stability within the GI tract and not decreased absorption accounts for the increased recovery. The environment of different segments of the GI tract may determine the stability of individual ACNs. Complex ACNs containing di- or triglycosides disappeared more slowly in the GI tract than simple ACNs such as a monoglycoside. TAC and total ACNs remained high 4 h after feeding, which indicates that ACNs provide significant antioxidant protection in the environment of the gut epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that freeze-dried black raspberry extract fractions inhibit benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P]-induced transformation of Syrian hamster embryo cells and benzo(a)pyrene diol-epoxide [B(a)PDE]-induced activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity in mouse epidermal Cl 41 cells. The phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt pathway is critical for B(a)PDE-induced AP-1 activation in mouse epidermal Cl 41 cells. In the present study, we determined the potential involvement of PI-3K and its downstream kinases on the inhibition of AP-1 activation by black raspberry fractions, RO-FOO3, RO-FOO4, RO-ME, and RO-DM. In addition, we investigated the effects of these fractions on the expression of the AP-1 target genes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Pretreatment of Cl 41 cells with fractions RO-F003 and RO-ME reduced activation of AP-1 and the expression of VEGF, but not iNOS. In contrast, fractions RO-F004 and RO-DM had no effect on AP-1 activation or the expression of either VEGF or iNOS. Consistent with inhibition of AP-1 activation, the RO-ME fraction markedly inhibited activation of PI-3K, Akt, and p70 S6 kinase (p70(S6k)). In addition, overexpression of the dominant negative PI-3K mutant delta p85 reduced the induction of VEGF by B(a)PDE. It is likely that the inhibitory effects of fractions RO-FOO3 and RO-ME on B(a)PDE-induced AP-1 activation and VEGF expression are mediated by inhibition of the PI-3K/Akt pathway. In view of the important roles of AP-1 and VEGF in tumor development, one mechanism for the chemopreventive activity of black raspberries may be inhibition of the PI-3K/Akt/AP-1/VEGF pathway.",

    "abstract": "The nucleotide sequences of RNAs 1 and 2 of a German isolate of Raspberry ringspot virus (RpRSV) infecting grapevine (RpRSV-Grapevine), as well as partial sequences of another grapevine isolate from Switzerland (RAC815) were determined. The sequences of the protease-polymerase region encoded by RNA1, and the movement protein and coat protein genes encoded by RNA 2, of these isolates were compared with those of other isolates available in databases. The coat proteins of the grapevine isolates formed a sister group to all those from other RpRSV isolates, but whether this resulted from divergence or recombination was uncertain.",

    "abstract": "Nano-sized poly(ethylene glycol dimethacrylate-co-acylic acid) (poly(EGDMA-co-AA)) were effectively self-assembled on poly(divinylbenzene-co-styryl methylpyridinium chloride) (poly(DVB-co-StMPyCl)) surfaces to form the raspberry-like composite by a charge compensation mechanism through the affinity complex between carboxylic group and pyridinium group. The effects of pH and salt electrolyte on the morphology of the self-assembled polymer composites were investigated. The resulting heterocoagulates were highly stable in water and acid solution. These heterocoagulates were reversible through the self-assembly in acidic or neutral media and the dissociation in the basic medium due to the charge compensation through the strong affinity complex between hydroxide anion and pyridinium group cation. The resulting heterocoagulates were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). As a result, a new method for tuning the structure of a charge compensation directed polymer composite was developed.",
