    "abstract": "In current medical practice, the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease remains essentially clinical. This practice determines that the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is done in an already advanced neuropathological stage of the disease. The aim of this study is to review the validity of cerebrospinal fluid protein biological markers in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The a-synuclein and DJ-1 proteins, due to their role in the hereditary Parkinson's disease, have been the most widely studied cerebrospinal biomarkers. Nevertheless, they have had divergent results mostly owing to different processing, identification and control of laboratory techniques. The new proteomic techniques, directed to the detection of multiple undifferentiated proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (eg. ceruloplasmin, chromogranin B, apoH), are promising. The early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is imperious as it is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes extensive morbidity. Most of current scientific research in Parkinson's disease is focused on the discovery of neuroprotective drugs. Thus, the definition of biomarkers for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is highly relevant.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to learn if participants with Parkinson disease (PD), when compared to normal controls, are impaired in making simultaneous but independent right and left hand movements. Participants were tested with Luria's Alternating Hand Postures (AHP) test and modified AHP tests. Twelve PD participants without dementia and twelve matched controls were assessed for their ability to perform the parallel AHP test (both hands remaining in the same coronal plane) and with modifications of this test into swimming (alternative arm extension with finger extension and arm flexion with finger flexion) and reverse swimming (alternative arm extension-finger flexion and arm flexion-finger extension) movements. The participants with PD were significantly impaired when performing the parallel and the reverse swimming movements AHP tests, but not impaired on the swimming movements AHP test. Swimming movements may be phylogenetically and ontogenetically more primitive and not as heavily dependent on frontal-basal ganglia networks; thus performance of swimming movements during the parallel AHP test may decrease this test's sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-syn) is a 140-amino acid protein that plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. However, the molecular determinants that are responsible for triggering and/or propagating \u03b1-syn aggregation and toxicity remain poorly understood. Several studies have suggested that there are direct interactions between different metals and \u03b1-syn, but the role of metal ions and \u03b1-syn in the pathogenesis of PD is not firmly established. Interestingly, the majority of disease-associated post-translational modifications (PTMs) (e.g., truncation, phosphorylation, and nitration) of \u03b1-syn occur at residues within the C-terminal region (Y125, S129, Y133, and Y136) and in very close proximity to the putative metal binding sites. Therefore, we hypothesized that phosphorylation within this domain could influence the \u03b1-syn-metal interactions. In this paper, we sought to map the interactions between the di- and trivalent cations, Cu(II), Pb(II), Fe(II), and Fe(III), and the C-terminal region of \u03b1-syn encompassing residues 107-140 and to determine how phosphorylation at S129 or Y125 alters the specificity and binding affinity of metals using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and fluorescence spectroscopy. We demonstrate that D115-M116 and P128-S129 act as additional Cu(II) binding sites and show for the first time that the residues P128-S129 and D119 are also involved in Pb(II) and Fe(II) coordination, although D119 is not essential for binding to Fe(II) and Pb(II). Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at either Y125 or S129 increases the binding affinity of Cu(II), Pb(II), and Fe(II), but not Fe(III). Additionally, we also show that phosphorylations at these residues lead to a shift in the binding sites of metal ions from the N-terminus to the C-teminus. Together, our findings provide critical insight into and expand our understanding of the molecular and structural bases underlying the interactions between \u03b1-syn and metal ions, including the identification of novel metal binding sites, and highlight the potential importance of cross-talk between post-translational modifications and metal ion binding in modulating \u03b1-syn functional and aggregation properties that are regulated by its C-terminal domain.",

There have been numerous publications, patent applications, and press releases within this time frame that highlight new medicinal chemistry approaches to this attractive and promising target to treat Parkinson's disease. The Review is broken down by scaffold type and will discuss the efforts to optimize particular scaffolds for activity, pharmacokinetics, and other drug discovery parameters. The majority of approaches focus on preparing selective A(2A) antagonists, but a few approaches to dual A(2A)/A(1) antagonists will also be highlighted. The in vivo profiles of compounds will be highlighted and discussed to compare activities across different chemical series. A clinical report and update will be given on compounds that have entered clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from two main thalamostriatal systems that originate either from the centre median/parafascicular complex (CM/PF-striatal system) or the rostral intralaminar, midline, associative and relay thalamic nuclei (non-CM/PF-striatal system). These dual thalamostriatal systems display striking differences in their anatomical and, most likely, functional organization. The CM/PF-striatal system is topographically organized, and integrated within functionally segregated basal ganglia-thalamostriatal circuits that process sensorimotor, associative and limbic information. CM/PF neurons are highly responsive to attention-related sensory stimuli, suggesting that the CM/PF-striatal system, through its strong connections with cholinergic interneurons, may play a role in basal ganglia-mediated learning, behavioral switching and reinforcement. In light of evidence for prominent CM/PF neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease, we propose that the significant CM-striatal system degeneration, combined with the severe nigrostriatal dopamine loss in sensorimotor striatal regions, may alter normal automatic actions, and shift the processing of basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor programs towards goal-directed behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinaemia (HHcy) is as a long-term sequelum of levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD). Information on its frequency and effects in Africans with PD is sparse.\nTo determine the frequency of HHcy and its relationship to clinical features of PD in African patients.\nUsing a case-control design, 40 consecutively attending PD patients and 40 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteering controls were studied. Parkinson's disease cases were evaluated for disease and treatment characteristics, using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor and activities of daily living scores and disease stage (Hoehn and Yahr scale). Fasting total plasma homocysteine (Hcy) was determined in all subjects. Hyperhomocysteinaemia was defined as a Hcy level above the 90th percentile for the controls.\nMean Hcy was 13.8 \u00b1 5.4mmol/L in PD and 12.4\u00b13mmol/L in controls (P>0.05). Hyperhomocysteinaemia (Hcy > 16.26umol/L) occurred in nine (22.5%) PD patients (all on levodopa) and 6 (15%) controls (P>0.05). Mean duration of levodopa use was 92 \u00b1 105.3 months in PD with HHcy compared to PD patients with normal Hcy 33.9 \u00b1 33.2 (p < 0.05). Disease severity and disability were similar regardless of Hcy levels. None of current age, disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr stage, UPDRS scores, total levodopa dose and duration was independent predictor of homocysteine level.\nThere is increased occurrence of hyper-homocysteinaemia in Nigerian subjects with Parkinson's disease, receiving Levodopa. This hyperhomocysteinaemia is more common with prolonged use but appears to have no relationship with disease severity or disability.",

    "abstract": "Missense mutations of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) gene cause autosomal-recessive Parkinson's disease. To date, little is known about the intrinsic catalytic properties of PINK1 since the human enzyme displays such low kinase activity in vitro. We have discovered that, in contrast to mammalian PINK1, insect orthologues of PINK1 we have investigated-namely Drosophila melanogaster (dPINK1), Tribolium castaneum (TcPINK1) and Pediculus humanus corporis (PhcPINK1)-are active as judged by their ability to phosphorylate the generic substrate myelin basic protein. We have exploited the most active orthologue, TcPINK1, to assess its substrate specificity and elaborated a peptide substrate (PINKtide, KKWIpYRRSPRRR) that can be employed to quantify PINK1 kinase activity. Analysis of PINKtide variants reveal that PINK1 phosphorylates serine or threonine, but not tyrosine, and we show that PINK1 exhibits a preference for a proline at the +1 position relative to the phosphorylation site. We have also, for the first time, been able to investigate the effect of Parkinson's disease-associated PINK1 missense mutations, and found that nearly all those located within the kinase domain, as well as the C-terminal non-catalytic region, markedly suppress kinase activity. This emphasizes the crucial importance of PINK1 kinase activity in preventing the development of Parkinson's disease. Our findings will aid future studies aimed at understanding how the activity of PINK1 is regulated and the identification of physiological substrates.",

    "abstract": "Motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are related to the excessive synchronized oscillatory activity in the beta frequency band (around 20Hz) in the basal ganglia and other parts of the brain. This review explores the dynamics and potential mechanisms of these oscillations employing ideas and methods from nonlinear dynamics. We present extensive experimental documentation of the relevance of synchronized oscillations to motor behavior in Parkinson's disease, and we discuss the intermittent character of this synchronization. The reader is introduced to novel time-series analysis techniques aimed at the detection of the fine temporal structure of intermittent phase locking observed in the brains of parkinsonian patients. Modeling studies of brain networks are reviewed, which may describe the observed intermittent synchrony, and we discuss what these studies reveal about brain dynamics in Parkinson's disease. The parkinsonian brain appears to exist on the boundary between phase-locked and nonsynchronous dynamics. Such a situation may be beneficial in the healthy state, as it may allow for easy formation and dissociation of transient patterns of synchronous activity which are required for normal motor behavior. Dopaminergic degeneration in Parkinson's disease may shift the brain networks closer to this boundary, which would still permit some motor behavior while accounting for the associated motor deficits. Understanding the mechanisms of the intermittent synchrony in Parkinson's disease is also important for biomedical engineering since efficient control strategies for suppression of pathological synchrony through deep brain stimulation require knowledge of the dynamics of the processes subjected to control.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, as-of-yet incurable, neurodegenerative condition affecting the nigro-striatal dopaminergic system. Emerging evidence suggests the importance of exercise in improving the trajectory of PD. Yet few people with PD are physically active. One challenge that healthcare professionals face in the 21st century is how to deliver physical activity programs to the population of individuals living with PD. A novel approach to delivering physical activity to people with PD is introduced - termed community-based participatory research (CBPR) - which engages people with PD and patient advocates as co-researchers in the development and implementation of community-based exercise programs. The authors describe the CBPR approach and provide several recent examples of community exercise programs that are steps in the direction of developing the CBPR model. This is followed by a discussion of what a more fully realized CBPR model might look like. Finally, the authors describe some obstacles to conducting CBPR and suggest strategies for overcoming them. It is argued that people with PD are an integral component of delivering the exercise intervention.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate sympathetic sudomotor activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) by means of the sympathetic skin response (SSR) and explore its possible changes due to mental stress.\nSudomotor function was evaluated using SSR in 29 patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage I-IV) without any clinical evidence of autonomic dysfunction. Twenty-seven healthy matched controls were also evaluated. SSR was elicited by electrical stimulation of the right median nerve and simultaneously recorded on the palms of both hands. Arithmetic mental stress was evoked by means of the WAIS-R arithmetic subscale. Latency and amplitude of SSR were evaluated before and after arithmetic mental stress.\nThe SSR was obtained in all patients and controls. There were no significant differences in its mean latency and amplitude between patients and controls. SSR parameters were significantly correlated with disease duration, UPDRS score, and disease stage. There were also significant correlations with rigidity and bradykinesia, but not with tremor. Mental stress had no effect on SSR parameters in any group.\nSSR parameters in PD without autonomic dysfunction were comparable to matched controls. Although PD patients are sensitive to mental stress, the arithmetic task had no effect on SSR parameters. Consequently, SSR as a method of evaluation of sympathetic sudomotor function is not sufficient for exploration of subclinical autonomic dysfunction in PD, but should be combined with other tests of autonomous nervous system.",

    "abstract": "The clinical picture in Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and postural instability. In advanced stages of the disease, many patients will experience reduced efficacy of medication with fluctuations in symptoms and dyskinesias. Surgical treatment with deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is now considered the gold standard in fluctuating PD. Many patients experience a gain of weight following the surgery. The aim of this study was to identify possible mechanisms, which may contribute to body weight gain in patients with PD following bilateral STN-DBS surgery.\nTen patients with PD were studied before bilateral STN-DBS surgery, and seven patients were studied again 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Clinical examination and resting metabolic rate with and without medical treatment was measured before and after STN-DBS. Furthermore, free-living energy expenditure, body composition, energy intake, peak oxygen consumption, maximal workload and leisure time physical activity were measured before and 3 and 12 months after surgery.\nThe STN-DBS operated patients had a significant weight gain of 4\u00b77 \u00b1 1\u00b76 kg (mean \u00b1 SE) 12 months postoperatively, and the weight gain was in the fat mass. The free-living energy expenditure decreased postoperatively 13 \u00b1 4% even though the reported dietary intake was reduced. A decreased energy expenditure took place in the non-resting energy expenditure. The reported daily leisure time activity, peak oxygen consumption and maximal workload were unchanged.\nThe STN-DBS operated patients have a significant postoperative weight gain, as a result of a decrease in free-living energy expenditure concomitant with an insufficient decrease in energy intake.",

From the literature we learn that in parkinsonian people there a is e major reduction of Bone Mass Density (BMD) compared to age-matched controls. A low BMD is one of the factors related to fracture's frequency in PD patients besides an increased risk of falls. From the standpoint pathophysiology, various factors are involved in osteoporosis: immobilization, endocrine factors like hypovitaminosis D, nutritional and iatrogenic factors.Considering morbidity and mortality related to fractures in old people and in particular in PD patients it is reasonable that these patients would undergo to vitamin and BMD measuring, to fall risk assessment and that all preventive measure are implemented to reduce the risk of fractures. Possible interventions are essentially based on fall prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Randomized clinical studies in the literature, in which it was studied the effect of anti-osteoporotic drugs in patients with MP showed a significant reduction in the number of fractures and increase BMD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and the aggression of alpha Synuclein (\u03b1S) in the brain. Drosophila mutants and transgenes have provided a platform to understand the mechanistic insight associated with the degenerative diseases. A number of polyphenols have been reported to inhibit the \u03b1S aggregation resulting in the possible prevention of PD. The involvement of free radicals in mediating the neuronal death in PD has also been implicated. In the present study, the effect of Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) was studied on the climbing ability of the PD model Drosophila expressing normal human alpha synuclein (h-\u03b1S) in the neurons. These flies exhibit locomotor dysfunction as the age progresses. NDGA at final concentration of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and 1\u03bcl/ml was supplemented with the diet and the flies were allowed to feed for the 24 days. NDGA at 0.01 \u03bcl/ml did not showed any significant delay in the loss of climbing ability of PD model flies. However, NDGA doses at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 \u03bcl/ml showed a dose dependent significant (p < .05) delay in the loss of climbing ability of PD model flies as compared to the untreated PD flies. The results suggest that the NDGA is potent in delaying the climbing disability of PD model flies and also supports the utility of this model in studying PD symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that pramipexole might have the potential to improve depressive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. To provide more evidence, in five Japanese patients at Hoehn & Yahr stage 1-3 we evaluated the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at our hospital. After the pramipexole treatment, each total score of UPDRS, HAMD and MADRS significantly decreased compared with that before the treatment. Our data indicate that pramipexole improves depressive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibitors hold tremendous therapeutic potential for the treatment of pain, epilepsy, sleep disorders, essential tremor and other neurological disorders; however, a lack of truly selective tools has hindered basic research, and selective tools from the pharmaceutical industry are potentially burdened with intellectual property (IP) constraints. Thus, an MLPCN high-throughput screen (HTS) was conducted to identify novel T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibitors free from IP constraints, and freely available through the MLPCN, for use by the biomedical community to study T-type Ca(2+) channels. While the HTS provided numerous hits, these compounds could not be optimized to the required level of potency to be appropriate tool compounds. Therefore, a scaffold hopping approach, guided by SurflexSim, ultimately afforded ML218 (CID 45115620) a selective T-Type Ca(2+) (Ca(v)3.1, Ca(v)3.2, Ca(v)3.3) inhibitor (Ca(v)3.2, IC(50) = 150 nM in Ca(2+) flux; Ca(v)3.2 IC(50) = 310 nM and Ca(v)3.3 IC(50) = 270 nM, respectively in patch clamp electrophysiology) with good DMPK properties, acceptable in vivo rat PK and excellent brain levels. Electrophysiology studies in subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons demonstrated robust effects of ML218 on the inhibition of T-Type calcium current, inhibition of low threshold spike and rebound burst activity. Based on the basal ganglia circuitry in Parkinson's disease (PD), the effects of ML218 in STN neurons suggest a therapeutic role for T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibitors, and ML218 was found to be orally efficacious in haloperidol-induced catalepsy, a preclinical PD model, with comparable efficacy to an A(2A) antagonist, a clinically validated PD target. ML218 proves to be a powerful new probe to study T-Type Ca(2+) function in vitro and in vivo, and freely available.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-synuclein (aS) is a natively unfolded pre-synaptic protein found in all Parkinson's disease patients as the major component of fibrillar plaques. Metal ions, and especially Cu(II), have been demonstrated to accelerate aggregation of aS into fibrillar plaques, the precursors to Lewy bodies. In this work, copper binding to aS is investigated by a combination of quantum and molecular mechanics simulations. Starting from the experimentally observed attachment site, several optimized structures of Cu-binding geometries are examined. The most energetically favorable attachment results in significant allosteric changes, making aS more susceptible to misfolding. Indeed, an inverse kinematics investigation of the configuration space uncovers a dynamically stable \u03b2-sheet conformation of Cu-aS that serves as a nucleation point for a second \u03b2-strand. Based on these findings, we propose an atomistic mechanism of copper-induced misfolding of aS as an initial event in the formation of Lewy bodies and thus in PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Spike trains from neurons in the basal ganglia of parkinsonian primates show increased pairwise correlations, oscillatory activity, and burst rate compared to those from neurons recorded during normal brain activity. However, it is not known how these changes affect the behavior of downstream thalamic neurons. To understand how patterns of basal ganglia population activity may affect thalamic spike statistics, we study pairs of model thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons receiving correlated inhibitory input from the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), a primary output nucleus of the basal ganglia. We observe that the strength of correlations of TC neuron spike trains increases with the GPi correlation level, and bursty firing patterns such as those seen in the parkinsonian GPi allow for stronger transfer of correlations than do firing patterns found under normal conditions. We also show that the T-current in the TC neurons does not significantly affect correlation transfer, despite its pronounced effects on spiking. Oscillatory firing patterns in GPi are shown to affect the timescale at which correlations are best transferred through the system. To explain this last result, we analytically compute the spike count correlation coefficient for oscillatory cases in a reduced point process model. Our analysis indicates that the dependence of the timescale of correlation transfer is robust to different levels of input spike and rate correlations and arises due to differences in instantaneous spike correlations, even when the long timescale rhythmic modulations of neurons are identical. Overall, these results show that parkinsonian firing patterns in GPi do affect the transfer of correlations to the thalamus.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was evaluation the effect of Gallic acid on movement disorders and pallidal electrical power in animal model of Parkinson's Disease (PD). PD is clinically characterized by development of motor disturbances, such as bradykinesia, resting tremors, rigidity and a later loss ofpostural reflexes. Oxidative stress is a hallmark factor where the oxidation of dopamine generates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and an unbalanced production ROS induces neuronal damage, therefor leading the neuronal death. Gallic Acid (GA) and its derivatives are present in the plant kingdom and acts as a potent antioxidant. Wistar male rats divided into seven groups randomly with 8 in each. Animals in all groups except control received 8 microg/2 microL 6-hydroxydopamine dissolved in normal saline contains 0.01% ascorbate or vehicle in right Medial Forbrain Bundle (MFB) and a bipolar wire electrode was implanted in the left globus pallidus nucleus of all animals under stereotaxic surgery. Two weeks later PD was approved by contralateral rotation signs induced by apomorphine and then movements and electrical power of pallidal were evaluated. Motor functions and pallidal electrical power were impaired and GA could improve motor dysfunctions and gamma wave power in parkinsonian rats' significantly with higher dose of GA (200 mg kg(-1)). Present result showed that GA may act as a potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger to reverse motor disorders and pallidal gamma wave power after 6-OHDA neurotoxicity in brain.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a non-invasive, non-contact system for the measurement of the arterial dorsum manus vibration waveforms of Parkinson disease patients. The laser line method is applied to detect the dorsum manus vibration in rest and postural situations. The proposed measurement system mainly consists of a laser diode and a low cost complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor. Laser line and centroid methods are combined with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in this study. The shape and frequency and relative frequency of the dorsum manus vibration waveforms can be detected rapidly using our Parkinson's disease measurement system. A laser line near the wrist joint is used as the testing line. The experimental results show an obvious increase in the amplitude and frequency of dorsum manus variation in the measured region in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, indicating the obvious effects of the disease. Both in postural and rest state measurements, as the patient disease age increases the vibration frequency increases. The measurement system is well suited for evaluating and pre-diagnosing early stage Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on recovery of muscle atrophy induced by Parkinson's disease.\nThe rat model was established by direct injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 20\u03bcg) into the left striatum using stereotaxic surgery. Rats were divided into two groups; the Parkinson's disease group with vehicle treatment (Vehicle; n=12) or DHEA treatment group (DHEA; n=22). DHEA or vehicle was administrated intraperitoneally daily at a dose of 0.34 mmol/kg for 21 days. At 22-days after DHEA treatment, soleus, plantaris, and striatum were dissected.\nThe DHEA group showed significant increase (p<.01) in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons in the lesioned side substantia nigra compared to the vehicle group. Weights and Type I fiber cross-sectional areas of the contralateral soleus of the DHEA group were significantly greater than those of the vehicle group (p=.02, p=.00). Moreover, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation significantly decreased in the lesioned striatum, but was recovered with DHEA and also in the contralateral soleus muscle, Akt and ERK phosphorylation recovered significantly and the expression level of myosin heavy chain also recovered by DHEA treatment.\nOur results suggest that DHEA treatment recovers Parkinson's disease induced contralateral soleus muscle atrophy through Akt and ERK phosphorylation.",

SN echogenic areas were larger in patients (mean \u00b1 SD, 0.31 \u00b1 0.08 cm(2)) compared to controls (mean \u00b1 SD, 0.17 \u00b1 0.02 cm(2)). TCS accurately identified 88.2% of PD patients.\nA large proportion of Brazilians seem to be eligible for TCS. An expressive number of PD patients could be diagnosed by TCS based on an expanded SN echogenic area. However, the current data is preliminary and must be corroborated by larger studies.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) are commonly observed in advanced Parkinson's disease. The neuronal mechanism of PIGD is not fully understood. Dysfunction of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) might be a possible cause of these symptoms. The autopsy studies of subjects with PIGD revealed a neurodegenerative process involving mainly PPN cholinergic neurons. The PPN participates in the locomotion processes by initiation, modulation and execution of stereotyped patterns of movement. The standard neurosurgical treatment of PD is subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN DBS). Clinical results revealed low efficiency of STN DBS on PIGD. Preliminary results of simultaneous PPN and STN DBS are very promising. Only a few reports have been published until now; a significant improvement of PIGD was observed in both ON and OFF L-dopa states.",

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that monocyte-macrophage based drug delivery can be applied to a spectrum of infectious, neoplastic, and degenerative disorders. In particular, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) loaded with nano formulated catalase, \"nanozyme\", were shown to attenuate neuro inflammation and nigrostriatal degeneration in rodent models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Nonetheless, the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of BMM-incorporated nanozyme has not been explored. To this end, we now demonstrate that BMM, serving as a \"depot\" for nanozyme, increased area under the curve(AUC), half-life, and mean residence time in blood circulation of the protein when compared to the nanozyme administered alone. Accordingly, bioavailability of the nanozyme for the brain, spleen, kidney, and liver was substantially increased. Importantly, nanozyme-loaded BMM targeted diseased sites and improved transport across the blood brain barrier. This was seen specifically in affected brain subregions in models of PD. Engaging natural immune cells such as monocyte-macrophages as drug carriers provides a new perspective for therapeutic delivery for PD and also likely a range of other inflammatory and degenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed rest tremor, one of the etiologically most elusive hallmarks of Parkinson disease (PD), in 12 consecutive PD patients during a specific task activating the locus coeruleus (LC) to investigate a putative role of noradrenaline (NA) in tremor generation and suppression. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed in all subjects by reduced dopamine reuptake transporter (DAT) binding values investigated by single photon computed tomography imaging (SPECT) with [(123)I] N-\u03c9-fluoropropyl-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl) tropane (FP-CIT). The intensity of tremor (i.e., the power of Electromyography [EMG] signals), but not its frequency, significantly increased during the task. In six subjects, tremor appeared selectively during the task. In a second part of the study, we retrospectively reviewed SPECT with FP-CIT data and confirmed the lack of correlation between dopaminergic loss and tremor by comparing DAT binding values of 82 PD subjects with bilateral tremor (n = 27), unilateral tremor (n = 22), and no tremor (n = 33). This study suggests a role of the LC in Parkinson tremor.",

    "abstract": "The onset of Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by focal motor features in one body part, which are usually correlated with greater dopaminergic depletion in the contralateral posterior putamen. The role of dopamine (DA) hemispheric differences in the onset and progression of motor symptoms of PD, however, remains undefined. Previous studies have demonstrated that unilateral manipulations of one nigrostriatal system affect contralateral DA turnover, indicating a functional and compensatory inter-dependence of the two nigrostriatal systems. In preliminary data obtained by our group from asymmetric PD patients, a higher asymmetry index as measured by 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-dopa ((18) F-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) was associated with a higher threshold (i.e., greater dopaminergic loss) for the onset of motor symptoms in the less-affected side. To further elucidate the underlying basis for this, we carried out a complementary study in monkeys using PET to assess and correlate the degree of dopaminergic striatal depletion with motor activity. Control and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated monkeys with symmetrical lesions were characterized behaviorally and with (18)F-DOPA PET. In parallel, an acute lesion was inflicted in the nigrostriatal projection unilaterally in one monkey, generating a 30% dopaminergic depletion in the ipsilateral striatum, which was not associated with any noticeable parkinsonian feature or deficit. The monkey remained asymptomatic for several months. Subsequently, this monkey received systemic MPTP, following which motor behavior and PET were repeatedly evaluated during progression of parkinsonian signs. The brains of all monkeys were processed using immunohistochemical methods. Our results suggest that the onset of motor signs is related to and influenced by the dopaminergic status of the less-affected, contralateral striatum. Although this work is still preliminary, the study agrees with our general hypothesis of hemispheric inter-dependence in the compensation of striatal DA deficit in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease, like many other neurodegenerative disorders, is characterized by the progressive accumulation of pathogenic protein species and the formation of intracellular inclusion bodies. The cascade by which the small synaptic protein \u03b1-synuclein misfolds to form distinctive protein aggregates, termed Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, has been the subject of intensive research for more than a decade. Genetic and pathological studies in Parkinson's disease patients as well as experimental studies in disease models have clearly established altered protein metabolism as a key element in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Alterations in protein metabolism include misfolding and aggregation, post-translational modification and dysfunctional degradation of cytotoxic protein species. Protein folding and re-folding are both mediated by a highly conserved network of molecules, called molecular chaperones and co-chaperones. In addition to the regulatory role in protein folding, molecular chaperone function is intimately associated with pathways of protein degradation, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, to effectively remove irreversibly misfolded proteins. Because of the central role of molecular chaperones in maintaining protein homeostasis, we herein review our current knowledge on the involvement of molecular chaperones and co-chaperones in Parkinson's disease. We further discuss the capacity of molecular chaperones to prevent or modulate neurodegeneration, an important concept for future neuroprotective strategies and summarize the current progress in preclinical studies in models of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Finally we include a discussion on the future potential of using molecular chaperones as a disease modifying therapy.",

    "abstract": "The tetrad of Parkinson's disease (PD) including tremor, rigidity, akinesia and postural instability are attributed to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Both environmental factors and genetic predisposition are supposed to be implicated in the initiation and progression of the disease. Particularly, much attention has been focused on \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1SYN) since \u03b1SYN is not only found in Lewy bodies characteristic of PD, but also mutations in the gene for \u03b1SYN can cause inherited forms of PD. Recent studies have shown that \u03b1SYN can be secreted into the extracellular milieu, thereby propagate Lewy pathology to neighboring cells in a prion-like manner. This concept sounds attractive as an acceptable explanation for the stereotypic distribution of Lewy pathology in PD. In addition to the classic motor symptoms, a variety of non-motor manifestations may affect on the patient's quality of life. Of all, hyposmia is prevalent in PD and may precede the onset of motor symptoms. We found that odor identification test scores correlated positively with the impairment of short-term memory and visuospatial functions. Furthermore, our data from fear-conditioning experiment indicated that the key player in the processing of emotional memories appears to be the amygdala, which has tight connections to primary olfactory areas.",

    "abstract": "As both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit a variety of patterns of dysphagia, appropriate symptomatic treatment is provided after evaluation of swallowing function through videofluoroscopic examination of swallowing. In ALS, disease progression is rapid, therefore, respiratory function, swallowing function and nutritional status should be evaluated regularly. When the oral or pharyngeal stage of swallowing are affected early in dysphagia, adjusting swallowing volume and varying consistency can be beneficial in ALS. When all stages of swallowing are impaired in ALS, such complications as pneumonia, dehydration and malnutrition, are observed. In such patients, it is necessary to consider an alternative to oral dietary intake. In PD, dysphagia is not necessarily associated with severity of parkinsonism and can appear at any time during the course of the disease. Dysphagia in PD can occur at any stage of swallowing and frequently accompanies multiple abnormalities. In particular, aspiration is an important risk factor for pneumonia in PD. The effect of L-dopa treatment for dysphagia is often insufficient; however, this treatment remains the first choice because dysphagia is exacerbated during off state. Rehabilitation for dysphagia in PD has also some effect.",

    "abstract": "To identify susceptibility genes that account for the heritability seen for complex traits, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) employing common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been conducted. The theoretical framework for GWAS is the 'common disease-common variant hypothesis'. Although GWAS have successfully revealed numerous susceptibility genes for common diseases, they generally account for only a small proportion of estimated heritability. In contrast, the prominent role of rare variants in neurodegenerative disease is best highlighted by the recent discovery of the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) as a robust genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease. Emerging new technology of next-generation sequencer will be a promising tool which enables an efficient search for remaining disease-relevant alleles.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a commonly observed phenomenon in Parkinson's disease, but its causes and mechanisms are not fully understood. This paper presents the development of a virtual reality (VR)-based body-weight supported treadmill interface (BWSTI) designed and applied to investigate FOG. The BWSTI provides a safe and controlled walking platform which allows investigators to assess gait impairments under various conditions that simulate real life. In order to be able to evoke FOG, our BWSTI employed a novel speed adaptation controller, which allows patients to drive the treadmill speed. Our interface responsively follows the subject's intention of changing walking speed by the combined use of feedback and feedforward controllers. To provide realistic visual stimuli, a three dimensional VR system is interfaced with the speed adaptation controller and synchronously displays realistic visual cues. The VR-based BWSTI was tested with three patients with PD who are known to have FOG. Visual stimuli that might cause FOG were shown to them while the speed adaptation controller adjusted treadmill speed to follow the subjects' intention. Two of the three subjects showed FOG during the treadmill walking.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a chronic degenerative neurologic disorder with both motor and nonmotor facets. The motor symptoms, including increased risk for falls, fractures, and stiffness, contribute to the morbidity of arthroplasty. In this article, we report 3 cases of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty in patients with PD. All patients achieved poor functional outcomes with mean (range) active forward flexion of 40\u00b0 (20\u00b0-60\u00b0) at follow-up. Although each patient obtained significant pain relief-mean (range) visual analog scale score was less than 1 (0-2)-range of motion was poor. In addition, each patient developed significant glenoid notching, though no component loosening or migration was observed. Mean (range) postoperative follow-up was 17 (4-32) months. A patient who has PD and requires an inverse arthroplasty should be counseled that pain relief may be reliably achieved, while functional outcomes are poor.",

The authors review the rapidly growing field of PD genetics, with a focus on the clinical, genetic, and pathophysiologic features of well-validated monogenic forms of PD caused by mutations in the SNCA, LRRK2, PARKIN, PINK1, DJ-1, and ATP13A2 genes. In addition, they discuss mutations in the GBA gene, which increase susceptibility for PD. The authors also evaluate the implications of genome-wide association studies and stem cell-derived disease models and give recommendations for genetic testing.",

The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using \u03b1-synuclein as a biological marker for Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTwenty-three drug-na\u00efve patients with PD (age 62.4\u00b112.7 years, mean\u00b1SD; 11 males) and 29 age- and sex-matched neurologic control subjects (age 60.1\u00b116.2 years; 16 males) were recruited. The levels of oligomeric and total \u03b1-synuclein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma were measured using two simultaneous enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.\nThe level of \u03b1-synuclein oligomer in the CSF of PD patients was significantly higher in PD patients than in neurological controls, but other findings (plasma \u03b1-synuclein oligomer and total \u03b1-synuclein in CSF and plasma) did not differ significantly between the two groups. When the control subjects were divided into a symptomatic control group (11 patients who complained of parkinsonian symptoms and were diagnosed with hydrocephalus and drug-induced or vascular parkinsonism) and a neurologic control group (10 normal subjects and 8 patients with diabetic ophthalmoplegia), the level of \u03b1-synuclein oligomer in the CSF was still significantly higher in PD patients than in both of the control subgroups.\nThese findings provide further evidence for a pathogenic role of the \u03b1-synuclein oligomer and suggest that CSF levels of \u03b1-synuclein oligomer can be a reliable marker for PD.",

    "abstract": "Existing studies on task switching in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have led to somewhat different results. In particular, it is unclear whether PD patients have a deficit in attentional control. In this study, we assessed task-switching abilities in samples of non-demented PD patients and elderly controls. We used a paradigm in which there was a random task sequence and the task was cued in every trial. This allowed the investigation of both task-set reconfiguration and task-set dissipation. In terms of the proportion of errors made, the patients showed increased switch cost and congruency effects. For reaction times, PD patients showed enlarged congruency effects on switch trials, specifically in the condition in which we used a short constant response-cue interval (RCI). Nevertheless, in a similar fashion to older controls, the patients showed reductions in reaction time switch cost from a short to a long cue-target interval (CTI) and from a short to a long RCI. While these latter findings, respectively, suggest unimpaired task preparation and task dissipation on correct trials in the PD patients, the overall results show that they have a deficit in biasing and selecting currently relevant task sets and more generally argue in favour of a failure of attentional control in PD.",

    "abstract": "The clinical hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) are movement poverty and slowness (i.e. bradykinesia), muscle rigidity, limb tremor or gait disturbances. Parkinson's gait includes slowness, shuffling, short steps, freezing of gait (FoG) and/or asymmetries in gait. There are currently no validated clinical instruments or device that allow a full characterization of gait disturbances in PD. As a step towards this goal, a four accelerometer-based system is proposed to increase the number of parameters that can be extracted to characterize parkinsonian gait disturbances such as FoG or gait asymmetries. After developing the hardware, an algorithm has been developed, that automatically epoched the signals on a stride-by-stride basis and quantified, among others, the gait velocity, the stride time, the stance and swing phases, the single and double support phases or the maximum acceleration at toe-off, as validated by visual inspection of video recordings during the task. The results obtained in a PD patient and a healthy volunteer are presented. The FoG detection will be improved using time-frequency analysis and the system is about to be validated with a state-of-the-art 3D movement analysis system.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel method based on analysis of dynamic response of vestibular system for diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) is introduced. Electrovestibulography (EVestG) signals are recorded from the ear canal in response to a vestibular stimulus. EVestG signals are in fact the vestibular response modulated by more cortical brain signals. We used EVestG data of 20 patients with PD and 26 age-matched healthy controls recorded in a previous study. We calculated the Katz Fractal Dimension (FD) of the extracted timing signal of firings during contralateral and ipsilateral stimuli of both left and right ear. We used multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to select pairs of features showing the most significant differences between the groups. Then, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant (LDA, QDA) classification algorithms were applied on the selected features. The results have shown above 77.27% accuracy. Given the small population of the subjects and the patients were at different stage of disease, the results encourage continuing exploration of the application of EVestG for PD diagnosis and perhaps as a quick and non-invasive screening tool.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) automatic identification has been actively pursued over several works in the literature. In this paper, we deal with this problem by applying evolutionary-based techniques in order to find the subset of features that maximize the accuracy of the Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) classifier. The reason for the choice of this classifier relies on its fast training phase, given that each possible solution to be optimized is guided by the OPF accuracy. We also show results that improved other ones recently obtained in the context of PD automatic identification.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor disabilities that can be alleviated reasonably with appropriate medication. However, there is a lack of objective methods for quantifying the efficacy of treatment in PD. We applied here an objective method for quantifying the effects of medication in PD using EMG and acceleration measurements and analysis. In the method, four signal features were calculated from the EMG and acceleration recordings of both sides of the body: the kurtosis and recurrence rate of EMG, and the amplitude and sample entropy of acceleration. Principal component approach was used for reducing the number of variables. EMG and acceleration data measured from nine PD patients were used for analysis. The patients were measured in four different medication conditions: with medication off, and two and three and four hours after taking the medication. The results showed that in eight patients the EMG recordings changed into less spiky and the acceleration recordings into more complex after taking the medication. A reverse phenomenon in the signal characteristics was observed in seven patients 3-4 hours after taking the medication. The results indicate that the presented method is potentially useful for quantifying objectively the effects of medication on the neuromuscular function in PD.",

These methods rely on the subjective judgment of a rater to assign scores representing the extent of impairment while subjects perform prescribed activities. We describe a new model-based framework that uses statistical video processing to automatically track movement during prescribed activities. This approach has many advantages over traditional clinical rating scales. It can completely characterize movement during prescribed tasks over time objectively and precisely using hardware that is inexpensive and readily available. We demonstrate the potential of this framework with a simple statistical model applied to a paced finger tapping test. This technology could be deployed in a natural home environment for frequent assessments. This technology could ultimately improve both clinical practice and clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in the portability and affordability of optical motion capture systems have opened the doors to various clinical applications. In this paper, we look into the potential use of motion capture data for the quantitative analysis of motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The standard of care, human observer-based assessments of the motor symptoms, can be very subjective and are often inadequate for tracking mild symptoms. Motion capture systems, on the other hand, can potentially provide more objective and quantitative assessments. In this pilot study, we perform full-body motion capture of Parkinson's patients with deep brain stimulator off-drugs and with stimulators on and off. Our experimental results indicate that the quantitative measure on spatio-temporal statistics learnt from the motion capture data reveal distinctive differences between mild and severe symptoms. We used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for discriminating mild vs. severe symptoms with an average accuracy of approximately 90%. Finally, we conclude that motion capture technology could potentially be an accurate, reliable and effective tool for statistical data mining on motor symptoms related to PD. This would enable us to devise more effective ways to track the progression of neurodegenerative movement disorders.",

    "abstract": "While many studies have reported on the use of kinematic analysis on well-controlled, in-laboratory mobility tasks, few studies have examined the challenges of recording dynamic mobility in home environments. This preliminary study evaluated whole body mobility in eleven patients with Parkinson disease (H&Y 2-4). Patients were recorded in their home environment during scripted and non-scripted mobility tasks while wearing a full-body kinematic recording system using 11 inertial motion sensors (IMU). Data were analyzed with principal component analysis (PCA) in order to identify kinematic variables which best represent mobility tasks. Results indicate that there was a large degree of variability within subjects for each task, across tasks for individual subjects, and between scripted and non-scripted tasks. This study underscores the potential benefit of whole body multi-sensor kinematic recordings in understanding the variability in task performance across patients during daily activity which may have a significant impact on rehabilitation assessment and intervention.",

    "abstract": "Functional motor impairment caused by Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders is currently measured with rating scales such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). These are typically comprised of a series of simple tasks that are visually scored by a trained rater. We developed a method to objectively quantify three upper extremity motor tasks directly with a wearable inertial sensor. Specifically, we used triaxial gyroscopes and adaptive filters to quantify how predictable and regular the signals were. We found that simply using the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) as a test statistic permitted us to distinguish between subjects with and without Parkinson's disease who were matched for age, height, and weight. A forward linear predictor based on the Kalman filter was able to attain areas under the curve (AUC) in receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves in the range of 0.76 to 0.83. Further studies and development are warranted. This technology has the potential to more accurately measure the motor signs of Parkinson's disease. This may reduce statistical bias and variability of rating scales, which could lead to trials with fewer subjects, less cost, and shorter duration.",

    "abstract": "Arousal from sleep are short awakenings, which can be identified in the EEG as an abrupt change in frequency. Arousals can occur in all sleep stages and the number and frequency increase with age. Frequent arousals during sleep results in sleep fragmentation and is associated with daytime sleepiness. Manual scoring of arousals is time-consuming and the inter-score agreement is highly varying especially for patients with sleep related disorders. The aim of this study was to design an arousal detection algorithm capable of detecting arousals from sleep, in both non-REM and REM sleep in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). The proposed algorithm uses features from EEG, EMG and the manual sleep stage scoring as input to a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN). The performance of the algorithm has been assessed using polysomnographic (PSG) recordings from a total of 8 patients diagnosed with PD. The performance of the algorithm was validated using the leave-one-out method resulting in a sensitivity of 89.8 % and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 88.8 %. This result is high compared to previous presented arousal detection algorithms.",

    "abstract": "A method for the analysis of accelerometer and gyroscope signals in order to automatically assess the Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in patients with Parkinson's disease is presented in this paper. Several accelerometers and gyroscopes are placed on certain positions on the subject's body and the obtained signals are analyzed in order to extract several features that depict the energy distribution over the frequency spectrum and the non-linear properties of the signal. These features are fed into an artificial neural network which is used for LID detection and severity classification. The method has been evaluated using a group of 29 subjects. Results are presented related to the body locations that the accelerometers and the gyroscopes are placed. The obtained results indicate high classification ability (84.3% average classification accuracy).",

WiiPD aims to make use of the many capabilities of the Nintendo Wii Remote in combination with a number of bespoke data gathering methods to provide a rich and engaging user experience that can capture a wide range of motor and non-motor metrics. In this paper we discuss the architecture of the approach, and provide details of the implementation and testing of the motor-assessment component of the system. Initial results of testing on 6 users indicate that the system is able to differentiate between normal and abnormal motor performance, suggesting that the system has the potential to monitor the motor fluctuations associated with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) predominantly alters the motor performance of the affected individuals. In particular, the loss of dopaminergic neurons compromises the speed, the automaticity and fluidity of movements. As the disease evolves, PD patient's motion becomes slower and tremoric and the response to medication fluctuates along the day. In addition, the presence of involuntary movements deteriorates voluntary movement in advanced state of the disease. These changes in the motion can be detected by studying the variation of the signals recorded by accelerometers attached in the limbs and belt of the patients. The analysis of the most significant changes in these signals make possible to build an individualized motor profile of the disease, allowing doctors to personalize the medication intakes and consequently improving the response of the patient to the treatment. Several works have been done in a laboratory and supervised environments providing solid results; this work focused on the design of unsupervised method for the assessment of gait in PD patients. The development of a reliable quantitative tool for long-term monitoring of PD symptoms would allow the accurate detection of the clinical status during the different PD stages and the evaluation of motor complications. Besides, it would be very useful both for routine clinical care as well as for novel therapies testing.",

The current work is related to a module of the PERFORM system, a FP7 project from the European Commission, that aims at providing an innovative and reliable tool, able to evaluate, monitor and manage patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. The assessment procedure was carried out through a developed C# library that detects the activities of the patient using an activity recognition algorithm and classifies the data using a Support Vector Machine trained with data coming from previous test phases. The accuracy between the output of the automatic detection and the evaluation of the clinician both expressed with the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale, presents an average value of [68.3 \u00b1 8.9]%. A meta-analysis algorithm is used in order to improve the accuracy to an average value of [74.4 \u00b1 14.9]%. Future work will include a personalized training of the classifiers in order to achieve a higher level of accuracy.",

    "abstract": "DEEP brain stimulation implants have improved life quality for more than 70,000 patients world-wide with diseases like Parkinson's, essential tremor, or obsessive-compulsive disorder where pharmaceutical therapies alone could not offer sufficient relief. Still, optimization and monitoring relies heavily on regular clinical visits, putting a burden on patient's comfort and clinicians. Permanent monitoring and combination with other patient health signals could ultimately lead to a personalized closed-loop therapy with remote quality monitoring. This requires technological improvements on the DBS implants such as integration of recording capabilities for brain activity monitoring, active low-power electronics, rechargeable battery technology, and body sensor networks for integration with e.g. gait, speech, and other vital information sensors on the patient's body and a link to a telemedicine platform using mobile technologies.",

Current methods for long-term monitoring of motor fluctuations, such as patient diaries, are ineffective due to their time consuming and subjective nature. Researchers have shown that wearable sensors such as accelerometers can be used to gather objective information about a patient's motor symptoms. In this paper, we present preliminary results from our analysis on wearable sensor data gathered during longitudinal monitoring of 5 patients with PD. Our results indicate that it is possible to track longitudinal changes in motor symptoms by training a regression model based on Random Forests.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative movement disorder. Early diagnosis and effective therapy monitoring is an important prerequisite to treat patients and reduce health care costs. Objective and non-invasive assessment strategies are an urgent need in order to achieve this goal. In this study we apply a mobile, lightweight and easy applicable sensor based gait analysis system to measure gait patterns in PD and to distinguish mild and severe impairment of gait. Examinations of 16 healthy controls, 14 PD patients in an early stage, and 13 PD patients in an intermediate stage were included. Subjects performed standardized gait tests while wearing sport shoes equipped with inertial sensors (gyroscopes and accelerometers). Signals were recorded wirelessly, features were extracted, and distinct subpopulations classified using different classification algorithms. The presented system is able to classify patients and controls (for early diagnosis) with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 86%. In addition it is possible to distinguish mild from severe gait impairment (for therapy monitoring) with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This system may be able to objectively classify PD gait patterns providing important and complementary information for patients, caregivers and therapists.",

    "abstract": "The unilaterally lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease which fails to orient to the food stimuli presented on the contralateral side of its preferential side of body could be induced by the injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). We employed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS, current intensity: 80 \u03bcA, and 40 \u03bcA; anodal electrode area: 3.14 mm(2); stimulation time: 30 minutes) over the M1 area to relieve the ipsilateral bias in the rat model. A corridor test was set to count the ipsilateral bias of the rats. In this experiment, 30 Sprague-Dawley rats (80 \u03bcA: n = 8, 40 \u03bcA: n = 8, sham: n = 7, healthy control: n = 7) were chosen for the corridor test and the tDCS session. The lesioned rats exhibited increased ipsilateral bias 4 weeks after the lesion surgery (P < 0.01), and the anodal tDCS with the active electrode on the lesioned side relieved the ipsilateral bias significantly (P < 0.01) immediately after the surgery and the improvement lasted for nearly 1 day. The rats in the group of 80 \u03bcA exhibited more significant changes than the 40 \u03bcA group after one day. After all the experiments, the histological process showed no neurotrauma led by the tDCS. In conclusion, the modulatory function of the cortical excitability of the tDCS may awaken the compensatory mechanisms and the response mechanisms which modulate the loss of the brain function. Further studies should be done to provide more evidence about the assumption.",

    "abstract": "Neurological disease is often associated with changes in firing activity in specific brain areas. Accurate statistical models of neural spiking can provide insight into the mechanisms by which the disease develops and clinical symptoms manifest. Point process theory provides a powerful framework for constructing, fitting, and evaluating the quality of neural spiking models. We illustrate an application of point process modeling to the problem of characterizing abnormal oscillatory firing patterns of neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We characterize the firing properties of these neurons by constructing conditional intensity models using spline basis functions that relate the spiking of each neuron to movement variables and the neuron's past firing history, both at short and long time scales. By calculating maximum likelihood estimators for all of the parameters and their significance levels, we are able to describe the relative propensity of aberrant STN spiking in terms of factors associated with voluntary movements, with intrinsic properties of the neurons, and factors that may be related to dysregulated network dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to assess Parkinson tremor estimating actual distance amplitude. We propose a practical, useful and simple method for evaluating Parkinson tremor with distance value. We measured resting tremor of 7 Parkinson Disease (PD) patients with triaxial accelerometer. Resting tremor of participants was diagnosed by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) by neurologist. First, we segmented acceleration signal during 7 seconds from recorded data. To estimate a displacement of tremor, we performed double integration from the acceleration. Prior to double integration, moving average method was used to reduce an error of integral constant. After estimation of displacement, we calculated tremor distance during 1s from segmented signal using Euclidean distance. We evaluated the distance values compared with UPDRS. Averaged moving distance during 1 second corresponding to UPDRS 1 was 11.52 mm, that of UPDRS 2 was 33.58 mm and tremor distance of UPDRS 3 was 382.22 mm. Estimated moving distance during 1s was proportional to clinical rating scale--UPDRS.",

    "abstract": "The hallmark of Parkinson's disease is on-going degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which may be due to various etiologies. Various approaches to alleviate symptoms are available, such as life-long pharmacological intervention, deep brain stimulation, and transplantation of dopaminergic neuron-containing fetal tissue. However, each of these approaches has a disadvantage. Several studies have shown that various kinds of stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and other cells can differentiate into dopaminergic neurons and may be promising for treating Parkinson's disease in the future. Therefore, this review addresses those cells in terms of their prospects in cell therapy for Parkinson's disease. In addition, the need for safety and efficacy studies, various cell delivery modes and sites, and possible side effects will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Neuroprotective treatments in Parkinson's disease (PD) have remained elusive. Psychotropics are commonly prescribed in PD without regard to their pathobiological effects. The authors investigated the effects of psychotropics on pathobiological proteins, proteasomal activity, mitochondrial functions, apoptosis, neuroinflammation, trophic factors, stem cells, and neurogenesis. Only findings replicated in at least 2 studies were considered for these actions. Additionally, PD-related gene transcription, animal model, and human neuroprotective clinical trial data were reviewed. Results indicate that, from a PD pathobiology perspective, the safest drugs (i.e., drugs least likely to promote cellular neurodegenerative mechanisms balanced against their likelihood of promoting neuroprotective mechanisms) include pramipexole, valproate, lithium, desipramine, escitalopram, and dextromethorphan. Fluoxetine favorably affects transcription of multiple genes (e.g., MAPT, GBA, CCDC62, HIP1R), although it and desipramine reduced MPTP mouse survival. Haloperidol is best avoided. The most promising neuroprotective investigative priorities will involve disease-modifying trials of the safest agents alone or in combination to capture salutary effects on H3 histone deacetylase, gene transcription, glycogen synthase kinase-3, \u03b1-synuclein, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), apoptosis, inflammation, and trophic factors including GDNF and BDNF.",

The aim of this study was to map out PD patients' perception about various advanced treatment methods, their availability and regional differences in medical care, and to investigate patients' experience of their medication and quality of life.\nA survey was sent to 4886 PD patients of the Swedish Parkinson's Disease Association covering demography, the patient's illness, current treatment, received information about advanced treatment alternatives, and health status. Advanced PD was considered as patients diagnosed >5 years ago, using PD medication >5 times/day, and experiencing motor complications >2 hours/day.\nIn total, 3327/4886 persons (68%) responded (57% men) of which 1300 (39%) were classified as having advanced PD. Mean age was 71 years with a median disease duration of 8 years. The treating physician was a neurologist (86%) but varied between counties (96% to 52%) and was most frequent in urban areas. Doctor appointments were 1.7 times/year with regional variation (2.1 to 1.1). Three out of four patients had heard of advanced treatment options and were interested, but were denied treatment. Only a small proportion of patients were informed of these by their physician. Nine percent were satisfied with their medication (including 4% of advanced patients). One third of patients experienced their general health as poor or very poor.\nThe majority of Swedish PD patients are treated by neurologists. Annual numbers of doctors' appointments were low in an international context and can partly be explained by the shortage of neurologists and other trained specialists. Doctors only provided a small proportion of patients with advanced therapy information, despite patients' interest. Hence, improvement is warranted regarding doctor appointments, information about various advanced treatment options, and their availability.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress may be directly or indirectly involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is the major product of DNA oxidative damage but its determination in plasma or urine may have controversial significance. The concentration of 8-OHdG not only depends on its oxidation rate but also on the efficacy of the DNA repairing systems.\nWe studied the ratio between 8-OHdG and 2-dG (the corresponding not hydroxylated base 2'-deoxyguanosine) in plasma and urine as a marker of oxydative stress in PD. This enabled the determination of the real DNA damage in terms of oxidation rate regardless of the efficacy of the DNA repairing mechanisms.\nWe optimized two different analytical methods: one for 8-OHdG and the other for 2-dG, both based on a common preliminary solid-phase extraction step (SPE) followed by two different HPLC analytical separations with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED). The reliability of these methods was confirmed by analysing plasma and urine samples collected in parkinsonian patients and in age-matched healthy control subjects.\nIn urine samples, the measurement of 8-OHdG alone as well as the ratio 8-OHdG/2-dG were significantly different in healthy controls and PD patients. In plasma samples, only the ratio 8-OHdG/2-dG was significantly higher in PD compared to healthy controls showing that the ratio 8-OHdG/2-dG is a reliable diagnostic tool in studies on DNA oxydative damage.",

    "abstract": "Measurement of \u03b1-synuclein level in the peripheral blood was proposed as a diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease. However, the results of these studies remain contradictory, probably because the examined samples included patients with different etiology of Parkinson's disease. To verify this assumption we studied the levels of \u03b1-synuclein in peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with Parkinson's disease associated with mutations in the gene of leucine-rich kinase 2 (LRRK2). The mean \u03b1-synuclein level was significantly lower in patients with LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease (N=8) than in patients with sporadic form of the disease (N=33; p<0.02) and in controls (N=18; p<0.05). On the other hand, we found no differences in the level of \u03b1-synuclein level between patients with sporadic form of the disease and controls. We hypothesize that the level of \u03b1-synuclein in the peripheral blood largely depends on the etiology of the disease and cannot be used as a universal diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Degeneration of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons of the nigrostriatal system is the key stage in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The first symptoms of this disease are observed after degeneration of 70-80% neurons, which occurs over 20-30 years. The clinical stage of Parkinson's disease begins after this period. Late diagnostics of Parkinson's disease contributes to low efficiency of therapy for this disorder. Detailed study of the pathogenesis and development of preclinical diagnostic methods for Parkinson's disease are the urgent problems. This work was designed to develop a new experimental model of the preclinical and clinical stages of the disease. Experimental modeling was performed on C57Bl/6 mice using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). This agent is converted into the MPP(+)-neurotoxin in brain DAergic neurons. We showed that MPTP in a dose of 4 mg/kg has no effect on the nigrostriatal DAergic system. MPTP in a dose of 8-16 mg/kg produced the toxic effect only on DAergic axons, which simulates the preclinical stage of Parkinson's disease. MPTP in a dose of 20-40 mg/kg had the toxic effect on neuronal axons and bodies, which simulates the clinical stage of Parkinson's disease. The data suggest that progressive degeneration of DAergic neurons is accompanied by activation of compensatory mechanisms for functional deficiency of these cells.",

Seven PD\u2009-\u2009FOG and seven age-matched healthy controls performed self-generated or cue-triggered gait initiation. Data for PD patients with FOG (PD\u2009+\u2009FOG) were cited from a previous study using a procedure similar to that used in the present study. Gait initiation was abnormal, and external cue normalized some abnormalities in PD\u2009-\u2009FOG. The initial swing side was fairly consistent among the trials in both PD\u2009-\u2009FOG and in healthy controls, although the initial swing side was inconsistent in PD\u2009+\u2009FOG. The duration of the first double limb support (DLS) was the only parameter that depends on FOG severity and that was abnormal in PD\u2009+\u2009FOG but was not abnormal in PD\u2009-\u2009FOG. The variability of the initial swing side and prolonged first DLS are abnormalities specifically related to FOG.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often show impaired performance on visuospatial attentional tasks. The objective of the study was to examine the attentional function of PD patients performing the attentional network test (ANT). We used the ANT to compare PD patients with healthy controls with respect to the efficiency of 3 anatomically defined attentional networks: the alerting, orienting, and executive control networks. We found that PD patients showed a selective abnormality in the orienting network. Although the alerting and executive control networks apparently remained unaffected, the efficiencies of these networks in patients with PD negatively correlated with the Hoehn-Yahr stage. The results supported the idea that the orienting processes may be more dynamic in PD than in non-PD individuals.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological movement disorder primarily resulting from damage to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. To elucidate the pathogenesis, mechanisms of cell death, and to evaluate therapeutic strategies for PD, numerous animal models have been developed. Understanding the strengths and limitations of these models can significantly impact the choice of model, experimental design, and data interpretation. The primary objectives of this article are twofold: First, to assist new investigators who are contemplating embarking on PD research to navigate through the available animal models. Emphasis will be placed on common neurotoxic murine models in which toxic molecules are used to lesion the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. And second, to provide an overview of basic technical requirements for assessing the pathology, structure, and function of the nigrostriatal pathway.",

    "abstract": "Although components of possible Parkinson's disease can be found in very early documents, the first clear medical description was written in 1817 by James Parkinson. In the mid-1800s, Jean-Martin Charcot was particularly influential in refining and expanding this early description and in disseminating information internationally about Parkinson's disease. He separated Parkinson's disease from multiple sclerosis and other disorders characterized by tremor, and he recognized cases that later would likely be classified among the Parkinsonism-plus syndromes. Early treatments of Parkinson's disease were based on empirical observation, and anticholinergic drugs were used as early as the nineteenth century. The discovery of dopaminergic deficits in Parkinson's disease and the synthetic pathway of dopamine led to the first human trials of levodopa. Further historically important anatomical, biochemical, and physiological studies identified additional pharmacological and neurosurgical targets for Parkinson's disease and allow modern clinicians to offer an array of therapies aimed at improving function in this still incurable disease.",

    "abstract": "Although face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was found to be beneficial for the treatment of depression in Parkinson disease (dPD) in a recent randomized-controlled trial, access to care was identified as a critical issue that needs to be addressed in order to improve the management of this nonmotor complication in PD. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and effect of telephone-based CBT for dPD.\nTwenty-one depressed people with PD participated in a National Institutes of Health-sponsored uncontrolled pilot trial of telephone-based CBT in an academic medical center from October 2009 to February 2011. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was the primary outcome. Treatment was provided to people with PD for 10 weeks, modified for delivery over the phone, and supplemented with 4 separate phone-based caregiver educational sessions. Assessments were completed at baseline and 5 (midpoint), 10 (end-of-treatment), and 14 weeks (follow-up) post-enrollment.\nTwenty (95%) people with PD completed the study treatment. Phone-based CBT was associated with significant improvements in depression, anxiety, negative thoughts, and coping. Mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale change from baseline to week 10 was 7.91 points (P < .001, Cohen d = 1.21).\nTelephone-based CBT may be a feasible and helpful approach for treating dPD and warrants further exploration in randomized-controlled trials.

    "abstract": "Depression in Parkinson disease (PD) is associated with faster disease progression, lower activities of daily living, and more severe cognitive impairment. Even mild symptoms of depression may impact outcomes in patients with PD. Nevertheless, a low rate of agreement has been reported between patient and clinician ratings of depression, suggesting that clinicians may underestimate depression in patients with PD. However, to accurately compare the rates of agreement, comparable estimates are needed so that patient and clinician ratings have similar meaning (eg, mild, moderate, severe, etc). The purpose of this study was to examine this question by investigating the degree of association and rate of agreement of levels of symptom severity among self-report and clinician ratings using established cutoffs that correspond to more comparable estimates of these levels for both patient and clinician. Our findings suggest that patient's self-report of depressive symptoms was significantly correlated with clinician-based report irrespective of the stage of disease. Moreover, patients demonstrated a 72% rate of agreement with clinicians in classifying symptoms as asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, or fully symptomatic, a rate significantly higher than the rate of 35% previously reported. This difference in rate of agreement may be accounted for using varying criteria for severity levels across the studies. Findings suggest that clinician and patient reports show a high rate of agreement across a range of depressive symptoms and that self-report measures may provide a relatively efficient means of detecting depressive symptoms especially if patients are disinclined to initiate their report.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. While sporadic in the majority of cases, PD-linked dominant mutations in the \u03b1-synuclein and LRRK-2 genes, and recessive mutations in the parkin, DJ-1 and PINK-1 genes have been identified in PD families in recent years. In this review we describe viral animal models for PD, i.e. models that are based on PD-associated mutations, and have been generated by viral delivery of the respective disease genes to the substantia nigra of rodents and non-human primates. To date, viral PD models comprise \u03b1-synuclein and LRRK-2-based overexpression models, as well as models that mimic parkin loss of function by overexpression of the parkin substrates Pael-R, CDCrel-1, p38/JTV or synphilin-1. These viral models provide valuable insights into Parkinson disease mechanisms, help to identify therapeutic targets and may contribute to the development of therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in autosomal recessive forms of the disease caused by mutations encoding PINK1. Although mitochondrial pathology can be demonstrated in many cell types, it is neurons that bear the brunt of cell death in PD. We studied the mitochondrial physiology of neurons and muscle cells with loss of function of the nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein PINK1. PINK1 is widely expressed in many types of tissues, but deficiency selectively induces death in neurons. We report here that the same genetic defect results in opposing phenotypes in different cell types, depending on the metabolic properties of the cell. Thus, PINK1-deficient myocytes exhibit high basal mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m), whereas PINK1-deficient neurons have been shown to exhibit a low \u0394\u03c8m. PINK1 deficiency induces impaired respiration in both cell types, with a concomitant increase in glycolytic activity. We demonstrate that the high glycolytic capacity in myocytes compared with neurons enables them to produce more ATP and, therefore, compensates for the metabolic defects induced by PINK1 deficiency. Furthermore, the high \u0394\u03c8m generated in PINK1 knockout (KO) muscle mitochondria enables them to buffer cytosolic Ca(2+) fluxes, rendering them resistant to Ca(2+) stress effectively. Conversely, PINK1 KO neurons were previously shown to develop mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload and Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial depolarisation. Prevention of Ca(2+) dysregulation in myocytes might therefore account for the sparing of these cells in PD.",

    "abstract": "Learning to select optimal behavior in new and uncertain situations is a crucial aspect of living and requires the ability to quickly associate stimuli with actions that lead to rewarding outcomes. Mathematical models of reinforcement-based learning to select rewarding actions distinguish between (1) the formation of stimulus-action-reward associations, such that, at the instant a specific stimulus is presented, it activates a specific action, based on the expectation that that particular action will likely incur reward (or avoid punishment); and (2) the comparison of predicted and actual outcomes to determine whether the specific stimulus-action association yielded the intended outcome or needs revision. Animal electrophysiology and human fMRI studies converge on the notion that dissociable neural circuitries centered on the striatum are differentially involved in different components of this learning process. The modulatory role of dopamine (DA) in these respective circuits and component processes is of particular relevance to the study of reward-based learning in patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we show that the first component process, learning to predict which actions yield reward (supported by the anterior putamen and associated motor circuitry) is impaired when PD patients are taken off their DA medication, whereas DA medication has no systematic effects on the second processes, outcome evaluation (supported by caudate and ventral striatum and associated frontal circuitries). However, the effects of DA medication on these processes depend on dosage, with larger daily doses leading to a decrease in predictability of stimulus-action-reward relations and increase in reward-prediction errors.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is well known to cause voice impairments. The aim of this study is to evaluate subjective and objective changes in voice quality in patients with PD in Croatian language speakers. Twenty one patients (11 male and 10 female) with PD and twenty one age-matched (10 male and 11 female) of the control group were assessed. Voice impairment was scored according to Voice Handicap Index (VHI). Patient's perceptual voice analysis was assessed using GRBAS scale including Grade of Dysphonia, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia and Strain items. The analysed objective voice parametars were: fundamental frequency, highest frequency, lowest frequency, voice range, jitter, shimmer, maximum phonation time and s/z ratio. In all patients we performed videolaryngostroboscopic examination. Compared with the control group we found the significant differences in VHI, in GRBAS scale (p < 0.05 in all items except asthenia). On videostroboscopic examination, laryngeal tremor was present only in PD group (6 patients), abnormalities of the mucosal wave was found more frequent in PD group (17 versus 8 patients) and also non-closure glottis pattern (11 versus 6 patients). There was no significant difference in the objective voice parametars except in maximum phonation time which was shorter in PD group (15.8 seconds and 23 seconds, p = 0.014) and voice range, which was shorter in PD group (111 Hz versus 147 Hz, p = 0.0465). No one of patients with PD was included in any form of speech therapy. The voice disability in PD is generally well known, but very often underestimated. In this study we found which components of voice were more affected. The voice quality has a significant impact on life quality and potential in assessment for severity of disease state and for the efficacy of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) management has traditionally focused largely on motor symptoms. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) are effective treatments for motor symptoms. Nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) may also profoundly affect the quality of life. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate NMS changes pre- and post-DBS utilizing two recently developed questionnaires. Methods. NMS-Q (questionnaire) and NMS-S (scale) were administered to PD patients before/after unilateral DBS (STN/GPi targets). Results. Ten PD patients (9 STN implants, 1 GPi implant) were included. The three most frequent NMS symptoms identified utilizing NMS-Q in pre-surgical patients were gastrointestinal (100%), sleep (100%), and urinary (90%). NMS sleep subscore significantly decreased (-1.6 points \u00b1 1.8, P = 0.03). The three most frequent NMS symptoms identified in pre-surgical patients using NMS-S were gastrointestinal (90%), mood (80%), and cardiovascular (80%). The largest mean decrease of NMS scores was seen in miscellaneous symptoms (pain, anosmia, weight change, and sweating) (-7 points \u00b1 8.7), and cardiovascular/falls (-1.9, P = 0.02). Conclusion. Non-motor symptoms improved on two separate questionnaires following unilateral DBS for PD. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine their clinical significance as well as to examine the strengths/weaknesses of each questionnaire/scale.",

    "abstract": "Persons with Parkinson disease (PD) experience difficulty turning, leading to freezing of gait and falls. We hypothesized that saccade dysfunction may relate to turning impairments, as turns are normally initiated with a saccade.\nDetermine whether saccades are impaired during turns in PD and if characteristics of the turn-initiating saccade are predictive of ensuing turn performance.\n23 persons with PD off medication and 19 controls performed 90 and 180 degree in-place turns to the right and left. Body segment rotations were measured using 3-D motion capture and oculomotor data were captured using a head-mounted eye tracking system and electrooculography. Total number of saccades and the amplitude, velocity, and timing of the first saccade were determined.\nTurn performance (turn duration, number of steps to turn) was impaired in PD (p<0.05). PD performed more saccades, and the velocity and timing of the first saccade was impaired for both turn amplitudes (p<0.05). Amplitude of the first saccade was decreased in PD during 180 degree turns. Turn duration correlated with oculomotor function. Characteristics of the first saccade explained 48% and 58% of the variance in turn duration for 90 and 180 degree turns, respectively.\nTurning performance is impaired in PD and may be influenced by saccade dysfunction. An association between saccade function and turning performance may be indicative of the key role of saccades in initiating proper turning kinematics. Future work should focus on improving saccade performance during functional tasks and testing the effects of therapeutic interventions on related outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Mutations of PLA2G6 gene have been lately proposed to be the causative gene for PARK14 in patients with autosomal recessive young-onset parkinsonism (YOPD). The role of PLA2G6 mutations as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease is not clear. To study the PLA2G6 mutations in PARK14-linked patients and its association with the onset of sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD), sequencing and gene dosage analyses were carried out in 25 patients (onset age \u226630 years) then the identified variants were assessed in 956 sporadic PD (sPD) patients and 802 age-matched healthy controls. Four genetic variants were identified; one patient had homozygous c.991G > T (p.Asp331Tyr) mutation, two had compound heterozygous c.991G > T/c.1077G > A (p.Met358IlefsX) mutation, one had single c.1976A > G (p.Asn659Ser) mutation, and one patient had an exon 1 hetero-deletion. The c.1077G > A mutation resulted in a 4-bp deletion in leukocyte mRNA by activating a cryptic splice site in exon 7. Only p.Asp331Tyr was identified in four sPD patients and four controls. The onset age for PLA2G6 mutation carriers was younger than that for sPD (29.86 \u00b1 8.59 vs. 56.84 \u00b1 11.33 years, P = 0.0002). The analysis of previously reported PARK14 patients revealed that those who carried a truncated mutation tended to have a complicated phenotype and atrophies of cortex and cerebellum. In conclusion, PLA2G6 mutation was the second common genetic cause after PRKN mutation in our YOPD patients and might be a risk factor for early-onset PD in Han Chinese. Additionally, mutation data should be interpreted carefully because even a synonymous mutation could cause abnormal mRNA splicing.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to examine associations among serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D levels, vitamin D receptor polymorphisms, vitamin D binding protein gene polymorphisms, and the severity of Parkinson's disease. In 137 patients, the severity of Parkinson's disease was evaluated using Hoehn & Yahr stage and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Stage by neurologists and compared with 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D, vitamin D receptor polymorphisms, ie, FokI (rs10735810), BsmI (rs1544410), Cdx2 (rs11568820), ApaI (rs7976091), and TaqI (rs731236), and vitamin D binding protein gene polymorphisms GC1 (rs7041)/GC2 (rs4588) in a cross-sectional study. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were 21.1 \u00b1 9.0 ng/mL. Levels were deficient (<20 ng/mL) in 49% of patients. In contrast, 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were considered normal in all patients. Higher circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly associated with milder Parkinson's disease evaluated by Hoehn & Yahr stage (P = .002) and total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Stage (P = .004) even after multivariate adjustment for 8 covariates, including disease duration. However, significant associations were not observed in 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Under multivariate analysis with 25-hydroxyvitamin D as well as other 8 covariates including disease duration, carriers of vitamin D receptor FokICC genotype had a milder form of Parkinson's disease: odds ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.66, P = 0.002. These results suggest that higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the vitamin D receptor FokICC genotype may be independently associated with milder forms of Parkinson's disease. However, significant associations were not observed in 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia and the cerebellum have both emerged as important structures involved in the processing of temporal information.\nWe examined the roles of the cerebellum and striatum in predictive motor timing during a target interception task in healthy individuals (HC group; n = 21) and in patients with early Parkinson's disease (early stage PD group; n = 20) using functional magnetic resonance imaging.\nDespite having similar hit ratios, the PD failed more often than the HC to postpone their actions until the right moment and to adapt their behavior from one trial to the next. We found more activation in the right cerebellar lobule VI in HC than in early stage PD during successful trials. Successful trial-by-trial adjustments were associated with higher activity in the right putamen and lobule VI of the cerebellum in HC.\nWe conclude that both the cerebellum and striatum are involved in predictive motor timing tasks. The cerebellar activity is associated exclusively with the postponement of action until the right moment, whereas both the cerebellum and striatum are needed for successful adaptation of motor actions from one trial to the next. We found a general ''hypoactivation'' of basal ganglia and cerebellum in early stage PD relative to HC, indicating that even in early stages of the PD there could be functional perturbations in the motor system beyond striatum.",

    "abstract": "To examine the psychometric properties of six outcome measures in people with Parkinson disease (PD).\nTwenty-four participants completed the following twice within 2 weeks: the timed up-and-go test (TUG), Northwestern University Disability Scale (NUDS), Schwab & England ADL Scale (S&E), Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, PD Questionnaire-Short Form (PDQ 8), and Stanford Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6-Item Scale (SSE). Internal consistency, test-retest reliability (ICC[3,1]), and minimal detectable change (MDC) scores were calculated. Convergent and discriminant validity of the ABC were examined.\nCronbach's alpha scores for the NUDS, ABC, PDQ-8, and SSE were 0.47, 0.92, 0.72, and 0.91 respectively. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC[3,1]) for the TUG was 0.69 and could be improved by averaging two trials. ICCs for the NUDS, S&E, ABC, PDQ-8, and SSE were 0.56, 0.70, 0.79, 0.82, and 0.72 respectively. The ABC correlated with the TUG (r=-0.44, p=0.03) and with PDQ-8 (r(s)=0.51, p=0.01) and NUDS (r(s)=0.48, p=0.02) walking items. The ABC was able to discriminate between stages 1 and 3 of disease progression but not between stages 1 and 2, which suggests that the ABC can distinguish large differences in disease progression but cannot detect more subtle differences.\nHomogeneity of the ABC, PDQ-8, and SSE is good to excellent. Test-retest reliability scores of all measures except the NUDS are moderate to good. The ABC is a valid measure for use in PD. The MDC statistic may be useful for interpreting group score changes.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined the effectiveness of a training method to enhance balance in people with PD, which could potentially reduce their risk for falls. Specifically, we investigated whether the benefits of the self-controlled use of a physical assistance device for the learning of a balance task, found previously in healthy adults, would generalize to adults with PD. Twenty-eight individuals with PD were randomly assigned to one of two groups, a self-control and a yoked (control) group. The task required participants to stand on a balance platform (stabilometer), trying to keep the platform as close to horizontal as possible during each 30-s trial. In the self-control group, participants had a choice, on each of 10 practice trials, to use or not to use a balance pole. Participants in the yoked group received the same balance pole on the schedule used by their counterparts in the self-control group, but did not have a choice. Learning was assessed one day later by a retention test. The self-control group demonstrated more effective learning of the task than the yoked group. Questionnaire results indicated that self-control participants were more motivated to learn the task, were less nervous, and less concerned about their body movements relative to yoked participants. Possible reasons for the learning benefits of self-controlled practice, including a basic psychological need for autonomy, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the relationship between the presence and severity of depression and the degree of motor and functional disability in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nOne hundred twenty-two outpatients with PD were enrolled in a neurology department: 65 satisfied the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, Fourth Edition criteria for major depression, and 57 did not (PD-C). Depressive symptoms were assessed by means of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and the PD severity was assessed according to the Hoehn and Yahr System. Activities of daily living and motor symptoms were measured by the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), parts II and III.\nTwenty-nine patients had a mild depression (HRSD total score ranging between 8 and 17), 30 had a moderate depression (HRSD total score ranging between 18 and 24), and 6 had a severe depression (HRSD total score, \u226525). By comparing the 3 groups of patients, it emerged that those with a severe depression showed significantly higher scores at the UPDRS II, UPDRS III, and HY scales than did PD-C or patients with a mild depression. Moreover, patients with a moderate depression scored significantly higher on the UPDRS II, UPDRS III, and HY scales than did PD-C or those with a mild depression.\nOur findings suggest that depression and motor symptoms/well-being are highly intertwined in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Some of the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms commonly experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been attributed to gastroparesis; however, the precise prevalence and relevance of gastric emptying delay in PD is unclear. The definition of gastroparesis varies; currently the most widely accepted definition (from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium) is the presence of appropriate symptoms (including nausea, retching, vomiting, stomach fullness, and inability to finish a meal) for \u2265 12 weeks, together with delayed gastric emptying on scintigraphy and the absence of any obstructive lesions on upper GI endoscopy. In PD patients, gastroparesis has the potential to affect nutrition and quality of life, as well as the absorption of PD medications, including L-dopa. This reduced absorption of L-dopa has implications for the control of the PD motor symptoms for which it is administered. We performed a systematic review of the literature on gastroparesis in PD with the aim of developing an evidence-based approach to its management. Based on this review, we conclude that while gastric emptying has been reported to be frequently delayed in PD, the existing data do not permit definitive conclusions concerning its true prevalence, relationship to the underlying disease process, relevance to PD management, or the optimal therapy of related GI symptoms. Further study of these important issues is, therefore, required.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether sentence intelligibility improves in speakers with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) as a result of Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT). It was hypothesized that all the speakers would improve following treatment, in association with increased vocal loudness, which was the primary target of the treatment.\nProspective study of eight Speakers with PD using a single-blinded, randomized pre-post treatment design, with multiple daily assessments before and after treatment was carried out. Resultant data were corrected for regression to the mean.\nRandomized digital recordings of sentences produced by speakers with idiopathic PD before and after the treatment were presented to normal-hearing listeners with equalized intensity at conversational loudness in the presence of pink noise. Percentage of words understood was calculated before and after the treatment. Changes in overall vocal intensity were also analyzed.\nThere was a statistically significant group effect from pre-to-post voice treatment; however, there was also significant interaction of treatment with speakers. Six of the speakers with PD improved significantly following voice treatment, one exhibited no change, and one exhibited a decline in sentence intelligibility post-treatment.\nLSVT yielded significant improvement in sentence intelligibility for most speakers in the study but was not beneficial for two of the speakers despite the fact that they increased their overall vocal loudness.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by difficulty with the timing of movements. Data collected using the synchronization-continuation paradigm, an established motor timing paradigm, have produced varying results but with most studies finding impairment. Some of this inconsistency comes from variation in the medication state tested, in the inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) selected, and in changeable focus on either the synchronization (tapping in time with a tone) or continuation (maintaining the rhythm in the absence of the tone) phase. We sought to re-visit the paradigm by testing across four groups of participants: healthy controls, medication na\u00efve de novo PD patients, and treated PD patients both \"on\" and \"off\" dopaminergic medication. Four finger tapping intervals (ISI) were used: 250, 500, 1000, and 2000\u2009ms. Categorical predictors (group, ISI, and phase) were used to predict accuracy and variability using a linear mixed model. Accuracy was defined as the relative error of a tap, and variability as the deviation of the participant's tap from group predicted relative error. Our primary finding is that the treated PD group (PD patients \"on\" and \"off\" dopaminergic therapy) showed a significantly different pattern of accuracy compared to the de novo group and the healthy controls at the 250-ms interval. At this interval, the treated PD patients performed \"ahead\" of the beat whilst the other groups performed \"behind\" the beat. We speculate that this \"hastening\" relates to the clinical phenomenon of motor festination. Across all groups, variability was smallest for both phases at the 500-ms interval, suggesting an innate preference for finger tapping within this range. Tapping variability for the two phases became increasingly divergent at the longer intervals, with worse performance in the continuation phase. The data suggest that patients with PD can be best discriminated from healthy controls on measures of motor timing accuracy, rather than variability.",

    "abstract": "The specific neuromuscular mechanisms for compromised muscle strength with PD, and the improvement that occurs with medication, have not been clearly delineated. This study assessed knee extension and flexion strength of PD patients whilst on and off medication and examined the neural mechanisms responsible for any changes. Ten idiopathic PD patients were assessed whilst on and off medication (\u2265 12-h after drug withdrawal), \u223c 7 days apart. Isometric strength of the knee extensors and flexors was assessed, and the interpolated twitch technique used to measure activation of the knee extensors. Surface EMG was also used to measure neural drive to the agonists and antagonists. Without medication isometric strength of the knee extensors (7%) and flexors (11%) was impaired and the interpolated twitch technique revealed activation of the knee extensors was reduced (8%, P=0.005). Maximum agonist amplitudes for nkee extension and flexion were unchanged off-medication (0.59 P< 0.77). The agonist and antagonist EMG-force relationships, and the maximum antagonist EMG, were unaffected by medication withdrawal. The decrease in knee extension strength when PD patients were off medication was due to reduced activation of the agonist muscle, rather than any change in antagonist co-activation, and these changes were associated with reduced locomotory performance.",

    "abstract": "Many neurodegenerative diseases are increasing in prevalence and cannot be prevented or cured. If they shared common pathogenic mechanisms, treatments targeting such mechanisms might be of benefit in multiple conditions. The tau protein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Tau reduction prevents cognitive deficits, behavioral abnormalities and other pathological changes in multiple AD mouse models. Here we examined whether tau reduction also prevents motor deficits and pathological alterations in two mouse models of PD, generated by unilateral striatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or transgene-mediated neuronal expression of human wildtype \u03b1-synuclein. Both models were evaluated on Tau(+/+), Tau(+/-) and Tau(-/-) backgrounds in a variety of motor tests. Tau reduction did not prevent motor deficits caused by 6-OHDA and slightly worsened one of them. Tau reduction also did not prevent 6-OHDA-induced loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. Similarly, tau reduction did not prevent motor deficits in \u03b1-synuclein transgenic mice. Our results suggest that tau has distinct roles in the pathogeneses of AD and PD and that tau reduction may not be of benefit in the latter condition.",

    "abstract": "Impairments in executive functioning are frequently observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, executive functioning needed in daily life is difficult to measure. Considering this difficulty the Cognitive Effort Test (CET) was recently developed. In this multi-task test the goals are specified but participants are free in their approach. This study applies the CET in PD patients and investigates whether initiative, planning and multi-tasking are associated with aspects of executive functions and psychomotor speed. Thirty-six PD patients with a mild to moderate disease severity and thirty-four healthy participants were included in this study. PD patients planned and demonstrated more sequential task execution, which was associated with a decreased psychomotor speed. Furthermore, patients with a moderate PD planned to execute fewer tasks at the same time than patients with a mild PD. No differences were found between these groups for multi-tasking. In conclusion, PD patients planned and executed the tasks of the CET sequentially rather than in parallel presumably reflecting a compensation strategy for a decreased psychomotor speed. Furthermore, patients with moderate PD appeared to take their impairments into consideration when planning how to engage the tasks of the test. This compensation could not be detected in patients with mild PD.",

    "abstract": "Alterations occur within distal neuronal compartments, including axons and synapses, during the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). These changes could hold important implications for the functioning of neural networks, especially since research studies have shown a loss of dendritic spines locating to medium spiny projection neurons and impaired axonal transport in PD-affected brains. However, despite ever-increasing awareness of the vulnerability of synapses and axons, inadequate understanding of the independent mechanisms regulating non-somatic neurodegeneration prevails. This has resulted in limited therapeutic strategies capable of targeting these distinct cellular compartments. Deregulated protein synthesis, folding and degrading proteins, and protein quality-control systems have repeatedly been linked with morphological and functional alterations of synapses in the PD-affected brains. Here, we review current understanding concerning the proteins involved in structural and functional changes that affect synaptic contact-points in PD. The collection of studies discussed emphasizes the need for developing therapeutics aimed at deregulated protein synthesis and degradation pathways operating at axonal and dendritic synapses for preserving \"normal\" circuitry and function, for as long as possible.",

    "abstract": "Underreporting of adverse drug reactions is common but has been rarely studied in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTo compare the prevalence of adverse events (AEs) in relation to antiparkinsonian drugs in PD patients using two different data collection methods: patient's spontaneous reporting versus a predefined investigator-driven structured interview. Secondary objectives were to assess factors related to spontaneous reporting and to compare the rate of AE reporting in PD patients with that of a group of non-parkinsonian post-stroke patients.\nCross-sectional study.\nAmbulatory, cognitively intact PD or post-stroke outpatients.\nNone.\nPatients were first asked by means of an an open question to disclose any unpleasant effects in connection with their current medications that had occurred during the previous week. Afterwards, a predefined questionnaire listing the most common AEs known to be related to antiparkinsonian drugs was used to question the same patients in a systematic manner about the presence of any AE during the same week. Chronological and semiological criteria were used to classify the reported AEs as \"unrelated\" or \"possibly/plausibly related\" to the antiparkinsonian treatment.\nA total of 203 PD and 52 post-stroke patients of comparable age and sex were recruited. Eighty-five PD and five post-stroke patients reported spontaneously at least one AE (42 vs. 10%, p\u2009<\u20090.01), while 203 PD and 47 post-stroke patients reported at least one AE following the structured questionnaire (100 vs. 90%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In PD patients, there were a total of 112 spontaneously reported AEs as compared with 1,574 according to the structured questionnaire (7%). Spontaneous disclosure of AEs was associated with experiencing\u2009>2 AEs [OR\u2009=\u20091.2 (1.1-3.2)], logistic regression). Seventy-four percent of PD patients had \u22651 AE possibly/plausibly related to antiparkinsonian drugs.\nResults showed that only 7% of AEs were reported spontaneously by patients, thus underscoring the importance of systematically asking about AEs in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Microarray-derived transcriptomic studies in human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) samples from sporadic Parkinson's disease (SPD) cases have opened an avenue to concentrate on potential gene intersections or cross-talks along the dopaminergic (DAergic) neurodegenerative cascade in SPD. One emerging gene candidate identified by our group was SKP1A (p19, S-phase kinase-associated protein 1A), found significantly decreased in the SNpc. It is part of the SCF (Skp1, Cullin 1, F-box protein) complex, the largest class of sophisticated ubiquitin-proteasome/E3 ligases, and can directly interact with Fbxo7, a gene defective in PARK15-linked PD. In vitro target validation by viral-mediated RNA interference revealed that the deficiency of Skp1 in a mouse SN-derived DAergic neuronal cell line potentiated the damage caused by exogenous insults implicated in PD pathology and caused the death of neurons undergoing differentiation, which developed Lewy body-like, \u03b1-synuclein-positive inclusions preceding cell death. Furthermore, recent animal studies show that site-directed intranigral stereotaxic injections of lentiviruses targeting SKP1A induce pathological and behavioral deficits in mice, supporting a significant role of Skp1 in SN DAergic neuronal survival in SPD. Thus, strategies aimed at increasing the activity or content of Skp1 may represent a novel therapeutic approach that has the potential to treat PD.",

    "abstract": "Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound. It has been reported that RA possessed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Our previous study showed that RA could protect MES23.5 dopaminergic cells against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity in vitro. The purpose of this study was to explore the neuroreparative (neurorescue) effect of RA on 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) in vivo. In this study, the rats were given RA orally after intrastriatal 6-OHDA lesion. Results showed that the dopamine content in the striatum decreased and the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons reduced after 6-OHDA treatment. RA treatment after 6-OHDA administration could restore these changes. Further studies demonstrated that 6-OHDA treatment increased the iron-staining positive cells, which were markedly decreased by RA treatment. Moreover, RA suppressed the increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 at gene level induced by 6-OHDA. This indicates that the neurorescue effects of RA against 6-ODHA-induced degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system were achieved by decreasing nigral iron levels and regulating the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax gene expression.",

We examined the relation between apathy, anxiety, side of onset of motor symptoms, and cognition in PD. We hypothesized that PD patients would show different neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive profiles depending on the side of onset. 22 nondemented PD patients (11 right-side onset (RPD) with predominant left-hemisphere pathology, and 11 LPD) and 22 matched healthy controls (NC) were administered rating scales assessing apathy and anxiety, and a series of neuropsychological tests. PD patients showed a higher anxiety level than NC. There was a significant association between apathy, anxiety, and disease duration. In LPD, apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive function and visuospatial measures, whereas, in RPD, anxiety but not apathy correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks. Our findings demonstrated a differential association of apathy and anxiety to cognition in PD.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease represent a huge unmet medical need. The prevalence of both diseases is increasing, but the efficacy of treatment is still very limited due to various factors including the blood brain barrier (BBB). Drug delivery to the brain remains the major challenge for the treatment of all neurodegenerative diseases because of the numerous protective barriers surrounding the central nervous system. New therapeutic drugs that cross the BBB are critically needed for treatment of many brain diseases. One of the significant factors on neurotherapeutics is the constraint of the blood brain barrier and the drug release kinetics that cause peripheral serious side effects. Contrary to common belief, neurodegenerative and neurological diseases may be multisystemic in nature, and this presents numerous difficulties for their potential treatment. Overall, the aim of this paper is to summarize the last findings and news related to liposome technology in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and demonstrate the potential of this technology for the development of novel therapeutics and the possible applications of liposomes in the two most widespread neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) has received little attention to date and as such, there are currently very few treatment options available. The aim of the present study was to determine whether cognitive training might alleviate these cognitive symptoms and if so, whether such changes might be correlated with altered brain patterns. The performance of 10 PD patients and 10 paired healthy controls was assessed in a modified version of the Stroop task performed in association with functional magnetic resonance imaging, and half of the PD patients were given 6\u2009months of cognitive daily training based on Sudoku exercises. Results showed that the training program improved the cognitive performance in the Stroop test of the trained Parkinson's patients during MRI, specifically in terms of reaction time, and of correct and missing answers. Moreover, training provoked reduced cortical activation patterns with respect to untrained patients that were comparable to the patterns of activation observed in controls. Based on these findings, we propose that cognitive training can contribute significantly to save brain resources in PD patients, maybe by readdressing the imbalance caused by the alterations to inhibitory circuitry. Furthermore, these data strongly support the development and use of standardized cognitive training programs in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "We examined performance of healthy older and younger adults and individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) on digit cancellation, a task putatively sensitive to cognitive impairment, but possibly affected by visual impairment, particularly in contrast sensitivity. Critical contrast thresholds were established to create custom stimulus arrays that were proximally matched across individuals. Age- and PD-related differences in search were fully accounted for by the sensory deficit. Increased contrast benefited AD patients, but could not override cognitive impairment. We conclude that visually fair neuropsychological testing can effectively compensate for normal age- and PD-related visual changes that affect cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Maneb and paraquat are known to induce Parkinson's disease (PD) phenotype, however, caffeine offers neuroprotection. Nitric oxide (NO) acts an important mediator in PD phenotype and tyrosine kinase (TK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) are known to regulate its production. The present study aimed to elucidate the role of caffeine in the regulation of NO production and microglial activation and their subsequent contribution in dopaminergic neuroprotection. The animals were treated with caffeine and/or maneb and paraquat along with controls. In a few sets of experiments, the animals were also treated with aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an inhibitor of NF-kB, genistein, an inhibitor of TK or SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactivity and anti-integrin \u03b1M (OX-42) staining were performed to assess the number of dopaminergic neurons and activation of microglia, respectively. NO was measured in terms of nitrite, however, the expressions of p38 MAPK, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, NF-kB and TK were checked by western blot analyses. Maneb and paraquat induced the number of degenerating dopaminergic neurons, microglial cells, nitrite content, expressions of IL-1\u03b2, p38 MAPK, NF-kB and TK and caffeine co-treatment reduced the level of such alterations. Reductions were more pronounced in the animals co-treated with aminoguanidine, PDTC, genistein or SB202190. The results obtained thus demonstrate that caffeine down-regulates NO production, neuroinflammation and microglial activation, which possibly contribute to neuroprotection.",

Refer a patient with suspected Parkinson's disease (or parkinsonism) for diagnosis and treatment preferably to a neurologist with expertise in movement disorders. The treatment of Parkinson's disease is symptomatic; to date, there is no treatment that slows disease progression. The treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease and its related disorders involves collaboration of the neurologist, Parkinson's disease nurse and general practitioner. In addition to recognizing the hypokinetic-rigid syndrome, the general practitioner has a role in diagnosing and treating associated symptoms and disorders, and in supporting and counseling the patient and their partner or caregiver.",

    "abstract": "Brain stimulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) constitute promising clinical and research tools to investigate neural mechanisms underlying neurological and psychiatric diseases. They have enormous potential in modifying brain activity and subsequent function. However, it is still a matter of debate how either of these stimulation approaches operates to produce the clinical outcomes observed in patients. The combination of these techniques with functional neuroimaging is contributing significantly to disentangle the mechanisms through which brain stimulation affects neuronal activity and related networks. In the present review we outline the research done to date on the effects of DBS and TMS on motor, cognition and behaviour in Parkinson's disease (PD) with particular emphasis on neuroimaging.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the selective degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, continuing or permanent deficiency of dopamine, accretion of an abnormal form of alpha synuclein in the adjacent neurons, and dysregulation of ubiquitin proteasomal system, mitochondrial metabolism, permeability and integrity, and cellular apoptosis resulting in rigidity, bradykinesia, resting tremor, and postural instability. Melatonin, an indoleamine produced almost in all the organisms, has anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-oxidant nature. Experimental studies employing 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), methamphetamine, rotenone, and maneb and paraquat models have shown an enormous potential of melatonin in amelioration of the symptomatic features of PD. Although a few reviews published previously have described the multifaceted efficacy of melatonin against MPTP and 6-OHDA rodent models, due to development and validation of the newer models as well as the extensive studies on the usage of melatonin in entrenched PD models, it is worthwhile to bring up to date note on the usage of melatonin as a neuroprotective agent in PD. This article presents an update on the usage and applications of melatonin in PD models along with incongruous observations. The impending implications in the clinics, success, limitations, and future prospective have also been discussed in this article.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) have recently identified a new susceptibility locus GAK (PARK17) (rs1564282 variant) in subjects of European ancestry. Its role in other races is still unclear. The potential differences of the clinical characteristics between carriers and non-carriers have not been examined in detail. Using a case-control methodology, we analyzed the GAK rs1564282 variant in an ethnic Han Chinese population and conducted a meta-analysis combining our result and available published data. A total of 1,574 ethnic Han Chinese study subjects comprising 812 sporadic PD patients and 762 control individuals were included. The minor allele frequency was significantly different at SNP rs1564282 between the cases and the controls (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.09, 1.69, P = 0.007) in the overall PD population. Subjects with CT + TT genotypes have an increased risk (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.72, P = 0.017) compared to those with CC genotype. A meta-analysis revealed that the frequency of carrier's genotypes was significantly higher in PD than in control subjects (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.19, 1.44, P < 0.00001). The gender, age of onset, Hoehn-Yahr stage and UPDRS scores and clinical features were similar between carriers and non-carriers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the rs1564282 variant in GAK (PARK17) increases the risk of PD in Han Chinese patients from mainland China and the meta-analysis with European populations revealed a similar finding. However, carriers cannot be distinguished from non-carriers based on their clinical features or motor severity. Functional studies of GAK to unravel its role in the pathophysiologic pathway of PD will be useful.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits may contribute to falls in Parkinson's disease (PD) and these deficits may be risk factors for falls. However, their association with falls has been generally studied in patients with continuous gait problems. There have been few studies in PD patients without postural instability. In addition, the effectiveness of various simple bedside cognitive tests in predicting falls has not been established. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of three bedside cognitive tests in consecutive patients with PD without postural instability. Of the 119 patients, 39 experienced falls during the follow-up period. Of the bedside cognitive assessment methods examined, only the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was significantly lower in the group of fallers than in the group of non-fallers. This result suggests that the MoCA is effective as a bedside test for evaluating the risk of falls.",

    "abstract": "Both genetic and environmental factors trigger risks of and protection from Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative syndrome, but possible inter-relationships between these risk and protection processes were not yet explored. By examining gene expression changes in the brains of mice under multiple treatments that increase or attenuate PD symptoms we detected underlying disease and protection-associated genes and pathways. In search for potential links between these different genes and pathways, we conducted meta-analysis on 131 brain region transcriptomes from mice over-expressing native or mutated \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) with or without the protective HSP70 chaperone, or exposed to the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), with or without the protective acetylcholinesterase (AChE-R) variant. All these models showed shared risk-inducible and protection-suppressible transcript modifications. Self-organized map (SOM) classification revealed risk- and protection-associated alterations in nuclear and mitochondrial metal ion-regulated transcripts, respectively; Gene Ontology based analysis validated these pathways. To complement this approach, and identify potential outcome damages, we further searched for shared functional enrichments in the lists of genes detected in young SNCA mutant or in old SNCA mutants and MPTP-exposed mice. This post-hoc functional analysis identified early-onset changes in Parkinsonian, immune and alternative splicing pathways which shifted into late-onset or exposure-associated NFkB-mediated neuro-inflammation. Our study suggests metal ions-mediated cross-talk between nuclear and mitochondrial pathways by both environmental and genetic risk and protective factors involved in Parkinson's disease, which eventually culminates in neuro-inflammation. Together, these findings offer new insights and novel targets for therapeutic interference with the gene-environment interactions underlying sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "Environmental enrichment has been shown to be both neuroprotective and neurorestorative in 1-methyl-2-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse models of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, whether social interaction or novel physical stimulation is responsible for this recovery is controversial. In the current study, we have investigated the effects of only social enrichment (SocE) in progressively MPTP-lesioned mice. After mice were lesioned using a progressively increased dose (4 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg, 16 mg/kg and 32 mg/kg; each dose daily for 5 days), the MPTP-induced behavioral deficits, after the 32 mg/kg dose, were reversed with acute L-DOPA. This acute behavioral recovery suggests that this progressive MPTP-induced neurodegeneration is an appropriate murine model of PD. Mice were housed four per cage for the first 2 weeks of progressive lesioning or vehicle treatment. After the 8 mg/kg MPTP dose (prior to SocE intervention) mice showed a significant decrease in rearing and foot fault behaviors (FF/BB) compared to the vehicle group. Additionally, there was a 38% decrease in mean number of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH-ir) substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) neurons/section, and a 50% decrease in the optical density of TH-ir dorsolateral caudate putamen (CPu) terminals compared to the vehicle group. Mice were then housed either two (socially limited environment; SLE) or twelve (SocE) mice per cage during continued MPTP lesioning for the next 2 weeks at 16 mg/kg and 32 mg/kg MPTP. MPTP treatment was then discontinued, while mice remained in the SLE or SocE cages for an additional week. Rearing behavior was further impaired in SLE-MPTP mice following progressive MPTP, accompanied by additional decreases in the mean number of TH-ir SNpc neurons/section and CPu TH-ir terminals. CPu TH and dopamine transporter (DAT) protein expression, as well as dopamine tissue and TH protein levels was significantly decreased compared to either vehicle group. However, the deficit in rearing behavior in SLE-MPTP mice was reversed with acute L-DOPA following the intervention period. SocE-MPTP mice showed rearing and FF/BB behaviors similar to vehicle levels, although FF/BB was not significantly different from pre-intervention levels. The reversal from pre-intervention rearing deficits was correlated with an attenuated decrease in the mean number of SNpc TH-ir neurons/section and CPu TH and DAT protein, and with a blocked decrease in CPu TH-ir terminals compared to pre-intervention levels. Our findings show that SocE mice not only resist further nigrostriatal lesioning and FF/BB deficit, but rearing behavior is recovered to the level of the vehicle group despite continued MPTP treatment. In contrast, SLE mice showed continued loss of nigrostriatal TH-ir and decline of motor behaviors with progressive MPTP. The data suggest that non-pharmacological intervention that started at an early stage of dopamine loss is effective at slowing or blocking further nigrostriatal degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Depression occurs in around 35% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and is often persistent. Symptoms of depression can be evident in individuals at the time of diagnosis and might develop in the premotor stage of the disease. The underlying mechanisms of depression in PD are not known in detail, but changes in brain structure, signaling by neurotransmitters, and levels of inflammatory and neurotrophic factors are all suggested to contribute to its development. Psychosocial factors and pain could also have roles in depression. Changes in dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems in patients with PD might help to explain the incidence of depression in these individuals. Antidepressants that have dual serotonergic and noradrenergic effects are the drugs of choice for treating depression in PD. However, antiparkinsonian drugs might have beneficial effects not only on the motor symptoms of disease, but also on a patient's mood. Deep brain stimulation can worsen depression in some patients, but a preliminary study has suggested that transcranial magnetic stimulation could improve symptoms of depression. This Review describes the frequency and course of depression in patients with PD. The mechanisms that underlie depression in this disease are also discussed, and the management strategies for these patients are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Modeling Parkinson's disease remains a major challenge for preclinical researchers, as existing models fail to reliably recapitulate all of the classic features of the disease, namely, the progressive emergence of a bradykinetic motor syndrome with underlying nigrostriatal \u03b1-synuclein protein accumulation and nigrostriatal neurodegeneration. One limitation of the existing models is that they are normally induced by a single neuropathological insult, whereas the human disease is thought to be multifactorial with genetic and environmental factors contributing to the disease pathogenesis. Thus, in order to develop a more relevant model, we sought to determine if administration of the Parkinson's disease-associated pesticide, rotenone, into the substantia nigra of rats overexpressing the Parkinson's disease-associated protein, \u03b1-synuclein, could reliably model the triad of classic features of the human disease. To do so, rats underwent stereotaxic surgery for unilateral delivery of the adeno-associated virus (AAV)-\u03b1-synuclein into the substantia nigra. This was followed 13 weeks later by delivery of rotenone into the same site. The effect of the genetic and environmental insults alone or in combination on lateralised motor performance (Corridor, Stepping, and Whisker Tests), nigrostriatal integrity (tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry), and \u03b1-synucleinopathy (\u03b1-synuclein immunohistochemistry) was assessed. We found that rats treated with either AAV-\u03b1-synuclein or rotenone developed significant motor dysfunction with underlying nigrostriatal neurodegeneration. However, when the genetic and environmental insults were sequentially administered, the detrimental impact of the combined insults on motor performance and nigrostriatal integrity was significantly greater than the impact of either insult alone. This indicates that sequential exposure to relevant genetic and environmental insults is a valid approach to modeling human Parkinson's disease in the rat.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether attentional resources are involved in swallowing in persons with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, and if so, in which phase(s) of swallowing. The approach involved a dual-task, reaction time (RT) paradigm using ten participants with Parkinson's disease. Single-task baseline measures were obtained for durations of the anticipatory phase and oropharyngeal phase of swallowing and RTs were obtained for nonword auditory stimuli. A dual-task then required participants to swallow 5\u00a0ml of water from an 8-oz. cup while listening for a target nonword presented auditorily during the anticipatory or oropharyngeal phase. Target stimuli were randomized across baseline and dual-task trials. Durations of the anticipatory and oropharyngeal phases of swallowing and RTs during baseline and dual-task trials were determined. Results showed a nonsignificant change in speed of completion for both the anticipatory phase and the oropharyngeal phase of swallowing during dual-task trials. However, there was a statistically significant increase in RT during the anticipatory phase during the dual-task condition. RT during the oropharyngeal phase remained unaffected. Given a need for additional research using more complex competing tasks, these data on attention are consistent with earlier claims of an automatic, nonresource-demanding, oropharyngeal swallowing mechanism that is preserved for persons with early-to-mid-stage Parkinson's disease. Clinical implications of these data suggest that disruptive environmental stimuli to individuals with early-to-mid-stage Parkinson's disease may alter feeding but have little effect on the oropharyngeal swallow.",

    "abstract": "In this work we present a method based on partial decision trees and association rules for the prediction of Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms. The proposed method is part of the PERFORM system. PERFORM is used for the treatment of PD patients and even advocate specific combinations of medications. The approach presented in this paper is included in the data miner module of PERFORM. A patient performs some initial examinations and the module predicts the future occurrence of the symptoms based on the initial examinations and medications taken. Using the method, the expert can prescribe specific medications that will not cause, or postpone the appearance of specific symptoms to the patient. The approach employed is able to provide interpretation for the predictions made, by providing rules. The models have been developed and evaluated using real patient's data and the respective results are reported. Another functionality of the data miner module is the extraction of rules through a user friendly interface using association rule mining algorithms. These rules can be used for the prediction analysis of patient's reaction to certain treatment plans. The accuracy of the symptoms' prediction ranges from 57.1 to 77.4%, depending on the symptom.",

    "abstract": "To estimate the age-specific incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) in elderly persons in the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC). All-cause and injury mortalities and relative risk of death for those persons with PD were also examined.\nA historical cohort study was conducted using 5 provincial administrative databases from 1991/92 to 2000/2001. A series of algorithms based on the databases were created for case ascertainment of PD for persons 65 years or older. Crude and age-specific incidence and mortality rates were calculated using person-years of follow-up as the denominator. The impact of PD on all-cause and injury mortalities was examined using multivariate Cox regression models to provide adjusted hazard ratios.\n10,910 incidence cases over 6,051,682 person-years of follow-up were identified. The crude annual incidence rate was 252 per 100,000 person-years. Over the nine year period, age standardized incidence for males ranged from 207 to 396 per 100,000 person-years and 127 to 259 per 100,000 person-years for females. Persons with PD were at a 43% greater risk of all-cause mortality and specifically, 51% greater risk of injury mortality.\nIncidence of PD is substantially higher in advanced age with age adjusted increases for both all-cause and injury mortalities. These findings also highlight falls as a primary factor for injury mortality in PD.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to investigate the neuroprotective effects of rutin (vitamin P) on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) in rats. Oxidative stress and inflammation is an important event, play a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases. Rutin has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, and thus was tested for its beneficial effects using 6-OHDA-induced PD rat model. Male Wistar rats were pre-treated with rutin (25\u00a0mg/kg bwt, orally) for 3\u00a0weeks and subjected to unilateral intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA (10\u00a0\u03bcg in 0.1% ascorbic acid in normal saline). Three weeks after 6-OHDA infusion, rats were tested for neurobehavioral activity, and were killed after 4\u00a0weeks of 6-OHDA infusion for the estimation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, glutathione, and its dependent enzymes (glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase), dopamine (DA) and its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid. The increase in 6-OHDA-induced rotations and deficits in locomotor activity and motor coordination and decrease in antioxidant level, DA content and its metabolite and increase in the number of dopaminergic D2 receptors in striatum were protected significantly with lesioned group pre-treated with rutin. These findings were further supported by the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings in the substantia nigra that showed that rutin protected neurons from deleterious effects of 6-OHDA. These results suggest that the consumption of rutin, which is novel vitamin, may have the possibility of protective effect against the neurological disorder such as PD.",

Paired t-tests were used to compare initial imaging target coordinates versus final electrode coordinates based on intraoperative MER. United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores pre-operatively (medication off) and at 6 months post-operatively (medication off, stimulation on) and daily levodopa equivalents preoperatively and 6 months post-operatively were analyzed.\nThe mean difference between calculated imaging target and final electrophysiological target was 3 mm (SD + 1.53 mm; p < 0.0001) in the dorsal-ventral plane and 1.2 mm the axial plane, resulting in a calculated final electrophysiology-based target adjustment of 3.4 mm (SD = 1.4 mm). Patients' average daily levodopa equivalent dose dropped by 52% at six months post-operatively (SD=40.9; p = 0.002).

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) traditionally has been defined by its characteristic motor hallmarks, but non-motor features such as cognitive impairment and dementia are increasingly recognized as part of PD. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common in non-demented PD patients, occurring in about 20-50%. Frequency estimates and clinical features of mild cognitive impairment in PD (PD-MCI), however, vary across studies due to methodological differences and lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for PD-MCI. Overall, PD-MCI patients exhibit nonamnestic deficits in cognitive domains such as executive function, attention, and visuospatial function; however, the cognitive phenotype of PD-MCI is heterogeneous with some patients demonstrating greater amnestic deficits. PD-MCI patients, particularly those with posterior cortical profiles, may be at high risk for developing dementia. Various biomarkers studied in PD-MCI including cerebrospinal fluid, genetic analyses, and neuroimaging suggest that there may be distinct PD-MCI profiles. Future studies using uniform PD-MCI diagnostic criteria and incorporating biomarkers and longitudinal follow-up of PD-MCI cohorts are needed to understand PD-MCI as a transitional state between normal cognition and dementia.",

    "abstract": "The expression of clock genes is altered in leukocytes from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. To determine whether abnormal CpG methylation contributes to the dysregulated expression of these genes, the methylation status of the promoters of seven major human clock genes, PER1, PER2, CRY1, CRY2, Clock, NPAS2, and BMAL1, was examined using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and sequencing in 206 PD patients and 181 healthy controls. This analysis revealed that most clock gene promoters were devoid of methylation. Methylation was only detectable in the CRY1 and NPAS2 promoters. Interestingly, the methylation frequency of the NPAS2 promoter was significantly decreased in PD patients. These results suggest that altered promoter methylation may contribute to the abnormal expression of clock genes in PD.",

    "abstract": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) are clinically difficult to differentiate from idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in the early stages of the disease. Previous reports indicated that the olfactory function is relatively intact or slightly reduced in patients with PSP and MSA-P, suggesting that the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J), which is a short and simple noninvasive test that is potentially useful clinically for detecting early-stage PD in Japan, may be useful in the differential diagnosis of early-stage PD from MSA-P and PSP. There is no information on the sensitivity and specificity of OSIT-J in the diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes such as PSP and MSA-P.\nWe assessed the olfactory function using the OSIT-J test in 94 Japanese patients with idiopathic PD, 15 with MSA-P, 7 with PSP, and 29 age-matched control subjects.\nThe mean \u00b1 SD score of OSIT-J in patients with PD (4.4 \u00b1 2.9) was significantly lower than in patients with MSA-P (8.7 \u00b1 2.2, P < 0.0001), PSP (7.6 \u00b1 2.2, P < 0.0057), and control subjects (10.5 \u00b1 1.3, P < 0.0001). The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to discriminate PD from normal control using OSIT-J scores was 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.00), from MSA-P 0.87 (0.80-0.95), and from PSP 0.81 (0.66-0.96).\nThe OSIT-J is a potentially useful clinical test not only for detection of olfactory deficit in PD but also for differentiating PD from MSA-P and PSP.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is an early 'pre-clinical' sign of Parkinson's disease (PD). The present review is a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of such dysfunction in PD and related disorders. The olfactory bulb is implicated in the dysfunction, since only those syndromes with olfactory bulb pathology exhibit significant smell loss. The role of dopamine in the production of olfactory system pathology is enigmatic, as overexpression of dopaminergic cells within the bulb's glomerular layer is a common feature of PD and most animal models of PD. Damage to cholinergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic systems is likely involved, since such damage is most marked in those diseases with the most smell loss. When compromised, these systems, which regulate microglial activity, can influence the induction of localized brain inflammation, oxidative damage, and cytosolic disruption of cellular processes. In monogenetic forms of PD, olfactory dysfunction is rarely observed in asymptomatic gene carriers, but is present in many of those that exhibit the motor phenotype. This suggests that such gene-related influences on olfaction, when present, take time to develop and depend upon additional factors, such as those from aging, other genes, formation of \u03b1-synuclein- and tau-related pathology, or lowered thresholds to oxidative stress from toxic insults. The limited data available suggest that the physiological determinants of the early changes in PD-related olfactory function are likely multifactorial and may include the same determinants as those responsible for a number of other non-motor symptoms of PD, such as dysautonomia and sleep disturbances.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often present with orthostatic hypotension (OH) as a result of the dysautonomia associated with the disease or as a side effect of the dopaminergic medications used to treat the disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in motor and cognitive function in patients with PD with and without OH. Forty-four patients with a diagnosis of PD were evaluated and stratified by the presence of OH based on orthostatic blood pressure recordings. Both groups underwent assessments of motor and cognitive function. OH was present in 17 of 44 patients (39%) with PD. These patients with OH had significantly lower scores in gross motor, balance, and cognitive function (p < .05). No significant difference between groups was found in the finger tapping scores. These results suggest that patients with PD should be routinely screened for OH as it commonly occurs and may negatively impact gross motor, balance, and cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease often have walking difficulty, and this is likely to be exacerbated while walking in places in the community, where people are likely to face greater and more varied challenges. This study aims to understand the facilitators and the barriers to walking in the community perceived by people with Parkinson's disease. This qualitative study involved 5 focus groups (n = 34) of people with Parkinson's disease and their partners residing in metropolitan and rural regions in Queensland, Australia. Results found that people with PD reported to use internal personal strategies as facilitators to community walking, but identified primarily external factors, particularly the environmental factors as barriers. The adoption of strategies or the use of facilitators allows people with Parkinson's disease to cope so that participants often did not report disability.",

    "abstract": "There is research evidence that exercise and motor training are beneficial for people with Parkinson's disease (PD), and clinicians seek to implement optimal programs. This paper summarizes important factors about the nature and reporting of randomized controlled trials of exercise and/or motor training for people with PD which are likely to influence the translation of research into clinical practice. Searches identified 53 relevant trials with 90 interventions conducted for an average duration of 8.3 (SD 4.2) weeks. Most interventions were fully supervised (74%) and conducted at a facility (79%). Retention rates were high with 69% of interventions retaining \u226585% of their participants; however adherence was infrequently reported, and 72% of trials did not report adverse events. Overall, the labor-intensive nature of most interventions tested in these trials and the sparse reporting of adherence and adverse events are likely to pose difficulties for therapists attempting to balance benefits and costs when selecting protocols that translate to sustainable clinical practice for people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Both efficacy and clinical feasibility deserve consideration in translation of research outcomes. This study evaluated the feasibility of rehabilitation programs within the context of a large randomized controlled trial of physical therapy. Ambulant participants with Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 210) were randomized into three groups: (1) progressive strength training (PST); (2) movement strategy training (MST); or (3) control (\"life skills\"). PST and MST included fall prevention education. Feasibility was evaluated in terms of safety, retention, adherence, and compliance measures. Time to first fall during the intervention phase did not differ across groups, and adverse effects were minimal. Retention was high; only eight participants withdrew during or after the intervention phase. Strong adherence (attendance >80%) did not differ between groups (P = .435). Compliance in the therapy groups was high. All three programs proved feasible, suggesting they may be safely implemented for people with PD in community-based clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), both the patient and the health care provider look for ways to preserve the patient's quality of life. Many studies focus on the impact of depression and motor disability on poor life quality but neglect to examine the role of anxiety. We investigated the impact of anxiety and depression on health-related quality of life in PD, using the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life measure (PDQ-39). Symptoms of anxiety, more than depression, cognitive status, or motor stage, significantly affected quality of life in 38 nondemented patients with mild-to-moderate motor disability. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that anxiety explained 29% of the variance in the PDQ-39 sum score, and depression explained 10% of the variance beyond that accounted for by anxiety. The findings suggest that primary management of anxiety as well as depression may be important to optimizing the quality of life of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Since turning is often impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may lead to falls, it is important to develop targeted treatment strategies for turning. We determined the effects of rotating treadmill training on turning in individuals with PD. This randomized controlled study evaluated 180\u00b0 in-place turns, functional turning (timed-up-and-go), and gait velocity before and after 15 minutes of rotating treadmill training or stepping in place in 26 people with PD and 27 age-matched controls. A subset of participants with PD (n = 3) completed five consecutive days of rotating treadmill training. Fast as possible gait velocity, timed-up-and-go time, 180\u00b0 turn duration, and steps to turn 180\u00b0 were impaired in PD compared to controls (P < 0.05) and did not improve following either intervention (P > 0.05). Preferred pace gait velocity and timing of yaw rotation onset of body segments (head, trunk, pelvis) during 180\u00b0 turns were not different in PD (P > 0.05) and did not change following either intervention. No improvements in gait or turning occurred after five days of rotating treadmill training, compared to one day. The rotating treadmill is not recommended for short-term rehabilitation of impaired in-place turning in the general PD population.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Current treatments for PD focus on dopaminergic therapies, including L-dopa and dopamine receptor agonists. However, these treatments induce neuropsychiatric side effects. Psychosis, characterized by delusions and hallucinations, is one of the most serious such side effects. Adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonism is a nondopaminergic treatment for PD with clinical and preclinical efficacy. The present studies assessed A(2A) antagonists SCH 412348 and istradefylline in rodent prepulse inhibition (PPI), a model of psychosis. Dopamine receptor agonists pramipexole (0.3-3\u2009mg/kg), pergolide (0.3-3\u2009mg/kg), and apomorphine (0.3-3\u2009mg/kg) significantly disrupted PPI; ropinirole (1-30\u2009mg/kg) had no effect; L-dopa (100-300\u2009mg/kg) disrupted rat but not mouse PPI. SCH 412348 (0.3-3\u2009mg/kg) did not disrupt rodent PPI; istradefylline (0.1-1\u2009mg/kg) marginally disrupted mouse but not rat PPI. These results suggest that A(2A) antagonists, unlike dopamine agonists, have an improved neuropsychiatric side effect profile.",

    "abstract": "Motor learning has been found to occur in the rehabilitation of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Through repetitive structured practice of motor tasks, individuals show improved performance, confirming that motor learning has probably taken place. Although a number of studies have been completed evaluating motor learning in people with PD, the sample sizes were small and the improvements were variable. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine the ability of people with PD to learn motor tasks. Studies which measured movement time in upper extremity reaching tasks and met the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. Results of the meta-analysis indicated that people with PD and neurologically healthy controls both demonstrated motor learning, characterized by a decrease in movement time during upper extremity movements. Movement time improvements were greater in the control group than in individuals with PD. These results support the findings that the practice of upper extremity reaching tasks is beneficial in reducing movement time in persons with PD and has important implications for rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment and behavioural disorders are often encountered in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). A simple PD-related frontostriatal cognitive dysfunction (PDFCD) staging is proposed. Executive dysfunction and mental fatigue (stage I), depression/anxiety (stage IIa), apathy/pain (stage IIb), and dementia (stage III) reflect a sequential process of dopamine depletion occurring in different regions of the striatum (stages I and II) and the frontal cortex (stage III). In addition to these nonmotor manifestations present in the unmedicated (OFF) state, the PDFCD model also predicts a number of complications related to dopaminergic treatment (ON state), from impulse control disorders (stages I and IIa) to hallucinations (stage IIb) and psychosis (stage III). Although the model admittedly needs further refinements, it provides a framework for hypothesis testing and may help clinicians optimize therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. We analyzed the ability of four balance assessments to predict falls in people with Parkinson Disease (PD) prospectively over six and 12 months. Materials and Methods. The BESTest, Mini-BESTest, Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) were administered to 80 participants with idiopathic PD at baseline. Falls were then tracked for 12 months. Ability of each test to predict falls at six and 12 months was assessed using ROC curves and likelihood ratios (LR). Results. Twenty-seven percent of the sample had fallen at six months, and 32% of the sample had fallen at 12 months. At six months, areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for the tests ranged from 0.8 (FGA) to 0.89 (BESTest) with LR+ of 3.4 (FGA) to 5.8 (BESTest). At 12 months, AUCs ranged from 0.68 (BESTest, BBS) to 0.77 (Mini-BESTest) with LR+ of 1.8 (BESTest) to 2.4 (BBS, FGA). Discussion. The various balance tests were effective in predicting falls at six months. All tests were relatively ineffective at 12 months. Conclusion. This pilot study suggests that people with PD should be assessed biannually for fall risk.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews the therapeutically beneficial effects of progressive resistance exercise (PRE) on Parkinson's disease (PD). First, this paper discusses the rationale for PRE in PD. Within the first section, the review discusses the central mechanisms that underlie bradykinesia and muscle weakness, highlights findings related to the central changes that accompany PRE in healthy individuals, and extends these findings to individuals with PD. It then illustrates the hypothesized positive effects of PRE on nigro-striatal-thalamo-cortical activation and connectivity. Second, it reviews recent findings of the use of PRE in individuals with PD. Finally, knowledge gaps of using PRE on individuals with PD are discussed along with suggestions for future research.",

    "abstract": "We assessed degree of Parkinson disease motor symptom improvement with medication among subjects enrolled in an ongoing, population-based study in Central California. The motor section of the unified Parkinson disease rating scale (UPDRS) was performed on subjects in both OFF and ON medication states, and difference between these scores was used as an indicator of symptomatic benefit. Higher OFF minus ON scores correlated with more severe baseline symptoms. There was equivalent improvement on the motor UPDRS scale for subjects divided according to medication classes used: levodopa alone 7.3 points, levodopa plus other medications 8.5 points, and dopamine agonists but not levodopa 6.1 points. In addition, there was no difference in the magnitude of improvement when subjects were divided according to Parkinson disease subtype, defined as tremor dominant, akinetic-rigid, or mixed. In this community-based sample, these values are within the range of a clinically important difference as defined by previous studies.",

Although fatigue is recognized to significantly affect health-related quality of life, it remains underrecognised and empirically treated. In this paper, the prevalence of fatigue as measured by a validated visual analogue scale and the Parkinson's disease nonmotor symptoms scale (PDNMSS) was correlated with other motor and nonmotor comorbidities. In a cohort of patients from a range of disease stages, occurrence of fatigue correlated closely with more advanced Parkinson's disease, as well as with depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders, hinting at a common underlying basis.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have suggested an increased frequency of variants in the gene encoding angiogenin (ANG) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Interestingly, a few ALS patients carrying ANG variants also showed signs of Parkinson disease (PD). Furthermore, relatives of ALS patients have an increased risk to develop PD, and the prevalence of concomitant motor neuron disease in PD is higher than expected based on chance occurrence. We therefore investigated whether ANG variants could predispose to both ALS and PD.\nWe reviewed all previous studies on ANG in ALS and performed sequence experiments on additional samples, which allowed us to analyze data from 6,471 ALS patients and 7,668 controls from 15 centers (13 from Europe and 2 from the USA). We sequenced DNA samples from 3,146 PD patients from 6 centers (5 from Europe and 1 from the USA). Statistical analysis was performed using the variable threshold test, and the Mantel-Haenszel procedure was used to estimate odds ratios.\nAnalysis of sequence data from 17,258 individuals demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of ANG variants in both ALS and PD patients compared to control subjects (p = 9.3 \u00d7 10(-6) for ALS and p = 4.3 \u00d7 10(-5) for PD). The odds ratio for any ANG variant in patients versus controls was 9.2 for ALS and 6.7 for PD.\nThe data from this multicenter study demonstrate that there is a strong association between PD, ALS, and ANG variants. ANG is a genetic link between ALS and PD.",

Outside of large-center studies, little is known about trends in DBS use in the USA.\nWe employ the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to look at changes in DBS utilization over time.\nWe identified all individuals with PD (332.0) and essential tremor (ET) (333.1) who underwent DBS (02.93) from 1998 to 2007. We examined demographics, hospital status, comorbidities, and in-hospital systemic/technical complications. DBS patients from 2000 and 2007 were compared using \u03c7(2) tests.\nPD patients from the 2007 sample who underwent DBS were older (p = 0.01). Both ET and PD patients had significantly more comorbidities in 2007 (p < 0.001). In-hospital complications decreased from 3.8 to 2.8%. DBS was performed in medium- or high-volume centers in 70% of cases in 2000 and in 50% in 2007. In all groups, a majority of cases (range 65-71%) underwent DBS at hospitals in the western and southern USA.\nPatients who underwent DBS in the 2007 sample were older and had more comorbidities than those in the 2000 sample; in-hospital complications remained low. Understanding trends in DBS is helpful in assessing how the technology is adopted and what relationships should be further explored.",

    "abstract": "This review summarizes the effects of neuroinflammatory stress on the subventricular zone (SVZ), where new neurons are constitutively produced in the adult brain, especially focusing on the relation with Parkinson's disease (PD), because the SVZ is under the control of dopaminergic afferents from the substantia nigra (SN). In Lewy bodies-positive-PD, microglia is known to phagocytoze aggregated \u03b1-synuclein, resulting in the release of inflammatory cytokines. The neurogenesis in the SVZ should be affected in PD brain by the neuroinflammatory process. The administration of lipopolysaccaharide is available as an alternative model for microglia-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons and also the impairment of stem cell maintenance. Therefore, the research on the neuroinflammatory process in the SVZ gives us a hint to prevent the outbreak of PD or at least slow the disease process.",

    "abstract": "Mildronate (3-[2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium] propionate dihydrate) traditionally is a well-known cardioprotective drug. However, our recent studies convincingly demonstrated its neuroprotective properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of mildronate on the expression of proteins that are involved in the differentiation and survival of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in the rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). The following biomarkers were used: heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70, a molecular chaperone), glial cell line-derived nerve growth factor (GDNF, a growth factor promoting neuronal differentiation, regeneration, and survival), and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM).\nPD was modeled by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilateral intrastriatal injection in rats. Mildronate was administered at doses of 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg for 2 weeks intraperitoneally before 6-OHDA injection. Rat brains were dissected on day 28 after discontinuation of mildronate injections. The expression of biomarkers was assessed immunohistochemically and by western blot assay.\n6-OHDA decreased the expression of Hsp70 and GDNF in the lesioned striatum and substantia nigra, whereas in mildronate-pretreated (20 and 50 mg/kg) rats, the expression of Hsp70 and GDNF was close to the control group values. NCAM expression also was decreased by 6-OHDA in the striatum and it was totally protected by mildronate at a dose of 50 mg/kg. In contrast, in the substantia nigra, 6-OHDA increased the expression of NCAM, while mildronate pretreatment (20 and 50 mg/kg) reversed the 6-OHDA-induced overexpression of NCAM close to the control values.\nThe obtained data showed that mildronate was capable to regulate the expression of proteins that play a role in the homeostasis of neuro-glial processes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in the loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. The etiology of this cell loss is unknown, but it involves abnormalities in mitochondrial function. In this study, we have demonstrated that the administration of a novel noncoding p137 RNA, derived from the human cytomegaloviral \u03b22.7 transcript, can prevent and rescue dopaminergic cell death in vitro and in animal models of PD by protecting mitochondrial Complex I activity. Furthermore, as this p137 RNA is fused to a rabies virus glycoprotein peptide that facilitates delivery of RNA across the blood-brain barrier, such protection can be achieved through a peripheral intravenous administration of this agent after the initiation of a dopaminergic lesion. This approach has major implications for the potential treatment of PD, especially given that this novel agent could have the same protective effect on all diseased neurons affected as part of this disease process, not just the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway.",

    "abstract": "Apathy, defined as decreased goal-directed activity, has been observed in Parkinson's disease. A number of cognitive/psychiatric features have been documented in essential tremor, yet we are unaware of studies of apathy.\nUsing the Apathy Evaluation Scale (range = 18-72 [more apathy]), we compared 79 essential tremor cases, 20 dystonia cases, and 39 Parkinson's disease cases with 80 normal controls.\nThe score of the Apathy Evaluation Scale was higher in essential tremor, dystonia, and Parkinson's disease cases than controls (all P \u2264 .04). Parkinson's disease cases had the highest scores. Analyses stratified by presence/absence of depressive symptoms indicated the presence of a group of apathetic but nondepressed cases.\nPatients with Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia had elevated apathy scores. Features of apathy seemed to occur in these conditions independent of depressive symptoms. The mechanistic basis for the apparent increased features of apathy in essential tremor and dystonia deserves further study.",

    "abstract": "Patients with young onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD) are often candidates for subthalamic nucleus-deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). Nevertheless, few data have been reported on the long term STN-DBS clinical outcome of YOPD versus non-young onset Parkinson's disease (n-YOPD) patients.\nIn this study, the issue of whether YOPD might represent a long term positive predictive factor for STN-DBS was addressed, comparing follow-up data for 20 YOPD and 40 n-YOPD patients (20 treated after <15 years of disease duration and 20 treated after \u226515 years of disease duration).\nMean scores for the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) sections were compared 1 year, 5 years and, for 34 patients (12 YOPD and 22 n-YOPD), \u22657 years after surgery. Furthermore, a Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to determine the influence of age at PD onset, clinical phenotype, disease duration and duration of motor complications on the development of stimulation and medication resistant symptoms.\nYOPD patients showed a lower incidence of stimulation and medication resistant symptoms and a lower mortality rate; also, the tremor dominant clinical phenotype was associated with a lower risk of developing dementia, hallucinations and constipation. No significant differences in UPDRS scores were observed between n-YOPD patients treated after <15 years of PD and those treated after \u226515 years of PD.\nIn this series of STN-DBS treated patients, YOPD was associated with a medium to long term lower incidence of stimulation and medication resistant symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. Beta-arrestin-2 has been reported to be an important protein involved in D(2) dopamine receptor desensitization, which is essential to Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the potential value of pharmacological inactivation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase or arrestin in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease has recently been shown. We studied the interaction between D(2) dopamine receptor and beta-arrestin-2 and the pharmacological regulation of chemical compounds on such interaction using capillary zone electrophoresis. The results from screening more than 40 compounds revealed three compounds that remarkably inhibit the beta-arrestin-2/D(2) dopamine receptor interaction among them. These compounds are promising therapies for Parkinson's disease, and the method used in this study has great potential for application in large-scale drug screening and evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The present study evaluates neuroprotection in a marmoset MPTP (1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) model representing early Parkinson's disease (PD). The anti-glutamatergic compound riluzole is used as a model compound for neuroprotection. The compound is one of the few protective compounds used in the clinic for a neurodegenerative disorder. Marmoset monkeys were randomized into three groups of six: 1) an MPTP group receiving a total MPTP dose of 7\u00a0mg/kg (4 injections over two weeks, s.c.) 2) a riluzole group receiving besides MPTP, a twice daily dose of riluzole (10\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.), starting one week before MPTP and continuing for one week after the final MPTP injection and 3) a control group receiving saline instead of MPTP and riluzole. The marmosets' Parkinsonian symptoms were scored daily and their activity level, hand-eye coordination, jumping behavior, axial turning and night sleep parameters were tested and recorded weekly. At three weeks following the last MPTP challenge, brains were dissected and dopamine levels in the striatum and the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expressing dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) were compared. MPTP affected all behavioral parameters and sleep architecture and induced a relatively mild (50%) decline of DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Riluzole relieved the Parkinsonian signs, and improved the hand-eye coordination as well as turning ability. Moreover, riluzole prevented the impact of MPTP on sleep architecture and rapid eye movement behavioral disorder (RBD). Riluzole also increased the number of surviving DA neurons in MPTP-treated marmosets to 75%. However, riluzole did not prevent the MPTP-induced impairments on locomotor activity and jumping activity. In conclusion, reduction of excitotoxicity by riluzole appeared to be effective in reducing progressive neurodegeneration and relieved several clinically relevant PD symptoms in an animal model representing the early phase of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by marked impairments in motor function caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Animal models of PD have traditionally been based on toxins, such as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), that selectively lesion dopaminergic neurons. Motor impairments from 6-OHDA lesions of SNc neurons are well characterized in rats, but much less work has been done in mice. In this study, we compare the effectiveness of a series of drug-free behavioral tests in assessing sensorimotor impairments in the unilateral 6-OHDA mouse model, including six tests used for the first time in this PD mouse model (the automated treadmill \"DigiGait\" test, the challenging beam test, the adhesive removal test, the pole test, the adjusting steps test, and the test of spontaneous activity) and two tests used previously in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice (the limb-use asymmetry \"cylinder\" test and the manual gait test). We demonstrate that the limb-use asymmetry, challenging beam, pole, adjusting steps, and spontaneous activity tests are all highly robust assays for detecting sensorimotor impairments in the 6-OHDA mouse model. We also discuss the use of the behavioral tests for specific experimental objectives, such as simple screening for well-lesioned mice in studies of PD cellular pathophysiology or comprehensive behavioral analysis in preclinical therapeutic testing using a battery of sensorimotor tests.",

    "abstract": "Valid assessment of apraxia in usually non-apraxic Parkinson's disease helps to delineate atypical parkinsonism frequently associated with apraxia. Furthermore, in a subgroup of late Parkinson's disease apraxia, typically the ideomotor subtype, may gradually superimpose onto parkinsonian motor symptoms contributing to defective manual skill. Here we evaluate the utility of a brief, standardized test, the apraxia screen of TULIA (AST).\nSeventy five Parkinson's disease patients were tested with the AST. Parkinsonian motor deficits were measured using Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III and difficulties in activities of daily living (ADL) by modified MDS-UPDRS part II (eating, dressing, personal hygiene, and writing).\nNo association was found between the AST and MDS-UPDRS part III, indicating that AST discriminates well (discriminative validity) between apraxia and parkinsonism.

    "abstract": "No recent analysis details Parkinson's Disease (PD) costs or survival for Medicare beneficiaries. This study assesses excess direct costs and survival in Medicare beneficiaries with early and advanced PD.\nPatients with \u2265 2 PD diagnoses (ICD-9-CM: 332.0), \u2265 age 65, continuously enrolled in Parts A&B during one-year baseline and study periods were selected from the Medicare 5% sample (N = 3.2 million, 1999-2008). Newly diagnosed patients were defined as having no baseline claims for movement disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's, bipolar disorder, psychosis, falls or related injuries, ambulatory assistance device (walker or wheelchair), or skilled nursing facility. Controls without PD were demographically matched 1:1. Costs to Medicare were compared via Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and inverse probability weighted multivariate regression. Survival was assessed via Cox proportional hazards analysis.\nCosts in the year post-diagnosis were higher for newly diagnosed patients (N = 9,201, $7423) than controls ($5024), resulting in excess PD-associated costs of $2399 (p < 0.001). Cumulative excess costs were $28,422 from the year prior to index quarter to five years following (p < 0.01). PD patients receiving their first claim for an ambulatory assistance device (N = 11,294) had excess cumulative costs of $50,923 (p < 0.001) over the same period; those receiving their first claim for a skilled nursing facility (N = 10,152) had excess costs of $102,750 (p < 0.001). Hazard rates of mortality were higher among newly diagnosed PD (1.43, p < 0.001), ambulatory assistance device (2.37, p < 0.001) and skilled nursing facility (3.34, p < 0.001) cohorts than in corresponding non-PD groups.\nMedicare beneficiaries with PD have substantially and progressively higher costs and mortality compared with controls.",

    "abstract": "Selective impairment of executive function has been shown in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN). However, some patients experience difficulties in daily life, such as dissension in interpersonal relationships or a loss of lifestyle balance, in the short term after surgery. Our hypothesis is that these difficulties might be related to executive dysfunction. To elucidate the involvement of executive dysfunction in these difficulties, we assessed motor and executive function in the short term and long term after surgery.\nWe examined motor function and executive function in 30 patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS for medically refractory PD. Patients were evaluated for executive function 1 month before surgery, 1 month after surgery, and 12 months after surgery using the Trail Making Test (TMT), the Modified Stroop Color Word Interference Test (MST) and tests of Verbal Fluency (VF).\nTMT-B, TMT (B/A), MST-B, VF-phonemic and VF-semantic scores were significantly poorer 1 month after STN-DBS. TMT-B, TMT (B/A) and VF-phonemic recovered to preoperative levels by 12 months after surgery. A reduction in dopaminergic medication 1 month after surgery was significantly correlated with deterioration of TMT (B/A).\nTemporary deterioration of executive function may occur in the short term after STN-DBS, whereas motor function is usually improved. PD patients undergoing STN-DBS should be managed during this period to better predict temporary executive dysfunction. Excessive reduction of dopaminergic medication after surgery might, at least in part, result in this deterioration of executive function.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene are associated with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. However, whether these alterations have any effect on the clinical course of Parkinson's disease is not clear. The glucocerebrosidase coding region was fully sequenced in 225 Parkinson's disease patients, 17 pathologically confirmed Lewy body dementia patients, and 186 controls from Spain. Twenty-two Parkinson's disease patients (9.8%) and 2 Lewy body dementia patients (11.8%) carried mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene, compared with only 1 control (0.5%); P = .016 and P = .021 for Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia, respectively. The N370S and the L444P mutations represented 50% of the alterations. Two novel variants, L144V and S488T, and 7 previously described alterations were also found. Alterations in glucocerebrosidase were associated with a significant risk of dementia during the clinical course of Parkinson's disease (age at onset, years of evolution, and sex-adjusted odds ratio, 5.8; P = .001). Mutation carriers did not show worse motor symptoms, had good response to L-dopa, and tended to present the intermediate parkinsonian phenotype. Our findings suggest that mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene not only increase the risk of both Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia but also strongly influence the course of Parkinson's disease with respect to the appearance of dementia.",

Only 2 patients (5%) dropped out. The mean intraclass correlation coefficient between Web- and office-based assessments ranged from 0.67 (first visit) to 0.75 (last visit) and 0.81 and 0.82 for doctor- and patient-administered scales, respectively. No differences in responsiveness (P = 0.63), and data precision (P = 0.11) were found, but Web-based assessments had fewer missing values (P = 0.01).\nWeb-based assessments offer a feasible format for assessing PD-related impairment from home.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic dysfunction and degeneration. DJ-1/PARK7 mutations have been linked with a familial form of early onset PD. In this study, we found that human DJ-1 wild type and the missense mutants M26I, R98Q, A104T and D149A were stable proteins in cells, only the L166P mutant was unstable. In parallel, the former were not degraded and the L166P mutant was directly degraded in vitro by proteasome-mediated endoproteolytic cleavage. Furthermore, genetic evidence in fission yeast showed the direct involvement of proteasome in the degradation of human DJ-1 L166P and the corresponding L169P mutant of SPAC22E12.03c, the human orthologue of DJ-1 in Schizosaccharomyces Pombe, as their protein levels were increased at restrictive temperature in fission yeast (mts4 and pts1-732) harboring temperature sensitive mutations in proteasomal subunits. In total, our results provide evidence that direct proteasomal endoproteolytic cleavage of DJ-1 L166P is the mechanism of degradation contributing to the loss-of-function of the mutant protein, a property not shared by other DJ-1 missense mutants associated with PD.",

    "abstract": "Exciting new features have been described concerning neurogenic bowel dysfunction, including interactions between the central nervous system, the enteric nervous system, axonal injury, neuronal loss, neurotransmission of noxious and non-noxious stimuli, and the fields of gastroenterology and neurology. Patients with spinal cord injury, myelomeningocele, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease present with serious upper and lower bowel dysfunctions characterized by constipation, incontinence, gastrointestinal motor dysfunction and altered visceral sensitivity. Spinal cord injury is associated with severe autonomic dysfunction, and bowel dysfunction is a major physical and psychological burden for these patients. An adult myelomeningocele patient commonly has multiple problems reflecting the multisystemic nature of the disease. Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disorder in which axonal injury, neuronal loss, and atrophy of the central nervous system can lead to permanent neurological damage and clinical disability. Parkinson's disease is a multisystem disorder involving dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic and cholinergic systems, characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Parkinson's disease affects several neuronal structures outside the substantia nigra, among which is the enteric nervous system. Recent reports have shown that the lesions in the enteric nervous system occur in very early stages of the disease, even before the involvement of the central nervous system. This has led to the postulation that the enteric nervous system could be critical in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, as it could represent the point of entry for a putative environmental factor to initiate the pathological process. This review covers the data related to the etiology, epidemiology, clinical expression, pathophysiology, genetic aspects, gastrointestinal motor dysfunction, visceral sensitivity, management, prevention and prognosis of neurogenic bowel dysfunction patients with these neurological diseases. Embryological, morphological and experimental studies on animal models and humans are also taken into account.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by oxidative stress and CNS iron deposition. Ceruloplasmin is an extracellular ferroxidase that regulates cellular iron loading and export, and hence protects tissues from oxidative damage. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis, we investigated ceruloplasmin patterns in the CSF of human Parkinson's disease patients. Parkinson's disease ceruloplasmin profiles proved more acidic than those found in healthy controls and in other human neurological diseases (peripheral neuropathies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease); degrees of acidity correlated with patients' pathological grading. Applying an unsupervised pattern recognition procedure to the two-dimensional electrophoresis images, we identified representative pathological clusters. In vitro oxidation of CSF in two-dimensional electrophoresis generated a ceruloplasmin shift resembling that observed in Parkinson's disease and co-occurred with an increase in protein carbonylation. Likewise, increased protein carbonylation was observed in Parkinson's disease CSF, and the same modification was directly identified in these samples on ceruloplasmin. These results indicate that ceruloplasmin oxidation contributes to pattern modification in Parkinson's disease. From the functional point of view, ceruloplasmin oxidation caused a decrease in ferroxidase activity, which in turn promotes intracellular iron retention in neuronal cell lines as well as in primary neurons, which are more sensitive to iron accumulation. Accordingly, the presence of oxidized ceruloplasmin in Parkinson's disease CSF might be used as a marker for oxidative damage and might provide new insights into the underlying pathological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) significantly improves quality of life (QoL) in PD. However, QoL fails to improve in a relevant proportion of patients. We studied clinical baseline and progression parameters associated with improvement in QoL after DBS. Data from a German randomized, controlled study comparing DBS (60 patients) with best medical treatment (59 patients) were analyzed. Changes in patients' QoL were assessed using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up. For the STN-DBS patients, the changes in PDQ-39 were correlated with predefined clinical preoperative and progression parameters. Scores for QoL improved after STN-DBS for 57% of the patients, and for 43% patients, they did not improve. Patients with improvement in QoL showed significantly higher cumulative daily \"off\" time. Changes in the PDQ-39 showed a significant positive correlation with the cumulative daily off time at baseline. Logistic regression analysis revealed that 1 additional hour off time at baseline increases the odds for improvement on PDQ-39 by a factor of 1.33 (odds ratio). In the postoperative course, changes in the PDQ-39 significantly correlated with the reduction of cumulative daily off time, an improvement on the UPDRS (UPDRS III off), and positive mood changes. Among the baseline parameters, the cumulative daily off time is the strongest predictor for improvement in disease-related QoL after DBS. Improvement in QoL after STN-DBS is also correlated with changes in motor functions and changes in depression and anxiety.",

    "abstract": "A substantial percentage of patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease without dementia are reported to be affected by cognitive impairment (CI). In practice, however, CI is underrecognized, as the signs may not be apparent in early-stage disease and many routine assessment tools lack the sensitivity to detect subtle cognitive dysfunction. Patients with PD and mild CI (MCI) may have a higher risk of developing dementia than cognitively intact PD patients; however, it is not currently known which patients with CI are at increased risk of developing dementia. This review summarizes current knowledge about CI in nondemented PD; it discusses the structural and functional changes associated with CI and addresses areas of unmet needs. We focus on questions that should be addressed in future studies to achieve consensus on its characteristics and definition, pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnosis and assessment, and treatment and management.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), abnormalities of speech rate have been observed in spontaneous speech, reading tasks and syllable repetition tasks. Impaired temporal speech patterns have been contributed to dysfunctional basal ganglia circuits, but little is known about a possible differential role of right and left basal ganglia concerning speech production, although neurodegeneration in PD typically follows an asymmetrical pattern. The aim of our study was to reveal a possible influence of lateralized basal ganglia dysfunction on speech timing in PD.\n60 patients with PD (30 with predominant symptoms on the left-side PD_L and 30 with predominant symptoms on the right side PD_R) and 40 healthy controls were tested. Participants had to repeat a single syllable in a self chosen steady pace. Additionally, the participants performed a reading task in order to measure speaking rate related to connected speech.\nSyllable repetition showed a significant instability in both PD groups as compared to controls. However, the PD_L group performed in a much higher pace with further significant pace acceleration in the course of the syllable repetition task. This pattern showed a further correlation to axial motor symptoms. No correlations were seen between parameters of syllable repetition and the reading task.\nLateralization of basal ganglia dysfunction in PD seems to differentially impact the stability of spontaneous syllable repetition pace. Our data suggest a crucial role of the right basal ganglia in the maintenance of isochronous speech rhythms at least in patients with additional axial motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine has been implicated in reward-related impulsivity, but the exact relationship between dopamine, reward and impulsivity in humans remains unknown. We address this question in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by severe dopamine depletion. PD is associated primarily with motor and cognitive inflexibility, but can also be accompanied by reward-related impulsivity. This paradoxical symptom of PD has often been attributed to dopaminergic overstimulation by antiparkinson medication, which is necessary to relieve the motor and cognitive inflexibility. However, factors other than medication may also contribute to aberrant impact of reward. Here we assess whether cognitive inflexibility and aberrant reward impact in PD are two sides of the same coin, namely dopamine cell loss. To measure dopamine cell loss, we employed (123)I-FP-CIT Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) in 32 PD patients (10 never-medicated patients and 22 patients after withdrawal of all medication for >12h) and related the values to behavior on a rewarded task-switching paradigm. Dopamine cell loss was associated not only with cognitive inflexibility (under low reward), but also with aberrant impact of reward. These effects could not be attributed to medication use. Relative to controls (n=26), aberrant reward processing in PD was particularly expressed as reduced capacity to maintain (i.e., repeat) the current task-set under high reward. Our findings demonstrate that factors intrinsically related to PD may underlie the paradoxical symptoms of inflexibility and reward-related impulsivity in PD. The present results concur with observations that low baseline dopamine states predispose to drug and other addictions.",

    "abstract": "Apathy and depression are among the most common psychiatric and behavioral disorders associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and demographic and clinical correlates of apathy and depression in a clinical population-based sample of patients with PD and to assess whether apathy may present as a primary behavioral disturbance independent from depression and cognitive impairment. A series of 360 PD patients underwent psychiatric investigation with the Starkstein's Apathy Scale (AS), and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), motor scoring with Hoehn and Yahr (HY) staging, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS); and cognitive screening with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) on the same day. Apathy coexisted with depression in 133 (36.9%) of PD patients, compared with depression without apathy in 16 (4.4%), apathy without depression in 84 (23%), and neither apathy nor depression in 127 PD patients (35.2%). Apathy was associated with higher axial UPDRS impairment score, lower MMSE score, higher l-dopa dosage, and earlier HY stages, while depression was predicted by the more advanced HY stages and younger age of PD patients. These findings suggest that apathy and depression may be separable in PD, although both are common in patients with PD. Therefore these two conditions should be systematically screened and considered in the care and management of PD.",

    "abstract": "Nonmotor symptoms, among them sexual dysfunction, are common and underrecognized in patients with Parkinson disease; they play a major role in the deterioration of quality of life of patients and their partners. Loss of desire and dissatisfaction with their sexual life is encountered in both genders. Hypersexuality (HS), erectile dysfunction and problems with ejaculation are found in male patients, and loss of lubrication and involuntary urination during sex are found in female patients. Tremor, hypomimia, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, 'clumsiness' in fine motor control, dyskinesias, hypersalivation and sweating may interfere with sexual function. Optimal dopaminergic treatment should facilitate sexual encounters of the couple. Appropriate counselling diminishes some of the problems (reluctance to engage in sex, problems with ejaculation, lubrication and urinary incontinence). Treatment of erectile dysfunction with sildenafil and apomorphine is evidence based. HS or compulsive sexual behaviour are side effects of dopaminergic therapy, particularly by dopaminergic agonists, and should be treated primarily by diminishing their dose. Neurologists should actively investigate sexual dysfunction in their Parkinsonian patients and offer treatment, optimally within a multidisciplinary team, where a dedicated professional would deal with sexual counselling.",

    "abstract": "Experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD) are of great importance for improving the design of future clinical trials. Various neurotoxic models are available, including 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), paraquat and rotenone. However, no model is considered perfect; each has its own limitations. Based on epidemiological data, a new trend of using environmental toxins in PD modeling seems attractive and has dominated public discussions of the disease etiology. A search for new environmental toxin-based models would improve our knowledge of the pathology of the condition. Here, we discuss some toxins of natural origin (e.g. cycad-derived toxins, epoxomicin, Nocardia asteroides bacteria, Streptomyces venezuelae bacteria, annonacin and DOPAL) that possibly represent a contributory environmental component to PD.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein, the major component of Lewy bodies, is thought to play a central role in the onset of synaptic dysfunctions in Parkinson's disease (PD). In particular, \u03b1-synuclein may affect dopaminergic neuron function as it interacts with a key protein modulating dopamine (DA) content at the synapse: the DA transporter (DAT). Indeed, recent evidence from our \"in vitro\" studies showed that \u03b1-synuclein aggregation decreases the expression and membrane trafficking of the DAT as the DAT is retained into \u03b1-synuclein-immunopositive inclusions. This notwithstanding, \"in vivo\" studies on PD animal models investigating whether DAT distribution is altered by the pathological overexpression and aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein are missing. By using the proximity ligation assay, a technique which allows the \"in situ\" visualization of protein-protein interactions, we studied the occurrence of alterations in the distribution of DAT/\u03b1-synuclein complexes in the SYN120 transgenic mouse model, showing insoluble \u03b1-synuclein aggregates into dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal system, reduced striatal DA levels and an altered distribution of synaptic proteins in the striatum. We found that DAT/\u03b1-synuclein complexes were markedly redistributed in the striatum and substantia nigra of SYN120 mice. These alterations were accompanied by a significant increase of DAT striatal levels in transgenic animals when compared to wild type littermates. Our data indicate that, in the early pathogenesis of PD, \u03b1-synuclein acts as a fine modulator of the dopaminergic synapse by regulating the subcellular distribution of key proteins such as the DAT.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about comorbidities of bipolar disorder such as Parkinson's disease. A case history and a literature survey indicate that bipolar disorder is linked with or influences Parkinson's disease and vice versa. Underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and, more importantly, no treatment options are established in such double diagnoses. The few data in comorbid Parkinson cases seem to point to a rapid cycling pattern of bipolar symptoms. With regard to therapeutic intervention, the literature supports pramipexole for treatment of both Parkinson and depressive symptoms in bipolar depression. Lithium, the mood stabilizer of choice for treating manic states, is problematical for use in Parkinson patients because of its side effects. Valproate might be an alternative, especially for treatment of rapid cycling.",

    "abstract": "This model-based analysis quantifies the population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic efficacy and safety/tolerability relationships of orally administered istradefylline, a selective adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist, in healthy participants and patients with Parkinson disease. Data from 6 phase 2/3 clinical trials comprised the population database, with 1760 and 1798 patients contributing to the efficacy and safety/tolerability analyses, respectively. The relationship between istradefylline area under the curve at steady state and percentage OFF time was described by a nonlinear model (Emax) based on time for the disease progression/placebo response component and an Emax model for the effect of istradefylline. The typical maximum decrease in percentage OFF time due to istradefylline exposure would be 5.79% (95% confidence interval = 4.09%-7.49%) with one-half of the maximum effect reached at an exposure of 1690 ng \u00d7 hr/mL (95% confidence interval = 199-3180 ng \u00d7 hr/mL). The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships for dyskinesia and dizziness were described by an Emax model, and for nausea, a power model was used. The probabilities of dyskinesia and dizziness are expected to plateau at a dose of 40 mg/d, and the probability of nausea is expected to continually rise as the dose is increased. Collectively, these results support a starting istradefylline dose of 20 to 40 mg/d.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to evaluate the Movement Disorders Society (MDS) Task Force-proposed screening checklist for detecting Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D) in relation to full neuropsychological testing. An MDS Task Force has proposed diagnostic procedures for PD-D, which have not been fully validated against more extensive neuropsychological testing. PD subjects were recruited from 2 specialty centers. A neuropsychologist evaluated them for dementia as part of routine clinical care. Independent clinical neurologists administered the MDS PD-D screening checklist. Diagnosis of PD-D by the 2 methods was compared. Ninety-one PD subjects had a mean age of 66.3 (SD = 9.7) years and a mean PD duration of 8.8 (SD = 6.1) years. Seven subjects (7.7%) met all 8 screening checklist criteria from the MDS PD-D screening tool and were classified as probable PD-D. Fifteen (16.5%) subjects were classified as PD-D by full neuropsychological assessment. The screening checklist showed 100% specificity, but only 46.7% sensitivity, for diagnosing PD-D compared to the full neuropsychological assessment. PD-D cases missed by the PD-D screening tool were largely due to 2 checklist items that were not endorsed (absence of depression and Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] scores <26). There was moderate agreement between these 2 methods for determination of PD-D (kappa = 0.59, P < .001). The MDS-PD-D screening checklist is highly accurate for detecting PD-D if all items are endorsed. However, for cases that do not meet these criteria, full neuropsychological testing is needed to differentiate PD-D from milder cognitive impairment. Revision of the checklist by altering or eliminating the 2 problematic checklist items may improve sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is heterogeneous, both in terms of motor symptoms and mood. Identifying associations between phenotypic variants of motor and mood subtypes may provide clues to understand mechanisms underlying mood disorder and symptoms in Parkinson's disease. A total of 513 patients were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and separately classified into anxious, depressed, and anxious-depressed mood classes based on latent class analysis of a semistructured interview. Motor subtypes assessed related to age-of-onset, rate of progression, presence of motor fluctuations, lateralization of motor symptoms, tremor dominance, and the presence of postural instability and gait symptoms and falls. The directions of observed associations tended to support previous findings with the exception of lateralization of symptoms, for which there were no consistent or significant results. Regression models examining a range of motor subtypes together indicated increased risk of anxiety in patients with younger age-of-onset and motor fluctuations. In contrast, depression was most strongly related to axial motor symptoms. Different risk factors were observed for depressed patients with and without anxiety, suggesting heterogeneity within Parkinson's disease depression. Such association data may suggest possible underlying common risk factors for motor subtype and mood. Combined with convergent evidence from other sources, possible mechanisms may include cholinergic system damage and white matter changes contributing to non-anxious depression in Parkinson's disease, while situational factors related to threat and unpredictability may contribute to the exacerbation and maintenance of anxiety in susceptible individuals.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease provides a useful model for studying the neural substrates of emotional processing. The striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, like the mesolimbic dopamine system that modulates their function, are thought to be involved in emotional processing. As Parkinson's disease is histopathologically characterized by the selective, progressive, and chronic degeneration of the nigrostriatal and mesocorticolimbic dopamine systems, it can therefore serve as a model for assessing the functional role of these circuits in humans. In the present review, we begin by providing a synopsis of the emotional disturbances observed in Parkinson's disease. We then discuss the functional roles of the striato-thalamo-cortical and mesolimbic circuits, ending with the conclusion that both these pathways are indeed involved in emotional processing.",

Two multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase III studies assessed the efficacy and safety of adjunctive perampanel in patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations.\nIn both phase III studies (301 and 302), levodopa-treated patients were randomized and treated with once-daily oral placebo (n = 504), perampanel 2 mg (n = 509), or perampanel 4 mg (n = 501). The primary end point was change in daily \"off\" time from baseline. The treatment period was 30 weeks in study 301 and 20 weeks in study 302.\nFor any efficacy end point, perampanel 2 or 4 mg was not superior to placebo. Perampanel was well tolerated up to 4 mg/day.\nPerampanel failed to significantly improve motor symptoms versus placebo. There was also no effect on the duration or disability of levodopa-induced dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "A number of preclinical studies in both in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease have demonstrated that coenzyme Q10 can protect the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Some clinical trials have looked at the neuroprotective effects of coenzyme Q10 in patients with early and midstage Parkinson's disease.\nTo assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of treatment with coenzyme Q10 compared to placebo in patients with early and midstage Parkinson's disease.\nWe searched the Cochrane Movment Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2011), and EMBASE (January 1985 to March 2011). We handsearched the references quoted in the identified trials, congress reports from the most important neurological association and movement disorder societies in Europe and America (March 2011), checked reference lists of relevant studies and contacted other researchers.\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared coenzyme Q10 to placebo for patients who suffered early and midstage primary Parkinson's disease. Studies in which the method of randomization or concealment were unknown were included. Cross-over studies were excluded.\nTwo review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. All disagreements were resolved by consensus between authors and were explained. We attempted to contact the authors of studies for further details if any data were missing and to establish the characteristics of unpublished trials through correspondence with the trial coordinator or principal investigator. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials.\nFour randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with a total of 452 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. In overall, there were improvements in activities of daily living (ADL) UPDRS (WMD -3.12, 95% CI -5.88 to -0.36) and Schwab and England (WMD 4.43, 95% CI 0.05 to 8.81) for coenzyme Q10 at 1200 mg/d for 16 months versus placebo.In safety outcomes, only the risk ratios (RR) of pharyngitis (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.89) and diarrhea (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.16) are mild elevated between coenzyme Q10 therapy and placebo and there were no differences in the number of withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.62).\nCoenzyme Q10 therapy with 1200 mg/d for 16 months was well tolerated by patients with Parkinson's disease. The improvements in ADL UPDRS and Schwab and England were positive, but it need to be further confirmed by larger sample. For total and other subscores of UPDRS, the effects of coenzyme Q10 seemed to be less clear.",

    "abstract": "Since the 1990 s deep brain stimulation (DBS) has provided an effective tool for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. About fifty thousand Parkinson patients have been treated by DBS so far. Although a relatively safe intervention, there are still some considerable side effects, psychiatric and non-psychiatric. We conducted a structured search using PubMed and included publications from 1999 to February 2011 to provide an overview of the current data concerning psychiatric side effects of DBS in Parkinson's disease. There was a tremendous variety and inconsistency concerning methods and results of the studies we included. However, it became apparent that postoperatively increased attention should be paid concerning a potentially increased suicidality and affective alterations (particularly manic states). We suggest frequent pre- and postoperative evaluations of Parkinson patients treated with DBS.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed the results of transcranial sonography (TCS) on 110 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, 30 essential tremor (ET) patients and 110 controls in a Chinese population and compared our findings to the previous literatures. The echo signal intensity of midbrain substantia nigra (SN) was measured and divided into grade I-V. If the high echo signal intensity (grade III, IV or V) was detected in either side of SN, it was measured as well as the whole area of midbrain and the ratio of both sides of SN hyperechogenicity to the whole area of midbrain (S/M) were calculated. In addition, the width of the third ventricle in the level of thalamus was also determined. There were more individuals with the grade of SN \u2265 III in PD group (100/110, 85.45%) than these in ET group (4/30, 13.33%, x ( 2 ) = 58.38, P < 0.001) and control group (11/110, 10%, x ( 2 ) = 125.51, P < 0.001). The median and quartile range of SN hyperechogenicity area and S/M in PD patients were greater than those in ET patients and controls. Both the area of SN hyperechogenicity \u22650.2 cm(2) and the S/M \u2265 0.07 were useful indexes to distinguish PD and ET in Chinese population. In conclusion, TCS is an effective and useful tool to detect PD and to distinguish PD from ET in Chinese patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting not only the motor system but also the cognitive and behavioral domains. Although there are many studies addressing the issue of cognition, a universally recognized method to diagnose patients with dementia is still lacking. The aim of this study was to determine which neuropsychological test is the most reliable in the diagnosis of dementia in PD and to establish if mini mental state examination (MMSE) is enough to detect this condition. We studied 200 consecutive PD patients through an extensive neuropsychological battery, clinical evaluation and brain magnetic resonance imaging over a period of 4 years. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the interplay between possible risk factors and the accuracy of different neuropsychological tests. PD patients with dementia performed significantly worse in all the tests as compared to patients with PD alone: phonological verbal fluency, attentional matrices, Rey auditory verbal learning test and digit span were the most useful tools. Age and disease duration were correlated with cognitive impairment. No relevant differences were detected in phenotype, affected body side at onset, levodopa equivalent daily dose or neuroimaging findings (except for the occurrence of atrophy). Despite reasonable accuracy of MMSE (90%), its positive predictive value is only 74%. Using at least 3 neuropsychological tests, among those more significant detected with logistic regression analysis, the positive predictive value rises to 91%. In conclusion, the use of an extensive neuropsychological battery is still recommended in the diagnosis of dementia in PD.",

    "abstract": "Camptocormia is a highly disabling syndrome that occurs in various diseases but is particularly associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although first described nearly 200 years ago, the morphological changes associated with camptocormia are still under debate and the pathophysiology is unknown. We analyzed paraspinal muscle biopsies of 14 PD patients with camptocormia and compared the findings to sex-matched postmortem controls of comparable age to exclude biopsy site-specific changes. Camptocormia in PD showed a consistent lesion pattern composed of myopathic changes with type-1 fiber hypertrophy, loss of type-2 fibers, loss of oxidative enzyme activity, and acid phosphatase reactivity of lesions. Ultrastructurally, myofibrillar disorganization and Z-band streaming up to electron-dense patches/plaques were seen in the lesions. No aberrant protein aggregation, signs of myositis or mitochondriopathy were found, but the mitochondrial content of paraspinal muscles in patients and controls was markedly higher than known from limb biopsies. Additionally, we were able to demonstrate a link between the severity of the clinical syndrome and the degree of the myopathic changes. Because of the consistent lesion pattern, we propose criteria for the diagnosis of camptocormia in PD from muscle biopsies. The morphological changes show obvious parallels to the muscle pathology of experimental tenotomy reported in the 1970s, which depend on an intact innervation and do not occur after interruption of the myotactic reflexes. A dysregulation of the proprioception could be part of the pathogenesis of camptocormia in Parkinson's disease, particularly in view of the clinical symptoms of rigidity and loss of muscle strength.",

    "abstract": "Intended reaches triggered by exogenous targets often coexist with spontaneous, automated movements that are endogenously activated. It has been posited that Parkinson's disease (PD) primarily impairs automated movements, but it is unknown to what extent this may affect multijoint/limb control, particularly when patients are off their dopaminergic medications. Here we tested nine human patients with PD while off dopaminergic medication versus nine age-matched normal controls (NCs). Participants performed intentional reaches forward to a target in a dark room and then transitioned back to their initial posture. Upon target flash, three forms of guidance were used: (1) memory with eyes closed, (2) continuous target vision only, and (3) vision of their moving finger only. The trajectories of their arm joints were measured and their joint velocities decomposed into the (intended) task-relevant and the (spontaneous) task-incidental degrees of freedom (DOF). We also measured the balance between these two subsets of DOF as these movements unfolded. In PD patients we found that the incidental DOF values were abnormally variable during the retracting movements and prevailed over the task-relevant DOF values. By contrast, their forward intentional motions were abnormally dominated by the task-relevant components. Moreover, the patients abruptly transitioned between voluntary and automated modes of joint control, and, unlike NCs, the type of visual guidance differentially affected their postural trajectories. These findings lend support to an emerging view that there is a loss of automated control in PD patients that contributes to impairments in voluntary control, and that basal ganglia-cortical circuits are critical for the maintenance and balance of multijoint control.",

    "abstract": "To assess regions and patterns of brain atrophy in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) with normal cognition (PD-NC), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and dementia-level cognitive deficits (PDD).\nImages were quantified using a region-of-interest approach and voxel-based morphometry analysis. We used a high-dimensional pattern classification approach to delineate brain regions that collectively formed the Spatial Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of PDD.\nThe Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center at the University of Pennsylvania.\nEighty-four PD patients (61 PD-NC, 12 PD-MCI, and 11 PDD) and 23 healthy control subjects (HCs) underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.\nThe PD-NC patients did not demonstrate significant brain atrophy compared with HCs. Compared with PD-NC patients, PD-MCI patients had hippocampal atrophy (\u03b2 = -0.37; P = .001), and PDD patients demonstrated hippocampal (\u03b2 = -0.32; P = .004) and additional medial temporal lobe atrophy (\u03b2 = -0.36; P = .003). The PD-MCI patients had a different pattern of atrophy compared with PD-NC patients (P = .04) and a similar pattern to that of PDD patients (P = .81), characterized by hippocampal, prefrontal cortex gray and white matter, occipital lobe gray and white matter, and parietal lobe white matter atrophy. In nondemented PD patients, there was a correlation between memory-encoding performance and hippocampal volume.\nHippocampal atrophy is a biomarker of initial cognitive decline in PD, including impaired memory encoding and storage, suggesting heterogeneity in the neural substrate of memory impairment. Use of a pattern classification approach may allow identification of diffuse regions of cortical gray and white matter atrophy early in the course of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is recognized as a key actor in brain remodeling. It has been shown to increase after peripheral and central injury, to modulate reparative capacity in neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to be associated with a number of other neurodegenerative diseases. This particular function of apoE has been postulated to underlie the robust association with risk and age at onset of AD. ApoE associations studies with Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, have generated contradictory results but associations with age at onset and dementia in PD stand out. We investigate here whether apoE is involved in response to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced degeneration that models PD-like deafferentation of the striatum in the mouse and participates in compensatory reinnervation mechanisms. We examined the modifications in gene expression and protein levels of apoE and its key receptors, the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the LDLR-related protein (LRP), as well as the reactive astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in different brain structures throughout the degenerative and reactive regenerative period. In the striatum, upregulations of GFAP, apoE and LRP mRNAs at 1 day post-treatment were associated with marked decreases in dopamine (DA) levels, loss in tyrosine hydroxylase protein content, as well as to a compensatory increase in dopaminergic metabolism. Subsequent return to near control levels coincided with indications of reinnervation in the striatum: all consistent with a role of apoE during the degenerative process and regenerative period. We also found that this cascade was activated in the hippocampus and more so than in the striatum, with a particular contribution of LDLR expression. The hippocampal activation did not correlate with substantial neurochemical reductions but appears to reflect local subtle alteration of DA metabolism and the regulation of plasticity-related event in this structure. This study provides first evidence of an activation of the apoE/apoE receptors cascade in a mouse model of PD, specifically in the MPTP-induced deafferentation of the striatum. Results are also quite consistent with the postulated role of apoE in brain repair but, raise the issue of possible lesion- and region-specific alterations in gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that the control of retrieval of episodic feature bindings is modulated by the striatal dopaminergic pathway. The present study investigated whether this may reflect a contribution from the ventral or the dorsal part of the striatum. Along the lines of the overdose hypothesis in Parkinson's disease (PD), functions known to rely on the dorsal striatum are enhanced with dopaminergic medication, while operations relying on the ventral circuitry are impaired. We found that partial mismatches between present and previous stimulus-response relations are, compared to control participants, abnormally low OFF DA medication and normalized ON DA medication. The results suggest that the dorsal striatum, but not (or not so much) the ventral striatum, is driving the flexible control of retrieval of stimulus-response episodes.",

    "abstract": "Amantadine is an established antiparkinsonian drug with a still unclear molecular site of action. In\u00a0vivo studies on rodents, in\u00a0vitro studies on tissue of rodents as well as binding studies on post mortem human tissue implicate monoamine transporters and NMDA receptors. In order to re-examine its action at human variants of these proteins on intact cells we established cells stably expressing the human NR1/2A NMDA-receptor, noradrenaline transporter (NAT) or dopamine transporter (DAT) and tested the activity of amantadine in patch-clamp, uptake, release, and cytotoxicity experiments. Amantadine was less potent in blockade of NMDA-induced inward currents than in blockade of noradrenaline uptake and in induction of inward currents in NAT expressing cells. It was 30 times more potent in blocking uptake in NAT- than in DAT cells. Amantadine induced NAT-mediated release at concentrations of 10-100\u00a0\u03bcM in superfusion experiments and blocked NAT-mediated cytotoxicity of the parkinsonism inducing neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP(+)) at concentrations of 30-300\u00a0\u03bcM, whereas 300-1000\u00a0\u03bcM amantadine was necessary to block NMDA-receptor mediated cytotoxicity. Similar to amphetamine, amantadine was inactive at \u03b1(2A)-adrenergic receptors and induced reverse noradrenaline transport by NAT albeit with smaller effect size. Thus, amantadine acted as \"amphetamine-like releaser\" with selectivity for the noradrenergic system. These findings and differences with memantine, which had been reported as less efficient antiparkinsonian drug than amantadine but in our hands was significantly more potent at the NMDA-receptor, suggest contributions from a noradrenergic mechanism in the antiparkinsonian action of amantadine.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing is a complex post-transcriptional process that can be regulated by cis-acting elements located within genomic non-coding regions. Recent studies have identified that polymorphic variations in non-coding regions of the \u03b1-synuclein gene (SNCA) locus are associated with an increased risk for developing Parkinson's disease (PD). The underlying mechanism(s) for this susceptibility may involve changes in \u03b1-synuclein mRNA expression and alternative splicing. As a first step towards understanding the biology of \u03b1-synuclein splice variants in PD, we characterized the levels of the full-length SNCA-140 mRNA transcript and SNCA-126, -112, and -98 alternatively spliced variants in different neuronal regions from PD patients or transgenic mice overexpressing human \u03b1-synuclein (ASO). In human post-mortem tissue, \u03b1-synuclein spliced transcripts were expressed in a region-specific manner in the cortex, substantia nigra, and cerebellum. We observed increased nigral SNCA-140 and SNCA-126 transcript levels in PD patients when compared to neurologically unaffected cases. Human \u03b1-synuclein splicing changes were also found to occur in a region-specific manner in ASO mice. Here, SNCA-126, -112, and -98 transcript levels did not increase proportionally with SNCA-140 levels, or parallel the region-specific mouse transcript ratios seen in wild-type (WT) littermates. While most transcripts were elevated in ASO mice when compared to WT mice, the most prominent increase was found in the ventral midbrain of 15-month-old ASO mice. These results demonstrate region-specific human \u03b1-synuclein transcript level abnormalities in PD patients and in a transgenic mouse model of \u03b1-synucleinopathy. This study is relevant to understanding the normal, adaptive, or pathological role(s) of \u03b1-synuclein splice variants.",

    "abstract": "The -174G>C (rs1800795) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of the interleukin-6 (IL6) gene and the 1730G>A (rs4986938) SNP in the estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) may influence the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated these SNPs in 380 unrelated US Caucasian PD cases and 522 controls, including 452 individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) origin (260 PD, 192 controls). The G allele of the -174G>C SNP was more common in AJ PD cases (p=0.033) as well as in Non-Jewish (NJ) men with PD (p=0.022). The GG genotype increased the risk of PD by over two fold in NJ men (OR=2.11, 95%CI: 1.14-3.89, p=0.017), and approached significance in the total AJ group with PD (OR=1.42, 95%CI: 0.97-2.06, p=0.067). The A allele of the ESR2 1730G>A SNP was associated with a decreased risk for PD in AJ women, and in this group, having the AA genotype decreased the risk of PD by half (OR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.22-0.92, p=0.029). Our data supports a role for the IL6 -174G>C G allele in AJ individuals overall. In NJ Caucasians, this role appears to be gender mediated. In both groups, the effect is independent from ESR2 1730G>A. A separate association for the ESR2 1730G>A SNP was found exclusively in women of AJ descent. Other polymorphisms in tight linkage disequilibrium with the SNP differentially influencing expression, ethnic differences in allele distribution, and gender differences in genetic load related to PD, may underlie our findings. Larger studies in diverse populations, including analysis of surrounding regions are recommended.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta with unknown aetiology. 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment of neuronal cells is an established in vivo model for mimicking the effect of oxidative stress found in PD brains. We examined the effects of 6-OHDA treatment on human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) and primary mesencephalic cultures. Using a reverse arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (RAP-PCR) approach we generated reproducible genetic fingerprints of differential expression levels in cell cultures treated with 6-OHDA. Of the resulting sequences, 23 showed considerable homology to known human coding sequences. The results of the RAP-PCR were validated by reverse transcription PCR, real-time PCR and, for selected genes, by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. In four cases, [tomoregulin-1 (TMEFF-1), collapsin response mediator protein 1 (CRMP-1), neurexin-1, and phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthetase (GART)], a down-regulation of mRNA and protein levels was detected. Further studies will be necessary on the physiological role of the identified proteins and their impact on pathways leading to neurodegeneration in PD.",

    "abstract": "The c.4309A>C mutation in the LRRK2 gene (LRRK2 p.N1437H) has recently been reported as the seventh pathogenic LRRK2 mutation causing monogenic Parkinson's disease (PD). So far, only two families worldwide have been identified with this mutation. By screening DNA from seven brains of PD patients, we found one individual with seemingly sporadic PD and LRRK2 p.N1437H mutation. Clinically, the patient had levodopa-responsive PD with tremor, and developed severe motor fluctuations during a disease duration of 19 years. There was severe and painful ON-dystonia, and severe depression with suicidal thoughts during OFF. In the advanced stage, cognition was slow during motor OFF, but there was no noticeable cognitive decline. There were no signs of autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus had unsatisfactory results on motor symptoms. The patient committed suicide. Neuropathological examination revealed marked cell loss and moderate alpha-synuclein positive Lewy body pathology in the brainstem. There was sparse Lewy pathology in the cortex. A striking finding was very pronounced ubiquitin-positive pathology in the brainstem, temporolimbic regions and neocortex. Ubiquitin positivity was most pronounced in the white matter, and was out of proportion to the comparatively weaker alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. Immunostaining for tau was mildly positive, revealing non-specific changes, but staining for TDP-43 and FUS was entirely negative. The distribution and shape of ubiquitin-positive lesions in this patient differed from the few previously described patients with LRRK2 mutations and ubiquitin pathology, and the ubiquitinated protein substrate remains undefined.",

In order to assess the frequency of the reported mutation and to search for other possible disease-causing variants in this gene, we sequenced all 17 exons of VPS35 in 96 familial PD cases, and exon 15 (in which the reported mutation is found) in an additional 64 familial PD cases, 175 young-onset PD cases, and 262 sporadic, neuropathologically confirmed PD cases. We identified 1 individual with the p.Asp620Asn mutation and an autosomal dominant family history of PD. Subsequent follow-up of the family confirmed an affected sibling and cousin who also carried the same mutation. No other potentially disease-causing mutations were identified. We conclude that the VPS35 c.1858G>A mutation is an uncommon cause of familial Parkinson's disease in our population.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor signs encountered in Parkinson's disease consist in a heterogeneous group of manifestations including hyposmia, pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, neuropsychic disorders. Functional imaging techniques provide an invaluable method to understand their pathophysiology, allowing us to study the abnormalities of brain metabolism or perfusion associated with these manifestations or the underlying dysfunction of different neurotransmission systems. The present paper covers the recent advances provided by functional imaging in this area.",

    "abstract": "Defined as the transient state between standing and walking, gait initiation is negatively affected in Parkinson's disease (PD), which often results in significant disability. Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the most common surgical procedure for PD, the long-term effects of DBS on gait initiation are not well studied. The present study evaluated the long-term effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS on the preparation phase of gait initiation using principal component (PC) analysis. Six patients with PD who had undergone STN DBS and 24 healthy control subjects were evaluated. PD subjects were assessed 11.3\u00b110.3 (P1) and 78.9\u00b110.6 (P2) months after surgery. PD subjects were tested with STN DBS in two conditions: without medication and with medication. PC analysis was applied separately for the vertical, anterior-posterior and medial-lateral components of ground reaction force (GRF) recorded during gait initiation. Three PC scores were chosen by the scree test for each GRF component and all these PC scores were used for calculating a standard distance between healthy controls and PD subjects. The Friedman test showed a significant difference in standard distance among conditions (P=0.004), with the post-hoc test recognizing differences among P1 conditions and P2 medication-on condition. The eigenvector loading factors pointed to major differences between PD conditions surrounding the maximum amplitude of vertical and anterior-posterior GRF. For the studied sample, all distances increased in the follow-up evaluation (P2) with and without medications, indicating a worsening in gait initiation after seven years.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons of the nigrostriatal system and by the presence of Lewy bodies (LB), proteinaceous inclusions mainly composed of filamentous \u03b1-synuclein aggregates. Alpha-synuclein is a natively unfolded protein which plays a central role in the control of dopaminergic neuronal functions and which is thought to be critically implicated in PD pathophysiology. Indeed, besides the fact that \u03b1-synuclein is the main protein component of LB, genetic studies showed that mutations and multiplications of the \u03b1-synuclein gene are responsible for the onset of familial forms of PD. A large body of evidence indicates that \u03b1-synuclein pathology at dopaminergic synapses may underlie the onset of neuronal cell dysfunction and degeneration in the PD brain. Thus, since the available therapeutic approaches to cure this disease are still limited, we hypothesized that the analysis of the \u03b1-synuclein synaptic proteome/lipidome may represent a tool to identify novel potential therapeutic targets to cure this disorder. We thus performed a critical review of studies describing \u03b1-synuclein pathophysiology at synaptic sites in experimental models of PD and in this paper we outline the most relevant findings regarding the specific modulatory effects exerted by \u03b1-synuclein in the control of synaptic functions in physiological and pathological conditions. The conclusions of these studies allow to single out novel potential therapeutic targets among the \u03b1-synuclein synaptic partners. These targets may be considered for the development of new pharmacological and gene-based strategies to cure PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how alexithymia may influence decision making under conditions of uncertainty, assessed using the Iowa Gambling Task, in patients with newly diagnosed, untreated (de novo) Parkinson's disease, as previously reported for healthy subjects. Twenty-four patients with de novo Parkinson's disease underwent a neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric assessment, including the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form, and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). The assessment showed that 12 patients were alexithymic and 12 were non-alexithymic; seven patients were found to be mildly depressed and 17 non-depressed. Alexithymic and non-alexithymic patients did not differ in the IGT total score; however, significant differences emerged across the third block of the IGT, in which the alexithymic patients outperformed the nonalexithymic patients. Depression did not influence IGT performance. Alexithymia may modulate decision making, as assessed with the IGT; alexithymia could be associated with faster learning to avoid risky choices and negative feedback, as previously reported in some studies conducted in anxious or depressed patients.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to determine self-awareness of dyskinesias and other core motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) through the use of movie presentations. A scale based on 10 movies (five depicting dyskinesias and five showing core symptoms) and the Self-Assessment Parkinson's Disease Disability Scale were administered to 21 patients (all with a Mini-Mental State Examination - MMSE score \u2265 25). Neurological assessment included the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn-Yahr and Schwab-England scales. In addition, the MMSE, Beck Depression Inventory and Stroop task were administered. Overall, patient and caregiver ratings of dyskinesias and core PD symptoms were consistent. Two patients (9%) completely denied dyskinesias, while four patients (19%) significantly underestimated their dyskinesias. Our results confirm that poor self-awareness of symptoms in PD may be selective and that denial of dyskinesias affects only a minority of patients with normal cognitive status (MMSE \u2265 25). Most patients are aware of the presence of dyskinesias. Poor self-awareness of dyskinesias is associated with longer disease duration.",

    "abstract": "In healthy individuals and those with insomnia, poor sleep quality is associated with decrements in performance on tests of cognition, especially executive function. Sleep disturbances and cognitive deficits are both prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD). Sleep problems occur in over 75% of patients, with sleep fragmentation and decreased sleep efficiency being the most common sleep complaints, but their relation to cognition is unknown. We examined the association between sleep quality and cognition in PD. In 35 non-demented individuals with PD and 18 normal control adults (NC), sleep was measured using 24-hr wrist actigraphy over 7 days. Cognitive domains tested included attention and executive function, memory and psychomotor function. In both groups, poor sleep was associated with worse performance on tests of attention/executive function but not memory or psychomotor function. In the PD group, attention/executive function was predicted by sleep efficiency, whereas memory and psychomotor function were not predicted by sleep quality. Psychomotor and memory function were predicted by motor symptom severity. This study is the first to demonstrate that sleep quality in PD is significantly correlated with cognition and that it differentially impacts attention and executive function, thereby furthering our understanding of the link between sleep and cognition.",

Yet the primacy of ethical arguments in favour of sham surgery controls is not yet established. Preliminary empirical research shows an asymmetry between the views of neurosurgical researchers and patients on the subject, while different ethical guidelines and regulations support conflicting interpretations. Research ethics committees faced with a proposal involving sham surgery should be aware of its ethical complexities. An overview of recent and current placebo-controlled surgical trials in the field of Parkinson's Disease is provided here, followed by an analysis of the key ethical issues which such trials raise.",

    "abstract": "Medication non-adherence is associated with chronic disease and complex medication schedules, and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients also frequently have cognitive impairments that may interfere with effective medication management. The current study quantitatively assessed the medication management skills of PD patients and probed the neurocognitive underpinnings and clinical correlates of this skill. A total of 26 men with PD completed a neuropsychological battery and a modified version of the Hopkins Medication Schedule (HMS), a standard test of a person's ability to understand and implement a routine prescription medication. Estimated adherence rates from performance on the HMS were low. Memory, executive functioning, and processing speed were strongly related to different components of the HMS. A range of neuropsychological abilities is associated with the ability to understand and implement a medication schedule and pillbox in individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "Neutral warning signals speed voluntary reactions by reducing temporal uncertainty and by triggering a brief burst of arousal. We attempted to isolate the phasic arousal mechanism in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) using a clock display to minimize temporal uncertainty. In this condition, the speeding of responses in a color-discrimination task by an accessory stimulus was the fully equivalent to the effect in age-matched control subjects. This indicates preserved phasic arousal in PD. Temporal preparation based on warning cues also appeared to be normal. By contrast, in a condition with high temporal uncertainty, the accessory stimulus (an air puff to the foot) impaired accuracy for the patients but not the neurologically normal subjects. The data are consistent with the view that PD disrupts internal but not external control of alertness.",

    "abstract": "Disability in Parkinson's disease (PD) is due not only to progressive impairment in balance, gait, and motor-related tasks, but also to several nonmotor symptoms affecting autonomic, neuropsychiatric, and sensory functions. The prevalence of PD in the United States is rising due to the expanding elderly population. Direct medical costs associated with PD are significant and influenced by level of disability and associated complexity of management. As new treatments are made available, reevaluation of treatment benefits and paradigms is warranted, for both motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD, to better manage outcomes. In addition to evaluation of symptomatic therapies for PD, attention to advances in disease-modifying therapies and to management of nonmotor symptoms should be an integral component of PD surveillance in the managed care environment.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with significant patient disability and costs to the healthcare system. It is questioned whether early treatment may improve outcomes and delay disability. Early treatment relies on early diagnosis, which can be difficult to achieve because the diagnosis of PD is based on motor symptoms, is clinical in nature, and is complicated by potential presentation of nonmotor symptoms prior to motor symptoms. Economic analyses demonstrate that treatments other than levodopa may be cost-effective. The lack of correlation between Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) outcomes and imaging studies of dopamine uptake may reflect the inappropriate selection of study end points, since activities of daily living scores may be more applicable than motor function scores. Levodopa, the standard therapy for motor control of PD and one of the most effective options, is associated with complications (a wearing-off effect) when used long term. Other therapies, including dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, may limit the rate of dyskinesia relative to levodopa-based regimens. It appears that early treatment with the MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline (1 mg), as compared with late treatment, delays the onset of worsened UPDRS score, especially the nonmotor activities of daily living subscore.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder diagnosed by the presence of bradykinesia and at least 1 of the symptoms of rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. It is increasingly recognized that nonmotor symptoms are common and can adversely affect quality of life, yet they often are not diagnosed and consequently are often untreated. Nonmotor symptoms include neuropsychiatric issues such as anxiety, depression, hallucinations, impulse control disorders, and cognitive impairment, as well as autonomic dysfunction, which may present as gastrointestinal, urinary, and sexual disturbances. Nonmotor symptoms also include excessive sweating, orthostatic hypotension, and sleep disturbances. Management of PD requires recognition of both motor and nonmotor symptoms as well as an understanding of the relationship between these symptoms and how they can be affected by treatments for PD. Therapy should be individualized for each patient, as treatments for the motor symptoms of PD can improve some nonmotor symptoms while they can worsen others. In many cases, symptom-specific treatments are necessary to control nonmotor symptoms of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder of aging. The pathological hallmark of PD is neuronal inclusions termed Lewy bodies whose main component is alpha-synuclein protein. The finding of these Lewy bodies in the intestinal enteric nerves led to the hypothesis that the intestine might be an early site of PD disease in response to an environmental toxin or pathogen. One potential mechanism for environmental toxin(s) and proinflammatory luminal products to gain access to mucosal neuronal tissue and promote oxidative stress is compromised intestinal barrier integrity. However, the role of intestinal permeability in PD has never been tested. We hypothesized that PD subjects might exhibit increased intestinal permeability to proinflammatory bacterial products in the intestine. To test our hypothesis we evaluated intestinal permeability in subjects newly diagnosed with PD and compared their values to healthy subjects. In addition, we obtained intestinal biopsies from both groups and used immunohistochemistry to assess bacterial translocation, nitrotyrosine (oxidative stress), and alpha-synuclein. We also evaluated serum markers of endotoxin exposure including LPS binding protein (LBP). Our data show that our PD subjects exhibit significantly greater intestinal permeability (gut leakiness) than controls. In addition, this intestinal hyperpermeability significantly correlated with increased intestinal mucosa staining for E. coli bacteria, nitrotyrosine, and alpha-synuclein as well as serum LBP levels in PD subjects. These data represent not only the first demonstration of abnormal intestinal permeability in PD subjects but also the first correlation of increased intestinal permeability in PD with intestinal alpha-synuclein (the hallmark of PD), as well as staining for gram negative bacteria and tissue oxidative stress. Our study may thus shed new light on PD pathogenesis as well as provide a new method for earlier diagnosis of PD and suggests potential therapeutic targets in PD subjects.\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT01155492.",

    "abstract": "Backward walking is difficult for persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). It is unknown how levodopa influences backward gait patterns, especially when compared to forward gait patterns.\nInvestigate the effects of levodopa on forward and backward gait patterns in individuals with PD.\nA repeated measures design was used.\nThe sample consisted of 21 individuals with PD (15 males, 6 females). Their mean age was 70.24 \u00b1 8.69 yr. The average time since diagnosis was 11.81 \u00b1 5.49 years. The median of the Hoehn and Yahr stage while 'ON' medication was 2.57. Gait patterns during forward and backward walking at a self-selected comfortable speed were recorded before and after taking levodopa on the same day.\nLevodopa significantly increased gait speed and stride length and decreased the percent of the gait cycle (%GC) spent in double support. Gait speed and stride length were greater and the %GC spent in double support was less during forward walking compared with backward walking. Cadence was not changed by levodopa or walking direction.\nLevodopa improved gait characteristics during backward walking in a manner similar to that during forward walking in persons with PD.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is a common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) that can manifest independently of depression, but little is known about its natural progression in medically managed patients. The present study sought to characterize and compare trajectories of apathy, depression, and motor symptoms in PD over 18 months.\nData from a sample of 186 PD patients (mean disease duration of 8.2 years) followed by the University of Florida Movement Disorders Center were obtained from a clinical research database. Scores on the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (motor portion), Apathy Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory at three time-points (baseline, 6 months, 18 months) were analyzed in a structural equation modeling framework.\nA multivariate growth model controlling for age, sex, education, and disease duration identified linear worsening of both apathy (slope estimate = 0.73; p < .001) and motor symptoms (slope estimate = 1.51; p < .001), and quadratic changes in depression (slope estimate = 1.18; p = .07). All symptoms were positively correlated. Higher education was associated with lower apathy, depression, and motor severity. Advanced age was associated with greater motor and apathy severity. Female sex and longer disease duration were associated with attenuated motor worsening. Antidepressant use was associated only with depression scores.\nThese longitudinal results support the differentiation of apathy and depression in PD. Like motor progression, apathy progression may be linked at least partially to dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Empirically supported treatments for apathy in PD are needed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is known to present and mostly persist as an asymmetrical movement disorder in most cases. The asymmetry is mainly described in motor features such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in upper and lower limbs. Unilateral hypomimia however, has only been reported in 14 patients, all of whom showed right-sided hemihypomimia. In this case report we describe the symptoms of a 51-year-old man with predominant left-sided Parkinson's disease in whom we discovered a left-sided hemihypomimia. We also briefly review the literature concerning hemihypomimia in Parkinson's disease. We conclude that a larger case series needs to be studied to further elucidate the pathophysiology and clinical implications of this observation.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson disease (PD) typically have complaints of weakness. The mechanisms underlying this deficit have not been well established, although many factors may contribute.\nThis investigation aimed to characterize quadriceps muscle weakness and activation failure in people with PD and explore whether these deficits were related to disease severity. The authors further sought to examine quadriceps muscle fatigability.\nThis was a cross-sectional comparison of 17 people with mild-severe PD and 17 healthy adults matched by age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score (UPDRS motor) ranged from 9.5 to 61.0. Participants were divided into those with low-PD motor signs (UPDRS motor < 31.7) and high-PD motor signs (UPDRS motor \u2265 31.7). Measures of quadriceps performance included isometric torque, central activation using doublet interpolation, and an isokinetic fatigue test.\nParticipants with high-PD motor signs had significantly more quadriceps weakness and central activation deficits than those with low-PD motor signs or healthy controls. Strength and activation deficits correlated strongly with UPDRS motor score. Quadriceps muscle fatigue was present in healthy controls and in those with low-PD motor signs but not in those with high-PD motor signs.\nThese findings provide additional evidence for lower-extremity strength loss with PD; central activation deficits may account for some of the strength deficits, especially with increased PD motor signs. Also, muscle fatigue did not occur in individuals with a greater degree of PD motor signs, most likely because of insufficient central activation to allow for muscle overload to induce metabolic fatigue.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by loss of dopominergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta, and can be experimentally induced by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Chronic administration of MPTP/probenecid (MPTP/p) leads to oxidative stress, induction of apoptosis, and loss of dopominergic neurons which results in motor impairments. Epidemiological studies have shown an inverse relationship between tea consumption and susceptibility to PD. Theaflavin is a black tea polyphenol, which possess a wide variety of pharmacological properties including potent anti oxidative, anti apoptotic and anti inflammatory effects. The current study is aimed to assess the effect of theaflavin against MPTP/p induced neurodegenaration in C57BL/6 mice. We found that the theaflavin attenuates MPTP/p induced apoptosis and neurodegeneration as evidenced by increased expression of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT) and reduced apoptotic markers such as caspase-3, 8, 9 accompanied by normalized behavioral characterization. This may be due to anti oxidative and anti apoptotic activity and these data indicate that theaflavin may provide a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by progressive disturbances in motor, autonomic and psychiatric functions. Much has been learnt since the disease entity was established in 1817. Although there are well established treatments that can alleviate the symptoms of PD, a pressing need exists to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis to enable development of disease modifying treatments. Ten responsible genes for PD have been identified and recent progress in molecular research on the protein functions of the genes provides new insights into the pathogenesis of hereditary as well as sporadic PD. Also, genome wide association studies, a powerful approach to identify weak effects of common genetic variants in common diseases, have identified a number of new possible PD associated genes, including PD genes previously detected. However, there is still much to learn about the interactions of the gene products, and important insights may come from chemical and genetic screens. In this review, an overview is provided of the molecular pathogenesis and genetics of PD, focusing particularly on the functions of the PD related gene products with marked research progress.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra (SNpc). FLZ, a novel synthetic squamosamide derivative from a Chinese herb, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in experimental Parkinson's disease (PD) models. However, it is still unclear whether FLZ protects against PD through regulating the function of dopaminergic system. In this study, we carried out a set of in vitro and in vivo experiments to address these questions. Oral administration of FLZ significantly improved motor dysfunction of mice challenged by MPTP. The beneficial effects of FLZ on motor behavior attributed to the elevation of dopamine level in striatum, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells, and TH activity in the middle brain of mouse. Mechanism study showed that treatment of FLZ increased the phosphorylation of activating protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Using LY294002 to block phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway prevented the phosphorylation of mTOR and attenuated the neuroprotection of FLZ in MN9D cells challenged by MPP(+). In addition, FLZ reduced the expression of RTP801, an important protein in PD, in mice and cells intoxicated by MPTP/MPP(+). Taken together, these results revealed a novel role that FLZ elevated TH expression and activity in dopaminergic neuron through activation of Akt/mTOR survival pathway and inhibition of RTP801 in MPTP/MPP(+)-induced PD models. The data also provided evidence that FLZ had potent neuroprotecive effects and might become a new promising anti-PD drug.",

    "abstract": "Anhedonia, a lowered ability to experience physical or social pleasure, has recently been recognized as a non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease.\nTo identify the frequency of anhedonia and the factors influencing hedonic tone in Japanese patients with Parkinson's disease.\nWe recruited 86 consecutive outpatients with a clinical diagnosis of PD attending two Japanese hospitals (one university hospital and one community hospital) in February 2010. We used the self-rating Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) translated into Japanese language from the original English version to assess and quantify hedonic tone as a subjectively experienced phenomenon. We studied the association of anhedonia with the variables age, age at onset, gender, disease duration, disease severity and antiparkinsonian drugs.\nThirty-nine patients (45%) were male and 47 (55%) were female. Mean age was 72.01\u00b19.07 (49-89) years, with mean age at onset of 64.93\u00b111.42 (31-88) years. Mean disease duration was 7.20\u00b15.54 (1-23) years. The mean Hoehn and Yahr scale was 2.76\u00b10.78. The mean SHAPS score of the total sample was 1.19\u00b11.86. The SHAPS score of 14 patients (16.3%) was 3 or more, indicating anhedonia. The mean SHAPS score was lower in patients taking pramipexole (0.58\u00b10.97) than in patients not taking pramipexole (1.57\u00b12.16). Multiple linear regression analysis identified pramipexole as a significant negative influencing factor on the SHAPS score, while disease severity and entacapone treatment were identified as positive influencing factors. The age, onset age, gender, disease duration, and use of pergolide, amantadine, zonisamide, selegiline, anticholinergic agents and droxidopa did not significantly affect the SHAPS score.\nAnhedonia is not rare non-motor symptom in Japanese patients with Parkinson's disease. This study suggests an anti-anhedonic property of pramipexole.",

    "abstract": "Dysphagia is a potentially harmful feature, also in Parkinson's disease (PD). As published prevalence rates vary widely, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia in PD in a meta-analysis. We conducted a systematic literature search in February 2011 and two independent reviewers selected the papers. We computed the estimates of the pooled prevalence weighted by sample size. Twelve studies were suitable for calculating prevalence rates. Ten studies provided an estimate based on subjective outcomes, which proved statistically heterogeneous (p < 0.001), with a pooled prevalence estimate with random effect analysis of 35% (95% CI 28-41). Four studies provided an estimate based on objective measurements, which were statistically homogeneous (p = 0.23), with a pooled prevalence estimate of 82% (95% CI 77-87). In controls the pooled subjective prevalence was 9% (95% CI 2-17), while the pooled objective prevalence was 23% (95% CI 13-32). The pooled relative risk was 3.2 for both subjective outcomes (95% CI 2.32-4.41) and objective outcomes (95% CI 2.08-4.98). Clinical heterogeneity between studies was chiefly explained by differences in disease severity. Subjective dysphagia occurs in one third of community-dwelling PD patients. Objectively measured dysphagia rates were much higher, with 4 out of 5 patients being affected. This suggests that dysphagia is common in PD, but patients do not always report swallowing difficulties unless asked. This underreporting calls for a proactive clinical approach to dysphagia, particularly in light of the serious clinical consequences.",

    "abstract": "Nearly all epidemiologic studies examining the association between the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) and diet have focused on single foods and specific nutrients. However, epidemiologic evidence for the association of dietary pattern with PD, namely the measurement of overall diet by considering the cumulative effects of nutrients is extremely limited. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study in Japan to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and the risk of PD.\nPatients with PD diagnosed using the UK PD Society Brain Bank criteria (n = 249) and controls without neurodegenerative diseases (n = 368) were recruited. At the time of recruitment, dietary intake during the preceding 1 month was assessed using a validated, self-administered diet history questionnaire. Dietary patterns from 33 predefined food groups (energy-adjusted food g/day) were extracted by factor analysis.\nThree dietary patterns were identified: 'Healthy', 'Western' and 'Light meal' patterns. After adjustment for potential non-dietary confounding factors, the Healthy pattern, characterized by a high intake of vegetables, seaweed, pulses, mushrooms, fruits and fish, was inversely associated with the risk of PD with a border-line significance (P for trend = 0.06). Multivariate Odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) for PD in the highest quartile of the Healthy pattern was 0.54 (0.32-0.92) compared with the lowest quartile. No associations with PD were detected for the other two dietary patterns.\nIn this case-control study in Japan, a dietary pattern consisting of high intakes of vegetables, fruits and fish may be associated with a decreased risk of PD.",

    "abstract": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors may be used to decrease levodopa requirement. The objective was to investigate whether the levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel infusion dose can be reduced by 20% without worsening of motor fluctuations and levodopa concentration stability when oral catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors are added.\nA short-term, randomized, partly blinded, crossover, investigator-initiated clinical trial was performed, with levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel combined with oral entacapone and tolcapone on two different days in 10 patients. The primary outcome measure was difference in coefficient of variation of levodopa in plasma between levodopa/carbidopa, levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone, and levodopa/carbidopa/tolcapone. The secondary outcome measures other pharmacokinetic variables, patient-reported outcome, and blinded analysis of motor performance.\nVariation of plasma levodopa concentrations did not differ significantly between the treatments. The treatments did not differ regarding motor performance. Levodopa concentrations were significantly higher using tolcapone. Concentrations of the metabolite 3-O-methyldopa decreased gradually during catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibition.\nAccording to this small, short-term pilot study, oral catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors administered in 5-h intervals may be useful in cases where levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel dose reduction is wanted. Stability of plasma levodopa levels is not significantly altered, and off-time is not increased when decreasing the levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel dose by 20%. Rather, the dose should probably be decreased more than 20%, especially under tolcapone co-treatment, to avoid increased dyskinesias with time.",

    "abstract": "The recent studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) indicate that genetics and environmental factors may play an important role in developing of PD. Nowadays, the cell death and cell adhesion are pathogenetic mechanisms which could be related with PD. On the basis of relationship of those mechanisms with PD, the aim of this study was to identify new candidate genes for PD by integration of results of transcriptomics studies and results obtained by Biomedical Discovery Support System (BITOLA).\nFor the detection of functional relationship between potential candidate gene and pathogenetic mechanisms associated with PD, we designed strategy of integration of results of transcriptomics studies with discovery approach in bibliographic data bases and BITOLA. Data of chromosome location, tissue-specific expression, function of potential candidate genes and their association with genetics disorders were obtained from Medline, Locus Link, Gene Cards and OMIM.\nIntegration and comparison of results obtained using the BITOLA system and analysis of transcriptomics studies identified six genes (MAPT, UCHL1, NSF, CDC42, PARK2 and GFPT1) that occur simultaneously in both group of results. The function of genes NSF, CDC42 and GFPT1 in the pathogenesis of PD has not been studied yet.\nAccording to our result that aforementioned genes appeared in both groups of results and partially match the criteria set for the selection of candidate genes and their potential role in the development of PD, they should be tested by methods specifically intended for those three genes.",

    "abstract": "Strength training is an effective modality to improve muscular strength and functional performance in people with Parkinson's disease (PWP). One-repetition maximum (1-RM) is the gold standard assessment of strength; however, PWP suffer from day-to-day variations in symptom severity and performance characteristics, potentially adversely affecting the reliability of 1-RM performance. Herein, we assessed the reliability of 1-RM in PWP. Forty-six participants completed two sessions of 1-RM testing of knee extension, knee flexion, chest press, and biceps curl at least 72 hours apart. Significantly differences between testing sessions were identified for knee extension (P < 0.001), knee flexion (P = 0.042), and biceps curl (P = 0.001); however, high reliability (ICC > 0.90) was also identified between sessions. Interestingly, almost third of subjects failed to perform better on the second testing session. These findings suggest that 1-RM testing can be safely performed in PWP and that disease-related daily variability may influence 1-RM performance.",

    "abstract": "Gait impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) are exacerbated under dual-task conditions requiring the simultaneous performance of cognitive or motor tasks. Dual-task walking deficits impact functional mobility, which often requires walking while performing concurrent tasks such as talking or carrying an object. The consequences of gait impairments in PD are significant and include increased disability, increased fall risk, and reduced quality of life. However, effective therapeutic interventions for dual-task walking deficits are limited. The goals of this narrative review are to describe dual-task walking deficits in people with PD, to discuss motor and cognitive factors that may contribute to these deficits, to review potential mechanisms underlying dual-task deficits, and to discuss the effect of therapeutic interventions on dual-task walking deficits in persons with PD.",

Cognitive rehabilitation, a behavioral approach to improve cognitive skills, has potential as a treatment option to improve and maintain cognitive skills and increase quality of life for those with Parkinson's disease-related cognitive dysfunction. Four cognitive rehabilitation programs in individuals with PD are identified from the literature. Characteristics of the programs and outcomes are reviewed and critiqued. Current studies on cognitive rehabilitation in PD demonstrate feasibility and acceptability of a cognitive rehabilitation program for patients with PD, but are limited by their small sample size and data regarding generalization of effects over the long term. Because PD involves progressive heterogeneous physical, neurological, and affective difficulties, future cognitive rehabilitation programs should aim for flexibility and individualization, according to each patient's strengths and deficits.",

    "abstract": "Objective. The purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness of the Mini-BESTest compared to the Berg Balance Scale in evaluating balance in people with PD of varying severity. We evaluated (1) the distribution of patients scores to look for ceiling effects, (2) concurrent validity with severity of disease, and (3) the sensitivity/specificity of separating people with or without postural response deficits. Subjects. Ninety-seven people with PD were tested for balance deficits using the Berg, Mini-BESTest, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III and the Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) disease severity classification. Setting. Clinical research facility at Oregon Health & Science University. Results. The Mini-BESTest is highly correlated with the Berg (r = 0.79, P < 0.001), but avoids the ceiling compression effect of the Berg for mild PD (skewness -2.30 Berg, -0.93 Mini-BESTest). Consequently, the Mini-BESTest is more effective than the Berg for predicting UPDRS Motor score (P < 0.001 Mini-BESTest versus P = 0.86 Berg), and for discriminating between those with and without postural response deficits as measured by the H&Y (ROC differential P = 0.06). Conclusion. The Mini-BESTest is a promising tool for discerning balance deficits in patients with PD, most importantly those with more subtle deficits.",

    "abstract": "Coexistent impairments in executive functions and language comprehension in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been repeatedly observed. In this study, the aim was to provide insights into the interaction between linguistic representation and processing and executive functioning. Therefore, sentence comprehension and executive functions were assessed in 28 Dutch-speaking PD patients and 28 healthy control subjects. Three aspects of the sentence materials were varied: (1) phrase structure complexity, (2) sentence length, and (3) picture congruence. PD patients with mild-to-moderate disease severity showed decreased sentence comprehension compared to healthy control subjects. The difficulties encountered by PD patients were not limited to one aspect of the sentence materials. The same pattern of results was present in healthy control subjects. Deficits in set-switching were specifically associated with the comprehension of passive sentences. Generally, our study confirms that there does not appear to be a language faculty encapsulated from the influence of executive functions.",

    "abstract": "Two semantic priming tasks, designed to isolate automatic and controlled semantic activation, were utilized to investigate the impact of dopamine depletion on semantic processing in Parkinson's disease (PD). Seven people with PD (tested whilst on and off levodopa medication) and seven healthy adults participated in the study. The healthy adult participants demonstrated intact automatic and controlled semantic activation. Aberrant controlled semantic activation was observed in the PD group on levodopa; however, automatic semantic activation was still evident. In contrast, automatic semantic activation was not evident in the PD group off levodopa. These results further clarify the impact of PD on semantic processing, demonstrating that dopamine depletion can cause disturbances in both automatic and controlled semantic activation.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine dysregulation syndrome is a complication of the dopaminergic treatment in Parkinson's disease that may be very disabling due to the negative impact that compulsive medication use may have on patients' social, psychological, and physical functioning. The relationship between subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation and dopamine dysregulation syndrome in patients with Parkinson's disease remains unclear. Deep brain stimulation may improve, worsen, or have no effect on preoperative dopamine dysregulation syndrome. Moreover, dopamine dysregulation syndrome may appear for the first time after deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. The outcome of postoperative dopamine dysregulation syndrome is poor despite stimulation and medication adjustments. Here we review the phenomenology and neurobiology of this disorder, discuss possible mechanisms that may underlie the diverse outcomes of dopamine dysregulation syndrome after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation, and propose management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Antagonists of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) were among the first treatments for Parkinson's disease. However, the clinical utility of mAChR antagonists is limited by adverse effects associated with the blockade of multiple mAChR subtypes. Understanding the roles of specific mAChR subtypes in regulating basal ganglia and motor function could lead to the development of novel agents that have antiparkinsonian activity with fewer adverse effects. Using the novel, highly selective M1 antagonist N-[3-oxo-3-[4-(4-pyridinyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl]-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4-sulfonamide (VU0255035) and the M1 positive allosteric modulator benzylquinolone carboxylic acid, we investigated the roles of M1 receptors in cholinergic excitation and regulation of synaptic transmission in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that M1 activation has excitatory effects on MSNs but plays little or no role in mAChR-mediated increases in firing frequency or the regulation of synaptic transmission in STN and SNr neurons. On the basis of this profile, M1-selective antagonists may have weak antiparkinsonian activity but would not have the full efficacy observed in nonselective mAChR antagonists. Consistent with this, the M1-selective antagonist VU0255035 partially reversed reserpine-induced akinesia and decreased haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats but did not have the full efficacy observed with the nonselective mAChR antagonist scopolamine. These results suggest that the M1 receptor participates in the overall regulation of basal ganglia function and antiparkinsonian effects of mAChR antagonists but that other mAChR subtype(s) also play important roles at multiple levels of the basal ganglia motor circuit.",

    "abstract": "Ablation of right-sided accessory pathways (APs) is sometimes challenging because several anatomical features of the tricuspid annulus (TA) and surrounding structures differ from those of the mitral annulus. This study investigated the electrophysiological characteristics and efficacy of a non-contact mapping (NCM) system for catheter ablation of right-sided APs.\nWe examined nine APs in six consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation of right-sided APs with NCM. In Case 6, we compared NCM with contact activation mapping. Three of six patients had two APs, and one of these had previously failed ablation. We observed atrial activation during sinus rhythm or atrial pacing using a multiple-electrode array (MEA) deployed in the right atrium near the TA. Non-contact mapping identified the AP location as a peri-TA breakout point that appeared prior to or simultaneously with the delta wave onset in all APs. In Case 6 we confirmed that the peri-TA breakout identified by NCM corresponded to the earliest ventricular activation identified by contact mapping. We successfully ablated nine APs by radiofrequency (RF) energy application to the breakout sites, while one AP located just above the pole of the MEA required additional conventionally guided mapping and ablation. The mean RF duration was 189.8 \u00b1 119.0 s. After 33.2 \u00b1 9.4 months of follow-up, one para-hisian AP and one right lateral AP recurred, but these were successfully ablated in a second procedure using NCM.\nNon-contact mapping was able to identify the location of right-sided APs accurately and quickly.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorders and related disorders (hobbyism-punding and dopamine dysregulation syndrome) occur in 15% to 20% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We assessed the validity and reliability of the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS), a rating scale designed to measure severity of symptoms and support a diagnosis of impulse control disorders and related disorders in PD. A convenience sample of PD patients at a movement disorders clinic self-completed the QUIP-RS and were administered a semistructured diagnostic interview by a blinded trained rater to assess discriminant validity for impulse control disorders (n = 104) and related disorders (n = 77). Subsets of patients were assessed to determine interrater reliability (n = 104), retest reliability (n = 63), and responsiveness to change (n = 29). Adequate cutoff points (both sensitivity and specificity values >80% plus acceptable likelihood ratios) were established for each impulse control disorder and hobbyism-punding. Interrater and retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient r) were >0.60 for all disorders. Participants in an impulse control disorder treatment study who experienced full (t = 3.65, P = .004) or partial (t = 2.98, P = .01) response demonstrated significant improvement on the rating scale over time, while nonresponders did not (t = 0.12, P = .91). The QUIP-RS appears to be valid and reliable as a rating scale for impulse control disorders and related disorders in PD. Preliminary results suggest that it can be used to support a diagnosis of these disorders, as well as to monitor changes in symptom severity over time.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease and drug-induced movement disorders (DIMDs) have commonalities in etiology based on impaired dopamine-based neurotransmission. Adenosine A(2A)-receptor antagonism may provide a new mechanism through which these disorders can be managed. In the motor circuit, tonic output from the globus pallidus and substantia nigra regulates movement via opposing excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the cerebral cortex through the direct and indirect pathways. Increased activity of the direct pathway increases movement via an inhibitory effect on thalamocortical projection neurons; increased activity of the indirect pathway has the opposite effect. Regulation of these pathways is mediated primarily by reciprocal inhibitory interactions between dopamine and adenosine receptors on neurons of these pathways. Adenosine A(2A) receptors are colocalized with dopamine D(2) receptors on the indirect pathway neurons, with A(2A) activation opposing the effect of D(2) activation. The A(2A) receptors' role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and DIMDs is evidenced by the upregulation of A(2A) receptors in patients with Parkinson's disease and patients receiving long-term administration of dopamine blockers. Further, A(2A)-receptor antagonists are effective in reversing parkinsonian motor deficits and extrapyramidal symptoms in animal models of Parkinson's disease and DIMDs. Understanding the role of A(2A)-receptor antagonism in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and DIMD has therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "A complex interaction of environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors combine with ageing to cause the most prevalent of movement disorders Parkinson's disease. Current pharmacological treatments only tackle the symptoms and do not stop progression of the disease or reverse the neurodegenerative process. While some incidences of Parkinson's disease arise through heritable genetic defects, the cause of the majority of cases remains unknown. Likewise, why some neuronal populations are more susceptible to neurodegeneration than others is not clear, but as the molecular pathways responsible for the process of cell death are unravelled, it is increasingly apparent that disrupted cellular energy metabolism plays a central role. Precise control of cellular calcium concentrations is crucial for maintenance of energy homeostasis. Recently, differential cellular expression of neuronal voltage-gated calcium channel (Ca(V)) isoforms has been implicated in the susceptibility of vulnerable neurons to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Ca(V) channels are also involved in the synaptic plasticity response to the denervation that occurs in Parkinson's disease and following chronic treatment with anti-parkinsonian drugs. This review will examine the putative role neuronal Ca(V) channels have in the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) occurs worldwide but prior to this review of data from the Thailand Parkinson's Disease Registry there had been no nationwide PD registry reported globally.\nTo determine the distribution and prevalence of PD in Thailand and related risk factors in order to more adequately develop and allocate prevention and treatment resources where they are most needed and to ascertain risk factors that are specific to the Thai population.\nThe Thailand Parkinson's Disease Registry is a new resource, and data collection began in March 2008. Data is collected by the Registry from physicians, and a mechanism is also provided for patients to self-report. This data was further analyzed by the capture-recapture methodology (CRM) to assess reporting biases.\nThe three main sources of data input to the Registry, i.e. (1) public hospitals, (2) private hospitals and (3) self-registration, require checking for duplicates and also allow estimation of completeness of recording (the degree of underreporting) in this disease registry. There is underreporting because of poor record keeping and administrative procedures in some facilities, and there is an unknown number of persons with PD who are not properly diagnosed because of inadequate facilities and staffing in some areas. Since our data sources should be overlapping in some way, and assuming that the likelihood of being detected in one system is independent of the others, we estimated these data sources' actual coverage and the expected total number of patients utilizing the 'capture-recapture' statistical technique.\nAs of March 2011, the Thailand PD Registry had identified 40,049 PD patients. Employing log-linear modeling, the CRM analysis based on the three data sets estimated underreporting of 20,516 cases. The revised estimated total is thus 60,565 cases, resulting in a crude and age-adjusted prevalence of 95.34 and 424.57 PD cases/100,000 population, respectively. The prevalence of PD was 126.83/100,000 in urban areas and 90.82/100,000 in rural areas (p < 0.001). Preliminary regional comparisons revealed a higher prevalence of PD in residents of the central plain valley of Thailand, an area with a large amount of pesticide use.\nThe combination of a passive registry and the CRM technique allowed us to derive population prevalence estimates for PD in Thailand. Thai PD prevalence estimates were similar to previous ones published for Asian countries; in addition, they suggested that urbanization and exposure to pesticides may both be risk factors for PD in the Thai population.",

    "abstract": "Data regarding both drug-related and non-drug-related costs in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are scarce, mainly due to the difficulties in data acquisition in experimental designs. Likewise, the reported impact of drug costs on total direct costs varies across different studies. In addition, the influence of comorbidities on both treatment costs and health-related quality of life has not been adequately evaluated.\nA sample of office-based neurologists (n=315) in Germany was asked to examine up to five consecutive patients with PD (n=1449) on a specified day during the study period. Patients of all ages were eligible and their evaluation was performed using standardized questionnaires.\nPD-specific therapy costs increased with the stage of the disease, early onset of the disease and disease duration. The major costs were due to PD-related therapy, whereas other medications only resulted in minor costs. Disease stage mainly influenced direct therapy costs, with an observed increase of total daily costs from \u20ac7.3 to \u20ac11.3/day. In addition, disease onset at age <65 years resulted in total daily costs of \u20ac11.2 compared to late onset of disease (>75 years) with daily therapy costs of \u20ac5.3. In this patient group neuropsychiatric comorbidities such as dementia and depression were only insufficiently treated. In addition, these comorbidities severely affected health-related quality of life.\nTherapy costs were influenced by disease stage, disease onset as well as present comorbidities. Furthermore, comorbidities such as depression and dementia were diagnosed but were not adequately treated.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a disorder characterized pathologically by progressive neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic cells of the nigrostriatal pathway. Although the resulting dopamine deficiency is the cause of the typical motor features of Parkinson's disease (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor), additional non-motor symptoms appear at various timepoints and are the result of non-dopamine nerve degeneration. Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors are used in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease as they increase synaptic dopamine by blocking its degradation. Two MAO-B inhibitors, selegiline and rasagiline, are currently licensed in Europe and North America for the symptomatic improvement of early Parkinson's disease and to reduce off-time in patients with more advanced Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations related to levodopa. A third MAO-B inhibitor (safinamide), which also combines additional non-dopaminergic properties of potential benefit to Parkinson's disease, is currently under development in phase III clinical trials as adjuvant therapy to either a dopamine agonist or levodopa. MAO-B inhibitors have also been studied extensively for possible neuroprotective or disease-modifying actions. There is considerable laboratory evidence that MAO-B inhibitors do exert some neuroprotective properties, at least in the Parkinson's disease models currently available. However, these models have significant limitations and caution is required in assuming that such results may easily be extrapolated to clinical trials. Rasagiline 1\u2009mg/day has been shown to provide improved motor control in terms of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score at 18 months in those patients with early disease who began the drug 9 months before a second group. There are a number of possible explanations for this effect that may include a disease-modifying action; however, the US FDA recently declined an application for the licence of rasagiline to be extended to cover disease modification.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the depletion of striatal dopamine (DA). Acupuncture, as an alternative therapy for PD, has beneficial effects in both PD patients and PD animal models, although the underlying mechanisms therein remain uncertain. The present study investigated whether acupuncture treatment affected dopamine neurotransmission in a PD mouse model using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). We found that acupuncture treatment at acupoint GB34 improved motor function with accompanying dopaminergic neuron protection against MPTP but did not restore striatal dopamine depletion. Instead, acupuncture treatment increased dopamine release that in turn, may lead to the enhancement of dopamine availability in the synaptic cleft. Moreover, acupuncture treatment mitigated MPTP-induced abnormal postsynaptic changes, suggesting that acupuncture treatment may increase postsynaptic dopamine neurotransmission and facilitate the normalization of basal ganglia activity. These results suggest that the acupuncture-induced enhancement of synaptic dopamine availability may play a critical role in motor function improvement against MPTP.",

    "abstract": "Neuroprotection refers to the protection of neurons from excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis as principal mechanisms of cell loss in a variety of diseases of the central nervous system. Our interest in Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment is focused on drugs with neuroprotective properties in preclinical experiments and evidence-based efficacy in human subjects. To this date, neuroprotection has never been solidly proven in clinical trials but recent adequate markers and/or strategies to study and promote this important goal are described. A myriad of compounds with protective properties in cell cultures and animal models yield to few treatments in clinical practice. At present, markers of neuronal vitality, disease modifying effects and long term clinical stability are the elements searched for in clinical trials. This review highlights new strategies to monitor patients with PD. Currently, neuroprotection in subjects has not been solidly achieved for selegiline and pramipexole; however, a recent rasagiline trial design is showing new indications of disease course modifying effects. In neurological practice, it is of utmost importance to take into account the potential neuroprotection exerted by a treatment in conjunction with its symptomatic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. These symptoms are associated with massive loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) causing an estimated 70-80% depletion of dopamine (DA) in the striatum, where their projections are located. Although the etiology of PD is unknown, mitochondrial dysfunctions have been associated with the disease pathophysiology. We used a mouse model expressing a mitochondria-targeted restriction enzyme, PstI or mito-PstI, to damage mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in dopaminergic neurons. The expression of mito-PstI induces double-strand breaks in the mtDNA, leading to an oxidative phosphorylation deficiency, mostly due to mtDNA depletion. Taking advantage of a dopamine transporter (DAT) promoter-driven tetracycline transactivator protein (tTA), we expressed mito-PstI exclusively in dopaminergic neurons, creating a novel PD transgenic mouse model (PD-mito-PstI mouse). These mice recapitulate most of the major features of PD: they have a motor phenotype that is reversible with l-DOPA treatment, a progressive neurodegeneration of the SN dopaminergic population, and striatal DA depletion. Our results also showed that behavioral phenotypes in PD-mito-PstI mice were associated with striatal dysfunctions preceding SN loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and that other neurotransmitter systems [noradrenaline (NE) and serotonin (5-HT)] were increased after the disruption of DA neurons, potentially as a compensatory mechanism. This transgenic mouse model provides a novel model to study the role of mitochondrial defects in the axonal projections of the striatum in the pathophysiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shed light on non-motor features of ET, such as depressive symptoms and cognitive changes, which might be attributed to pathophysiological changes in the brains of ET patients. Given these brain changes, we explored sleep abnormalities in ET patients.\nSleep was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in 120 ET cases, 120 normal controls, and 40 PD cases.\nThe mean\u00b1SD (median) ESS score increased from normal controls (5.7\u00b13.7 (5.0)), to ET cases (6.8\u00b14.6 (6.0)), to PD cases (7.8\u00b14.9 (7.0)), test for trend p=0.03. An ESS score >10 (an indicator of greater than normal levels of daytime sleepiness) was observed in 11 (9.2%) normal controls, compared to 27 (22.5%) ET cases and 10 (25.0%) PD cases (p=0.008 when comparing all three groups, and p=0.005 when comparing ET to normal controls). The global PSQI score was 7.8\u00b12.8 (7.5) in controls, 8.0\u00b13.3 (8.0) in ET cases, and 9.9\u00b13.9 (10.0) in PD cases. The ET case-control difference was not significant (p=0.8), yet in a test for trend, PD cases had the highest PSQI score (most daytime sleepiness), followed by ET (intermediate), and lowest scores in controls (p=0.02).\nSome sleep scores in ET were intermediate between those of PD cases and normal controls, suggesting that a mild form of sleep dysregulation could be present in ET.",

    "abstract": "To assess the effect of disease severity, dopaminergic medication (med) and STN-DBS on postural stability in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nPostural sway in quiet stance, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (motor) (UPDRS III) were evaluated in 129 subjects in the off-med state. A subgroup of 28 subjects was studied on-med and after STN-DBS. Postural sway was measured using center of pressure (CoP) root mean square displacement (RMS(CoP)) and mean velocity (V(CoP)) in the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions.\nAll CoP parameters were larger in moderate/advanced subjects vs controls (P < 0.001) and early subjects. Only RMS(CoP)ML was larger in early subjects vs controls (P < 0.05). Med, DBS and DBS + med decreased UPDRS III compared to off-med (P < 0.001). RMS(CoP)ML and V(CoP)ML were larger on-med vs off-med and vs DBS (P < 0.001). Compared to controls and PD subjects with normal CoP sway off-med, med increased all CoP parameters (P < 0.01) but DBS returned V(CoP)ML to normal values. For 'abnormal' PD subjects, STN-DBS improved the excessive V(CoP) in ML compared to off and on-med pre-DBS (P < 0.05).\nPostural sway in quiet stance increased with disease severity. Only ML CoP displacement was abnormal in early stage PD, and this may be a compensatory mechanism. Medication increased ML postural sway. In 'normal' PD subjects, STN-DBS reversed medication induced postural instability. Subjects with abnormal balance in quiet stance did not benefit from medication or DBS, except for improvement in ML CoP velocity from DBS. This may serve to reduce postural instability and falling.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are associated with dopamine agonist treatment. Although discontinuation of dopamine agonist is recommended, ICD management has not been precisely stated. The aims of the study were to describe demographic and clinical characteristics in a group of PD patients with ICDs and to evaluate the management of dopamine agonist treatment proposed to the same patients in order to treat the ICDs.\nThirty-five PD patients with ICD and 607\u00a0PD patients without ICD were studied. In the ICD group, demographic and clinical data were collected prospectively (ICD characteristics, motor and cognitive evaluation); demographic and clinical data were obtained retrospectively in the group without ICD.\nIn the ICD group, the sex ratio was 2.9 (versus 1.2\u00a0in the absence of ICD; p<0.05), the mean age was 57.5\u00a0years (versus 66.9\u00a0years; p<0.01) and the mean age at PD onset was 48.3\u00a0years (versus 55.5\u00a0years; p<0.01). All ICD patients were receiving a dopamine agonist when the ICD started (versus 50.9\u00a0% of patients receiving a dopamine agonist in the absence of ICD; p<10(-6)). In mean, ICDs started 2.8\u00a0years before they were diagnosed. No particular dopamine agonist was associated with ICDs more frequently than the others. Discontinuation of the dopamine agonist was the treatment the more frequently associated with the recovery of ICDs (93.3\u00a0%). Dose lowering and the change of dopamine agonist resulted in complete regression of ICDs respectively in 9.1% and 33.3% of patients.\nYoung age, male gender and young age at PD onset are frequent in PD patients developing ICDs, as already described in American or Asian cohorts. We highlighted a long diagnosis delay and confirmed the strong efficacy of dopamine agonist withdrawal.",

Our objective was to study the meaning and significance to people living with PD of their experience of safety events.\nTwenty qualitative interviews were conducted by telephone with purposively sampled individuals with PD, a proxy, or both, throughout New Zealand. Themes identified from the data included joint assessments of the objective and subjective severity of the individual safety events.\nMost of the events indicated minor objective errors, whose severity was sometimes perceived as major, especially in the face of callous communication.\nVariation between objective and subjective assessments of the severity of possible errors indicated by safety events highlight the importance of distinguishing between, and using, both forms of assessment.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of dual time point F-18 FP-CIT PET imaging in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTwenty-four patients with PD (mean age 69.6) and 18 healthy people (mean age 70.26) underwent two sequential PET/CT scans (dual time point imaging) at 90 and 210 min after F-18 FP-CIT injection. Tracer activity of region of interest was measured in the caudate, putamen and a reference region in the brain from both time points. The outcome parameter was the striatooccipital ratio (SOR). Normal SOR values were obtained in the control group. The percent change in tracer activity between 90- and 210-min images was calculated. The SOR values and the percent change in tracer activity were compared between the patients and healthy control group.\nThe SOR values for the caudate, anterior and posterior putamen at both 90- and 210-min images were significantly reduced in the patients with PD. The lowest P value was obtained for the anterior and posterior putamen (p\u2009<\u20090.001) at both time points. There were significant differences of the percent change in tracer activity for the anterior and posterior putamen in the two groups (p\u2009=\u20090.01).\nF-18 FP-CIT PET scans at 90 and 210 min after injection are both able to diagnose PD. Therefore, the 90-min image by itself is sufficient for diagnosing PD.",

In this pilot study, four drivers with PD (selected based on poor road driving performance in the past) participated in a rehabilitation program using a driving simulator. Two different training drives (#1- multiple intersections of varying visibility and traffic load, where an incurring vehicle posed a crash risk, #2- various scenarios on decision making, hazard perception and response) were administered in each session (total 3 sessions once every 1-2 weeks) with immediate feedback after the drives. We observed reduction in crashes in drive #1 and improved scores on drive #2 in the simulator. In addition, 3 subjects showed marked improvements in their total error counts on a standard road test between baseline and post-training sessions, one subject stayed stable. These findings suggest that our simulator training program is feasible and potentially useful in impaired drivers with PD.",

    "abstract": "To explore the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of Bushen Huoxue Decoction (BHD), a traditional Chinese medicinal preparation, on dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) in the brain of rat models of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA total of 120 SD rats were randomized into normal control group, saline model group and BHD-treated group. In the latter two groups, PD rat models were established by direct injection of 6-OHDA to destruct the substantia nigra compact part (SNC) with corresponding treatments. The behavioral changes of the rats were observed. Radioimmunoassay was employed to determine the changes in the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and maximal binding capacity (B(max)) of DRD2, and immunohistochemistry was used to observe the number of the DRD2-positive cells in the brain of the rats.\nBHD can markedly improve the behavioral abnormalities of PD model rats. Compared with those in the saline model group, the B(max) of DRD2 in the damaged hemisphere increased while the Kd of BHD decreased significantly after BHD treatment (P<0.01). The number of DRD2-positive cells in BHD-treated group was significantly higher than that in the model group (80.9\u221313.59 vs 11.15\u22136.78, P<0.01), but showed no significant difference from that in the normal control group (P>0.05).\nBHD can improve the behavioral abnormalities and increase the cerebral expression and affinity of DRD2 in PD rat models.",

    "abstract": "Dementia and cognitive impairment (CI) are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and have important clinical consequences. We explored the prognostic factors for CI in patients with PD.\nA total of 102 patients with PD in Xuan wu hospital and Qian dongnan People's Hospital from 2005 to 2010 were included in this study. All patients underwent clinical and neurological assessments. Relevant demographic and performance parameters were analysed to determine variables that may be independently associated with the progression of CI.\nIn the 6-month follow-up group, CI progressed in three out of 58 cases (5%): two cases progressed from mild CI (MiCI) to moderate CI (MoCI), and one case from MoCI to dementia. In the six-month-to-two-year follow-up group, seven out of 46 cases (15%) worsened: one case developed MiCI, three cases progressed from MiCI to MoCI and three other cases from MoCI to dementia. In the two-to-five-year group, 20 out of 44 cases (45%) worsened with one case developing MiCI, 14 cases progressing from MiCi to MoCI and five cases from MoCI to dementia. Compared with other patients, those with worsening of CI symptoms were significantly older in the two-to-five-year group. Progression of CI was also associated with age at onset and initial staging of PD.\nAdvanced age, late onset of disease and severity of PD are the predictive factors for the progression of CI in PD. The highest probability of progression of CI is in patients with initial severe impairments of visuospatial function.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. Since there are limited treatment options for PD, neuroprotective agents are currently being tested as a means to slow disease progression. Agents targeting oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation are prime candidates for neuroprotection. This review identifies Rasagiline, Minocycline, and creatine, as the most promising neuroprotective agents for PD, and they are all currently in phase III trials. Other agents possessing protective characteristics in delaying PD include stimulants, vitamins, supplements, and other drugs. Additionally, combination therapies also show benefits in slowing PD progression. The identification of neuroprotective agents for PD provides us with therapeutic opportunities for modifying the course of disease progression and, perhaps, reducing the risk of onset when preclinical biomarkers become available.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that Parkinson's disease is not solely affecting the dopaminergic system. Results from biochemical, animal, postmortem, and functional imaging studies have revealed that other neurotransmitter systems are affected as well, including the serotonergic system. With the use of in vivo positron emission tomography functional imaging, it has been shown that serotonergic terminals are affected at a varying, nonlinear degree starting early in the clinical course of Parkinson's disease. Tremor and the majority of nonmotor symptoms do not seem to respond adequately to dopaminergic medication. Recent studies suggest that serotonergic dysfunction has a direct relevance to Parkinson's disease symptoms, the so-called nonmotor symptoms, including depression, fatigue, weight changes, and visual hallucinations. These in vivo findings indicate that agents acting on the serotonergic system could help towards alleviating these symptoms. This paper aims to review the current literature and to highlight the need for further in vivo investigations.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this review was to examine whether chronic Mn exposure produces dopamine neuron degeneration and PD or whether it has a distinct neuropathology and clinical presentation. I reviewed available clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological studies in humans and nonhuman primates exposed to Mn or other human conditions that result in elevated brain Mn concentrations. Human and nonhuman primate literature was examined to compare clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological changes associated with Mn-induced parkinsonism. Clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological evidence was used to examine whether Mn-induced parkinsonism involves degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system as is the case in PD. The overwhelming evidence shows that Mn-induced parkinsonism does not involve degeneration of midbrain dopamine neurons and that l-dopa is not an effective therapy. New evidence is presented on a putative mechanism by which Mn may produce movement abnormalities. Confirmation of this hypothesis in humans is essential to make rational decisions about treatment, devise effective therapeutic strategies, and set regulatory guidelines.",

    "abstract": "The aim of present study was to investigate the risk of heart failure associated with dopamine agonist use in patients with Parkinson's disease. The data sources of this study were four different population-based, healthcare databases in United Kingdom, Italy and Netherlands. A case control study nested within a cohort of Parkinson's disease patients who were new users of either dopamine agonist or levodopa was conducted. Incident cases of heart failure were identified and validated, using Framingham criteria. Controls were matched to cases on age, gender and database. To estimate the risk of newly diagnosed heart failure with ergot and non-ergot derived dopamine agonists, as compared to levodopa, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated through conditional logistic regression. In the cohort of 25,459 Parkinson's disease patients (11,151 new users of dopamine agonists, 14,308 new users of levodopa), 518 incident heart failure cases were identified during follow-up. Compared to levodopa, no increased risk of heart failure was found for ergot dopamine agonists (odds ratio: 1.03; 95% confidence interval: 0.69-1.55). Among non-ergot dopamine agonists, only pramipexole was associated with an increased risk of heart failure (odds ratio: 1.61; 95%confidence interval: 1.09-2.38), especially in the first three months of therapy (odds ratio: 3.06; 95% confidence interval: 1.74-5.39) and in patients aged 80 years and older (odds ratio: 3.30; 95% confidence interval: 1.62-7.13). The results of this study indicate that ergot dopamine agonist use in Parkinson's disease patients was not associated with an increased risk of newly diagnosed heart failure. Among non-ergot dopamine agonists, we observed a statistically significant association between pramipexole use and heart failure, especially during the first months of therapy and in very old patients.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is effective for medically refractory Parkinson's disease. We retrospectively analyzed complications in 180 consecutive patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS. Surgery-related complications were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in 2, chronic subdural hematoma in 1, and transient deterioration of medication-induced psychosis in 2 patients. Device-related complications involved device infection in 5, skin erosion in 5, and implantable pulse generator malfunction in 2 patients. All of these patients required surgical repair. Surgery and device-related complications could be reduced with increased surgical experience and the introduction of new surgical equipment and technology. Treatment or stimulation-related complications were intractable dyskinesia/dystonia in 11, problematic dysarthria in 7, apraxia of eyelid opening (ALO) in 11, back pain in 10, and restless leg syndrome in 6 patients. Neuropsychiatric complications were transient mood changes in some, impulse control disorder in 2, severe depression related to excessive reduction of dopaminergic medications in 2, rapid progression of dementia in 1, and suicide attempts in 2 patients. Most complications were mild and transient. Dysarthria and ALO were the most frequent permanent sequelae after STN-DBS. Treatment-related adverse events may be caused not only by the effect of stimulation effect but also excessive reduction of dopaminergic medication, or progression of the disease. In conclusion, STN-DBS seems to be a relatively safe procedure. Although serious complications with permanent sequelae are rare, significant incidences of adverse effects occur. Physicians engaged in this treatment should have a comprehensive understanding of the probable complications and how to avoid them.",

    "abstract": "''Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) domain containing, Nogo receptor-interacting protein-1'' also known as LINGO-1 is a protein encoded by the LINGO-1 gene in human. LINGO-1 protein has been demonstrated to play a role in the structural plasticity and integrity of dopaminergic neurons as well as their survival in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). The LINGO family includes LINGO-1 to LINGO-4. In two of them, LINGO-1 and LINGO-2 expressions are detectable in the adult mouse brain and appear to be restricted to neuronal tissue. Given the high degree of homology between the LINGO-1 and LINGO-2 proteins, LINGO-1 and its paralog LINGO-2 are reasonable candidate genes for PD. Recently, some variants of LINGO-1 and LINGO-2 have been reported as risk factors for developing PD in some Caucasian populations, but which has not been confirmed in others. In this study we aimed to assess whether the LINGO-2 variant (rs10968280) is associated with PD among Taiwanese. We examined the SNP of LINGO-2 gene (rs10968280 (T > A)) in a total of 457 PD patients (44.9% female) and 378 controls (44.9% female) recruited from neurology clinics at Linkou Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital. The frequencies of rs10968280 genotypes and alleles were similar between the PD and control group. Stratification by age at onset (<50 and \u2265 50 years) and sex also demonstrated no differences in the minor allele (A) frequency in either cohort. We conclude that the LINGO-2 variant rs109668280 does not contribute to the risk of developing PD in Taiwan.",

    "abstract": "The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a frequent target of deep brain stimulation (DBS), which is used to treat patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). However, few studies have assessed the relationship between the STN and the clinical characteristics of PD patients. We identified the STN of 17 PD patients and 7 control subjects using coronal Short TI Inversion Recovery (STIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and estimated the T2 relaxation time (T2) of the STN on the subsequent coronal images that were acquired from T2-weighted MRI. The relationships between the STN T2 measurements and the PD patients' age, disease duration, laterality, and clinical scores were examined. STN T2 measurements tended to be lower in PD patients than in controls, although the difference was not significant. STN T2 measurements were significantly and inversely correlated (p=0.03) with scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part 1, which was applied to evaluate the mentation, behavior, and mood of PD patients. However, no significant correlations were found between the STN T2 measurements and the patients' age, disease duration, laterality, or motor clinical scores. These results suggest that degeneration of the STN in PD patients may contribute to their neuropsychological symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacological intervention is essential for managing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Adherence to medication regimens however is a major problem. Poor adherence leads to significant motor deterioration and inadequate symptom control. This results in poor quality of life. Whilst interventions to improve medication adherence have shown considerable benefit in other chronic conditions, the efficacy of such treatments in Parkinson's disease is less well researched. Many people with Parkinson's disease require substantial support from spouse/caregivers. This often extends to medication taking. Consequently, spouse/caregiver's support for timely medication management is paramount. We aim to investigate the benefit of a novel intervention, Carer Assisted Adherence Therapy, for improving medication adherence and quality of life in people with Parkinson's disease. Adherence therapy may help to optimise the efficacy of anti-parkinsonian agents, subsequently improving clinical outcomes.\nA parallel, randomised controlled trial will be conducted to investigate whether carer assisted adherence therapy is effective for improving medication adherence and quality of life. We aim to recruit 40 patient/carer pairs into each group. Participants will be randomly assigned by the Clinical Research Trials Unit at the University of East Anglia. Adherence therapy is a brief cognitive-behavioural approach aimed at facilitating a process of shared decision making. The central theory is that when patients make shared choices with a professional they are more likely to continue with those choices because they are personally owned and meaningful. Outcomes will be rates of adherence and quality of life, determined by the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-4 and the Parkinson's disease Questionnaire-39 respectively. Assessments will take place post randomisation, immediately post intervention and 12-weeks post randomisation. Primary outcomes are adherence and quality of life at 12-week follow-up. Efficacy will be determined using intention-to-treat analysis. Independent samples t-tests will compare mean changes between groups from baseline to follow-up. Per protocol analysis will be conducted based on individuals with no major protocol deviation. Where imbalances in baseline characteristics are identified, an adjusted analysis will be performed using a regression model. Analysis will be masked to treatment allocation.\nISRCTN: ISRCTN07830951.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are two common neurodegenerative diseases that result in the progressive damage or death of neurons. Environmental agents have the potential to damage the developing and mature nervous system, resulting in neurodegenerative diseases. Heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve coding sequence modifications are referred to as 'epigenetic'. These modifications include DNA methylation and downstream modification of histones. Environmental factors, including heavy metals and dietary folate intake, perturb neurodegenerative genes by epigenetic means, leading to altered gene expression and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases. Research into the genetic control of DNA methylation indicates an allelic skewing in a significant proportion of genes. This phenomenon may determine how an individual's genetic makeup can alter the effect an environmental factor has on their risk of developing neurodegeneration. Finally, preliminary evidence using cell culture and transgenic animal models suggests that whole classes of pan-epigenetic modifiers will have significant protective effects against common neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "As a result of the efficacy of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can survive longer and are thus naturally prone to ageing-related degenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Managing PD and HIV in the same patient may be challenging, as HAART and levodopa interact and may cause intolerable side effects. Concerns about the increased risk of hardware infection in immunocompromised patients submitted to deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) still persist. We report a PD patient with HIV infection who suffered peak-dose dyskinesias and intolerable gastrointestinal side effects while on HAART, prompting its suspension. STN-DBS allowed complete postoperative levodopa withdrawal and HAART restart, without infectious complications after 12 months of follow-up. STN-DBS seems to be a safe procedure in selected patients with both medically refractory PD and HIV infection, and may result in clinical optimization of both conditions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait impairment. So far, very few pharmacological agents have been isolated or developed that effectively inhibit the progression of PD. However, several studies have demonstrated that inflammatory processes play critical roles in PD. Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents may suppress disease progression in PD. 11-Dehydrosinulariolide was isolated from cultured soft corals. The anti-inflammatory effect of this molecule has been observed through suppression of the expression of two main pro-inflammatory proteins: inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage cells. We also found that 11-dehydrosinulariolide significantly reduced 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y). The pharmacological activity of this compound has been studied, and it is associated with the inhibition of 6-OHDA-induced activation of caspase-3 and translocation of nuclear factor kappa B. 11-Dehydrosinulariolide increased the activation of survival-signaling phospho-Akt but not phospho-ERK. The neuroprotective effect of 11-dehydrosinulariolide was assessed here using 6-OHDA-treated SH-SY5Y cells, wherein neuroprotection is mediated through regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Furthermore, 11-dehydrosinulariolide caused a significant decrease in caspase-3/7 activity in comparison to the 6-OHDA-treated group, indicating that 11-dehydrosinulariolide has neuroprotective properties. We conclude that 11-dehydrosinulariolide is a promising candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease through its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory action via PI3K signaling.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), aside from the central lesion, involvement of visceral organs has been proposed as part of the complex clinical picture of the disease. The issue is still poorly understood and relatively unexplored. In this study we used a classic rodent model of nigrostriatal degeneration, induced by the intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), to investigate whether and how a PD-like central dopaminergic denervation may influence hepatic functions. Rats received an intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA or saline (sham), and blood, cerebrospinal fluid, liver and brain samples were obtained for up to 8 weeks after surgery. Specimens were analyzed for changes in cytokine and thyroid hormone levels, as well as liver mitochondrial alterations. Hepatic mitochondria isolated from animals bearing extended nigrostriatal lesion displayed increased ROS production, while membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8) and ATP production were significantly decreased. Reduced ATP production correlated with nigral neuronal loss. Thyroid hormone levels were significantly increased in serum of PD rats compared to sham animals while steady expression of selected cytokines was detected in all groups. Hepatic enzyme functions were comparable in all animals. Our study indicates for the first time that in a rodent model of PD, hepatic mitochondria dysfunctions arise as a consequence of nigrostriatal degeneration, and that thyroid hormone represents a key interface in this CNS-liver interaction. Liver plays a fundamental detoxifying function and a better understanding of PD-related hepatic mitochondrial alterations, which might further promote neurodegeneration, may represent an important step for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Studies demonstrate existence of inflammation in prevalent Parkinson's disease (PD). We assessed associations of baseline levels of inflammatory markers with prevalent PD at baseline (1989) and incident PD identified over 13 years of follow-up of the Cardiovascular Health Study.\nBlood samples at baseline were measured for fibrinogen, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, C-reactive protein, albumin, and white blood cells. The analysis included 60 prevalent and 154 incident PD cases.\nRisk of prevalent PD was significantly higher per doubling of IL-6 among women (odds ratio [OR]=1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0, 2.4) and WBC among men (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.2, 4.9) in multivariate models. Risk of incident PD was not associated with higher levels of any biomarker after adjusting for age, smoking, African American race, and history of diabetes. Inverse associations with incident PD were observed per doubling of C-reactive protein (OR=0.9; 95% CI: 0.8, 1.0) and of fibrinogen among women (OR=0.4; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.8).\nAlthough inflammation exists in PD, it may not represent an etiologic factor. Our findings suggest the need for larger studies that measure inflammatory markers before PD onset.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is often accompanied by postural disorders such as anterior and lateral flexion of the thoracolumbar spine and dropped head. We examined frequencies and clinical correlates of postural disorders in patients with PD.\nWe interviewed 365 consecutive PD patients between 40 and 80 years of age, at Hoehn and Yahr stages 1, 2, 3 and 4, and evaluated postural deformities, including anterior and lateral flexion of the trunk and dropped head as well as other clinical characteristics. Control subjects were 65 age-matched patient spouses without neurological or spinal disorders.\nThere were no differences in age or sex between PD patients and controls. The frequencies of anterior and lateral flexion of the trunk were significantly higher in PD patients than in controls. The frequency and severity of anterior and lateral flexion and the incidence of dropped head increased as the disease progressed. Other factors related to anterior and lateral flexion included age, disease duration, lower MMSE score, lumbago and levodopa equivalent daily dose of dopaminergic drugs. Women tended to develop more severe anterior flexion than men. Anterior flexion severity also correlated with that of lateral flexion and the emergence of dropped head.\nPostural disorders are frequent complications in PD patients and their severity increases with disease progression. Advancing age and disease severity may be the major risks for developing postural disorders.",

    "abstract": "Based on the substantial overlap in clinical and pathological characteristics of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD) with Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) we hypothesized that these disorders might share underlying genetic factors. The contribution of both sequence and copy number variants (CNVs) in known AD and PD genes to the genetic etiology of DLB and PDD however is currently unclear. Therefore, we performed a gene-based mutation analysis of all major AD and PD genes in 99 DLB and 75 PDD patients, including familial and sporadic forms, from Flanders, Belgium. Also, copy number variants in APP, SNCA, and PARK2 were determined. In the AD genes we detected proven pathogenic missense mutations in PSEN1 and PSEN2, and 2 novel missense variants in PSEN2 and MAPT. In the PD genes we identified 1 SNCA duplication, the LRRK2 R1441C founder mutation and 4 novel heterozygous missense variants with unknown pathogenicity. Our results suggest a contribution of established AD and PD genes to the genetic etiology of DLB and PDD though to a limited extent. They do support the hypothesis of a genetic overlap between members of the Lewy body disease spectrum, but additional genes still have to exist.",

    "abstract": "Earlier studies showed neuronal histamine production in the hypothalamic tuberomamillary nucleus to be unchanged in Parkinson's disease (PD), whereas the histamine levels and innervation in the substantia nigra (SN) increased. In the present study we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to assess the changes in the histaminergic system in the SN, caudate nucleus (CN), and putamen (PU) in 7 PD patients and 7 controls. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the histamine receptor-3 (H(3)R), which was localized immunocytochemically in the large pigmented neurons, was significantly decreased in the SN in PD, while histamine receptor-4 (H(4)R)-mRNA expression showed a significant increase in caudate nucleus and PU. In addition, significantly increased mRNA levels of histamine methyltransferase (HMT), a key enzyme involved in histamine metabolism, were found in the SN and in the PU in PD. Moreover, in the SN, the histamine methyltransferase-mRNA showed a strong negative correlation with PD disease duration. Our observations imply the presence of local changes in the histaminergic system that may contribute to PD pathology, and may thus provide a rationale for possible novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently compounded by neuropsychiatric complications, increasing disability. The combined effect of motor and mental status on care-dependency in PD outpatients is not well characterized. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1449 PD outpatients. The assessment comprised the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the diagnostic criteria for dementia. PD severity and treatment complications were rated using Hoehn and Yahr staging and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) IV. The acknowledged level of care-dependency was documented. Care-dependency was present in 18.3% of all patients. A total of 13.9% had dementia, 18.8% had depression, and 14.3% had both. Regression analyses revealed increasing effects of age, PD duration, and PD severity on care-dependency in all three mental-disorder subgroups with the strongest effects in patients with depression only. Depressed patients with antidepressive treatment still had significantly higher PD severity, higher MADRS and UPDRS-IV scores but were not more likely to be care-dependent than non-depressed patients. Older age, longer duration and increased severity of PD contribute to care-dependency in patients with untreated depression. Treatment of depression is associated with lower rates of care-dependency.",

    "abstract": "Sleep symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are frequent and have multifactorial and multilayered causes. Primary involvement of sleep/wake regulating centers in the brainstem, sleep problems caused by the nocturnal manifestation of motor and dysautonomic signs and medication-induced sleep problems are often impossible to disentangle in the individual patient. Two syndromes, hypersomnia and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), are increasingly recognized as harbingers of the core PD motor syndrome. RBD, associated with a panoply of other nonmotor symptoms, may predispose to a specific PD phenotype. Long-acting dopaminergic stimulation, when abating nocturnal akinesia, also improves subjective sleep quantity. While this strategy is backed up by several randomized controlled trials (RCT), other treatment recommendations are mostly based on case series or expert opinion. Thus we identified only two other RCT, one treating insomnia with eszopiclone, the other nocturnal behavioral abnormalities in demented PD patients with memantine. While the causal complexity of sleep problems in PD certainly hampers the design of therapeutic studies, multiple general treatment strategies against sleep disorders can however be applied efficiently in PD patients as well.",

    "abstract": "L-DOPA is the gold standard medication of Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder consequent upon the degeneration of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. The therapeutic efficacy of L-DOPA has been related to its ability to restore dopamine (DA) extracellular levels in the Parkinsonian brain. The origin of the L-DOPA-induced rise in DA has been the object of numerous studies and controversies but the data collectively point to serotonergic (5-HT) neurons as being most significant in the release. Here, we review biochemical and behavioral evidence supporting serotonergic neurons as playing the main role in the actions of L-DOPA, considered from two points of view. The main aspect concerns the biochemical demonstration that 5-HT neurons are almost solely implicated in the release of DA induced by L-DOPA. The mechanism of action of L-DOPA inside 5-HT neurons will be thoroughly dissected on the basis of L-DOPA effects on extracellular versus tissue DA levels. The unique contribution of 5-HT neurons in mediating the release of newly synthesised DA from L-DOPA will be discussed in parallel with DA-dependent behaviors induced by L-DOPA. The other, and neglected, aspect concerns the possible deleterious impact of the presence of L-DOPA inside 5-HT neurons on 5-HT neuronal function. Overall, the fact that 5-HT neurons release the newly synthesised DA from L-DOPA in multiple brain regions beyond the striatum gives new insight into the large impact of L-DOPA in the Parkinsonian brain and strengthens therapeutic perspectives targeting the 5-HT system to reduce both motor and non-motor complications of L-DOPA medication.",

    "abstract": "Rotigotine transdermal patch (Neupro(\u00ae)) [referred to here as rotigotine] is a non-ergolinic dopamine agonist that is available in the EU as monotherapy for the treatment of early Parkinson's disease and as combination therapy with levodopa throughout the course of the disease. Daily application of the rotigotine patch provided predictable release and absorption of rotigotine, with steady-state rotigotine concentrations reached within 1-2 days. In early Parkinson's disease, compared with placebo, rotigotine monotherapy produced significantly greater improvements in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale summed motor and activities of daily living (ADL) scores (primary endpoint), as well as significantly higher response rates. In advanced Parkinson's disease, rotigotine in combination with levodopa reduced 'off' time (primary endpoint) and improved motor functioning and ADL significantly more than levodopa plus placebo. In patients with inadequate early morning motor control despite antiparkinsonian treatment, rotigotine improved morning motor functioning and reduced sleep disturbances, night-time motor symptoms, depressive symptoms, pain and functioning, and quality of life to a significantly greater extent than placebo. The efficacy of rotigotine relative to other treatments requires further evaluation, as there were inconsistent results in noninferiority analyses that compared rotigotine to other dopamine agonists. Rotigotine was generally well tolerated across the trials, with the most common treatment-emergent adverse events being application-site reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, somnolence and headache. No unexpected adverse effects were observed in extension studies of up to 6 years. Thus, rotigotine offers a novel approach to the treatment of Parkinson's disease and, given its ease of administration, efficacy in reducing disabling motor and non-motor symptoms, and acceptable tolerability profile, it has the potential to be an attractive treatment option for this highly debilitating disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, yet despite this, very little is known about the underlying cellular mechanisms. Initially it was thought to be a disease primarily involving loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Recent studies, however, have focused on observations that aggregated \u03b1-synuclein protein, the major component of Lewy bodies, is found throughout the nervous system. It is speculated that misfolded \u03b1-synuclein transfers between cells in a prion-like manner, thereby mediating the spread of the neuropathology. In this review, we discuss the staging (according to Braak) of Parkinson pathology and the concept describing the disease progression from one region of the brain to the other. We highlight how \u03b1-synuclein might be responsible for the spread of the disease. We compare the idea of a prion-like mechanism contributing to Parkinson's disease to emerging concepts that other proteins participate in similar processes in other neurodegenerative diseases. We then examine the future implications of a critical role in disease pathogenesis of \u03b1-synuclein for the classification, diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease in the future.",

However, no comprehensive study of the GIGYF2 gene has been conducted among PD patients from mainland China. In our previous study, the GIGYF2 gene was directly sequenced, and nine missense variants and 14 polymorphisms were identified. For these 14 polymorphisms, in the present study we performed a case\u2013control analysis for 300 PD patients and 200 healthy controls from mainland China. The c.297T>C p.Ala99Ala polymorphism was associated with increased risk with respect to the pathogenesis of sporadic PD.

However, the frequency of RBD in tauopathies such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) remains unclear. In this study, we compared RBD-related symptoms and polysomnographic (PSG) findings between patients with PSP and those with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nWe conducted clinical interviews of 20 patients with PSP, 93 patients with PD and their caregivers regarding RBD-related symptoms, and conducted PSG recordings on all the subject patients. We then compared the clinical backgrounds, PSG parameters, and frequency of RBD-related symptoms between the two groups.\nPSP patients had more severe symptoms of Parkinsonism and cognitive impairment, and took lower doses of dopaminergic agents compared with PD patients. The PSP group had lower values for both estimated total sleep time and sleep efficiency on PSG compared with the PD group (p = 0.002, p = 0.021, respectively). The PSP group also included a significantly smaller number of patients having REM sleep without atonia (RWA) compared with the PD group (n = 5, 20.0% vs. n = 56, 60.2%, p = 0.003). None of the PSP patients were experiencing RBD-related symptoms at the time of the investigation, while 30 PD patients (32.3%) had RBD-related symptoms.\nThe existence of RWA as well as RBD-related symptoms was less frequent in patients with PSP versus patients with PD. Differences in brain stem pathology and/or disease course between the two disorders might influence this difference.",

    "abstract": "The risk of Parkinson's disease is reduced by cigarette smoking, which raises some unanswered questions. Nicotine, a major component of tobacco smoke, could exert either nonreceptor-mediated biological effects or, more importantly, act on the different subtypes of nicotinic brain receptors, in particular those associated with the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. There is now robust experimental evidence for a neuroprotective effect of nicotine upon dopaminergic neurons. By contrast, in animal models of Parkinson's disease, nicotine alone has slight or no motor effects. However, nicotine may modulate dopamine transmission and has clear motor effects when associated with L-DOPA, reducing L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Clinical trials have yielded inconclusive results thus far and are hampered by different designs and small cohorts. Ongoing studies address either symptomatic motor or nonmotor symptoms, or neuroprotection. There is still no agreement on the daily dosage of nicotine or the method of administration. Together, these data suggest that nicotine or nicotinic receptor drugs have therapeutic potential for Parkinson's disease, although the specific treatment regimens remain to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease is a degenerative neurological condition that causes movement problems and other distressing symptoms. People with Parkinson's disease gradually lose their independence and strain is placed on family members. A multidisciplinary approach to rehabilitation for people with Parkinson's is recommended but has not been widely researched. Studies are needed that investigate cost-effective community-based service delivery models to reduce disability and dependency and admission to long term care, and improve quality of life.\nA pragmatic three parallel group randomised controlled trial involving people with Parkinson's Disease and live-in carers (family friends or paid carers), and comparing: management by a specialist multidisciplinary team for six weeks, according to a care plan agreed between the professionals and the patient and carer (Group A); multidisciplinary team management and additional support for four months from a trained care assistant (Group B); usual care, no coordinated team care planning or ongoing support (Group C). Follow up will be for six months to determine the impact and relative cost-effectiveness of the two interventions, compared to usual care. The primary outcomes are disability (patients) and strain (carers). Secondary outcomes include patient mobility, falls, speech, pain, self efficacy, health and social care use; carer general health; patient and carer social functioning, psychological wellbeing, health related quality of life. Semi structured interviews will be undertaken with providers (team members, care assistants), service commissioners, and patients and carers in groups A and B, to gain feedback about the acceptability of the interventions. A cost - effectiveness evaluation is embedded in the trial.\nThe trial investigates components of recent national policy recommendations for people with long term conditions, and Parkinson's Disease in particular, and will provide guidance to inform local service planning and commissioning.\nISRCTN: ISRCTN44577970.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease frequently suffer from impaired autonomic nervous function. To elucidate the effects of the induction of anesthesia with propofol on cardiovascular hemodynamics has become important, since the number of patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing deep brain stimulation under general anesthesia has increased recently.\nEffects of induction with propofol in patients with Parkinson's disease on cardiovascular hemodynamics and autonomic nervous activity were compared with those of the control patients. Moreover, possible different effect on hemodynamics between the propofol alone and the combination of propofol and fentanyl for the induction were examined in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nAlthough heart rate or blood pressure was not different between patients with Parkinson's disease and the control patients before the induction, sympathetic vasomotor activity was lower in patients with Parkinson's disease than the control patients. The induction of anesthesia significantly decreased blood pressure in patients with Parkinson's disease. However the decreasing systolic blood pressure after the induction of anesthesia was more marked in patients with Parkinson's disease than the control patients. We did not find differences in the changes of blood pressure between the propofol alone and the combination of propofol and fentanyl in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nNo abnormal responses to the induction of anesthesia with propofol were found in the patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine promotes the execution of positively reinforced actions, but its role for the formation of behaviour when feedback is unavailable remains open. To study this issue, the performance of treated/untreated patients with Parkinson's disease and controls was analysed in an implicit learning task, hypothesising dopamine-dependent adherence to hidden task rules. Sixteen patients on/off levodopa and fourteen healthy subjects engaged in a Go/NoGo paradigm comprising four equiprobable stimuli. One of the stimuli was defined as target which was first consistently preceded by one of the three non-target stimuli (conditioning), whereas this coupling was dissolved thereafter (deconditioning). Two task versions were presented: in a 'Go version', only the target cue required the execution of a button press, whereas non-target stimuli were not instructive of a response; in a 'NoGo version', only the target cue demanded the inhibition of the button press which was demanded upon any non-target stimulus. Levodopa influenced in which task version errors grew from conditioning to deconditioning: in unmedicated patients just as controls errors only rose in the NoGo version with an increase of incorrect responses to target cues. Contrarily, in medicated patients errors went up only in the Go version with an increase of response omissions to target cues. The error increases during deconditioning can be understood as a perpetuation of reaction tendencies acquired during conditioning. The levodopa-mediated modulation of this carry-over effect suggests that dopamine supports habit conditioning under the task demand of response execution, but dampens it when inhibition is required. However, other than in reinforcement learning, supporting dopaminergic actions referred to the most frequent, i. e., non-target behaviour. Since this is passive whenever selective actions are executed against an inactive background, dopaminergic treatment could in according scenarios contribute to passive behaviour in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable age-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although common, the etiology of PD remains poorly understood. Genetic studies infer that the disease results from a complex interaction between genetics and environment and there is growing evidence that PD may represent a constellation of diseases with overlapping yet distinct underlying mechanisms. Novel clinical approaches will require a better understanding of the mechanisms at work within an individual as well as methods to identify the specific array of mechanisms that have contributed to the disease. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) strategies provide an opportunity to directly study the affected neuronal subtypes in a given patient. Here we report the generation of iPSC-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons from a patient with a triplication in the \u03b1-synuclein gene (SNCA). We observed that the iPSCs readily differentiated into functional neurons. Importantly, the PD-affected line exhibited disease-related phenotypes in culture: accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein, inherent overexpression of markers of oxidative stress, and sensitivity to peroxide induced oxidative stress. These findings show that the dominantly-acting PD mutation is intrinsically capable of perturbing normal cell function in culture and confirm that these features reflect, at least in part, a cell autonomous disease process that is independent of exposure to the entire complexity of the diseased brain.",

    "abstract": "Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-I) belong to the earliest drugs tried in Parkinson's disease (PD). They have been used with or without levodopa (L-DOPA). Non-selective MAO-I due to their side-effect/adverse reaction profile, like tranylcypromine have limited use in the treatment of depression in PD, while selective, reversible MAO-A inhibitors are recommended due to their easier clinical handling. For the treatment of akinesia and motor fluctuations selective irreversible MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline are recommended. They are safe and well tolerated at the recommended daily doses. Their main differences are related to (1) metabolism, (2) interaction with CYP-enzymes and (3) quantitative properties at the molecular biological/genetic level. Rasagiline is more potent in clinical practise and has a hypothesis driven more favourable side effect/adverse reaction profile due to its metabolism to aminoindan. Both selegiline and rasagiline have a neuroprotective and neurorestaurative potential. A head-to head clinical trial would be of utmost interest from both the clinical outcome and a hypothesis-driven point of view. Selegiline is available as tablet and melting tablet for PD and as transdermal selegiline for depression, while rasagiline is marketed as tablet for PD. In general, the clinical use of MAO-I nowadays is underestimated. There should be more efforts to evaluate their clinical potency as antidepressants and antidementive drugs in addition to the final proof of their disease-modifying potential. In line with this are recent innovative developments of MAO-I plus inhibition of acetylcholine esterase for Alzheimer's disease as well as combined MAO-I and iron chelation for PD.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes has been associated with chronic neurodegeneration. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between pre-existing diabetes and Parkinson's disease (PD).\nOriginal articles in English published up to 10 May 2011 were searched for in electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Scopus) and by reviewing references of eligible articles. Prospective cohort and case-control studies providing risk and precision estimates relating to pre-existing diabetes and PD were considered eligible.\nNine studies/1,947 citations (cohort, N = 4; case-control, N = 5) fulfilled inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. In prospective studies, the onset of diabetes before onset of PD was found to be a risk factor for future PD (relative risk [RR] = 1.37 [95%CI 1.21-1.55]; P < 0.0001). This association was confirmed by secondary analyses based on estimates derived after the exclusion of participants who had vascular disease at baseline and/or who developed vascular disease during follow-up (RR = 1.34 [1.14-1.58]; P < 0.001) and by sensitivity analyses addressing the association with diabetes at baseline or during follow-up. However, the association found for case-control studies was not significant (odds ratio [OR] 0.75 [95%CI 0.50-1.11]; P = 0.835). Sensitivity analysis based on estimates adjusted for BMI confirmed the lack of a relationship between PD and diabetes (OR 0.56 [0.28-1.15]; P = 0.089).\nAlthough data from cohort studies suggest that diabetes is a risk factor for PD, there is no conclusive evidence on this association. Further prospective studies focused on putative pathogenic pathways and taking a broad range of confounders into account is required to clarify this relationship.",

The coefficient of variance for interval length and the change in interval length with successive utterances were used to describe pace stability.\nAtaxic and parkinsonian patients both showed a significant instability of vocal pace performance. Ataxic speakers featured difficulties in keeping the pace immediately from the beginning of the task, whereas parkinsonian patients accelerated the pace in the course of the performance. The results support differential roles of cerebellar and basal ganglia pathways in motor speech performance.\nCerebellar function may be required for the general precision of interval timing, whereas basal ganglia rather serve to maintain rhythm stability over time.",

The novel findings from this study significantly increased normal rapid eye movement sleep, and decreased abnormal rapid eye movement sleep without atonia after deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease. The improved total sleep scale score correlated with decreased wakefulness after sleep onset. Moreover, improved daytime sleepiness correlated with increased normal rapid eye movement sleep time. Sleep improvement did not significantly correlate with resolution of motor complication or reduced dopaminergic dosages.\nSubthalamic nucleus-deep brain stimulation may have beneficial effects on sleep disturbance in advanced Parkinson's disease by restoring sleep architecture and normal rapid eye movement sleep.",

    "abstract": "Animal experimentation in the Parkinson's disease (PD) field is a classic example of how the use of animal models to study diseases can have a significant impact on human health. Among the different neurotoxin-based animal models of PD that are presently available, the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) models have been established and validated as useful models for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed to treat motor symptoms and to study alterations of the basal ganglia that occur in this disease. The 6-OHDA rat model and the MPTP primate model have contributed enormously to translate animal experimentation into clinical practice, including pharmacological treatments and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. These models, along with the MPTP mouse model, are helping to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration in PD. The roles of oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and impairment of the protein degradation pathways have also come under careful consideration thanks to these models. The more recently developed paraquat and rotenone rodent models are also contributing to our understanding of neuronal cell death. However, none of the neuroprotective strategies that have worked in the pre-clinical stage have thus far been successfully translated to a clinical setting to treat PD patients. At the same time, the lack of any effective neuroprotective strategy for PD is preventing the validation of any one particular model as a screening tool for such neuroprotective strategies. Therefore, it seems that we are trapped in a vicious circle that casts doubt on the suitability of the neurotoxin-based models for this purpose. Here, we discuss how epidemiological data may help to validate a specific model with data linking a lower risk of developing PD with nutritional/consumption habits or with a specific chronic drug therapy.",

    "abstract": "Research suggests overlap in brain regions undergoing neurodegeneration in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. To assess the clinical significance of this, we applied a validated Alzheimer's disease-spatial pattern of brain atrophy to patients with Parkinson's disease with a range of cognitive abilities to determine its association with cognitive performance and decline. At baseline, 84 subjects received structural magnetic resonance imaging brain scans and completed the Dementia Rating Scale-2, and new robust and expanded Dementia Rating Scale-2 norms were applied to cognitively classify participants. Fifty-nine non-demented subjects were assessed annually with the Dementia Rating Scale-2 for two additional years. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were quantified using both a region of interest approach and voxel-based morphometry analysis, and a method for quantifying the presence of an Alzheimer's disease spatial pattern of brain atrophy was applied to each scan. In multivariate models, higher Alzheimer's disease pattern of atrophy score was associated with worse global cognitive performance (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.31, P\u2009=\u20090.007), including in non-demented patients (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.28, P\u2009=\u20090.05). In linear mixed model analyses, higher baseline Alzheimer's disease pattern of atrophy score predicted long-term global cognitive decline in non-demented patients [F(1,\u2009110)\u2009=\u20099.72, P\u2009=\u20090.002], remarkably even in those with normal cognition at baseline [F(1,\u200980)\u2009=\u20094.71, P\u2009=\u20090.03]. In contrast, in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses there was no association between region of interest brain volumes and cognitive performance in patients with Parkinson's disease with normal cognition. These findings support involvement of the hippocampus and parietal-temporal cortex with cognitive impairment and long-term decline in Parkinson's disease. In addition, an Alzheimer's disease pattern of brain atrophy may be a preclinical biomarker of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common disease which occurs in aged people with chronic, progressive degenerative character of the central nervous system. Until now there is no effective treatment method in PD patients before they show obvious symptoms for prevention and early diagnosis. In order to find out early disease specific biomarkers, two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry coupled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling was employed to quantitatively identify the differentially expressed proteins among the different disease progress types of PD. 26 proteins were differentially expressed in a total of 258 identified proteins by proteomic techniques. The expression level of eight proteins which included sero-transferrin and clusterin increased. The expression level of eighteen proteins which include complement component 4B, apolipoprotein A-I, \u03b1-2-antiplasmin and coagulation factor V decreased. Those proteins may be associated with oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal protein aggregation and inflammation. In this study, the expression level of apolipoprotein A-I decreased, particularly in the early stage of PD patients. This protein regulated not only the lipid metabolism in the central nervous system, but also influenced the deposition process of proteins which are involved in neural degenerative diseases, such as the pathogenesis of PD.",

It may also serve as a paradigm to screen for potential therapeutic reagents treating these diseases. Here, we developed an automated, 96-well plate and liquid phase based system that quantifies nematode motor activity in real time. Using this system, we identified an adult-onset, ageing-associated motor activity loss in a transgenic nematode line expressing human pathogenic G2019S mutant LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), the leading genetic cause of Parkinson's disease characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration associated motor deficient mainly in elder citizens. Thus, our system may be used as a platform to screen for potential therapeutic drugs treating Parkinson's disease. It can also be used to monitor motor activity of nematodes in liquid phase at similar scenario.",

Consequently, this study sought to investigate how people with PD perceive the cause and controllability of their ICB.\n\u2003The study utilized qualitative methodology involving semi-structured interviews. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) allowed an in-depth exploration of the subjective experience of ICBs.\n\u2003Ten people with idiopathic PD and current or recent history of ICBs were recruited from an existing research participant pool.\n\u2003The themes that arose from the participants' accounts were 'Conflicting views on causality', 'Impulse control behaviours as a coping strategy', and 'The relationship between causal attribution and perceived controllability'.\n\u2003Participants' beliefs about the cause of ICBs varied from externalized cause (medication) to internalized (coping with the impact of PD). These causal attributions were fundamental to the perceived controllability of the behaviours and psychological benefits. Further research is warranted to explore a psychosocial viewpoint of this feature of PD and to provide appropriate and effective biopsychosocial interventions.",

    "abstract": "While several genes have been identified to cause Parkinson's disease (PD), monogenic forms explain only a small proportion of cases. We report clinical and genetic results in a large family with late-onset autosomal dominant PD.\nThirty-eight family members of a five-generation Northern German PD family underwent a detailed neurologic examination, and transcranial sonography was performed in fifteen of them. Comprehensive mutation analysis of known PD-causing genes and a genome-wide linkage analysis were performed.\nLate-onset definite PD was found in five subjects with a mean age at onset of 63 years. Another six individuals presented either with probable/possible PD or with subtle parkinsonian signs. Six members with a mean age of 79 years had an essential tremor phenotype. Mode of PD inheritance was compatible with autosomal dominant transmission. One of three examined patients with definite PD demonstrated an increased area of substantia nigra hyperechogenicity upon transcranial sonography. Comprehensive linkage and mutational analysis excluded mutations in known PD-causing genes. Genome-wide linkage analysis suggested a putative disease gene in an 11.3-Mb region on chromosome 7p15-21.1 with a multipoint LOD score of 2.0.\nThe findings in this family further demonstrate genetic heterogeneity in familial autosomal dominant late-onset PD.",

This study investigates whether improvement for particular PD symptoms varies differentially with respect to stimulation location in the STN.\nTen PD patients treated with bilateral STN DBS were enrolled in the study. Each electrode contact was stimulated independently to assess for changes in tremor, bradykinesia, and gait. Electrode contacts were localized via MRI. A novel iterative volumetric analysis was used to search the contact space for stimulation regions corresponding to alleviation of specific symptoms.\nTremor was best controlled with DBS applied to the more dorsal, anterior, and medial areas of the contact space. Improvement in bradykinesia was seen largely within the middle of the contact space. Gait improvement was observed with ventral contacts, likely bordering the ventral boundaries of the STN.\nThe iterative volumetric analysis is a valuable tool in identifying anatomic regions responsive to DBS across a subject population treated for PD. In the subjects tested, overlapping efficacy for all symptoms was observed in the region of the STN, but anatomic variances in the responsiveness for tremor, bradykinesia, and gait were found.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene encoding DJ-1 have been identified in patients with familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and are thought to inactivate a neuroprotective function. Oxidation of the sulfhydryl group to a sulfinic acid on cysteine residue C106 of DJ-1 yields the \"2O \" form, a variant of the protein with enhanced neuroprotective function. We hypothesized that some familial mutations disrupt DJ-1 activity by interfering with conversion of the protein to the 2O form. To address this hypothesis, we developed a novel quantitative mass spectrometry approach to measure relative changes in oxidation at specific sites in mutant DJ-1 as compared with the wild-type protein. Treatment of recombinant wild-type DJ-1 with a 10-fold molar excess of H(2)O(2) resulted in a robust oxidation of C106 to the sulfinic acid, whereas this modification was not detected in a sample of the familial PD mutant M26I exposed to identical conditions. Methionine oxidized isoforms of wild-type DJ-1 were depleted, presumably as a result of misfolding and aggregation, under conditions that normally promote conversion of the protein to the 2O form. These data suggest that the M26I familial substitution and methionine oxidation characteristic of sporadic PD may disrupt DJ-1 function by disfavoring a site-specific modification required for optimal neuroprotective activity. Our findings indicate that a single amino acid substitution can markedly alter a protein's ability to undergo oxidative modification, and they imply that stimulating the conversion of DJ-1 to the 2O form may be therapeutically beneficial in familial or sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus is an accepted therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). In animal models, pharmacologic ablation and stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus have resulted in clinical improvement and, in some cases, improved survival of dopaminergic neurons. DBS has not been studied in the early stages of PD, but early application should be explored to evaluate safety, efficacy, and the potential to alter disease progression.\nWe are conducting a prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial of optimal drug therapy (ODT) compared to medication plus DBS (ODT + DBS) in subjects with Hoehn & Yahr Stage II idiopathic PD who are without motor fluctuations or dementia. We report here subject screening, enrollment, baseline characteristics, and adverse events.\n30 subjects (average age 60 \u00b1 6.9 years, average duration of medicine 2.1 \u00b1 1.3 years, average UPDRS-III scores 14.9 on medication and 27.0 off medication) are enrolled in the ongoing study. Twelve of 15 subjects randomized to DBS experienced perioperative adverse events, the majority of which were related to the procedure or device and resolved without sequelae. Frequently reported adverse events included wound healing problems, headache, edema, and confusion.\nThis report demonstrates that subjects with early stage PD can be successfully recruited, consented and retained in a long-term clinical trial of DBS. Our ongoing pilot investigation will provide important preliminary safety and tolerability data concerning the application of DBS in early stage PD.",

    "abstract": "Significant efforts have been focused on investigating the contribution of common variants to Parkinson disease (PD) risk. Several independent GWAS and metanalysis studies have shown a genome-wide significant association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) regions. Here we investigated the role of SNCA and MAPT as PD susceptibility genes in a large Italian population of 904 patients and 891 controls. An evaluation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in association with PD was also attempted.\nThe SNCA Rep1 microsatellite was genotyped by a fluorescent PCR assay, whereas the SNPlex genotyping system was used to genotype 12 additional markers across the SNCA gene, and 2 SNPs tagging the risk MAPT H1 haplotype.\nSingle-marker analysis demonstrated nominal evidence of association for: i) the 261-bp-long allele of Rep1; ii) 7 SNPs in the SNCA region (top SNP: rs356186, P = 3.08 \u00d7 10(-04), intron 4); iii) both SNPs identifying the MAPT H1 haplotype (P = 4.63 \u00d7 10(-04) and P = 4.23 \u00d7 10(-04) for rs1800547 and rs9468, respectively). Moreover, we found a highly significant protective haplotype spanning \u223c83 kb from intron 4 to the 3' end of SNCA (P = 1.29 \u00d7 10(-05)).\nOur findings strongly confirm SNCA and MAPT as major PD susceptibility genes for idiopathic PD in the Italian population. Interaction analyses did not evidence either epistatic effects between the two loci or gene-environment interactions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology. The characteristic \u03b1-synuclein aggregation of PD is also a feature of Sanfilippo syndrome, a storage disorder caused by \u03b1-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) gene mutations. We explored genetic links between these disorders and studied the pathology of Sanfilippo syndrome to investigate a common pathway toward \u03b1-synuclein aggregation.\nWe typed the 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms that tag the common haplotypes of NAGLU in 926 PD patients and 2308 controls and also stained cortical tissue from 2 cases of Sanfilippo A syndrome using the anti-\u03b1-synuclein antibody, Per7.\nAllelic analysis showed an association between rs2071046 and risk for PD (P 1.3 \u00d7 10(-3) ). Intracellular \u03b1-synuclein accumulation was observed in the cortical tissue of both Sanfilippo A syndrome cases.\nThis study suggests a possible role of NAGLU in susceptibility to PD while extending evidence for \u03b1-synuclein aggregation in the brain in lysosomal storage disorders. Our findings support a mechanism involving lysosomal dysfunction more generally in the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computerized tomography can visualize dopaminergic degeneration in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. Some studies have suggested that dopamine transporter imaging can distinguish these disorders based on a more diffuse and symmetric striatal dopamine transporter binding loss in multiple system atrophy. The present study compared patterns of striatal dopamine transporter distribution in postmortem-confirmed Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. Patients with a postmortem diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (n = 6) or Parkinson's disease (n = 8) who had undergone dopamine transporter imaging were included. Imaging had been performed after a mean disease duration of 3.6 and 4.1 years in multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease, respectively. Visual analysis showed bilaterally reduced binding in all patients. Mean overall striatal binding was reduced by 53% in multiple system atrophy and 52% in Parkinson's disease. There was a trend for greater asymmetry of striatal binding in multiple system atrophy compared with Parkinson's disease (23% \u00b1 15% vs 10.5% \u00b1 7%, respectively; P = .071), with 3 multiple system atrophy patients showing more asymmetry of striatal binding than any Parkinson's disease patient. Putamen/caudate binding ratios did not differ between the groups. This is the first study comparing dopamine transporter imaging in autopsy-confirmed multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease. Unexpectedly, we found a tendency for greater asymmetry of striatal binding in multiple system atrophy than in Parkinson's disease. Our findings demonstrate that these conditions cannot be differentiated by subregional analysis of striatal dopamine transporter binding.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between syncope or presyncope occurrence and dysfunction of the cardiovascular autonomic system in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nTwenty-four PD patients were studied, including 10 subjects with syncope/presyncope and 14 con-trols without those symptoms. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), Holter electrocardiographic monitoring, carotid sinus massage, tilt test, and cardiac scintigraphy with 123I metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) were performed.\nDifferences between the two groups were found in myocardial scintigraphy and ABPM. The stepwise regression analyses suggest that the values of late phase reduced uptake of MIBG (95% CI: 0.0-0.77; p < 0.05) and day-time minimum systolic blood pressure (95% CI: 0.78-0.98; p = 0.007) may be related to the occurrence of syncope/presyncope.\nThe findings suggest an association between syncope/presyncope occurrence and dysfunction of the cardiovascular autonomic system in PD patients. Both 123I MIBG myocardial scintigraphy and ABPM may help identify a group of patients with an elevated risk for syncopic episodes which, in turn, may affect the choice of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Prior work suggested that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a lower Body Mass Index (BMI) than controls, but evidence is inconclusive. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis on BMI in PD. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl and Scopus to identify cohort studies on BMI in PD, published before February 2011. Studies that reported mean BMI for PD patients and healthy controls were eligible. Twelve studies were included, with a total of 871 patients and 736 controls (in three studies controls consisted of subjects from other published studies). Our primary aim was to assess differences in BMI between patients and controls; this was analyzed with random effects meta-analysis. Our secondary aim was to evaluate the relation with disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr stage) and disease duration, using random effects meta-regression. PD patients had a significantly lower BMI than controls (overall effect 1.73, 95% CI 1.11-2.35, P<0.001). Pooled data of seven studies showed that patients with Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 had a lower BMI than patients with stage 2 (3.9, 95% CI 0.1-7.7, P<0.05). Disease duration was not associated with BMI. Because a low body weight is associated with negative health effects and a poorer prognosis, monitoring weight and nutritional status should be part of PD management.",

    "abstract": "Neurons are specialized cells with unique features, including a constant high demand for energy. Mitochondria satisfy this constant demand, and are emerging as a central target for dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease. PPAR\u03b3 co-activator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) is a transcription co-activator for nuclear receptors such as the PPARs, and thereby coordinates a number of gene expression programs to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation. Studies of PGC-1\u03b1 knock-out mice have yielded important insights into the role of PGC-1\u03b1 in normal nervous system function and potentially neurological disease. HD is caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the huntingtin protein, and decades of work have established mitochondrial dysfunction as a key feature of HD pathogenesis. However, after the discovery of the HD gene, numerous reports produced strong evidence for altered transcription in HD. In 2006, a series of studies revealed that PGC-1\u03b1 transcription interference contributes to HD neurodegeneration, linking the nuclear transcriptionopathy with the mitochondrial dysfunction. Subsequent work has strengthened this view, and further extended the role of PGC-1\u03b1 within the CNS. Within the last year, studies of Parkinson's disease, another involuntary movement disorder long associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, have shown that PGC-1\u03b1 dysregulation is contributing to its pathogenesis. As PGC-1\u03b1 is likely also important for aging, a process with considerable relevance to neuron function, translational studies aimed at developing therapies based upon the PGC-1\u03b1 pathway as a high priority target are underway.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the interaction of different treadmill-induced gait velocities and visual cues on the gait performance in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nExternal cuing has been reported to facilitate hypokinetic gait patterns in PD.\n19 PD-patients and 17 controls volunteered for the study. Gait analyses were conducted using dynamic pressure sensors integrated in a treadmill at a given velocity of 1, 2, 3 or 4 km/h. For each velocity, measurements were performed under three conditions. The first condition was without visual cuing, the remaining two consisted of visual cuing e.g. white stripes put on the treadmill belt 25 or 50 cm apart.\nVisual cuing lowered the cadence and increased stride length and stride time while maintaining gait velocity in both PD-patients and controls. A significant interaction between this effect of visual cuing and gait velocity was observed. Visual cuing demonstrated a clear velocity-dependency with less influence on cadence, stride length, stride time and coefficient of variation in stride time at higher velocities. At lower velocities visual cuing was more effective in reducing gait variability as assessed by the coefficient of variation in stride time in PD-patients than in controls.\nThe current experiment shows that the gait patterns of PD-patients are not rigidly coupled to gait velocity and can be manipulated with visual cuing techniques. Our results suggest that visual cuing can improve the efficacy of treadmill training. Due to an interaction between the effect of visual cuing and gait velocity, the application of visual cues could enhance the efficacy of treadmill training particularly at lower velocities.",

    "abstract": "A recent study reporting significantly reduced symmetry in arm swing amplitude in early Parkinson's disease (PD), as measured during single strides in a gait laboratory, led to this investigation of arm swing symmetry and coordination over many strides using wearable accelerometers in PD.\nForearm accelerations were recorded while eight early PD subjects and eight Controls performed 8-min walking trials. Arm swing asymmetry (ASA), maximal cross-correlation (MXC), and instantaneous relative phase (IRP) of bilateral arm swing were compared between PD and Controls. Correlations between arm swing measurements (ASA and MXC) and Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores were estimated.\nPD subjects demonstrated significantly higher ASA (p=0.002) and lower MXC (p<0.001) than Controls. The IRP probability distribution for PD was significantly different than Controls (p<0.001), with an angular standard deviation of 67.2\u00b0 for PD and 50.6\u00b0 for Controls. Among PD subjects, ASA was significantly correlated with the UPDRS score for the limbs (R(2)=0.58, p=0.049), whereas MXC was significantly correlated with the tremor subscore of the limbs (R(2)=0.64, p=0.031).\nThe study confirms previously reported higher arm swing asymmetry in PD but also shows there is significantly lower MXC and greater IRP variability, suggesting that reduction in bilateral arm coordination may contribute to clinically observed asymmetry in PD. The differential correlation of clinical measures of motor disability with measurements of arm swing during gait is intriguing and deserves further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) was recently found to be associated with HLA in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Follow-up GWAS's replicated the PD-HLA association but their top hits differ. Do the different hits tag the same locus or is there more than one PD-associated variant within HLA? We show that the top GWAS hits are not correlated with each other (0.00\u2264r(2)\u22640.15). Using our GWAS (2000 cases, 1986 controls) we conducted step-wise conditional analysis on 107 SNPs with P<10(-3) for PD-association; 103 dropped-out, four remained significant. Each SNP, when conditioned on the other three, yielded P(SNP1)\u200a=\u200a5\u00d710(-4), P(SNP2)\u200a=\u200a5\u00d710(-4), P(SNP3)\u200a=\u200a4\u00d710(-3) and P(SNP4)\u200a=\u200a0.025. The four SNPs were not correlated (0.01\u2264r(2)\u22640.20). Haplotype analysis (excluding rare SNP2) revealed increasing PD risk with increasing risk alleles from OR\u200a=\u200a1.27, P\u200a=\u200a5\u00d710(-3) for one risk allele to OR\u200a=\u200a1.65, P\u200a=\u200a4\u00d710(-8) for three. Using additional 843 cases and 856 controls we replicated the independent effects of SNP1 (P(conditioned-on-SNP4)\u200a=\u200a0.04) and SNP4 (P(conditioned-on-SNP1)\u200a=\u200a0.04); SNP2 and SNP3 could not be replicated. In pooled GWAS and replication, SNP1 had OR(conditioned-on-SNP4)\u200a=\u200a1.23, P(conditioned-on-SNP4)\u200a=\u200a6\u00d710(-7); SNP4 had OR(conditioned-on-SNP1)\u200a=\u200a1.18, P(conditioned-on-SNP1)\u200a=\u200a3\u00d710(-3); and the haplotype with both risk alleles had OR\u200a=\u200a1.48, P\u200a=\u200a2\u00d710(-12). Genotypic OR increased with the number of risk alleles an individual possessed up to OR\u200a=\u200a1.94, P\u200a=\u200a2\u00d710(-11) for individuals who were homozygous for the risk allele at both SNP1 and SNP4. SNP1 is a variant in HLA-DRA and is associated with HLA-DRA, DRB5 and DQA2 gene expression. SNP4 is correlated (r(2)\u200a=\u200a0.95) with variants that are associated with HLA-DQA2 expression, and with the top HLA SNP from the IPDGC GWAS (r(2)\u200a=\u200a0.60). Our findings suggest more than one PD-HLA association; either different alleles of the same gene, or separate loci.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is inversely associated with cigarette smoking, but its relation with passive smoking or environmental tobacco smoke exposure is rarely examined.\nWithin a case-control study, we assessed the association between Parkinson's disease and living or working with active smokers. Cases were newly diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n = 154) from western Washington State in 2002-2008. Age- and sex-matched controls (n = 173) were neurologically normal and unrelated to cases.\nCompared with never active or passive tobacco smokers, we observed reduced Parkinson's disease risks for ever passive only smokers (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.73), similar to those for ever active smokers (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.73). Among persons whose only tobacco smoke exposure was passive smoking at home, risk was inversely associated with years exposed.\nThese observations parallel those well established for active smoking. However, it remains unresolved whether a true protective effect of tobacco smoke, generally detrimental to health, underlies these associations.",

    "abstract": "Previous clinical trials have evaluated the association between Parkin p.Ser167Asn (c.601G>A) variant and Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. However, the results remain conflicting rather than conclusive. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to assess whether pooled results show the association. We performed structured literature searches for studies addressing the association between the Parkin p.Ser167Asn variant and PD risk. We conducted analyses of study characteristics, heterogeneity, and funnel plot asymmetry in analyses analogous to additive, dominant, recessive, and general genetic models with the odds ratio (OR) as the measure of association. When 15 eligible studies (n\u2009=\u20094,739 subjects) were pooled into the meta-analysis, there was no evidence for significant association in additive genetic model between Parkin p. Ser167Asn variant and PD risk (OR\u2009=\u20091.02, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20090.83-1.25; P\u2009=\u20090.866). The OR for the dominant model was 1.06 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.80-1.41) while the OR for the recessive model was 0.90 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.71-1.14). The OR for the heterozygous was 1.07 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.80-1.43) while the OR for the homozygotes was 1.19 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.81-1.74). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no significant association was found in any genetic model. Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test provided visual and statistical evidences for funnel plot symmetry, suggesting no presence of publication bias. In summary, the meta-analysis strongly suggests that Parkin p. Ser167Asn variant is not associated with PD risk.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients often develop psychotic symptoms that severely affect quality of life and limit the use of medications to ameliorate motor symptoms. Psychotic symptoms are a major cause for nursing home placement. While these symptoms do not always require treatment, they often do but antipsychotic drugs all share the common pharmacological mechanism of blocking dopamine D2 receptors which may worsen motor problems in this very vulnerable population. Double blind, placebo controlled trials (DBPCT) have shown that clozapine is effective at controlling the psychotic symptoms at doses far below those used in schizophrenia, without worsening motor function, even improving tremor. DBPCT have demonstrated that olanzapine worsens motor function without improving psychosis. Quetiapine has been shown in DBPCT to be free of motor side effects in PD patients but not effective, whereas many open label studies have indicated that quetiapine is effective. The other atypical have been the subjects of conflicting open label reports. The effects of the atypicals in PD psychosis is reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Signs or symptoms of impaired autonomic regulation of circulation often attend Parkinson disease (PD). This review covers biomarkers and mechanisms of autonomic cardiovascular abnormalities in PD and related alpha-synucleinopathies. The clearest clinical laboratory correlate of dysautonomia in PD is loss of myocardial noradrenergic innervation, detected by cardiac sympathetic neuroimaging. About 30-40% of PD patients have orthostatic hypotension (OH), defined as a persistent, consistent fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg within 3 min of change in position from supine to standing. Neuroimaging evidence of cardiac sympathetic denervation is universal in PD with OH (PD+OH). In PD without OH about half the patients have diffuse left ventricular myocardial sympathetic denervation, a substantial minority have partial denervation confined to the inferolateral or apical walls, and a small number have normal innervation. Among patients with partial denervation the neuronal loss invariably progresses over time, and in those with normal innervation at least some loss eventually becomes evident. Thus, cardiac sympathetic denervation in PD occurs independently of the movement disorder. PD+OH also entails extra-cardiac noradrenergic denervation, but this is not as severe as in pure autonomic failure. PD+OH patients have failure of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic components of the arterial baroreflex. OH in PD therefore seems to reflect a \"triple whammy\" of cardiac and extra-cardiac noradrenergic denervation and baroreflex failure. In contrast, most patients with multiple system atrophy, which can resemble PD+OH clinically, do not have evidence for cardiac or extra-cardiac noradrenergic denervation. Catecholamines in the neuronal cytoplasm are potentially toxic, via spontaneous and enzyme-catalyzed oxidation. Normally cytoplasmic catecholamines are efficiently taken up into vesicles via the vesicular monoamine transporter. The recent finding of decreased vesicular uptake in Lewy body diseases therefore suggests a pathogenetic mechanism for loss of catecholaminergic neurons in the periphery and brain. Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most common chronic neurodegenerative diseases of the elderly, and it is likely that as populations age PD will become even more prevalent and more of a public health burden. Severe depletion of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal system characterizes and likely produces the movement disorder (rest tremor, slowness of movement, rigid muscle tone, and postural instability) in PD. Over the past two decades, compelling evidence has accrued that PD also involves loss of noradrenergic neurons in the heart. This finding supports the view that loss of catecholaminergic neurons, both in the nigrostriatal system and the heart, is fundamental in PD. By the time PD manifests clinically, most of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are already lost. Identifying laboratory measures-biomarkers-of the disease process is therefore crucial for advances in treatment and prevention. Deposition of the protein, alpha-synuclein, in the form of Lewy bodies in catecholaminergic neurons is a pathologic hallmark of PD. Alpha-synucleinopathy in autonomic neurons may occur early in the pathogenetic process. The timing of cardiac noradrenergic denervation in PD is therefore a key issue. This review updates the field of autonomic cardiovascular abnormalities in PD and related disorders, with emphasis on relationships among striatal dopamine depletion, sympathetic noradrenergic denervation, and alpha-synucleinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Although progress has been made in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease since the discovery of L-dopa in the 1960s, no neuroprotective therapy is yet available. Absence of adequate animal models of the disease that enable prediction of clinical success of potential treatments is often cited as a major impediment to progress and discourages researchers and pharmaceutical companies from investing resources to develop such treatments. Classic models are still widely used, but have been disappointing, and development of genetic models has given new hope. However, can a human disease be faithfully reproduced in a mouse? In this Review we summarise evidence that some genetic mouse models do reproduce key features of Parkinson's disease and show that much can be learned from even imperfect models. The hope is that this information could be used to advance the search for neuroprotective therapies for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive movement disorder marked by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. Levodopa (l-dopa), usually combined with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, has been proved to provide the best symptomatic benefit for PD. However, its long-term efficacy is limited because of motor complications and drug-induced dyskinesia. Dopamine agonists, catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors and monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors are anti-parkinsonian (anti-PD) drugs that have been found to further improve the potency of l-dopa and prevent the onset of motor complications. However, as PD is a progressive disorder, all the drugs used for its therapy, manifest reduced efficacy and adverse effects with time. Research on the field of pharmacogenetics has pointed out that the genetic variability of each individual determines to a large extent the inter-individual variability in response to anti-PD drugs. Clinicogenetic trials show that drug efficacy or toxicity or susceptibility to side effects are features governed by genetic principles. This article is a review of the present pharmacological treatment of PD and current pharmacogenetic data for PD.",

    "abstract": "Gait disorders are common in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) yet their associations with activity limitations remain poorly understood. The objective of this review is to investigate the relationships between gait impairments and activity limitations in people with idiopathic PD. Six electronic databases (MEDLINE ISI, CINAHL, Web of Science ISI, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Scopus) were systematically searched using relevant terms to source for English-language studies published between 1900 and January 2011. Only studies that reported associations between impairments and activity limitations were considered for the review. The methodological quality of eligible studies was evaluated using a customized checklist by two independent reviewers. Data on participant characteristics, disease severity and associations between variables were extracted using a standardized data extraction form. Correlation coefficients were transformed to standardized scores and pooled using the fixed or random effects models. 16 of the 1735 studies screened were included, comprising 1882 participants. Large effect sizes were found between postural instability measured by the Berg Balance scale and activity limitation measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Activities of Daily Living (UPDRS ADL) section (-0.81; 95% CI,\u00a0-0.99 to\u00a0-0.63; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Gait hypokinesia measured by gait speed was significantly correlated with UPDRS ADL (-0.41; 95% CI,\u00a0-0.56 to\u00a0-0.26; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Gait freezing measured by the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire was associated with reduction in ADL (0.45; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.54; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Knowledge of gait disturbances and their associations with disability may help to guide clinicians in assessing patients to optimize functional outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Immunizations that target specific types of immune responses are used commonly to prevent microbial infections. However, a range of immune responses may prove necessary to combat the ravages of neurodegenerative diseases. The goal is to eliminate the 'root' cause of neurodegenerative disorders, misfolded aggregated proteins, while harnessing adaptive immune responses to promote neural repair. However, immunization strategies used to elicit humoral immune responses against aberrant brain proteins have yielded mixed success. While specific proteins can be cleared, the failures in halting disease progression revolve, in measure, around adaptive immune responses that promote autoreactive T cells and, as such, induce a meningoencephalitis, accelerating neurodegeneration. Thus, alternative approaches for protein clearance and neural repair are desired. To this end, our laboratories have sought to transform autoreactive adaptive immune responses into regulatory neuroprotective cells in Parkinson's disease. In this context, induction of immune responses against modified brain proteins serves to break immunological tolerance, while eliciting adaptive immunity to facilitate neuronal repair. How to harness the immune response in the setting of Parkinson's disease requires a thorough understanding of the role of immunity in human disease and the ways to modify such immune responses to elicit therapeutic gain. These are discussed in this review.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the appearance of fibrillar aggregates of insoluble \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) called Lewy bodies (LBs). Approximately 90% of \u03b1-syn deposited in LBs is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129). In contrast, only 4% of total \u03b1-syn is phosphorylated in normal brain, suggesting that accumulation of Ser129-phosphorylated \u03b1-syn is involved in the pathogenesis of PD. However, the role of Ser129 phosphorylation in \u03b1-syn neurotoxicity remains unclear. In this study, we coexpressed familial PD-linked A53T \u03b1-syn and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6) in the rat SN pars compacta using recombinant adeno-associated virus 2. Coexpression of these proteins yielded abundant Ser129-phosphorylated \u03b1-syn and significantly exacerbated degeneration of dopaminergic neurons when compared with coexpression of A53T \u03b1-syn and GFP. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Ser129-phosphorylated \u03b1-syn was preferentially distributed to swollen neurites. However, biochemical analysis showed that the increased expression of Ser129-phosphorylated \u03b1-syn did not promote accumulation of detergent-insoluble \u03b1-syn. Coexpression of catalytically inactive K215R mutant GRK6 failed to accelerate A53T \u03b1-syn-induced degeneration. Furthermore, introducing a phosphorylation-incompetent mutation, S129A, into A53T \u03b1-syn did not alter the pace of degeneration, even when GRK6 was coexpressed. Our study demonstrates that authentically Ser129-phosphorylated \u03b1-syn accelerates A53T \u03b1-syn neurotoxicity without the formation of detergent-insoluble \u03b1-syn, and suggests that the degenerative process could be constrained by inhibiting the kinase that phosphorylates \u03b1-syn at Ser129.",

    "abstract": "For more than 15 years deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus have become therapeutic options in advanced Parkinson's disease. The number of patients with long-term treatment is increasing steadily. This review focuses on issues of the long-term care of these Parkinson's patients, including differences of the available deep brain stimulation systems, recommendations for follow-up examinations, implications for medical diagnostics and therapies and an algorithm for symptom deterioration. Today, there is no profound evidence that deep brain stimulation prevents disease progression. However, symptomatic relief from motor symptoms is maintained during long-term follow-up and interruption of the therapy remains an exception.",

    "abstract": "Clinical evidence suggests that after initiation of dopaminergic medications some patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the neurocognitive basis of this phenomenon can be defined as the formation of arbitrary and illusory associations between conditioned stimuli and reward signals, called aberrant salience. Young, never-medicated PD patients and matched controls were assessed on a speeded reaction time task in which the probe stimulus was preceded by conditioned stimuli that could signal monetary reward by color or shape. The patients and controls were re-evaluated after 12 weeks during which the patients received a dopamine agonist (pramipexole or ropinirole). Results indicated that dopamine agonists increased both adaptive and aberrant salience in PD patients, that is, formation of real and illusory associations between conditioned stimuli and reward, respectively. This effect was present when associations were assessed by means of faster responding after conditioned stimuli signaling reward (implicit salience) and overt rating of stimulus-reward links (explicit salience). However, unusual feelings and experiences, which are subclinical manifestations of psychotic-like symptoms, were specifically related to irrelevant and illusory stimulus-reward associations (aberrant salience) in PD patients receiving dopamine agonists. The learning of relevant and real stimulus-reward associations (adaptive salience) was not related to unusual experiences. These results suggest that dopamine agonists may increase psychotic-like experiences in young patients with PD, possibly by facilitating dopaminergic transmission in the ventral striatum, which results in aberrant associations between conditioned stimuli and reward.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder associated with severe motor impairments caused by the loss of dopaminergic innervation of the striatum. Previous studies have demonstrated that positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu\u2084), including N-phenyl-7-(hydroxyimino) cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamide, can produce antiparkinsonian-like effects in preclinical models of PD. However, these early mGlu\u2084 PAMsexhibited unsuitable physiochemical properties for systemic dosing, requiring intracerebroventricular administration and limiting their broader utility as in vivo tools to further understand the role of mGlu\u2084 in the modulation of basal ganglia function relevant to PD. In the present study, we describe the pharmacologic characterization of a systemically active mGlu\u2084 PAM, N-(3-chlorophenyl)picolinamide (VU0364770), in several rodent PD models. VU0364770 showed efficacy alone or when administered in combination with L-DOPA or an adenosine 2A (A2A) receptor antagonist currently in clinical development (preladenant). When administered alone, VU0364770 exhibited efficacy in reversing haloperidol-induced catalepsy, forelimb asymmetry-induced by unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the median forebrain bundle, and attentional deficits induced by bilateral 6-OHDA nigrostriatal lesions in rats. In addition, VU0364770 enhanced the efficacy of preladenant to reverse haloperidol-induced catalepsy when given in combination. The effects of VU0364770 to reverse forelimb asymmetry were also potentiated when the compound was coadministered with an inactive dose of L-DOPA, suggesting that mGlu\u2084 PAMs may provide L-DOPA-sparing activity. The present findings provide exciting support for the potential role of selective mGlu\u2084 PAMs as a novel approach for the symptomatic treatment of PD and a possible augmentation strategy with either L-DOPA or A2A antagonists.",

No association was observed between the remaining 31 Parkinson disease SNPs and the risk of melanoma. The genetic score based on the number of Parkinson disease risk allele was not associated with melanoma risk [OR for the highest genetic score quartile (30-35) vs. the lowest (15-20), 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47-2.70].\nThe Parkinson disease SNPs identified in published GWAS do not seem to play an important role in melanoma development.\nThe Parkinson disease susceptibility loci discovered by GWAS contribute little to the observed epidemiologic association between the Parkinson disease and melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Whilst deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (DBS-STN) improves the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), its effect on daily activity is unknown. We aimed to quantify changes in ambulatory activity following DBS-STN in advanced PD using novel accelerometry based measures that describe changes to the volume and pattern of walking. Seventeen participants with advanced PD were measured over a 7-day period using an activPAL (\u2122) activity monitor. Data were collected 6 weeks before and 6 months after surgery and included measures that describe the volume and pattern of ambulatory activity (number of steps per day, accumulation, diversity and variability of walking time), alongside standard measures for disease severity, freezing of gait, gait speed, and extended activities of daily living. Activity outcomes were compared pre- and 6 months post-surgery using linear mixed models and correlated with standard outcomes. The results of this study are despite significant improvements in motor symptoms after surgery, the volume of ambulatory activity (total number of steps per day) did not change (P = 0.468). However, significant increases in length and variability of walking bouts emerged, suggesting improvements in diversity and flexibility of walking patterns. Motor severity and extended activities of daily living scores were significantly correlated with walking bout variability but not with volume of walking. Thus, the conclusions are reduction in motor symptom severity after DBS-STN translated into selective improvements in daily activity. Novel measures derived from accelerometry provide a discrete measure of performance and allow closer interpretation of the impact of DBS-STN on real-world activity.",

    "abstract": "In order to be able to assess the level of awareness of swallowing disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD), a specific questionnaire was designed and validated: the Dysphapark questionnaire.\nA total of 470 persons with PD were asked whether they believe they have problems swallowing or not, and then they filled in a self-administered questionnaire that evaluates the effectiveness and safety of swallowing. The Dysphapark questionnaire was validated by means of Rasch analysis and classical psychometric methods.\nThe safety and effectiveness dimensions of the Dysphapark fit the Rasch model well. The efficacy dimension showed significant differences for gender, length of the illness, awareness of dysphagia and length of meals. Significant differences were also found in the safety dimension for length and severity of illness, awareness of dysphagia, speech therapy and knowledge of thickening agents. Despite the fact that 90% of patients had problems concerning effectiveness and safety in swallowing, 79.45% were not aware that they suffered from dysphagia.\nThe Dysphapark questionnaire is a suitable measure of dysphagia in PD, according to the Rasch analysis. A high proportion of patients with PD have dysphagia, although it has been observed that they have a low level of awareness of the condition, of the consequences it may have and of the possibility of using thickening agents. Given that some of the swallowing disorders in PD are asymptomatic and that the level of awareness of the disorder is low, we recommend including specific questionnaires as well as clinical and instrumental evaluation of dysphagia in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Current gene therapy approaches for Parkinson's disease (PD) deliver neurotrophic factors like glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or neurturin via neuronal transgene expression. Since these potent signaling-inducing neurotrophic factors can be distributed through long-distance neuronal projections to unaffected brain sites, this mode of delivery may eventually cause side effects. To explore a localized and thus potentially safer alternative for gene therapy of PD, we expressed GDNF exclusively in astrocytes and evaluated the efficacy of this approach in the mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and rat 6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA) models of PD. In terms of protection of dopaminergic cell bodies and projections, dopamine (DA) synthesis and behaviour, astrocyte-derived GDNF demonstrated the same efficacy as neuron-derived GDNF. In terms of safety, unilateral striatal GDNF expression in astrocytes did not result in delivery of bio-active GDNF to the contralateral hemispheres (potential off-target sites) as happened when GDNF was expressed in neurons. Thus, astrocytic GDNF expression represents a localized but efficient alternative to current gene therapeutic strategies for the treatment of PD, especially if viral vectors with enhanced tissue penetration are considered. Astrocytic neurotrophic factor expression may open new venues for neurotrophic factor-based gene therapy targeting severe diseases of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Several case reports have linked solvent exposure to Parkinson disease (PD), but few studies have assessed associations with specific agents using an analytic epidemiologic design. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to specific solvents is associated with PD risk using a discordant twin pair design.\nNinety-nine twin pairs discordant for PD ascertained from the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council World War II Veteran Twins Cohort were interviewed regarding lifetime occupations and hobbies using detailed job task-specific questionnaires. Exposures to 6 specific solvents selected a priori were estimated by expert raters unaware of case status.\nEver exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE) was associated with significantly increased risk of PD (odds ratio [OR], 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-33; p = 0.034), and exposure to perchloroethylene (PERC) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4) ) tended toward significance (respectively: OR, 10.5; 95% CI, 0.97-113; p = 0.053; OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.9-6.1; p = 0.088). Results were similar for estimates of exposure duration and cumulative lifetime exposure.\nExposure to specific solvents may increase risk of PD. TCE is the most common organic contaminant in groundwater, and PERC and CCl(4) are also ubiquitous in the environment. Our findings require replication in other populations with well-characterized exposures, but the potential public health implications are substantial.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) typically appears in late middle-aged and in elderly persons progressing over a period of several years. The characteristic pathological features of PD patients include defective motor function and cognitive function affecting the quality of life of PD patients. Oxidative stress is considered to a play a central role along with various other factors in the pathogenesis of PD and the incidence and prevalence of the disease is incessantly increasing worldwide. The objective of the current study was to assess mRNA expressional changes of AQP4, TH and PBP in blood samples of control and patients with PD. The study included 30 healthy controls and 90 PD patients subjected to treatment through the entire period of the study. RNA isolation was carried out using blood samples of the subjects recruited in the study and used for RT-PCR analysis of AQP4, TH as well as PBP. The mRNA expressions of AQP4 and TH were found to be reduced whereas that of PBP was found to be elevated when compared with those of healthy control samples. The statistically analysed data were presented which could be helpful for appreciation of PD pathology reflecting in the blood samples of PD population.",

    "abstract": "This study reviews empirical evidence on the association between personality traits and Parkinson's disease (PD), with a twofold aim. First, to better identify non-motor symptoms, such as affective symptoms and personality changes, that could help to define the pre-motor phase of PD; second, to better understand the neurobiological bases of personality traits, a goal that is not fully accomplished by a purely anatomical approach. A literature review was performed on studies of personality traits in PD patients, in electronic databases ISI Web of Knowledge, Medline and PsychInfo, conducted in July 2011. We found evidence that the existence of a characteristic premorbid personality profile of PD patients is not actually sustained by robust empirical evidence, mainly due to the methodological bias of the retrospective assessment of personality; PD patients present a personality profile of low novelty seeking and high harm avoidance. We concluded that the definition of a pre-motor phase of PD, based on non-motor symptoms, should search for the presence of concomitant affective disorders and for a positive psychiatric history for affective disorders rather than for a typical personality profile or personality changes. The low novelty seeking profile is probably related to the dopaminergic deficit, while the high harm avoidance profile is probably associated with the presence of affective disorders. Clinical implications of these findings, in regard to personality assessment and pharmacological treatments in PD, are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "In PD, tissue damage occurs in specific cortical and subcortical regions. Conventional MR images have only limited capacity to depict these structural changes. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether voxel-based MT imaging could indicate structural abnormalities beyond atrophy measurable with T1-weighted MR imaging.\nThirty-six patients with PD without dementia (9 in H&Y stage 1, thirteen in H&Y 2, eleven in H&Y 3, three in H&Y 4) and 23 age-matched control subjects were studied with T1-weighted MR imaging and MT imaging. Voxel-based analyses of T1-weighted MR imaging was performed to investigate brain atrophy, while MT imaging was used to study abnormalities within existing tissue. Modulated GM and WM probability maps, sensitive to volume, and nonmodulated maps, indicative of tissue density, were obtained from T1-weighted MR imaging. Effects seen on MTR images, but absent on density maps, were attributed to damage of existing tissue.\nContrary to T1-weighted MR imaging, MT imaging was sensitive to the progression of brain pathology of the neocortex and paraventricular WM. MTR images and T1-based volume images, but not density images, showed a progression of disease in the olfactory cortex, indicating the occurrence of atrophy as well as damage to existing tissue in this region. MTR images revealed bilateral damage to the SN, while T1-weighted MR imaging only showed left-sided abnormalities.\nThe findings suggest that voxel-based MT imaging permits a whole-brain unbiased investigation of CNS structural integrity in PD and may be a valuable tool for identifying structural damage occurring without or before measurable atrophy.",

    "abstract": "The present study compared mesenchymal stem cells derived from umbilical cord matrix (UCM-MSCs) with bone marrow (BM-MSCs) of miniature pigs on their phenotypic profiles and ability to differentiate in vitro into osteocytes, adipocytes and neuron-like cells. This study further evaluated the therapeutic potential of UCM-MSCs in a mouse Parkinson's disease (PD) model. Differences in expression of some cell surface and cytoplasm specific markers were evident between UCM-MSCs and BM-MSCs. However, the expression profile indicated the primitive nature of UCM-MSCs, along with their less or non-immunogenic features, compared with BM-MSCs. In vitro differentiation results showed that BM-MSCs had a higher tendency to form osteocytes and adipocytes, whereas UCM-MSCs possessed an increased potential to transform into immature or mature neuron-like cells. Based on these findings, UCM-MSCs were transplanted into the right substantia nigra (SN) of a mouse PD model. Transplantation of UCM-MSCs partially recovered the mouse PD model by showing an improvement in basic motor behaviour, as assessed by rotarod and bridge tests. These observations were further supported by the expression of markers, including nestin, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), neuronal growth factor (NGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), at the site of cell transplantation. Our findings of xenotransplantation have collectively suggested the potential utility of UCM-MSCs in developing viable therapeutic strategies for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most frequent neurodegenerative disorders, is no longer considered a complex motor disorder characterized by extrapyramidal symptoms, but a progressive multisystem or-more correctly-multiorgan disease with variegated neurological and nonmotor deficiencies. It is morphologically featured not only by the degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, responsible for the core motor deficits, but by multifocal involvement of the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous system and other organs associated with widespread occurrence of Lewy bodies and dystrophic Lewy neurites. This results from deposition of abnormal \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn), the major protein marker of PD, and other synucleinopathies. Recent research has improved both the clinical and neuropathological diagnostic criteria of PD; it has further provided insights into the development and staging of \u03b1Syn and Lewy pathologies and has been useful in understanding the pathogenesis of PD. However, many challenges remain, for example, the role of Lewy bodies and the neurobiology of axons in the course of neurodegeneration, the relation between \u03b1Syn, Lewy pathology, and clinical deficits, as well as the interaction between \u03b1Syn and other pathologic proteins. Although genetic and experimental models have contributed to exploring the causes, pathomechanisms, and treatment options of PD, there is still a lack of an optimal animal model, and the etiology of this devastating disease is far from being elucidated.",

    "abstract": "This study compares the effects of traditional logopedic dysphagia treatment with those of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) as adjunct to therapy on the quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease and oropharyngeal dysphagia. Eighty-eight patients were randomized over three treatment groups. Traditional logopedic dysphagia treatment and traditional logopedic dysphagia treatment combined with NMES at sensor or motor level stimulation were compared. At three times (pretreatment, post-treatment, and 3\u00a0months following treatment), two quality-of-life questionnaires (SWAL-QOL and MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory) and a single-item Dysphagia Severity Scale were scored. The Functional Oral Intake Scale was used to assess the dietary intake. After therapy, all groups showed significant improvement on the Dysphagia Severity Scale and restricted positive effects on quality of life. Minimal group differences were found. These effects remained unchanged 3\u00a0months following treatment. No significant correlations were found between dietary intake and quality of life. Logopedic dysphagia treatment results in a restricted increased quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease. In this randomized controlled trial, all groups showed significant therapy effects on the Dysphagia Severity Scale and restricted improvements on the SWAL-QOL and the MDADI. However, only slight nonsignificant differences between groups were found.",

    "abstract": "To study the effects of levodopa and walking speed on gait variability in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThirty-three individuals with PD were studied. Their mean age was 70.61\u00b19.23 year. The average time since diagnosis was 9.65\u00b15.80 year. Gait variability was studied while 'OFF' and 'ON' dopaminergic medication when the subjects walked at their usual and fastest speeds.\nVariability of step time, double support time, stride length and stride velocity decreased significantly (P=0.037; P=0.037; P=0.022; P=0.043, respectively) after dopaminergic treatment. When subjects increased walking speed, the variability of stride length and stride velocity decreased significantly (P=0.038 and P=0.004, respectively) both while 'OFF' and 'ON' levodopa. Increasing walking speed did not change the variability of step time and double support time regardless of medication status.\nLevodopa decreased gait variability in persons with PD. Stride length and stride velocity variability appeared to be speed dependent parameters, whereas, the variability of step time and double support time appeared to be speed independent measures. Levodopa had positive effects on gait stability in PD.",

    "abstract": "Dominant missense mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic causes of Parkinson disease (PD) and genome-wide association studies identify LRRK2 sequence variants as risk factors for sporadic PD. Intact kinase function appears critical for the toxicity of LRRK2 PD mutants, yet our understanding of how LRRK2 causes neurodegeneration remains limited. We find that most LRRK2 PD mutants abnormally enhance LRRK2 oligomerization, causing it to form filamentous structures in transfections of cell lines or primary neuronal cultures. Strikingly, ultrastructural analyses, including immuno-electron microscopy and electron microscopic tomography, demonstrate that these filaments consist of LRRK2 recruited onto part of the cellular microtubule network in a well-ordered, periodic fashion. Like LRRK2-related neurodegeneration, microtubule association requires intact kinase function and the WD40 domain, potentially linking microtubule binding and neurodegeneration. Our observations identify a novel effect of LRRK2 PD mutations and highlight a potential role for microtubules in the pathogenesis of LRRK2-related neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Objective To assess the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) and update information on mortality from major causes of death among a UK workforce who manufactured paraquat (PQ) between 1961 and 1995. There have been no previous studies of the incidence of PD among PQ production workers, although much epidemiological literature exists concerning the relationship between pesticides and PD, and interest has focused on PQ and its users. Methods The cohort included all employees who had ever worked on any of the four plants at Widnes where PQ was manufactured between 1961 and 1995, and 926 male and 42 female workers were followed through 30 June 2009. Mortalities for males were compared with national and local rates, including rates for PD as a mentioned cause of death. Results Overall, 307 workers had died by 30 June 2009. One male death was due to PD, and no other death certificate mentioned PD. At least 3.3 death certificates of male employees would have been expected to have mentioned PD (standardised mortality ratio=31; 95% CI 1 to 171). Personal monitoring results were indicative that the exposure of a PQ production worker on a daily basis was at least comparable with that of a PQ sprayer or mixer/loader. Reduced mortalities compared with local rates were found for major causes of death. Conclusions The study provided no evidence of an increased risk of PD, or increased mortalities from other causes.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) catalyze the reversible metabolism of many types of alcohols and aldehydes to prevent the possible toxic accumulation of these compounds. ADHs are of interest in Parkinson's disease (PD) since these compounds can be harmful to dopamine (DA) neurons. Genetic variants in ADH1C and ADH4 have been found to associate with PD and lack of Adh4 gene activity in a mouse model has recently been reported to induce changes in the DA system. Adh1 knockout (Adh1-/-) and Adh1/4 double knockout (Adh1/4-/-) mice were investigated for possible changes in DA system related activity, biochemical parameters and olfactory function compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Locomotor activity was tested at \u223c7 (adult) and >15 months of age to mimic the late onset of PD. Adh1-/- and Adh1/4-/- mice displayed a significantly higher spontaneous locomotor activity than WT littermates. Both apomorphine and d-amphetamine increased total distance activity in Adh1-/- mice at both age intervals and in Adh1/4-/- mice at 7 months of age compared to WT mice. No significant changes were found regarding olfactory function, however biochemical data showed decreased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)/DA ratios in the olfactory bulb and decreased homovanillic acid (HVA)/DA ratios in the olfactory bulb, frontal cortex and striatum of Adh1/4-/- mice compared to WT mice. Our results suggest that lack of Adh1 alone or Adh1 and Adh4 together lead to changes in DA system related behavior, and that these knockout mice might be possible rodent models to study presymptomatic PD.",

    "abstract": "To compare the effects of gait impairment without freezing of gait (FOG) versus FOG without gait impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) on disability and quality of life.\nFOG is frequently characterized as the major cause of gait-related disability in PD. However, gait impairment may also result from other PD symptoms including slowing, motor asymmetry, gait variability, dystonia or stooped posture.\nThe Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Older Americans Resources and Services Disability Scale (OARS) and the SF-12 Health Status Survey were used to evaluate patients with PD. Responses to UPDRS Items #14 (Freezing) and # 29 (Gait) were used to create 4 subgroups: 1) No FOG or gait impairment, 2) FOG, no gait impairment, 3) Gait impairment, no FOG, and 4) Both FOG and gait impairment. Disease severity, disability, and quality of life were compared across the subgroups with ANOVAs, and between subgroups with t-tests.\n916 PD patients were divided into 4 subgroups based on their gait and freezing score (#1: n = 213, #2: n = 41, #3: n = 323 and #4: n = 339). Total UPDRS progressively increased from Group 1 through Group 4 (1 = 25.2, 2 = 33.7, 3 = 39.2, 4 = 59.2; p < 0.001). Motor UPDRS also progressively increased (1 = 17.4, 2 = 19.7, 3 = 26.9, 4 = 36.5; p < 0.0001). Similarly, disability and health-related quality of life progressively increased from Group 1 through Group 4 (Total OARS: 1 = 15.3, 2 = 17.2, 3 = 18.9, 4 = 28.4; p < 0.001). Group 3 (Gait impairment, no FOG) showed greater disease severity than Group 2 (FOG, no gait impairment; Total and Motor UPDRS; p < 0.05), but the difference did not reach significance for disability or quality of life.\nGait impairment without FOG was associated with greater disease severity than FOG without gait impairment. The combination of gait impairment and FOG was associated with the greatest disease severity and disability. These results show differential effects of diverse features of gait impairment in PD and demonstrate the importance of gait features unrelated to freezing.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD) both speech production and self-monitoring of voiced speech are altered.\nIn our previous study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine which brain areas are involved in overt reading in nine female PD patients (mean age 66.0 \u00b1 11.6 years) compared with eight age-matched healthy female controls (mean age 62.2 years \u00b1 12.3). Here we performed the post-hoc seed-based functional connectivity analysis of our data to assess the functional connectivity between the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG; i.e. the core subcortical structure involved in human vocalization) and other brain regions in the same groups of PD patients and controls.\nIn PD patients as compared with controls we observed increased connectivity between PAG and basal ganglia, posterior superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal and fusiform gyri and inferior parietal lobule on the right side. In the PD group, the connectivity strength in the right putamen and the right sypramarginal gyrus was correlated with variability of pitch while the connectivity strength in the right posterior superior temporal gyrus and in the right inferior parietal lobule was correlated with speech loudness.\nWe observed functional reorganization in PD patients as compared with controls in both the motor basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitry and cortical areas known to be engaged in-auditory and somatosensory feedback control of voiced speech. These changes were hemisphere-specific and might either reflect effects of dopaminergic treatment or at least partially successful compensatory mechanisms involved in early-stage PD.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this review was to assess models of cost effectiveness for Parkinson's disease (PD) published after July 2002 and to derive recommendations for future modelling. A systematic literature search was performed in the databases PubMed, Current Contents, EMBASE, EconLit, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness), NHS EED (Economic Evaluation Database) and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) of the UK NHS Centre for Review and Dissemination (July 2002 to March 2010). Only fully published studies using decision trees, Markov models, individual simulation models or sets of mathematical equations were included. Most of the 11 studies identified used Markov models (n\u2009=\u20099) and two employed were based on decision trees. Based on the Hoehn & Yahr (HY) scale, authors evaluated the cost effectiveness of drug treatments (n\u2009=\u20096), surgical approaches such as deep brain stimulation (n\u2009=\u20091) or striatal cell grafting (n\u2009=\u20091), and diagnostic procedures such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) testing (n\u2009=\u20093) over a time horizon of 1 year to lifetime. Costs were adapted to address a societal and/or healthcare provider/third-party payer perspective. All but one of the interventions investigated were considered cost effective or cost saving. Cost-effectiveness modelling in PD between 2003 and 2010 showed only minor improvement when compared with our earlier review of models published from 1998 up to 2003. Cost-effectiveness modelling recommendations were complied with to only a limited extent, leaving room for quality improvement. More advanced modelling approaches may, so far, be under-represented, but may be used in the future, driven by the research question. Adverse events of treatment, co-morbidities or disease complications are not yet sufficiently included in the models to adequately represent clinical reality.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa-induced dyskinesia represents disabling complication of long-term therapy with dopaminergic drugs in treating Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, our group demonstrated that PD patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesia were characterized by abnormal volumetric changes in the inferior prefrontal gyrus. In this study, the functional relevance of this structural abnormality was explored using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Ten dyskinetic PD patients and 10 nondyskinetic PD patients were studied in the OFF phase with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing externally and internally triggered visuomotor tasks. Although neither group demonstrated behavioral differences during execution of motor tasks, magnetic resonance imaging analysis detected significant changes in target cortical regions. In particular, PD patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesia showed significant overactivity in the supplementary motor area and underactivity in the right inferior prefrontal gyrus during execution of both tasks when compared with PD patients without levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Moreover, these prefrontal functional alterations were significantly correlated with Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study together with our previous volumetric findings highlights the role of the prefrontal cortex in the neuronal mechanisms of dyskinesia.",

We searched for DNA variants at the SNCA 3' UTR through single strand conformation analysis and direct sequencing in a cohort of Spanish PD patients and controls. We have genotyped the rs356165 SNCA 3' UTR polymorphism in a total of 1,135 PD patients and 772 healthy controls from two Spanish cohorts (Asturias and Navarre). We identified six SNCA 3' UTR variants. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs356165 was significantly associated with PD risk in the Spanish cohort (p\u2009=\u20090.0001; odd ratio\u2009=\u20091.37, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.19-1.58). This SNP was also significantly associated with early age at onset of PD. Our work highlights rs356165 as an important determinant of the risk of developing PD and early age at onset and encourages future research to identify a functional effect on SNCA expression.",

All subjects were Caucasian. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) was diagnosed according to the essential diagnostic criteria.\nMore patients (81 of 200, 40.5%) than controls (31 of 173, 17.9%) reported leg restlessness (p < 0.001). Thirty-one (15.5%) of these patients with PD and 16 (9.2%) control subjects met RLS criteria (p = 0.07). A total of 21 (12.5%) patients and 12 (6.9%) controls with RLS remained after the exclusion of potential RLS mimics and 26 patients vs 10 control subjects with leg motor restlessness (LMR), leading to a relative risk for RLS of 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-3.43, p = 0.089) and 2.84 for LMR (95% CI 1.43-5.61, p = 0.001) in PD. Except for increased sleep disturbances in patients with RLS and increased Montgomery and \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale scores for patients with RLS or LMR there were no other major differences in relevant blood tests, motor or cognitive function between PD with and without RLS or LMR.\nLMR and not RLS occurs with a near 3-fold higher risk as compared to controls in early PD. The findings underline a need for more accurate assessments of RLS in PD and support the notion that RLS and PD are different entities.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a widespread age-associated neurodegenerative disorder. Current treatment is symptomatic rather than curative. However, stem cell replacement therapies may have the potential to offer curative treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that rat CD49f+ spermatogonial stem cells (rSSCs) can be induced to become functional dopaminergic neuron-like cells in vitro. Furthermore, when rSSCs were transplanted into 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated PD rats, the results indicated that rSSCs expressed multiple neuron cell markers and were ameliorative to behavioral recovery in PD rats after induction both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, rSSCs demonstrated increased activity in the regeneration of dopaminergic neuron-like cells, increased migration distances and were associated with improvement in animal behavior in the PD rat model. Therefore, rSSCs could be a source of dopaminergic neuron-like cells with potential benefit in cell replacement therapy for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disease. Breakdown of compensatory mechanisms influencing putaminal dopamine processing could contribute to the progressive motor symptoms. We studied a cohort of 78 subjects (at baseline) with sporadic Parkinson's disease and 35 healthy controls with multi-tracer positron emission tomography scans to investigate the evolution of adaptive mechanisms influencing striatal dopamine processing in Parkinson's disease progression. Presynaptic dopaminergic integrity was assessed with three radioligands: (i) [(11)C](\u00b1)dihydrotetrabenazine, to estimate the density of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2; (ii) [(11)C]d-threo-methylphenidate, to label the dopamine transporter; and (iii) 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-DOPA, to assess the activity of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and storage of 6-[(18)F]-fluorodopamine in synaptic vesicles. The subjects with Parkinson's disease and the healthy controls underwent positron emission tomography scans at the initial visit and after 4 and 8 years of follow-up. Non-linear multivariate regression analyses with random effects were utilized to model the longitudinal changes in tracer values in the putamen standardized relative to normal controls. We found evidence for possible upregulation of dopamine synthesis and downregulation of dopamine transporter in the more severely affected putamen in the early stage of Parkinson's disease. The standardized 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-DOPA and [(11)C]d-threo-methylphenidate values tended to approach [(11)C](\u00b1)dihydrotetrabenazine values in the putamen in later stages of disease (i.e. for [(11)C](\u00b1)dihydrotetrabenazine values <25% of normal), when the rates of decline in the positron emission tomography measurements were similar for all the markers. Our data suggest that compensatory mechanisms decline as Parkinson's disease progresses. This breakdown of compensatory strategies in the putamen could contribute to the progression of motor symptoms in advanced disease.",

    "abstract": "A number of studies have identified pathological neural oscillations in Parkinson's disease and it is widely agreed that these excessive synchronizations are linked to the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is still under debate if there exists a single frequency having a critical negative influence on PD symptoms and what this frequency might be. To provide experimental evidence for a causal link between beta oscillations and bradykinesia, C. C. Chen and coauthors stimulated patients with Parkinson's disease with different low frequencies while the patients were performing a grip force task [C. C. Chen, W. Y. Lin, H.L. Chan, Y.T. Hsu, P.H. Tu, S.T. Lee, S.M. Chiou, C.H. Tsai, C.S. Lu, P. Brown: Stimulation of the subthalamic region at 20 Hz slows the development of grip force in Parkinson's disease, Exp. Neurology, 2011]. In their study the authors could demonstrate a 15% slowing in the grip force task during 20 Hz stimulation, but not during stimulation with other frequencies. The finding of 20 Hz being the driving pathological frequency contrasts with previous studies using e.g. finger tapping, where 5 and 10 Hz had the largest influence. Thus, this study provides evidence that there is no single pathological oscillation frequency that is responsible for all Parkinsonian symptoms. Instead, the results indicate that the modulation of very specific frequencies leads to changes in specific performance parameters evaluated in particular tasks. In this respect, this study also provides more physiological evidence on the involvement of the STN in dynamic force production. Taken together, the study adds a further piece to the puzzle of understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and the mechanisms of deep brain stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Dyskinesias represent a major complication of dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) and have prompted a search for alternative treatments. The most radical advances in this field have been provided by surgical manipulations of the deep basal ganglia nuclei, and particularly by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Although being very effective, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the STN is a poorly understood treatment. Besides its anti-akinetic activity, it can be pro-dyskinetic above a certain stimulation intensity. Accumulating evidence indicates that dyskinesias induced by STN-HFS and dopamine replacement therapy are linked to dysregulation of glutamate transmission in the basal ganglia. In rat models of PD, both types of dyskinesia are associated with increased concentrations of extracellular glutamate and altered expression of glutamate transporters in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the striatum. Furthermore, a vast and ever growing literature has revealed changes in the expression, phosphorylation state, and/or subcellular distribution of specific subtypes of glutamate receptors in these dyskinetic conditions. Both types of dyskinesias are linked to an increased phosphorylation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in critical basal ganglia circuits. We conclude that disruption of glutamate homeostasis and activation of perisynaptic and extra-synaptic glutamate receptors are an important pathophysiological component of these treatment-induced dyskinesias in PD. These findings lay the ground for therapeutic development initiatives targeting dysfunctional components of glutamate transmission in the basal ganglia.",

    "abstract": "L-Dopa is the mainstay of Parkinson's disease therapy; this drug is usually administered orally, but it is extensively metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract, so that relatively little arrives in the bloodstream as intact L-Dopa. The peripheral conversion of L-Dopa by amino acid decarboxylase to dopamine is responsible for the typical gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects. To minimize the conversion to dopamine outside the central nervous system, L-Dopa is usually given in combination with peripheral inhibitors of amino acid decarboxylase. In spite of that, other central nervous side effects such as dyskinesia, on-off phenomenon and end-of-dose deterioration still remain. The main factors responsible for the poor bioavailability are the drug's physical-chemical properties: low water and lipid solubility, resulting in unfavorable partition, and the high susceptibility to chemical and enzymatic degradation. Starting from these considerations the prodrug approach has been applied to L-Dopa in order to overcome its metabolism problems and to improve its bioavailability. The goal of this paper is to provide the reader with a critical overview on L-Dopa prodrugs here classified according to the nature of the main chemical modification on L-Dopa backbone that led to the formation of the desired derivative.",

Thirty-three PD patients, divided according to three previously determined subgroups based on their initial cognitive performance, and a healthy comparison group were reassessed after a 1-year interval. Participants were assessed in the following five domains: Executive Function, Problem Solving, Working Memory/Attention, Memory, and Visuospatial Ability. The PD groups differed on the domains of Executive Function, Problem Solving, and Working Memory, with the most severe deficits being evident for the group that had previously shown the greatest level of impairment. Increased cognitive problems were also associated with decreased functioning in activities of daily living. The most severely impaired group had evidence of global cognitive decline, possibly reflecting a stage of preclinical dementia.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are chronic diseases with unpredictable course causing progressive physical disability and cognitive decline, and broadly affecting the patient's life, social interaction, recreational activities and overall life satisfaction.\nTo examine the quality of life of patients with PD and MS, and investigate the existence of differences between the degree of impairment to the quality of life in PD and MS.\nA prospective study was conducted at the Neurology Clinic, University Clinical Center in Tuzla in the period from December 2005 until May 2007. The study included subjects with confirmed diagnosis of MS and PD. We analyzed 50 patients with PD and 50 patients with MS, with disease duration 1-5 years without any or with mild cognitive impairment. Quality of life was assessed using the SF-36 scale comprised of 36 questions in eight health profiles.\nThere was no significant difference in gender frequency in our study sample of patients with PD, while in MS group of patients there were a significantly more females. The average age of the PD patients was 63.18 +/- 10.42, and in patients with MS 37.4 +/- 8.65 years. In our study the relative influence of PD and MS on quality of life was similar after controlling the duration of the disease, and there were some differences in relation to the degree for clinical disability. Subjects showed reduced QoL independently of the duration of illness (patients with PD in 88% of cases, and multiple sclerosis in 84% of cases). There are significant differences in the occurrence of poor quality of life in patients with PD were in advanced clinical stages of disease for the physical, mental dimension of the SF 36 and the total score. Respondents in stages III-V of the disease were 5.23 times (23%) likely to experience reduced QoL compared to those with less physical disability. In subjects suffering from MS reduced QoL was not related to the degree of clinical disability in physical, nor the mental dimension of the SF 36 and the total score. These results in MS patients can be partially explained by the small sample size, on the other hand it is possible that patients with MS, although they have greater physical disability seen as a very difficult diagnosis which determines the entire life.\nPatients who are treated for PD and MS had a high degree (> 80%) of reduction of the overall quality of life, and there were no significant differences in the extent of QoL reduction between these groups of patients. Reduced quality of life in patients with PD is observed during severe stages of the disease, while the QoL does not depent on the degree of clinical disability in MS patients. In both groups of patients the appearance patients reduced QoL does not depend on the duration of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Self-regulation of brain activity in humans based on real-time feedback of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal is emerging as a potentially powerful, new technique. Here, we assessed whether patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are able to alter local brain activity to improve motor function. Five patients learned to increase activity in the supplementary motor complex over two fMRI sessions using motor imagery. They attained as much activation in this target brain region as during a localizer procedure with overt movements. Concomitantly, they showed an improvement in motor speed (finger tapping) and clinical ratings of motor symptoms (37% improvement of the motor scale of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale). Activation during neurofeedback was also observed in other cortical motor areas and the basal ganglia, including the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus, which are connected to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and crucial nodes in the pathophysiology of PD. A PD control group of five patients, matched for clinical severity and medication, underwent the same procedure but did not receive feedback about their SMA activity. This group attained no control of SMA activation and showed no motor improvement. These findings demonstrate that self-modulation of cortico-subcortical motor circuits can be achieved by PD patients through neurofeedback and may result in clinical benefits that are not attainable by motor imagery alone.",

    "abstract": "Current treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) is focused on relieving symptoms, at present there is nothing that is widely accepted to halt or slow disease progression. Potential neuroprotective or disease modifying agents have been identified from preclinical studies. One such group of compounds are anti-hypertensive drugs.\n1) Do anti-hypertensive drugs prevent the onset of PD? (primary prevention)2) Are anti-hypertensive drugs disease modifying agents in PD, do they slow the progression of disease once PD is established? (secondary prevention)3) What are the adverse effects of taking anti-hypertensive drugs for patients with PD?\nElectronic databases including trial registers were searched, complemented with handsearching of conference proceedings and searching the citations of key articles (updated May 2011). Authors were contacted, to provide additional information, where necessary.\nFor the primary prevention review, primary prevention trials and observational studies (cohort and case control studies) were sought. Participants were free of PD when exposure to anti-hypertensive drugs was assessed. For the secondary prevention review, clinical trials in patients with well defined PD were sought. Two people independently selected studies for inclusion using predetermined criteria.\nData were abstracted from the source papers and methodological quality was assessed independently by two review authors. Results for both reviews were dealt with descriptively.\nTwo cohort studies and four case control studies met the inclusion criteria for the primary prevention review. The two cohort studies found no effect of exposure to calcium channel blockers on the risk of developing PD. Three case control studies looked at the effects of exposure to calcium channel blockers and beta blockers on the risk of developing PD but the assessment periods of exposure were markedly different prior to PD onset, and different subclasses of drugs were examined, so results were not comparable. A protective effect of centrally acting calcium channel blockers was found in one study.Two trials and one ongoing trial met the inclusion criteria for the secondary prevention review. Each completed trial examined a different class of anti-hypertensive drug. The ongoing trial is examining the effects of the calcium channel blocker isradipine on motor symptoms and disease progression. It follows an earlier tolerability study. The results are due in the year 2012.Adverse effects were noted in all included trials and included intolerability to the drugs and worsening PD symptoms.\nThere is currently a lack of evidence for the use of antihypertensive drugs for either the primary or secondary prevention of PD. More observational studies are required to identify potential drugs to go forward for safety and tolerability studies in people with early PD. The results of the ongoing trial will help inform further research.",

Exposure to any NSAIDs or aspirin had no effect on the risk of developing PD. Exposure to non-aspirin NSAIDs reduced the risk of developing PD by 13% (effect estimate 0.87 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.04 - random-effects model), but this did not reach statistical significance. We found similar results for the most robust studies. Ibuprofen in isolation was examined in four studies and was associated with a 27% reduction in risk (effect estimate 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85). There was a lack of information on adverse effects.\nThere is currently no evidence for the use of NSAIDs in the secondary prevention of PD. Non-aspirin NSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen, may reduce the risk of developing PD. However, little is known of the effects of other individual drugs and at present no recommendations can be made regarding their use in primary prevention.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa is the mainstay of treatment for alleviating the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. However, patients often experience fluctuations in their symptoms over time and 'wearing off' which may be partly related to variable absorption of the drug. There is some evidence that treatment of the common gastrointestinal infection Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) with antibiotics may improve levodopa absorption in the gut and hence improve symptoms.\n1) What is the prevalence of H pylori in Parkinson's disease patients? 2) Does treatment of H pylori infection with antibiotics improve symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients? Is this effect dependent on improvements in the absorption of levodopa?\nWe searched electronic databases (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL) and trial registers, handsearched conference proceedings and carried out citation searching on key articles. All searching was updated in August 2009. We contacted authors to provide additional information where necessary.\nClinical trials in patients with a well-defined definition of Parkinson's disease and who were H pylori-positive. Two people independently selected studies for inclusion using predetermined criteria. We used recruitment figures from clinical trials and other studies identified from the searching to determine the prevalence of H pylori in Parkinson's disease.\nTwo authors abstracted data from the source papers and assessed methodological quality independently. We presented results descriptively.\nTwo completed and one ongoing clinical trial met the inclusion criteria. One trial (34 patients randomised) examined the effects of H pylori eradication on levodopa absorption and motor symptoms and found significant improvements in both. The ongoing trial has similar objectives and aims to recruit 100 patients. The other completed trial (20 patients analysed) sought to find a causal link between infection with H pylori and Parkinsonism and was non-contributory. A worsening of symptoms was noted with eradication failure.The prevalence of H pylori in Parkinson's disease was reported in four studies and ranged from 37% to 59% which is similar to that of the general population.\nThere is currently a lack of evidence on the effects of screening and treating H pylori in patients with Parkinson's disease. There is limited evidence to suggest that H Pylori eradication improves the absorption of levodopa and improves motor symptoms. Results from an ongoing trial will inform the evidence base and will be incorporated in an update of this review. There is a need for well-conducted randomised controlled trials with standard outcome measures for motor symptoms and incorporating the costs of screening and treatment.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to test the concordance between disease severity, prevalence of nonmotor symptoms, age, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disability and medication use in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Severity was classified with the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) scale and Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD) calculated. HRQoL was evaluated with the SF-36, disability with the WHO-DAS II and nonmotor symptoms with the NMSQuest. Patients were clustered using SF-36 and WHO-DAS II into three groups covering the continuum from low disability and HRQoL, to severe disability and HRQoL decrement. Contingency Coefficient were used to verify the relationships between clusters and HY stage; ANOVA to evaluate differences in NMS, age and LEDD between clusters; odds ratio to test the likelihood of taking levodopa or dopamine agonist and being member of the three clusters; t test to evaluate differences in LEDD between patients with HY \u22653 or \u22642. Eighty-six patients were clustered: 48 had low disability and HRQoL decrement, 18 intermediate disability and HRQoL decrement and 20 high disability and HRQoL decrement. A significant relationship was found between PD severity groups, HRQoL and disability profiles. No differences for age and LEDD were observed in the three groups, and those with more disability and lower HRQoL reported a higher number of nonmotor symptoms; patients in HY \u22653 were prescribed higher doses of drugs. In conclusion, we found a substantial concordance between PD staging, prevalence of nonmotor symptoms and patient-reported HRQoL and disability measures. In our opinion, the SF-36 and the WHO-DAS II can be used for profiling patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder with an estimated 4 million patients worldwide. L-dopa is standard, and often initial, therapy for patients with this condition; however, with continued dopaminergic treatment and as the disease progresses, the majority of patients experience complications such as \"wearing-off\" symptoms, dyskinesias, and other motor complications. These complications may become disabling and profoundly affect quality of life. Treatment modification and combination therapies with L-dopa, dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors, and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors are commonly used to manage complications. In recent years regulatory agencies, clinical researchers, and sponsors have widely accepted and utilized changes in \"ON\" and \"OFF\" time measured by Patient Hauser Diaries as endpoints for measuring efficacy of therapeutics seeking approval for symptomatic treatment of PD. Successful antiparkinsonian medications have been associated with treatment effects of more than 1 h in either reduction of \"OFF\" time of increase in \"ON\" time. Accurate \"ON\" and \"OFF\" time registration during clinical studies requires rigorous patient training. Reduced compliance, recall bias and diary fatigue are common problems seen with patient diary reported measures. Electronic diaries may help reducing some of these problems but may be associated with other challenges in large, multicenter studies.",

    "abstract": "The last 25 years have witnessed remarkable advances in our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The ability to undertake detailed biochemical analyses of the Parkinson's disease postmortem brain enabled the identification of defects of mitochondrial and free-radical metabolism. The discovery of the first gene mutation for Parkinson's disease, in alpha-synuclein, ushered in the genetic era for the disease and the subsequent finding of several gene mutations causing parkinsonism, 15 at the time of writing. Technological advances both in sequencing technology and software analysis have allowed association studies of sufficiently large size accurately to describe genes conferring an increased risk for Parkinson's disease. What has been so surprising is the convergence of these 2 separate disciplines (biochemistry and genetics) in terms of reinforcing the importance of the same pathways (ie, mitochondrial dysfunction and free-radical metabolism). Other pathways are also important in pathogenesis, including protein turnover, inflammation, and post-translational modification, particularly protein phosphorylation and ubiquitination. However, even these additional pathways overlap with each other and with those of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. This review explores these concepts with particular relevance to mitochondrial involvement.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the sequence learning performance of 16 non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) was compared with 18 age-matched healthy controls on a verbal version of the serial reaction time (SRT) task intended to encapsulate both visuomotor- and judgment-linked learning processes. Visuomotor sequence performance in PD patients was closely related to baseline response speed, with robust learning demonstrated by patients who responded with comparable speed to controls but severely impaired performance in patients who responded slowly. In contrast, both fast- and slow-responding PD patients were able to successfully categorise patterns according to their sequential status, a performance that was linked to declarative memory for the sequence. The findings highlight the important role of event timing in SRT performance and are in accord with the hypothesis that, despite the important role played by the basal ganglia in motor sequence learning, basal ganglionic dysfunction may not substantially impair sequence order learning so much as the translation of sequence knowledge into rapid motor performance for some PD patients. Intact pattern judgment on the SRT experiment suggests that the integrity of the neostriatum is not essential for learning judgment-linked categorical information about sequences of temporal stimulus movement.",

    "abstract": "The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a very well-defined and genetically tractable nervous system which offers an effective model to explore basic mechanistic pathways that might be underpin complex human neurological diseases. Here, the role C. elegans is playing in understanding two neurodegenerative conditions, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a complex neurological condition, autism, is used as an exemplar of the utility of this model system. C. elegans is an imperfect model of Parkinson's disease because it lacks orthologues of the human disease-related genes PARK1 and LRRK2 which are linked to the autosomal dominant form of this disease. Despite this fact, the nematode is a good model because it allows transgenic expression of these human genes and the study of the impact on dopaminergic neurons in several genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions. For AD, C. elegans has orthologues of the amyloid precursor protein and both human presenilins, PS1 and PS2. In addition, many of the neurotoxic properties linked with A\u03b2 amyloid and tau peptides can be studied in the nematode. Autism spectrum disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by impairments in human social interaction, difficulties in communication, and restrictive and repetitive behaviours. Establishing C. elegans as a model for this complex behavioural disorder is difficult; however, abnormalities in neuronal synaptic communication are implicated in the aetiology of the disorder. Numerous studies have associated autism with mutations in several genes involved in excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the mammalian brain, including neuroligin, neurexin and shank, for which there are C. elegans orthologues. Thus, several molecular pathways and behavioural phenotypes in C. elegans have been related to autism. In general, the nematode offers a series of advantages that combined with knowledge from other animal models and human research, provides a powerful complementary experimental approach for understanding the molecular mechanisms and underlying aetiology of complex neurological diseases.",

This procedure was repeated 1 week later, without treatment changes. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients and Cronbach's alpha. Convergent validity was assessed by Spearman rank correlations and known-groups' validity, by the Mann-Whitney test. According to anonymous usability questionnaires, the patients could easily complete the tasks. Median compliance (93%) and test-retest reliability (0.88) were good. The correlations between overall score and total UPDRS (-0.64) and PDQ-39 (-0.72) were adequate. Median overall score was 18% better in the stable compared to the fluctuating group (p = 0.0014).",

    "abstract": "Lewy pathology in Parkinson disease (PD) extends well beyond the CNS, also affecting peripheral autonomic neuronal circuits, especially the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS is an integrative neuronal network also referred to as \"the brain in the gut\" because of its similarities to the CNS. We have recently shown that the ENS can be readily analyzed using routine colonic biopsies. This led us to propose that the ENS could represent a unique window to assess the neuropathology in living patients with PD. In this perspective, we discuss current evidence which indicates that the presence of ENS pathology may by exploited to improve our understanding and management of PD and likely other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "The propensity of \u03b1-synuclein to form amyloid plays an important role in Parkinson's disease. Three familial mutations, A30P, E46K, and A53T, correlate with Parkinson's disease. Therefore, unraveling the structural effects of these mutations has basic implications in understanding the molecular basis of the disease. Here, we address this issue through comparing details of the hydration of wild-type \u03b1-synuclein and its A53T mutant by a combination of wide-line NMR, differential scanning calorimetry, and molecular dynamics simulations. All three approaches suggest a hydrate shell compatible with a largely disordered state of both proteins. Its fine details, however, are different, with the mutant displaying a somewhat higher level of hydration, suggesting a bias to more open structures, favorable for protein-protein interactions leading to amyloid formation. These differences disappear in the amyloid state, suggesting basically the same surface topology, irrespective of the initial monomeric state.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative motor disorder. However, non-motor complications frequently alter the course of the disease. A particularly disabling non-motor symptom is dementia.\nThe study is designed as a multicentre prospective, observational cohort study of about 700 PD patients aged 45-80 years with or without dementia and PD-mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The patients will be recruited in eight specialized movement disorder clinics and will be followed for 36 months. Information about the patients' functional status will be assessed at baseline and 6-/12- month intervals. In addition, 120 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) will be included. Well-established standardized questionnaires/tests will be applied for detailed neuropsychological assessment. In addition, patients will be asked to participate in modules including volumetric MRI, genetic parameters, and neuropsychology to detect risk factors, early diagnostic biomarkers and predictors for dementia in PD.\nThe study included 604 PD patients by March 2011; 56.3% were classified as having PD alone, with 30.6% of patients suffering from PD-MCI and 13.1% from PD with dementia. The mean age of the cohort was 68.6 \u00b1 7.9 years, with a mean disease duration of 6.8 \u00b1 5.4 years. There was a preponderance of patients in the earlier Hoehn and Yahr stages.\nThe main aim of the study is to characterize the natural progression of cognitive impairment in PD and to identify factors which contribute to the evolution and/or progression of the cognitive impairment. To accomplish this aim we established a large cohort of PD patients without cognitive dysfunction, PD patients with MCI, and PD patients with dementia, to characterize these patients in a standardized manner, using imaging (serial structural MRI), genetic and proteomic methods in order to improve our understanding of the course of the PD process and the development of cognitive dysfunction and dementia in this disease. The inclusion of the DLB patients will start in the second quarter of 2011 in the BMBF-funded follow-up project LANDSCAPE.",

    "abstract": "External support may improve task performance regardless of an individual's ability to compensate for cognitive deficits through internally generated mechanisms. We investigated if performance of a complex, familiar visual search task (the game of bingo) could be enhanced in groups with suboptimal vision by providing external support through manipulation of task stimuli. Participants were 19 younger adults, 14 individuals with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), 13 AD-matched healthy adults, 17 non-demented individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 20 PD-matched healthy adults. We varied stimulus contrast, size, and visual complexity during game play. The externally supported performance interventions of increased stimulus size and decreased complexity resulted in improvements in performance by all groups. AD also obtained benefit from increasing contrast, presumably by compensating for their contrast sensitivity deficit. The general finding of improved performance across healthy and afflicted groups suggests the value of visual support as an easy-to-apply intervention to enhance cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Experimental research has produced evidence in recent years underlying the beneficial effects that exercise can have in preventing and deceleration of the development of Parkinson disease. These beneficial effects are exerted through various mechanisms such as neuroprotection, neurotransmission, plasticity, neurogenesis, homeostasis, and neurotrophic factors. Studies on clinical application at an early stage are still scarce, although some results are encouraging. There are still many questions to determine the most suitable type of exercise (forced/voluntary), the time of its implementation, the duration, and the combination of strategies. Nonconventional therapies can play an important role in addition to exercise, and are so numerous that they could be adapted to the circumstances of patients, although there is no evidence to date that they could have a neuroprotective effect.",

    "abstract": "Current available treatment for Parkinson disease has many drawbacks: single action on the nigrostriatal pathway, no halt of disease progression, pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation, complex treatment regimens, and motor complications. Compliance with treatment may be irregular in a variable number of patients. Factors such as age, education, complexity of posology, stage of disease, disease comprehension, cognitive function, or family support significantly influence compliance either in a positive or negative way. The consequences of noncompliance include withdrawal symptoms, increase in number of admissions, or, in severe cases, hyperthermia syndrome secondary to levodopa deficit in the case of infradose. In situations of overdose, dyskinesia or psychiatric complications may arise. The ideal treatment should have the potency of levodopa but not its side effects, act on striatal D2 receptors in a continuous way with a single dose and have low potential of addiction. Thus far, simple regimens are only applicable in early stages.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge and insight of pharmacologic safety issues and drug interactions are important for medical management of Parkinson's disease (PD). This review will discuss several topics, including apomorphine safety and interactions, impulsivity and excessive daytime somnolence associated with dopamine agonists (DAs), tolcapone hepatotoxicity, and monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) inhibitor drug interactions. Initiation of apomorphine requires antiemetic prophylaxis to minimize nausea and orthostatic hypotension. Centrally acting antidopaminergic antiemetics will worsen parkinsonism and block the therapeutic effects of apomorphine and should be avoided. Additionally, serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist antiemetics should be avoided on the basis of limited clinical data suggesting lack of efficacy for apomorphine-induced nausea. Dopamine-agonist-induced impulsivity and daytime somnolence are not uncommon. When severe, these effects can be disabling and unsafe. Tolcapone-induced hepatotoxicity has been significantly minimized with routine monitoring of liver enzymes, especially during the initial 6 months of therapy. Early detection of abnormal results will allow tolcapone discontinuation before progression to fulminant hepatotoxicity. In patients treated with selective MAO-B inhibitors, the risk of serotonin toxicity (ST) due to a concomitant serotonergic agent (e.g., antidepressants, dextromethorphan, serotonergic analgesics) or hypertensive crisis due to dietary tyramine or sympathomimetic amines appears to be minimal and is based on isolated case reports and overgeneralizations from nonselective MAO inhibitor pharmacology. Concerns about ST or hypertensive crisis should not preclude or restrict clinicians from using MAO-B inhibitors in patients with PD.",

The main complications are inadequate dopaminergic tone (\"off\" time and dose failures) and excess dopaminergic tone (dyskinesia). These motor complications increase as PD progresses.

Reducing \"off\" time can also be achieved by the addition of adjunctive therapies (dopamine agonists, catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors).

The United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria and dopamine transporter/single-photon emission computed tomography (DaT-SPECT) are diagnostic aids that can improve diagnostic accuracy. Even though PD is a progressive disease, for years, physicians and patients have delayed treatment until functional disability occurs. However, studies of monoamine oxidase-type B (MAO-B) inhibitors, dopamine agonists, and levodopa, all of which can be used as initial therapy, have demonstrated that PD patients receiving treatment do better than those who do not receive treatment, and some studies have shown that those receiving treatment earlier do better long term. Therefore, the management strategy for PD has moved toward earlier initiation of treatment. Although treatment for each patient should be individualized and based on their specific symptoms, severity, and lifestyle, in general MAO-B inhibitors may be used initially to treat mild symptoms, adding a dopamine agonist in younger patients or levodopa in older patients, as symptoms become more severe.",

Trials evaluating the use of coenzyme Q10, pramipexole, and levodopa suggest that these medications offer symptomatic benefit uniquely, while other studies reveal that rasagiline and selegiline may be disease modifying. This review will discuss in detail the design and results of clinical trials for varied medical therapies that were specifically undertaken to discern whether a particular treatment might be disease modifying in the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are dynamic organelles which are essential for many cellular processes, such as ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation, lipid metabolism, assembly of iron sulfur clusters, regulation of calcium homeostasis, and cell death pathways. The dynamic changes in mitochondrial morphology, connectivity, and subcellular distribution are critically dependent on a highly regulated fusion and fission machinery. Mitochondrial function, dynamics, and quality control are vital for the maintenance of neuronal integrity. Indeed, there is mounting evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in several neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, the identification of genes linked to rare familial variants of Parkinson's disease has fueled research on mitochondrial aspects of the disease etiopathogenesis. Studies on the function of parkin and PINK1, which are associated with autosomal recessive parkinsonism, provided compelling evidence that these proteins can functionally interact to maintain mitochondrial integrity and to promote clearance of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria. In this review we will summarize current knowledge about the impact of parkin and PINK1 on mitochondria.",

Despite adequate lowering of the body temperature, multiorgan-dysfunction syndrome including encephalopathy, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was noted in one patient, leading to permanent neurologic damage. Because the ensuing multiorgan dysfunction could determine the functional prognosis in heatstroke patients, it is important to provide information about the prevention of heatstroke to patients, who are isolated or are severely disabled in the advanced stages of PD.",

We investigated factors related to falling, including walking speed and time, in patients with Hoehn-Yahr stage III PD.\nWe performed clinical assessments and evaluated balance in 30 patients with PD. Information on falling was obtained from questionnaires and personal interviews. Gait patterns were analyzed with the use of an originally designed, suddenly narrowed path.\nGait velocity was slower in fallers than in non-fallers (p = 0.047).

An impairment of health status occurred in relation to the increase in pain syndromes in PD patients. There was a significant increase in VAS scores in relation to the EQ-5D group membership. Female patients reported more on pain and more frequently received a pain drug treatment than male patients. Significant associations were found between the VAS and the EQ-5D scores, and the correlation coefficients were higher in men than in women.\nPain is associated with the health status of PD patients and worsens it.

    "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are a promising source of cells for applications in regenerative medicine. Directed differentiation of PSCs into specialized cells such as spinal motoneurons or midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons has been achieved. However, the effective use of PSCs for cell therapy has lagged behind. Whereas mouse PSC-derived DA neurons have shown efficacy in models of Parkinson's disease, DA neurons from human PSCs generally show poor in vivo performance. There are also considerable safety concerns for PSCs related to their potential for teratoma formation or neural overgrowth. Here we present a novel floor-plate-based strategy for the derivation of human DA neurons that efficiently engraft in vivo, suggesting that past failures were due to incomplete specification rather than a specific vulnerability of the cells. Midbrain floor-plate precursors are derived from PSCs 11 days after exposure to small molecule activators of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and canonical WNT signalling. Engraftable midbrain DA neurons are obtained by day 25 and can be maintained in vitro for several months. Extensive molecular profiling, biochemical and electrophysiological data define developmental progression and confirm identity of PSC-derived midbrain DA neurons. In vivo survival and function is demonstrated in Parkinson's disease models using three host species. Long-term engraftment in 6-hydroxy-dopamine-lesioned mice and rats demonstrates robust survival of midbrain DA neurons derived from human embryonic stem (ES) cells, complete restoration of amphetamine-induced rotation behaviour and improvements in tests of forelimb use and akinesia. Finally, scalability is demonstrated by transplantation into parkinsonian monkeys. Excellent DA neuron survival, function and lack of neural overgrowth in the three animal models indicate promise for the development of cell-based therapies in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) is relevant to the preparation of movement ignition but its role in movement termination is uncertain. Fourteen patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) received local field potentials (LFPs) recording at the left STN on the fourth day after deep brain stimulation surgery. They performed phasic and tonic movements of the right wrist extensor. Movement onset (Mon) and movement offset (Moff) of the electromyographic activities were used as triggers to determine an eight-second LFPs epoch for time-frequency analysis. Movement-related power changes were assessed by repeated measures analysis of variance with within-subject factors of Event (Mon and Moff), Period (ten time periods for phasic movement and six time periods for tonic movement), and Frequency (alpha, low-beta, and high-beta). There was significant triple interaction in both the phasic and tonic movements. By post-hoc analysis, high-beta event-related de-synchronization (ERD) appeared earlier (3s prior to Mon) than those of low-beta and alpha for the Mon phasic movement. There was no alpha ERD for the Mon tonic movement. Alpha, low-beta, and high-beta ERD all appeared about 1s prior to the Moff tonic movement. The current findings suggest that STN participates in the preparation of volitional movement termination but via a different mechanism from that in movement initiation. Unlike asynchronous ERD frequency bands present in movement initiation, a simultaneous ERD across wide frequency bands in STN may play a pivotal role in terminating volitional movement.",

However the prevalence and the pattern of these complications are lacking for LRRK2 (leucine-rich kinase 2)-associated PD patients.\nThe purpose of this study was to assess cognitive function in LRRK2- associated PD patients.\n55 patients diagnosed with PD-related LRRK2 G2019S mutation were included in the study and compared to the same number of G2019S non-carriers PD patients. Age, sex, disease duration, the movement disorder society-unified Parkinson's Disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr stage, Schwab and England scale and the 30-item geriatric depression scale (GDS) scores were noted. Cognitive assessment included MMSE (Mini-Mental Examination), MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and FAB (Frontal Assessment Battery).\nMMSE, MOCA and FAB performance in G2019S carriers PD patients was similar to that of non-carriers. In both groups, performance was primarily impaired on visuospatial and executive tasks. Cognitive impairment was associated with older age, lower educational level and increased severity of motor impairment.\nCognitive functions were similarly affected in PD patients with and without LRRK2 G2019S mutation with mainly impaired visuospatial and executive abilities. However, these results need to be confirmed by further large and prospective studies.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation is the major pathological hallmark seen in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Alpha-synuclein (\u03b1S) is the main component of protein aggregates that form Lewy bodies (LBs) in PD and dementia with LBs. There have been several attempts to intervene in the process of expression, modification, clearance, and aggregation of \u03b1S as a therapeutic strategy toward neuroprotection. In this study, we have employed a novel, predictive, system level approach in silico to study four different strategies of anti-aggregation therapies: (a) reduction in \u03b1S modifications such as phosphorylation, nitration, or truncation in an approach called \"seed clearance;\" (b) \"anti-oligomerization\" approach through blocking the early oligomers formation; (c) \"oligomers clearance\" process by increasing its lysosomal degradation; and (d) \"anti-aggregation\" that involves prevention of aggregate formation at a later stage. These strategies were tested in a virtual dopaminergic neuronal system triggered by overexpression (OE) of mutant \u03b1S-A53T with or without rotenone (Rot)-induced oxidative stress. The results were compared by analyzing markers related to various end points such as oxidative stress, dopamine (DA) metabolism, proteasome function, survival and apoptosis. The experimental system and anti-oligomerization strategies were recapitulated in vitro in M17 dopaminergic cells overexpressing mutant \u03b1S-A53T triggered with Cu(II)-mediated oxidative stress, and the experimental data prospectively corroborated with the predictive results. Through this analysis, we found that intervention in the early part of the aggregation pathway by prevention of oligomer formation and increased clearance is indeed a good neuroprotective strategy, whereas anti-aggregation efforts to break up the aggregate at later stages has negative effects on the system.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that microglial activation may participate in the aetiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). CD200-CD200R signalling has been shown to be critical for restraining microglial activation. We have previously shown that expression of CD200R in monocyte-derived macrophages, induced by various stimuli, is impaired in PD patients, implying an intrinsic abnormality of CD200-CD200R signalling in PD brain. Thus, further in vivo evidence is needed to elucidate the role of malfunction of CD200-CD200R signalling in the pathogenesis of PD.\n6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats were used as an animal model of PD. CD200R-blocking antibody (BAb) was injected into striatum to block the engagement of CD200 and CD200R. The animals were divided into three groups, which were treated with 6-OHDA/Veh (PBS), 6-OHDA/CAb (isotype control antibody) or 6-OHDA/BAb, respectively. Rotational tests and immunohistochemistry were employed to evaluate motor deficits and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in animals from each group. HPLC analysis was used to measure monoamine levels in striatum. Morphological analysis and quantification of CD11b- (or MHC II-) immunoreactive cells were performed to investigate microglial activation and possible neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra (SN). Finally, ELISA was employed to assay protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines.\nCompared with 6-OHDA/CAb or 6-OHDA/Veh groups, rats treated with 6-OHDA/BAb showed a significant increase in counts of contralateral rotation and a significant decrease in TH-immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons in SN. A marked decrease in monoamine levels was also detected in 6-OHDA/BAb-treated rats, in comparison to 6-OHDA/Veh-treated ones. Furthermore, remarkably increased activation of microglia as well as up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines was found concomitant with dopaminergic neurodegeneration in 6-OHDA/BAb-treated rats.\nThis study shows that deficits in the CD200-CD200R system exacerbate microglial activation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a 6-OHDA-induced rat model of PD. Our results suggest that dysfunction of CD200-CD200R signalling may be involved in the aetiopathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to clarify the relationship between serum 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) and the clinical effects of entacapone. The 3-OMD and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of levodopa were measured in 21 Parkinson's Disease patients who took 100 mg levodopa / dopa decarboxylase inhibitor. After the administration of entacapone, the 3-OMD concentration and percentage of \"on\" time during waking hours (% of \"on\" time) were studied for 8 weeks. The 3-OMD concentration was reduced by 34%, and the increase in % of \"on\" time was 28% at the 8th week compared with baseline. We defined the COMT-index as [baseline 3-OMD concentration] / [levodopa Cmax when 100 mg levodopa was administered alone]. The COMT-index was significantly correlated with the increase in % of \"on\" time at the 8th week. In conclusion, the measurement of baseline 3-OMD and levodopa pharmacokinetics is useful for predicting the clinical effects of entacapone.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease affects over one million people in the United States. Although there have been remarkable advances in uncovering the pathogenesis of this disabling disorder, the etiology is speculative. Medical treatment and operative procedures provide symptomatic relief only. Compression of the cerebral peduncle of the midbrain by the posterior cerebral artery in a patient with Parkinson's Disease (Parkinson's Disease) was noted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and at operation in a patient with trigeminal neuralgia. Following the vascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve, the midbrain was decompressed by mobilizing and repositioning the posterior cerebral artery The patient's Parkinson's signs disappeared over a 48-hour period. They returned 18 months later with contralateral peduncle compression. A blinded evaluation of MRI scans of Parkinson's patients and controls was performed. MRI scans in 20 Parkinson's patients and 20 age and sex matched controls were evaluated in blinded fashion looking for the presence and degree of arterial compression of the cerebral peduncle. The MRI study showed that 73.7 percent of Parkinson's Disease patients had visible arterial compression of the cerebral peduncle. This was seen in only 10 percent of control patients (two patients, one of whom subsequently developed Parkinson's Disease); thus 5 percent. Vascular compression of the cerebral peduncle by the posterior cerebral artery may be associated with Parkinson's Disease in some patients. Microva-scular decompression of that artery away from the peduncle may be considered for treatment of Parkinson's Disease in some patients.",

    "abstract": "MSA-P and IPD have similar clinical presentations that may complicate accurate clinical diagnosis. Different iron-deposition patterns of those 2 diseases have been demonstrated in histopathology. The aim was to demonstrate the different iron-deposition patterns of MSA-P and IPD by using SWI phase images.\nSixteen patients with IPD, 8 with MSA-P, and 44 age-matched healthy controls underwent SWI of brain. The different phase shifts as well as the high iron percentage of the area in several gray nuclei were statistically evaluated. The putamen was divided into 4 subregions for further analysis.\nPatients with MSA-P had significantly higher iron deposition in the putamen and PT compared with those with IPD (P < .05). Moreover, ROC curves indicated slightly more sensitivity in differentiating MSA-P from IPD, by means of the high-iron-deposition-percentage area than the average phase shift (putamen: AUC = 0.88 versus 0.78; PT: AUC = 0.79 versus 0.62). Moreover, the lower inner region of the putamen was the most valuable subregion in differentiating MSA-P from IPD among the 4 subregions (AUC = 0.92 and 0.91 for high-iron-percentage area and average phase shift, respectively).\nHigher iron deposition in the putamen and PT may differentiate MSA-P from IPD, but the lower inner region of the putamen may be better compared with the PT and other subregions of the putamen. Moreover, the high iron percentage makes it possible to detect smaller increases in iron content more confidently in comparison with average phase shift.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates and degeneration of melanized, catecholaminergic neurons. The tissue transglutaminase (tTG) enzyme catalyzes molecular protein cross-linking. In PD, tTG levels are increased and cross-linking has been identified as an important factor in \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. In our quest to link tTGs distribution in the human brain to the hallmarks of PD pathology, we recently reported that catecholaminergic neurons in PD disease-affected brain areas display typical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) granules showing tTG immunoreactivity. In the present study, we set out to elucidate the nature of the interaction between tTG and the ER in PD pathogenesis, using retinoic-acid differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exposed to the PD-mimetic 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)). Alike our observations in PD brain, MPP(+)-treated cells displayed typical TG-positive granules, that were also induced by other PD mimetics and by ER-stress inducing toxins. Additional immunocytochemical and biochemical investigation revealed that tTG is indeed associated to the ER, in particular at the cytoplasmic face of the ER. Upon MPP(+) exposure, additional recruitment of tTG toward the ER was found. In addition, we observed that MPP(+)-induced tTG activity results in transamidation of ER membrane proteins, like calnexin. Our data provide strong evidence for a, so far unrecognized, localization of tTG at the ER, at least in catecholaminergic neurons, and suggests that in PD activation of tTG may have a direct impact on ER function, in particular via post-translational modification of ER membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD) many motor and non-motor symptoms are difficult to explain in terms of a purely ascending degeneration process as described by Braak. This essay proposes phylogenetic considerations for consolidating the multidimensional elements of PD. Subtle clinical analysis paired with ethological comparisons as well as patho-anatomical data suggests that disrupted automatic gait control, olfactory deficits, selected visual deficits, impaired emotional face recognition, and REM sleep behavior disorder could be due to dysfunction of phylogenetically ancient networks. Neuroanatomical and behavioral findings lead to a reconsideration of the basal ganglia, to be viewed as the nuclear core of a widely distributed neural network that arborizes throughout the primordial core of the neuraxis, including the brainstem. Fragility of the resulting multiple, closed, ancillary loops that link brainstem and forebrain components of the basal ganglia may be a nodal point, pivotal to the pathogenesis of PD. Other primitive neural networks, such as those located at cardiac or gastro-intestinal levels, may share the same vulnerability. Such a network-based hypothesis overrides the need of a fixed temporal ordering of symptoms based on putative caudal-cephalic propagation patterns of pathological lesions. It also creates testable, secondary hypotheses such as differential gene expression in different neural networks, potential early epigenetic influences, concepts of \"overuse\" or maladaptation of primitive networks to the constraints of adult life, and system frailty due to irreparable mitochondrial \"exhaustion\" in highly energy consuming postmitotic cells.",

    "abstract": "To ascertain the prevalence and determinants of neuropathy in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), in particular, the roles of vitamin B12 and levodopa exposure.\nWe performed a cross-sectional study of 37 patients with PD and 37 age- and gender-matched controls, using a sensitive and validated neuropathy scale. The prevalence of neuropathy was determined and compared between groups. We then ascertained the role of vitamin B12 by a separate case-control analysis (1) comparing numbers of patients in whom the neuropathy was directly attributable to vitamin B12 deficiency and (2) comparing serum vitamin B12 levels in patients with PD with neuropathy with a second control group consisting of age- and gender-matched consecutive patients with neuropathy without PD. We also determined correlations between cumulative levodopa exposure, PD duration, neuropathy status and score, and vitamin B12 status and levels in all patients with PD and, specifically, in those with neuropathy.\nFourteen of 37 (37.8%) patients with PD and 3 of 37 (8.1%) control subjects had neuropathy (p = 0.005), corresponding to an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for neuropathy, of 6.9 (1.78-26.73). Vitamin B12 deficiency was a significantly more common cause of neuropathy (p = 0.024) and vitamin B12 levels were significantly lower (p = 0.002) in patients with PD with neuropathy than in age- and gender-matched consecutive control subjects with neuropathy without PD. Cumulative levodopa exposure correlated with PD duration (p = 0.001) and vitamin B12 levels (p = 0.044), in patients with PD with neuropathy.\nNeuropathy is more prevalent in patients with PD than in control subjects. This may be predominantly due to vitamin B12 deficiency, which could relate to cumulative levodopa exposure in susceptible individuals. Vitamin B12 monitoring and supplementation, as well as serial clinical assessment for neuropathy, may be advisable in patients with PD.",

We aimed to evaluate prevalence and severity of nighttime sleep disturbances in Italian PD patients and to validate the Italian version of the Parkinson's disease sleep scale. A total of 221 PD patients and 57 healthy controls participated in a cross-sectional study with retest. PDSS, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and Hoehn and Yahr staging were applied. PDSS total and individual items scores from patients were significantly lower than those in controls. Internal consistency of PDSS scale was satisfactory and intraclass correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0.96 for total PDSS score. A significant negative correlation was found between total PDSS and ESS scores, and between total PDSS and HDRS scores. PDSS scores were also related to UPDRS sections II, III and IV, and H&Y stage. PDSS and ESS scores were not related to levodopa equivalent dose. Daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms and disease severity correlate with sleep disturbances in Italian PD patients. The PDSS is a valid and reliable tool to evaluate sleep disturbances in Italian patients.",

Gastrointestinal symptoms in PD include reduced salivation, dysphagia, impaired gastric emptying, constipation, and defecatory dysfunction. Constipation may precede the development of somatic motor symptoms of PD for several years. Neuropathological studies show early accumulation of abnormal alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-SYN) containing inclusions (Lewy neurites) in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) both in PD and in incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD). These findings provided the basis for the hypothesis that \u03b1-SYN pathology progresses in a centripetal, prion-like fashion, from the ENS to the DMV and then to more rostral areas of the central nervous system. Colonic biopsies may show accumulation \u03b1-SYN immunoreactive Lewy neurites in the submucosal plexus of PD patients. Salivary gland involvement is prominent in PD and \u03b1-SYN pathology can be detected both at autopsy and in minor salivary gland biopsies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder, is characterized by age-dependent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the mid-brain. Non-motor symptoms of PD, however, precede the motor features caused by dysfunction of the dopaminergic system, suggesting that PD is a systemic disorder. Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been observed in PD patients and animal models, but the mechanistic link between mitochondrial dysfunction and PD pathogenesis is not well understood. Recent studies have revealed that genes associated with autosomal recessive forms of PD such as PINK1 and Parkin are directly involved in regulating mitochondrial morphology and maintenance, abnormality of which is also observed in the more common, sporadic forms of PD, although the autosomal recessive PDs lack Lewy-body pathology that is characteristic of sporadic PD. These latest findings suggest that at least some forms of PD can be characterized as a mitochondrial disorder. Whether mitochondrial dysfunction represents a unifying pathogenic mechanism of all PD cases remains a major unresolved question.",

Therefore, we evaluated 52 non-demented PD patients, 22 of them with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) who were matched with 52 healthy controls. Our results confirm the existence of dysfunction in information processing speed, executive function, verbal memory and visuo-perceptual processing in PD. On the other hand, PD-MCI was associated with advanced age at the onset of PD, more neuropsychiatric symptoms, caregiver stress and functional problems. The study supports the hypothesis that specific neuropsychological impairments may act as modulators of functional impairment in PD, for instance slowness of information processing.",

Despite the fact that numerous mutations causing hereditary forms of Parkinson's disease have been identified in the last decade, current transgenic animal models do not adequately reproduce cardinal features of the human disease. Altogether, the animal models derived of human mutations indicate that the nigrostriatal degenerative process results from the combination of several mechanisms that implicate mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, and protein degradation impairment.\nWe performed a literature search between 2008 and 2010.\nThe absence of adequate in vivo experimental models of Parkinson's disease has severe repercussions for therapeutic intervention success for this incurable neurodegenerative disorder.

    "abstract": "Purpose. To trial four-week's physiotherapy targeting chair transfers for people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) and explore the feasibility of reliance on remote outcome measurement to preserve blinding. Scope. We recruited 47 PwPD and randomised 24 to a focused home physiotherapy programme (exercise, movement strategies, and cueing) and 23 to a control group. We evaluated transfers (plus mobility, balance, posture, and quality of life) before and after treatment and at followup (weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12) from video produced by, and questionnaires distributed by, treating physiotherapists. Participants fed back via end-of-study questionnaires. Thirty-five participants (74%) completed the trial. Excluding dropouts, 20% of questionnaire data and 9% of video data were missing or unusable; we had to evaluate balance in situ. We noted trends to improvement in transfers, mobility, and balance in the physiotherapy group not noted in the control group. Participant feedback was largely positive and assessor blinding was maintained in every case. Conclusions. Intense, focused physiotherapy at home appears acceptable and likely to bring positive change in those who can participate. Remote outcome measurement was successful; questionnaire followup and further training in video production would reduce missing data. We advocate a fully powered trial, designed to minimise dropouts and preserve assessor blinding, to evaluate this intervention.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has proven effective in treating the major motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study was to learn which laryngeal and articulatory acoustic features changed in patients who were reported to have worse speech with stimulation. Six volunteers with PD who had bilateral STN electrodes were recorded with DBS turned on or off. Perceptual ratings reflected poorer speech performance with DBS on. Acoustic measures of articulation (corner vowel formants, diphthong slopes, and a spirantization index) and phonation (perturbation, long-term average spectrum) as well as verbal fluency scores showed mixed results with DBS. Some speakers improved while others became worse on individual measures. The magnitude of DBS effects was not predictable based on the patients' demographic characteristics. Future research involving adjustments to stimulator settings or electrode placement may be beneficial in limiting the negative effects of DBS on speech.",

    "abstract": "The neurotransmitter dopamine is oxidized to its quinone (DA-Q), which at neutral pH undergoes intramolecular cyclization by 1,4-Michael addition, followed by oxidation to form leukochrome, then aminochrome, and finally neuromelanin. At lower pH, the amino group of DA is partially protonated, allowing the competitive intermolecular 1,4-Michael addition with nucleophiles in DNA to form the depurinating adducts, DA-6-N3Ade and DA-6-N7Gua. Catechol estrogen-3,4-quinones react by 1,4-Michael addition to form the depurinating 4-hydroxyestrone(estradiol)-1-N3Ade [4-OHE1(E2)-1-N3Ade] and 4-OHE1(E2)-1-N7Gua adducts, which are implicated in the initiation of breast and other human cancers. The effect of pH was studied by reacting tyrosinase-activated DA with DNA and measuring the formation of depurinating adducts. The most adducts were formed at pH 4, 5, and 6, and their level was nominal at pH 7 and 8. The N3Ade adduct depurinated instantaneously, but N7Gua had a half-life of 3 H. The slow loss of the N7Gua adduct is analogous to that observed in previous studies of natural and synthetic estrogens. The antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and resveratrol efficiently blocked formation of the DA-DNA adducts. Thus, slightly acidic conditions render competitive the reaction of DA-Q with DNA to form depurinating adducts. We hypothesize that formation of these adducts could lead to mutations that initiate Parkinson's disease. If so, use of N-acetylcysteine and resveratrol as dietary supplements may prevent initiation of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction is an integral part of the Parkinson disease (PD) symptom spectrum. Early detection of cognitive dysfunction could help to delineate prevention strategies. Our main objective was to study the validity of brief cognitive tests, the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), as cognitive screening tools for detecting global and executive cognitive deficits in early stages of PD, as compared to a healthy control population.\nWe evaluated 75 early-stage PD patients and 45 healthy age-matched and education-matched controls with the MMSE (global test) and FAB (frontal test), and compared total and subtest scores. We evaluated PD motor function with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part III. We assessed the relationship between cognitive and motor variables.\nFrontal and global cognitive dysfunction was significantly more frequent in PD patients. PD patients scored significantly lower on FAB total and similarities, motor series, and conflicting instructions scores, and on the MMSE total, visuoconstructive, and memory scores. MMSE scores correlated significantly with Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part III total score, speech, and bradykinesia scores.\nEarly-stage PD patients present with frontal, memory, and visuoconstructive deficits in brief cognitive tests. Our results suggest that these brief bedside tests are useful for cognitive deficit screening in the early stages of PD. Our study did not account for the influence of depression in cognition. This constitutes a limitation, because many PD patients have depressive symptoms, which some studies have shown can be related to cognitive dysfunction.",

In contrast, the effect on disability is not systematically evaluated.

Student's t-test was used to assess the difference in the disability score between patients declaring and not declaring NMS. In total, 86 patients were enrolled and reported a median of nine NMS. Patients reporting symptoms in cognitive, emotional, cardiovascular, and sleep functions, as well as those reporting more than nine symptoms as a whole, also reported higher disability levels.

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) has been defined as a chronic progressive neurological disorder with characteristics that generate changes in gait pattern. Several studies have reported that appropriate external influences, such as visual or auditory cues may improve the gait pattern of patients with IPD. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use three-dimensional (3D) analysis to evaluate the effects of parallel (PVC) and transverse visual spatial cues (TVCs) on gait variables (spatiotemporal and kinematic) of individuals with IPD. Twelve IPD patients were recruited from the Neurology Clinic, Medical School Hospital, Unicamp. The patients were initially evaluated using a modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale and subsection III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. A 3D analysis system consisting of six infrared cameras and 18 markers (with a sampling rate of 240 Hz) was used for gait evaluation at the Laboratory for Rehabilitation and Biomechanics of the Locomotor System - Unicamp. Patients were asked to walk down a walkway under the following circumstances: baseline condition (BC, without visual cues), TVCs (20 pieces of white adhesive tape, 5 cm width and 50 cm length, placed 45 cm apart) and PVCs (two adhesive white tapes, 30 cm distance between them, 5 cm width each tape, along the walkway). Compared with the patients without visual cues, gait velocity was higher with the aid of visual cues (PVCs and TVCs, P=0.003), and the percentage of leg stance time was smaller when cues were used (this value was significant for the right leg, P=0.008). In addition, stride length was significantly higher with the use of TVCs (P=0.006) compared with BC and PVCs. Regarding kinematic variables, TVCs resulted in smaller ranges of motion in knee joint flexion at initial contact and higher maximal amplitudes of knee flexion during the oscillatory phase compared with BC and PVCs. In conclusion, The use of TVCs on the gait evaluation results in improved gait variables compared with BC and PVCs. Therefore, the use of TVCs in a rehabilitation plan would be ideal for a physiotherapeutic treatment with emphasis on gait alterations.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease were suspected by Brissaud in the late 19th century. They were subsequently confirmed by Tretiakoff but neglected by Lewy, who described the inclusion bodies that bear his name. The experimental Parkinsonian syndrome caused by reserpine led Carlsson to discover the neuromediatory role of dopamine, a finding at the origin of L-DOPA therapy. Identification of a mutation of the alpha-synuclein gene in cases of familial Parkinson's disease with autosomal dominant transmission was followed by the detection of the protein product in Lewy bodies and neurites. Alpha-synuclein is now recognized as being the main constituent of Lewy bodies. Alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry has revealed that lesions can extend from the autonomous nervous system to the cortex (in Lewy body dementia). The Lewy body itself does not appear to be the direct cause of symptoms, which correlate better with neuronal death. Neuronal death could be due to metabolic disturbances related to alpha-synuclein accumulation, ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction, or oxidative stress. Non-autonomous cell death, caused by neuro-inflammation or gliosis, has also been incriminated.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa has been the mainstay of treatment for Parkinson's disease since the 1960s, but the dyskinesias it induces are a major drawback. High-frequency deep brain stimulation offers a safe, reversible alternative. Targets include the thalamus, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus and, more recently, the pedunculopntine nucleus, which requires low-frequency excitation. The subthalamic nucleus is the preferred target in Parkinson's disease. Other treatments such as gene therapy are in the pipeline.",

    "abstract": "Mutations of the gene for PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are a cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). PINK1 protein has been localised to mitochondria and PINK1 gene knockout models exhibit abnormal mitochondrial function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cells derived from PD patients with a range of PINK1 mutations demonstrate similar defects of mitochondrial function, whether the nature and severity of the abnormalities vary between mutations and correlate with clinical features.\nWe investigated mitochondrial bioenergetics in live fibroblasts from PINK1 mutation patients using single cell techniques. We found that fibroblasts from PINK1 mutation patients had significant defects of bioenergetics including reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, altered redox state, a respiratory deficiency that was determined by substrate availability, and enhanced sensitivity to calcium stimulation and associated mitochondrial permeability pore opening. There was an increase in the basal rate of free radical production in the mutant cells. The pattern and severity of abnormality varied between different mutations, and the less severe defects in these cells were associated with later age of onset of PD.\nThe results provide insight into the molecular pathology of PINK1 mutations in PD and also confirm the critical role of substrate availability in determining the biochemical phenotype--thereby offering the potential for novel therapeutic strategies to circumvent these abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, late-onset movement disorder with selective degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Although the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) has been used to induce progressive degeneration of DA neurons in various animal models of PD, the precise molecular pathway and the impact of anti-apoptotic treatment on this neurodegeneration are less understood. Following a striatal injection of 6-OHDA, we observed atrophy and progressive death of DA neurons in wild-type mice. These degenerating DA neurons never exhibited signs of apoptosis (i.e., caspase-3 activation and cytoplasmic release of cytochrome C), but rather show nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), a hallmark of regulated necrosis. However, mice with genetic deletion of the proapoptotic gene Bax (Bax-KO) exhibited a complete absence of 6-OHDA-induced DA neuron death and nuclear translocation of AIF, indicating that 6-OHDA-induced DA neuronal death is mediated by Bax-dependent AIF activation. On the other hand, DA neurons that survived in Bax-KO mice exhibited marked neuronal atrophy, without significant improvement of PD-related behavioral deficits. These findings suggest that anti-apoptotic therapy may not be sufficient for PD treatment, and the prevention of Bax-independent neuronal atrophy may be an important therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "In healthy subjects, comfortable walking minimizes the energy cost (E (c)) of locomotion. In Parkinson's disease (PD) patients walking is slower than in healthy subjects: this may increase E (c). Our aims were to analyze gait and E (c) in PD patients during walking, particularly at self-selected speed, and the possible pathological, mechanical, and cardiorespiratory limitations. Fourteen mild-to-moderate PD and 14 control subjects were enrolled. Subjects underwent 5-min walking tests at two speeds: self-selected and as-fast-as-possible speeds. Cardiopulmonary and gait parameters (heart rate, ventilation, gas exchanges, step count) were recorded. Velocity was reduced in PD compared to control subjects at both speeds (P < 0.05), and PD patients had shorter strides (P < 0.05) at both speeds and reduced cadence (P = 0.01) at fastest speed. No significant difference was found in E (c) at self-selected (0.12 \u00b1 0.04 versus 0.11 \u00b1 0.02 mLO(2) kg(-1) m(-1) in PD and control subjects, respectively) and maximal (0.14 \u00b1 0.03 versus 0.15 \u00b1 0.02 mLO(2) kg(-1) m(-1) in PD and control subjects, respectively) speed. However, the E (c) increment from self-selected to fastest velocity was significantly lower (P = 0.02) in PD patients. PD patients failed to walk at a self-selected speed, which minimizes the E (c). This could be mainly due to the inability to develop a wider stride. Cardiorespiratory adaptation was not affected, except for the possible reduced cardiac adaptation observed in some (28%) cases. Presumably, rehabilitation procedures that improve flexibility and step length may help maintain walking ability.",

We evaluated Anatomy 1.7 of SPM toolbox compared to 'Talairach Daemon' (TD) Client 2.4.2 software.\nOne hundred and thirty-six patients (mean age 60.0 \u00b1 9.09 years; 73 women and 63 men) with non-demented PD were selected. Tc-99m-HMPAO brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans were performed on the patients using a two-head gamma-camera. We analyzed the brain image of PD patients by SPM8 and found the anatomical names of correlated regions of rCBF perfusion with the clinical parameters using TD Client 2.4.2 and Anatomy 1.7. The SPM8 provided a correlation coefficient between clinical parameters and cerebral hypoperfusion by a simple regression method. To the clinical parameters were added age, duration of disease, education period, Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage and Korean mini-mental state examination (K-MMSE) score.\nAge was correlated with cerebral perfusion in the Brodmann area (BA) 6 and BA 3b assigned by Anatomy 1.7 and BA 6 and pyramis in gray matter by TD Client 2.4.2 with p < 0.001 uncorrected. Also, assigned significant correlated regions were found in the left and right lobules VI (Hem) with duration of disease, in left and right lobules VIIa crus I (Hem) with education, in left insula (Ig2), left and right lobules VI (Hem) with H&Y, and in BA 4a and 6 with K-MMSE score with p < 0.05 uncorrected by Anatomy 1.7, respectively. Most areas of correlation were overlapped by two different anatomical labeling methods, but some correlation areas were found with different names.\nAge was the most significantly correlated clinical parameter with rCBF. TD Client found the exact anatomical name by the peak intensity position of the cluster while Anatomy 1.7 of SPM8 toolbox, using the cyto-architectonic probability maps, assigned the anatomical name by percentage value of the probability.",

    "abstract": "To determine the prevalence of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease (PD-D) in a Brazilian sample adopting clinical and diagnostic procedures recommended by the Movement Disorders Society (MDS). Sixty-seven patients were consecutively submitted to neurological, neuropsychological and functional examinations. PD-D was established according to MDS clinical criteria (Level II) and clinical procedures for PD-D (Level I) and prevalence rate was compared between the levels adopted. Ten patients (14.9%) were diagnosed as demented by Level I criteria whereas sixteen (23.8%) were diagnosed based on Level II criteria. Level I criteria had low sensitivity in detecting PD-D (31.25%), but greater specificity (90.19). The PD-D group had significantly worse performance on all neuropsychological tests, were older (p<0.001), had an older age of onset of disease (p<0.01), had lower educational level (p<0.02) and had higher scores on functional scales. Current age (p=0.046) and Hoehn & Yahr score (p=0.048) were predictors for developing PD-D.",

    "abstract": "DJ-1, Parkinson's disease PARK7, acts as an oxidative stress sensor in neural cells. Recently, we identified the DJ-1 modulator UCP0054278 by in silico virtual screening. However, the effect of the peripheral administration of UCP0054278 on an in vivo Parkinson's disease (PD) model is unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effects of the peripheral administration of UCP0054278 on both 6-OHDA-microinjected rats and rotenone-treated mice as acute and chronic animal models of PD, respectively. The peripheral administration of UCP0054278 prevented 6-OHDA- and rotenone-induced dopaminergic neural cell death and restored the defect in locomotion in these models of PD. In addition, 6-OHDA- or rotenone-induced neural cell death and the production of reactive oxygen species were significantly inhibited by UCP0054278 in normal SH-SY5Y cells, but not in DJ-1-knockdown cells. These results suggest that UCP0054278 interacts with endogenous DJ-1 and then produces antioxidant and neuroprotective responses in both in vivo and in vitro models of PD. The present study raises the possibility that DJ-1 stimulatory modulators, such as UCP0054278, may be a new type of dopaminergic neuroprotective drug for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that apathy and depression are dissociable in Parkinson disease (PD) by conducting a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of items from two commonly used mood scales. A total of 161 non-demented PD patients (age = 64.1; \u00b1 8.4 years) were administered the Apathy Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Items were hypothesized to load onto four factors: (1) an apathy factor representing loss of motivation, (2) dysphoric mood factor representing sadness and negativity, (3) loss of interest/pleasure factor representing the features common to both apathy and depression, and (4) a somatic factor representing bodily complaints. Results indicated a good fit for the overall CFA model, \u03c7\u00b2 (128, N = 146) = 194.9; p<.01. RMSEA was .060 (p = .16). The four-factor model was significantly better than all alternative nested models at p < .001, including an overarching single factor model, representing \"depression.\" Results support the concept that apathy and depression are discrete constructs. We suggest a \"factor based\" scoring of the Apathy Scale and Beck Depression Inventory-II that disentangles symptoms related to apathy, depression, overlapping symptoms, and somatic complaints. Such scoring may be important in providing useful information regarding differential treatment options.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease remains unknown, although many genetic and environmental factors are suggested as likely causes. Neuronal oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated as possible triggers for the onset and progression of Parkinson's neurodegeneration. We have recently shown that long-term treadmill exercise prevented neurological, mitochondrial and locomotor deficits in a chronic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and probenecid-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease that was originally established in our laboratory. In the present study, we further demonstrated that long-term exercise attenuated both cytochrome c release and elevated levels of p53, which are known to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in the striatum of this chronic model. On the other hand, the expressions of mitochondrial transcription factor A and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1\u03b1 were unexpectedly upregulated in the striatum of this chronic model, but long-term exercise training brought their levels down closer to normal. Our findings suggest that maintaining normal mitochondrial function is essential for preventing the process of Parkinson's disease-like neurodegeneration, whereas stimulating the mitochondrial transcription factors for biogenesis is not obligatory.",

Cognitive tests included the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders and a battery of neuropsychological tests taken from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery and the Vienna Test System.\nDe novo patients with PD were more impaired in working memory strategy use than healthy controls and treated patients with PD. Furthermore, the generation of random motor behaviour was more impaired in both de novo and treated PD patients than in healthy controls. Correlation analysis revealed that in treated patients with PD, ascending doses of dopaminergic medication were associated with poorer performance on a pattern recognition task.\nSelective impairments in strategy use and the generation of random motor behaviour are a very early feature of PD and might be of predictive value in further frontal cognitive deterioration. Furthermore, DA replacement therapy seems to improve frontal lobe function (strategy use) and worsen temporal lobe function (visual memory).",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested increased prevalence of impulsive/compulsive behaviors (ICB) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) as compared to general population in different ethnic groups. The spectrum of these behaviors includes dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), punding, pathological gambling (PG), hypersexuality (HS), binge eating (BE), and compulsive shopping (CS).\nTwo hundred and seventy-eight consecutive patients with idiopathic PD regularly followed-up at an outpatient clinic were interviewed and screened for the ICB between September 2008 and December 2008 using designated diagnostic criteria. All patients who screened positive for ICB or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were further confirmed by an experienced psychiatrist.\nOf all the studied patients, 15 patients confirmed to have ICB (lifetime prevalence: 5.60%), 3 (1.12%) were diagnosed to have DDS, 1 (0.37%) punding, 4 (1.49%) PG, 8 (2.99%) HS, 1 (0.37%) BE, 0 (0%) CS. OCD was found in one patient (0.37%).\nThe prevalence of ICB is lower in Taiwan as compared with the Caucasians, with similar risk factors. The possible reasons include differences in ethnicity, environmental, cultural, and social factors as well as the dosage and selection of dopaminergic medications.",

    "abstract": "The Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Task Force on Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) Review of Treatments for Parkinson's Disease (PD) was first published in 2002 and was updated in 2005 to cover clinical trial data up to January 2004 with the focus on motor symptoms of PD. In this revised version the MDS task force decided it was necessary to extend the review to non-motor symptoms. The objective of this work was to update previous EBM reviews on treatments for PD with a focus on non-motor symptoms. Level-I (randomized controlled trial, RCT) reports of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for the non-motor symptoms of PD, published as full articles in English between January 2002 and December 2010 were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion and ranking followed the original program outline and adhered to EBM methodology. For efficacy conclusions, treatments were designated: efficacious, likely efficacious, unlikely efficacious, non-efficacious, or insufficient evidence. Safety data were catalogued and reviewed. Based on the combined efficacy and safety assessment, Implications for clinical practice were determined using the following designations: clinically useful, possibly useful, investigational, unlikely useful, and not useful. Fifty-four new studies qualified for efficacy review while several other studies covered safety issues. Updated and new efficacy conclusions were made for all indications. The treatments that are efficacious for the management of the different non-motor symptoms are as follows: pramipexole for the treatment of depressive symptoms, clozapine for the treatment of psychosis, rivastigmine for the treatment of dementia, and botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) and BTX-B as well as glycopyrrolate for the treatment of sialorrhea. The practical implications for these treatments, except for glycopyrrolate, are that they are clinically useful. Since there is insufficient evidence of glycopyrrolate for the treatment of sialorrhea exceeding 1 week, the practice implication is that it is possibly useful. The treatments that are likely efficacious for the management of the different non-motor symptoms are as follows: the tricyclic antidepressants nortriptyline and desipramine for the treatment of depression or depressive symptoms and macrogol for the treatment of constipation. The practice implications for these treatments are possibly useful. For most of the other interventions there is insufficient evidence to make adequate conclusions on their efficacy. This includes the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline, all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) reviewed (paroxetine, citalopram, sertraline, and fluoxetine), the newer antidepressants atomoxetine and nefazodone, pergolide, \u03a9-3 fatty acids as well as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of depression or depressive symptoms; methylphenidate and modafinil for the treatment of fatigue; amantadine for the treatment of pathological gambling; donepezil, galantamine, and memantine for the treatment of dementia; quetiapine for the treatment of psychosis; fludrocortisone and domperidone for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension; sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, ipratropium bromide spray for the treatment of sialorrhea; levodopa/carbidopa controlled release (CR), pergolide, eszopiclone, melatonin 3 to 5 mg and melatonin 50 mg for the treatment of insomnia and modafinil for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness. Due to safety issues the practice implication is that pergolide and nefazodone are not useful for the above-mentioned indications. Due to safety issues, olanzapine remains not useful for the treatment of psychosis. As none of the studies exceeded a duration of 6 months, the recommendations given are for the short-term management of the different non-motor symptoms. There were no RCTs that met inclusion criteria for the treatment of anxiety disorders, apathy, medication-related impulse control disorders and related behaviors other than pathological gambling, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sweating, or urinary dysfunction. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence for the treatment of these indications. This EBM review of interventions for the non-motor symptoms of PD updates the field, but, because several RCTs are ongoing, a continual updating process is needed. Several interventions and indications still lack good quality evidence, and these gaps offer an opportunity for ongoing research. \u00a9 2011 Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "The objective was to update previous evidence-based medicine reviews of treatments for motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease published between 2002 and 2005. Level I (randomized, controlled trial) reports of pharmacological, surgical, and nonpharmacological interventions for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease between January 2004 (2001 for nonpharmacological) and December 2010 were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion, clinical indications, ranking, efficacy conclusions, safety, and implications for clinical practice followed the original program outline and adhered to evidence-based medicine methodology. Sixty-eight new studies qualified for review. Piribedil, pramipexole, pramipexole extended release, ropinirole, rotigotine, cabergoline, and pergolide were all efficacious as symptomatic monotherapy; ropinirole prolonged release was likely efficacious. All were efficacious as a symptomatic adjunct except pramipexole extended release, for which there is insufficient evidence. For prevention/delay of motor fluctuations, pramipexole and cabergoline were efficacious, and for prevention/delay of dyskinesia, pramipexole, ropinirole, ropinirole prolonged release, and cabergoline were all efficacious, whereas pergolide was likely efficacious. Duodenal infusion of levodopa was likely efficacious in the treatment of motor complications, but the practice implication is investigational. Entacapone was nonefficacious as a symptomatic adjunct to levodopa in nonfluctuating patients and nonefficacious in the prevention/delay of motor complications. Rasagiline conclusions were revised to efficacious as a symptomatic adjunct, and as treatment for motor fluctuations. Clozapine was efficacious in dyskinesia, but because of safety issues, the practice implication is possibly useful. Bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation, bilateral globus pallidus stimulation, and unilateral pallidotomy were updated to efficacious for motor complications. Physical therapy was revised to likely efficacious as symptomatic adjunct therapy. This evidence-based medicine review updates the field and highlights gaps for research.",

    "abstract": "There is a need to explore non-dopaminergic approaches to treating balance and gait problems in PD. There is emerging evidence on the role of cholinergic denervation of the PPN-thalamus system and falls in PD. Preliminary clinical trial data suggest that the subgroup of PD patients with frequent falls may be suitable candidates for future cholinergic augmentation clinical trials. Recent controlled clinical trials using methylphenidate have been unable to confirm earlier reports of improved gait in PD. Although progressive deterioration of axial motor symptoms occur with DBS of the STN or GPi, new preliminary research suggests that other surgical stimulation sites, such as the PPN, may have a potential benefit on gait and balance impairments in PD. Ongoing vigorous exercise and physical fitness should be highly encouraged to patients with PD who are at risk of physical deconditioning and fear of falling but effective anti-fall physical therapy interventions remain an unmet clinical need.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene at chromosome 12q12 are the most common genetic cause of sporadic and familial late-onset Parkinson's disease. Our aim was to identify novel LRRK2 mutations in late-onset Parkinson's disease families.\nWe analyzed chromosome 12p11.2-q13.1 haplotypes in 14 late-onset Parkinson's disease families without known LRRK2 mutations.\nHaplotype analysis identified 12 families in which the affected subjects shared chromosome 12p11.2-q13.1 haplotypes. LRRK2 sequencing revealed a novel co-segregating missense mutation in exon 36 (c.5281A>C; p.S1761R) located within a highly conserved region of the COR [C-terminal of ROC (Ras of complex proteins)] domain wherein it could deregulate LRRK2 kinase activity by modifying ROC-COR dimer stability. p.S1761R was present in a late-onset Parkinson's disease family and in 2 unrelated Parkinson's disease subjects, but not in 2491 healthy controls. LRRK2 p.S1761R carriers developed levodopa-responsive asymmetrical parkinsonism, with variable age at onset (range: 37-72 years) suggesting age-dependent penetrance. These findings indicate that mutations interfering with LRRK2 ROC-COR domain dimerization lead to typical Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have indicated that three PITX3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2281983, rs4919621 and rs3758549, are likely to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) in Caucasians. Some studies also suggested an age-of-onset effect. We recently reported that allele and genotype frequencies did not differ between late-onset PD (LOPD) patients and controls for all three SNPs. To extend the analysis to early-onset PD (EOPD) patients, and to test whether an age-of-onset effect exists in Chinese, we genotyped these SNPs in 290 Chinese EOPD patients using a ligase detection reaction (LDR). For all three SNPs, allele and genotype frequencies did not differ between total PD patients and controls, between LOPD patients and controls, between EOPD patients and controls, or between LOPD and EOPD patients. Our results suggest that these PITX3 SNPs do not contribute to the risk of developing PD in EOPD or LOPD in Chinese.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder affecting millions. Treatment priorities focus on delaying its progression and resulting disability, and helping individuals continue to live at home as long as possible. This often requires long-term assistance by family caregivers.\nThe purpose of the study was to understand (1) family caregivers' experiences in caring for a relative with Parkinson's disease, and (2) factors that influenced the decision to place the relative in a long-term care facility.\nTwenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with adult family members (17 female, 3 male) acting as full-time primary caregivers for a relative with Parkinson's disease.\nGrounded theory was used to explore the process of healthcare decision-making and to illustrate the experiences of caring for persons with Parkinson's disease. The interview questions centered on family caregiving experiences and on how these caregivers made long-term care decisions on behalf of their loved ones. Data were coded and analyzed using dimensional analysis.\nThe caregiving model developed from the data illustrated that heightened caregiver strain-a risk factor for institutionalization-results from increased caregiving load and increased illness severity over time. Safety concerns, falls with severe injury, managing changes in health, and depleted support also influenced the decision to institutionalize the relative with Parkinson's disease.\nImplications from this research suggest the need for enhanced communication between providers and caregivers, formalized caregiver assessments, improved care coordination and family-centered interventions to avoid premature institutionalization.",

Univariate statistics were used to compare the behavioral groups. A linear regression model was created with either apathy or impulsivity as the dependent variable.\nThe two behavioral groups differed significantly from the PD control group on similar factors but in opposite directions. The apathy group was older at the time of both assessment and disease onset, had higher levels of depression and lower dopamine agonist use, compared to the other two groups. The ICD group was younger than the apathy group at disease onset and had higher levels of anxiety, a higher overall dopamine load and greater motor disease complexity. Overlap in behavioral pathology across the two groups was also noted.\nApathy and ICDs may be on a common behavioral spectrum in PD. Both are associated with significant psychiatric morbidity supporting shared underlying pathology.",

    "abstract": "Amantadine is currently used as an antiviral and an antiparkinsonian drug. Although the drug is known to bind a viral proton channel protein, the mechanism of action in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains to be determined. This study investigated whether the drug has an inhibitory effect on microglial activation and neuroinflammation, which have been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative processes. Using cultured microglial cells, it was demonstrated that the drug inhibited inflammatory activation of microglia and a signaling pathway that governs the microglial activation. The drug reduced the expression and production of proinflammatory mediators in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglia cells. The microglia-inhibiting activity of amantadine was also demonstrated in a microglia/neuron coculture and animal models of neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. Collectively, our results suggest that amantadine may act on microglia in the central nervous system to inhibit their inflammatory activation, thereby attenuating neuroinflammation. These results provide a molecular basis of the glia-targeted mechanism of action for amantadine.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to characterize electrophysiological properties of pulmonary veins (PVs) in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and atrial fibrillation (AF), and to compare them to those in patients with WPW without AF.\nA total of 31 patients (mean age 40 \u00b1 15 years, 23 males) with WPW were recruited: 16 patients with (AF group) and 15 without (controls) a history of AF. The basic electrophysiological (EPS) and echocardiographic data were not different between the 2 groups. Effective refractory periods (ERPs) of PVs were significantly shorter in the AF group compared to controls: left superior (LS) PV ERP 185\u00b129 versus 230 \u00b1 24 ms, P = 0.001; left inferior PV ERP 198 \u00b1 25 versus 219 \u00b1 26 ms, P = 0.04; right superior (RS) PV ERP 207 \u00b1 25 versus 236 \u00b1 19 ms, P = 0.001; right inferior PV ERP 208 \u00b1 30 versus 240 \u00b1 19 ms, P = 0.003. Maximal veno-atrial conduction delay (i.e., the maximal prolongation of interval from stimulus delivered at PV ostia to proximal coronary sinus after extrastimulus compared to the basic drive cycle) was longer in the AF group when pacing from LSPV (69.3 \u00b1 37.9 vs 32.6 \u00b1 16.1 ms, P = 0.01) and RSPV (74.1 \u00b1 25.9 vs 50.2 \u00b1 26.5 ms, P = 0.04). During EPS, AF was induced more often in the AF group (n = 7) compared to controls (n = 1; P = 0.04). Follow-up revealed that AF recurred in 3 patients in the AF group and none of the controls.\nPatients with WPW syndrome and AF have shorter ERPs of PVs and greater maximal veno-atrial conduction delay compared to patients with WPW without AF. These findings suggest a potential role of PVs in the development of AF in patients with WPW.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a complex neurologic and progressive incapacitating disease. Parkinson's disease severely threatens the quality of live and the number of patients worldwide is expected to rise considerably in the coming decade due to aging of the population. Even with optimal medical management using drugs or neurosurgery, patients are faced with progressively increasing impairments (e.g. in speech, mental and movement related functions), and restrictions in participation (e.g. domestic life and social activities). Physical therapy is often prescribed next to medical treatment but there is a lack of uniform treatment. A systematic literature search for guidelines, systematic reviews, trials, and expert opinions lead to a better understanding. The key question: Is physiotherapy able to optimally treat the Parkinson's disease symptoms? In which way, how and on which scientific bases can the physiotherapist participate to improve autonomy and to help them living independently and avoid, as long as possible, institutionalization? This article has integrated clinical research findings to provide clinicians with an overview to physical therapist management of disorders in people with Parkinson's disease. An Evidence-Based Physical Therapy Guideline providing practice recommendations was developed by the Royal Dutch Society for Physical Therapy (KNGF). Evidence from research was supplemented with clinical expertise and patients values. Randomized clinical trials reflect specific core areas of physical therapy, that is, transfer, posture, balance, reaching and grasping, gait and physical condition. Another aspect is that of educating patients (as well as their partners and family) about the disease process and the benefits of exercise therapy. Alternative therapies can be helpful like Tai Chi, virtual games, dancing, yoga, ball games for example.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in cerebral perfusion and metabolism in Parkinson's disease have been assessed in several studies, using nuclear imaging techniques and more recently magnetic resonance imaging. However, to date there is no consensus in the literature regarding the extent and the magnitude of these alterations. In this work, arterial spin labeled perfusion MRI was employed to quantify absolute cerebral blood flow in a group of early-to-moderate Parkinson's disease patients and age-matched healthy controls. Perfusion comparisons between the two groups showed that Parkinson's disease is characterized by wide-spread cortical hypoperfusion. Subcortically, hypoperfusion was also found in the caudate nucleus. This pattern of hypoperfusion could be related to cognitive dysfunctions that have been previously observed even at the disease early stages. The present results were obtained by means of whole brain voxel-wise comparisons of absolute perfusion values, using statistical parametric mapping, thus avoiding the potentially biased global mean normalization procedure. In addition, this work demonstrates that between-group comparison of relative perfusion values after global mean normalization, introduced artifactual relative perfusion increases, where absolute perfusion was in fact preserved. This has implications for perfusion studies of other brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) incidence and prevalence, particularly in Western countries, is greater in rural areas. Despite several epidemiological studies on PD in Australia, there are few publications addressing specific issues facing people with Parkinson's disease (PWP) in regional, rural and remote areas. This study looked at the dynamics of healthcare delivery to PWP and their carers in and around a regional New South Wales centre.\nQualitative analysis of rural and regional healthcare delivery to PWP involved five participant groups. Literature searches via electronic and medical databases were performed to provide a foundation for focus group questions, semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Volunteers from five groups: PWP, carers, allied health professionals (AHP), GPs and neurologists participated after recruitment via pamphlets, newsletters, postal invitation, public advertisements and preliminary talks.\nData analysis highlighted a lack of relevant facilities, funding, available health staff and awareness of information regarding beneficial services for PWP and their carers. With few available neurologists, the roles of GP and AHP were emphasized in consumer focus groups as being most significant in a regional and rural setting. Transport, and geographical and financial issues were also significant in these areas. Psychological issues, dementia and memory loss were considered to be as debilitating as the overt motor symptoms of PD.\nThe study found that the management of PD in regional NSW was highly variable, depending on geographical location and liaison among GPs, neurologists, AHPs, carers and PWP. Enhanced communication is recommended among PD stakeholders in regional NSW. This study provided a microcosmic view of the issues revealed by the very limited literature available on Australia's rural and regional healthcare delivery to PWP and their carers. It highlighted the lack of health staff, funding and information for relevant stakeholders, as well as PWP's desire for increased input from medical practitioners and the ancillary sectors. While this study did not directly compare rural with metropolitan PD services, it was inferred from all participant groups that regional and rural areas are disadvantaged in terms of medical staff and facilities, hindering timely diagnosis, management and treatment. The findings have implications for all stakeholders in the care of rural patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder affecting an estimated 5-10 million people worldwide. Recent evidence has implicated several genes that directly cause or increase susceptibility to PD. As well as advancing understanding of the genetic aetiology of PD these findings suggest new ways to modify the disease course, in some cases through genetic manipulation. Here we generated a 'walk-through' series of RNA Pol III-expressed shRNAs targeting both the \u03b1-synuclein A30P and LRRK2 G2019S PD-associated mutations. Allele-specific discrimination of the \u03b1-synuclein A30P mutation was achieved with alignments at position 10, 13 and 14 in two model systems, including a heterozygous model mimicking the disease setting, whilst 5'RACE was used to confirm stated alignments. Discrimination of the most common PD-linked LRRK2 G2019S mutation was assessed in hemizygous dual-luciferase assays and showed that alignment of the mutation opposite position 4 of the antisense species produced robust discrimination of alleles at all time points studied. Discrimination at this position was subsequently confirmed using siRNAs, where up to 10-fold discrimination was seen. The results suggest that RNAi-mediated silencing of PD-associated autosomal dominant genes could be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of the relevant clinical cases of PD in future.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative pathology with high incidence. Current treatments ease the symptoms but don't stop the development of the disease and aren't without any major side effects. Although this pathology is not specifically caused by genetic abnormalities, the involvement of numerous proteins in the pathophysiological process enables us to give an interest to gene therapy. This hypothesis has been upheld by positive results on animals and by five phase I trials on humans but may be attenuated by the first phase II trial recently published showing modest efficiency and multiple side effects. However, these preliminary results will need to be reinforced by more important trials in order to be sure of the safety and get efficacy data, which will allow us to give an opinion upon this new way of treatment.",

Both groups were stimulated with 1-Static visual field and 2-horizontal optokinetic stimulation using a virtual reality system. Postural responses were analyzed using the inverted pendulum as mathematical model.\nWhile the control group didn't show significant differences on the postural control between the two sensory conditions (COP p=0.0017, BFR p=0.0025), Parkinson's patients presented significant differences in the area of the center of pressure and the balance functional reserve values between static visual field and optokinetic stimulation.

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that single bouts of high-rate active cycling (> 80 rpm) improve upper extremity motor function in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). It is unknown if passive leg cycling produces a similar effect on upper extremity function. This article examines whether passive leg cycling can promote immediate changes in upper tremor and bradykinesia in PD and if pedaling rates have variable effects.\nTwenty individuals with mild-to-moderate idiopathic PD completed 4 sessions, with each session taking place 1 week apart. In the second to fourth sessions, a motorized bicycle was set to passively rotate the subjects' legs at rates of 60, 70, or 80 rpm for 30 minutes. Quantitative upper extremity motor assessments were completed immediately before and after each session.\nPassive leg cycling was shown to reduce tremor and bradykinesia in PD. However, the rate of passive cycling did not affect the degree of improvement in bradykinesia or tremor.\nThese findings suggest that lower extremity passive cycling can promote changes in upper extremity motor function in individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "L-Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is a hereditary dystonia characterized by an excellent response to low dosages of levodopa. DRD patients may also develop Parkinsonism which resembles idiopathic Parkinson's disease. In classical DRD no changes in the dopaminergic uptake have been observed.\nA 65-year old woman presented with clinically remarkably slowly progressing Parkinson's disease (PD) without any dystonic signs and excellent response to dopaminergic medications. We obtained a [(123)I] FP-CIT-SPECT (DaTSCAN\u2122) in order to elucidate a striatal dopaminergic deficit.\nWe found a reduced uptake in the [(123)I] FP-CIT-SPECT (DaTSCAN\u2122) contralateral to the more affected body side. Additionally, the patient showed a heterozygous deletion of the GHC1 gene.\nPatients with mild parkinsonian symptoms, excellent response to low dosages of dopaminergic drugs and a reduced dopamine-transporter uptake in [(123)I] FP-CIT-SPECT might more commonly be GCH1 mutation carriers than has previously been supposed. PD patients with a positive family history of DRD and combination of these clinical symptoms should be offered genetic counselling and testing for GCH1.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence that visuo-spatial capacity can become overloaded when processing a secondary visual task (Dual Task, DT), as occurs in daily life. Hence, we investigated the influence of the visuo-spatial interference in the identification of emotional facial expressions (EFEs) in early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared the identification of 24 emotional faces that illustrate six basic emotions in, unmedicated recently diagnosed PD patients (16) and healthy adults (20), under two different conditions: a) simple EFE identification, and b) identification with a concurrent visuo-spatial task (Corsi Blocks). EFE identification by PD patients was significantly worse than that of healthy adults when combined with another visual stimulus.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) affects speech inconsistently. Recently, stimulation of the caudal zona incerta (cZi-DBS) has shown superior motor outcomes for PD patients, but effects on speech have not been systematically investigated. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of cZi-DBS and STN-DBS on voice intensity in PD patients. Mean intensity during reading and intensity decay during rapid syllable repetition were measured for STN-DBS and cZi-DBS patients (eight patients per group), before- and 12 months after-surgery on- and off-stimulation. For mean intensity, there were small significant differences on- versus off-stimulation in each group: 74.2 (2.0)\u2009dB contra 72.1 (2.2)\u2009dB (P = .002) for STN-DBS, and 71.6 (4.1)\u2009dB contra 72.8 (3.4)\u2009dB (P = .03) for cZi-DBS, with significant interaction (P < .001). Intensity decay showed no significant changes. The subtle differences found for mean intensity suggest that STN-DBS and cZi-DBS may influence voice intensity differently.",

    "abstract": "Movement disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) are commonly associated with slow oscillations and increased synchrony of neuronal activity in the basal ganglia. The neural mechanisms underlying this dynamic network dysfunction, however, are only poorly understood. Here, we show that the strength of inhibitory inputs from striatum to globus pallidus external (GPe) is a key parameter controlling oscillations in the basal ganglia. Specifically, the increase in striatal activity observed in PD is sufficient to unleash the oscillations in the basal ganglia. This finding allows us to propose a unified explanation for different phenomena: absence of oscillation in the healthy state of the basal ganglia, oscillations in dopamine-depleted state and quenching of oscillations under deep-brain-stimulation (DBS). These novel insights help us to better understand and optimize the function of DBS protocols. Furthermore, studying the model behavior under transient increase of activity of the striatal neurons projecting to the indirect pathway, we are able to account for both motor impairment in PD patients and for reduced response inhibition in DBS implanted patients.",

    "abstract": "Dementia and psychotic disorders are frequent complications of Parkinson's disease (PD). They occurred in 40-60% of the cases. These complications are often accompanied by sleep disorders which also are non-motor presentations of PD. The objectives of the present study were 1) the assessment of correlations of daily sleepiness and behavioral disturbances during the fast sleep phase (REM-phase) with cognitive impairment and hallucinations; 2) the comparison of evaluation of sleep disorders in PD with questionnaires or polysomnographic study; 3) the assessment of the effect of galantamine on sleep disorders. Using a battery of scales (MMSE, FAB, ESS, PDSS) and polysomnographic study, we evaluated a state of sleep and cognitive functions in 26 PD patients with dementia before and after treatment with galantamine. The results obtained demonstrated the significant negative correlations of the severity of sleep disorders (excessive day sleepiness and disturbances of behavior in REM-phase) with hallucinations and cognitive disorders. Galantamine improved the quality of night sleep (the restoration of structure, decrease of fragmentation), decreased the severity of behavior disorders during REM-phase and day sleepiness along with changes in the intensity of cognitive disturbances and hallucinations.",
